7495,water resources in coastal areas can be profoundly influenced by both climate change and human activities these climatic and human impacts are usually intertwined and difficult to isolate this study developed an integrated model based approach for detection and attribution of climatic and human impacts and applied this approach to the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china an integrated surface water groundwater model was developed for the study area using gsflow coupled groundwater and surface water flow model calibration and validation were performed for background years between 1975 and 2000 the variation in water resources between the 1980s and 1990s was then quantitatively attributed to climate variability groundwater pumping and changes in upstream inflow climate scenarios for future years 2075 2100 were also developed by downscaling the projections in cmip5 potential water resource responses to climate change as well as their uncertainty were then investigated through integrated modeling the study results demonstrated the feasibility and value of the integrated modeling based analysis for water resource management in areas with complex surface water groundwater interaction specific findings for the luanhe plain included the following 1 during the historical period upstream inflow had the most significant impact on river outflow to the sea followed by climate variability whereas groundwater pumping was the least influential 2 the increase in groundwater pumping had a dominant influence on the decline in groundwater change followed by climate variability 3 synergetic and counteractive effects among different impacting factors while identified were not significant which implied that the interaction among different factors was not very strong in this case 4 it is highly probable that future climate change will accelerate groundwater depletion in the study area implying that strict regulations for groundwater pumping are imperative for adaptation keywords climate change human activities integrated surface water groundwater modeling coastal area water resources groundwater 1 introduction the majority of the world s population as well as some of the largest cities are distributed along coastal areas access to sufficient clean water is vital to the socio economic development of these areas coastal water resources have recently garnered significant research attention benini et al 2016 brinson et al 2013 chen et al 2016 sreeja et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the hydrological processes in coastal areas could be profoundly influenced by climate change miller et al 2003 schnorbus et al 2014 stefanova et al 2015 and intensive human activities teatini et al 2006 white and greer 2006 wu and chen 2013 such as water conservancy projects agricultural irrigation and urban water use in many cases the impacts of climate change and human activities are interconnected benini et al 2016 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 and are therefore difficult to assess some studies have attempted to attribute the variation in water resources to the individual influences of climatic and human factors a traditional approach evaluates paired catchments lørup et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 but this application is limited due to difficulty in finding suitable paired catchments especially at medium and large scales this research approach is also expensive a more popular approach is to perform a detrending analysis in this approach the impact of climate variability is identified and separated using statistical analyses e g non parametric tests time series analysis regression analysis etc a hydrological sensitivity analysis the elasticity method a water balance calculation or hydrological modeling then the remaining impacts can be attributed to human activities wang et al 2013 however the detrending approach usually lacks underlying physical mechanisms and assumes that the impacts of climate and human factors are independent which may not be valid in many cases zhao et al 2016 the third approach directly separates the impacts through physically based hydrological modeling for example li et al 2009 built a soil and water assessment tool swat model for an agricultural catchment on the loess plateau of china and simulated different climate and land use scenarios the individual impacts of climate variability and land use change were then assessed through a series of scenario comparisons based on the modeling results this modeling based approach can address the interaction between these two factors but has rarely been applied to integrated surface water groundwater modeling in water limited areas where groundwater accounts for a large portion of the local water supply gorelick and zheng 2015 wada et al 2010 substantial and complex surface water sw groundwater gw interactions would further complicate the interpretation of the individual and combined impacts of climate and human activities on coastal water resources as mentioned before most relevant studies have focused on surface water systems bao et al 2012 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 with regard to groundwater systems many studies have addressed the individual impact of either climate ali et al 2012 green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 or human activities cao et al 2013 liu et al 2001 pokhrel et al 2015 but only a few studies attempted to quantify their collective impact li et al 2014b pulido velazquez et al 2015 studies of integrated surface water groundwater sw gw systems are even rarer zhao et al 2016 investigated the impact of climate variability and land use change on green and blue water resources in the weihe river basin of china using swat arnold et al 2012 where the groundwater system was highly simplified landes et al 2014 used modflow harbaug 2005 a groundwater flow model to evaluate the influences of groundwater exploitation and climate change on wetland extensions groundwater recharge by infiltration was determined by an external water balance calculation while the modeling based approach is promising the sw gw interaction was highly simplified in these studies therefore a fully integrated modeling approach is desired in recent years some fully integrated sw gw models have been developed and applied in different watersheds these models include mike she graham and butts 2005 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 therrien et al 2010 parflow vanderkwaak and loague 2001 paws shen and phanikumar 2010 cathy camporese et al 2010 and gsflow markstrom et al 2008 these dynamic and spatially distributed models usually simulate a 3 d groundwater system and a 1 d or 2 d surface water system they can depict an integrated water resources system in great spatial and temporal detail and have been used to address a variety of water resource issues ajami et al 2014 goderniaux et al 2009 krause et al 2007 pérez et al 2011 tian et al 2015 however these complex models usually involve substantial simulation uncertainty wu et al 2014 especially when the data for initialization parameterization and calibration of the model are insufficient therefore hindering the wider application of these models few studies have applied these models to investigate the climate and human impacts on an entire sw gw system at a large basin scale this study performed integrated sw gw modeling for the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china this area is part of the downstream sector in the luanhe river basin lrb and is located in the northeastern north china plain fig 1 the lrb is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in china jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and intensive human activities e g large water transfer projects and agricultural irrigation have significantly altered the hydrological processes in this basin bao et al 2012 yan et al 2012 the lrb has many water related problems such as climate variability jiang et al 2015 anthropogenic influences li et al 2015 wang et al 2013 ecological deterioration yan et al 2012 and drought li et al 2014a previous hydrological modeling efforts jiang et al 2015 li et al 2015 yan et al 2015 in the lrb have focused on its upper mountainous area where surface runoff was the main concern the complicated sw gw interactions and responses to both climate change and human activities have not been systematically studied the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to demonstrate the feasibility and value of conducting an integrated sw gw model for studying coastal water resources under significant data scarcity 2 to couple integrated sw gw modeling with modeling based attributions for climatic and human impacts on water resources and 3 to investigate how the water resources in the luanhe plain would respond to future climate change and evaluate the climate induced risk of groundwater depletion in this area 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the luanhe river basin lrb is located in the northeastern north china plain ncp fig 1 it consists of two distinctive parts the upper mountainous area and the lower plain area the luanhe plain wang et al 2015 the main luanhe river as well as several small coastal streams drains water into the bohai sea this study which is concentrated on the luanhe plain has a total area of approximately 7770 km2 it is within the administrative boundaries of the cities of tangshan and qinghuangdao and covers eight counties including fengnan tanghai luanxian luannan leting lulong changli and funing the first five counties are in the western and southern parts of the plain and are governed by tangshan and the remaining three are in the northeastern part of the plain and are governed by qinhuangdao this coastal plain typically has a temperate continental climate the annual mean temperature is approximately 10 11 c the annual precipitation is approximately 620 mm and the annual actual evapotranspiration et accounts for approximately 90 of the precipitation the precipitation has significant seasonal variation and mostly occurs in july and august the study area has relatively flat topography and the elevation ranges from 0 m on the south shore area to 68 m in the north the dominant land use type on the plain is farmland which accounted for approximately 62 of the total area as of 2010 approximately 55 of the farmlands have substantial irrigation the main crops in the study area are grain crops including winter wheat summer maize and rice some high value crops such as cotton and peanuts are also planted in this region but account for no more than 20 of the farmlands or no more than 12 of the total area a major surface water diversion the yanshan headwork was built approximately 1 km downstream from the luanxian gauging station see fig 1 the headwork is a major point from which a substantial portion of the luanhe river flow is diverted to irrigate the farmlands on the plain groundwater is also a major water source for regional irrigation since the 1970s groundwater exploitation in this area has increased rapidly mainly due to growing irrigation needs and municipal water demands furthermore several large reservoirs and inter basin water transfer projects have been built in the upper lrb including the panjiakou daheiting and taolinkou reservoirs and two well known transfer projects one delivers water from the luanhe river to tianjin and the other delivers water to tangshan these two water transfer projects were established in 1983 and 1985 respectively wang et al 2015 the reservoirs and water transfer projects profoundly influenced streamflow from the mountainous area to the plain 2 2 the gsflow model this study developed an integrated surface water groundwater sw gw model for the luanhe plain using gsflow coupled groundwater and surface water flow gsflow markstrom et al 2008 is an integrated modeling tool developed by the u s geological survey usgs that has been successfully applied in many different hydrological contexts carroll et al 2017 doherty and hunt 2009 hassan et al 2014 huntington and niswonger 2012 surfleet and tullos 2013 tian et al 2015 the gsflow model reproduces all the major processes of the terrestrial water cycle it is comprised of three modules a surface module for simulating surface water and root zone soil water a subsurface module for modeling vadose zone flow and groundwater flow and a stream lake module that routes water through surface water bodies the surface module uses the prms precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 and the subsurface and stream lake modules use modflow harbaug 2005 a classic groundwater flow model in the gsflow model the 2 d surface domain is delineated into hydrologic response units hrus in terms of either irregular polygons or regular grids the subsurface domain is separated vertically into multiple layers based on hydrogeological information and horizontally delineated into finite difference grids a simulation of sw gw exchange is a critical part of modeling gsflow introduces the concept of a gravity reservoir that enables water exchange between a surface hru and its linked subsurface grid s however direct exchange between an aquifer cell and its connected river or lake segment s is calculated based on darcy s law more details about the usgs version of gsflow can be found elsewhere markstrom et al 2008 a digital elevation model dem land cover map and soil type map are the basic geographic data used to parameterize a gsflow model for the luanhe plain a dem with 90 m resolution was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm usa and used to determine the highest elevations based on modflow grids and streambeds a digitized land cover map 1 100 000 in 1980 and soil type map 1 1 000 000 were acquired from the heihe program data management centre www heihedata org and were the basis for the initial parameterization of the hrus horizontally the modeling domain was delineated into 7770 regular grids 1 km 1 km for both the surface and subsurface the subsurface modeling domain was vertically separated into three layers one shallow aquifer layer and two deep aquifer layers which was based on previous groundwater modeling studies for the entire north china plain cao et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2008 details on how the layers were conceptualized based on available hydrogeological data can be found in previous studies the stream network was divided into 194 segments and any portion of the river segment that intersected a modflow grid was referred to as a reach there are 2016 reaches total in this model meteorological data and boundary inflow data were the key inputs used to drive the model simulations in this study daily meteorological data primarily daily temperatures maximum and minimum and precipitation were collected at seven meteorological stations within or adjacent to the study area fig 1 the point observations were then interpolated to each hru using the square inverse distance weighting method because it is a coastal plain without significant topographical changes the uncertainty associated with the data interpolation based on seven stations would be relatively small especially for temperature on the other hand this study focused on the long term water budget of the entire area rather than the spatiotemporal distributions of hydrological variables within the area according to the interpolated data the annual average precipitation of the study area was 615 mm which was very close to the estimate from local meteorological agencies approximately 620 mm uncertainty in the spatial distribution of precipitation and its impacts on the simulated long term water budget are further investigated in section 2 4 daily streamflow rates at four boundary gauging stations fig 1 were used as the surface boundary inflow conditions for groundwater modeling the northern plain received subsurface lateral flow from the mountainous area and was represented using a specified groundwater inflow boundary condition however the flux of the subsurface lateral flow was largely unknown according to reports by the haihe river commission haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 the annual flux of the groundwater inflow was possibly between 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 the annual flux was adjusted within this range during model calibration see section 2 3 furthermore the coastline in the south was set to a specified groundwater head boundary condition of zero i e sea level and the west boundary was set to no flow conditions due to the existence of a groundwater divide the agriculture in the luanhe plain used surface water and groundwater conjunctively the water management practices including surface water diversion groundwater pumping and irrigation have significantly changed the natural water cycle and need to be properly reflected in the model as gsflow does not simulate agricultural irrigation based on environmental parameters e g temperature and soil moisture agricultural water use data must be prepared externally in this study annual water diversion volumes at the yanshan diversion point were determined based on the literature haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 wang and liu 2010 the annual diversion varied between 0 55 and 1 38 billion m3 from 1977 to 2000 in the model the diverted water was evenly distributed on all farmland hrus monthly variations in diversion volume were based on the crop growth cycle and the same was assumed for all farmland hrus each month the daily diversion was assumed to be constant annual pumping rates in different stress periods were determined based on references haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 huang and lin 1991 zhao 2009 unfortunately spatially and temporally detailed pumping data were not available which is a common challenge for basin scale groundwater modeling to derive daily time step simulations within each stress period constant daily pumping rates were assumed for the growing season and zero pumping was assumed for non growing season spatially the total volume of groundwater was first allocated to different counties in proportion to their crop yields then within each county the allocated volume was evenly distributed to all the hrus of irrigated farmland the groundwater was applied to where it was pumped the above spatial and temporal treatment of the pumping data inevitably involved significant uncertainty nevertheless they represented our best estimation given data scarcity because this research focused on assessing and separating basin scale hydrological responses to climate change and human activities the spatial and temporal uncertainties may not significantly affect the major conclusions of this study and will be later investigated see section 2 4 for the approach 2 3 model calibration and validation the entire calibration procedure was finished manually the groundwater model parameters i e hydraulic conductivities and specific yields were adopted from previous modeling studies of the north china plain which includes the luanhe plain cao et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2008 details on how the parameter values were determined can be found in the references note that the computational grid in previous studies was 2 km 2 km which has been refined to 1 km 1 km in this study as a regular step in running modflow a steady state simulation was first performed to set the initial conditions for the subsequent transient simulation in this step the subsurface lateral inflow was manually adjusted between 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 a and was eventually set to 0 286 billion m3 a where the steady state simulation can appropriately reproduce the observed groundwater levels since 1975 after the steady state simulation a transient simulation was performed for the period between 1975 and 2000 the first two years i e 1975 1976 were treated as a spin up period to produce reasonable initial soil water conditions for subsequent years tian et al 2015 and they were excluded from the following analyses the subsequent years were further divided into four stress periods 1977 1980 1981 1990 1991 1993 and 1994 2000 monthly groundwater level data from 24 monitoring wells see fig 1 during 1977 1983 were collected from local government agencies for the model calibration as some data were missing approximately 1500 data points were eventually used for calibration in the calibration stage to better match the simulated water levels with the observed ones the initial pumping rates were moderately adjusted if the model significantly and consistently underestimated or overestimated the observed water levels in the specific area and stress period the initial county wide pumping rate associated with the area and stress period was tuned within a range of 10 while keeping the total pumping rate of the entire luanhe plain approximately unchanged for that stress period in some local areas groundwater model parameters were also tuned to further improve the water level simulation the above steps represent a common calibration procedure in groundwater modeling it is worth emphasizing that with limited water level observations there would be no unique calibration for a complex groundwater model to examine the adequateness of the calibration the model validation was performed for the fourth stress period 1994 2000 using data from a previous study liu et al 2011 unfortunately no streamflow observations were available to calibrate the prms model i e the surface hydrology module in gsflow because there were no official gauging stations within the study area except for the four boundary sites see fig 1 alternatively the average runoff coefficients and annual et rates without human interference in this area as reported by local hydrological handbooks were referenced by adjusting key prms parameters e g maximum possible area contributing to surface runoff soil maximum available capillary water holding capacity and maximum depth where evapotranspiration can occur the model was run with all irrigation pumping and division practices turned off i e a scenario with no human interference and the simulated long term runoff coefficients and evapotranspiration were calculated and compared against values reported in the references it is worth noting that such a data scarcity situation actually reflects the strength of integrated surface water groundwater modeling rather than a shortcoming of this study in a recent study yao et al 2017 modflow with its streamflow routing package sfr2 was applied to quantify the mountain block recharge in the qinghai tibet plateau in a situation that had no groundwater level observations and only streamflow observations could be referred 2 4 analysis of input uncertainty due to the data limitation the uncertainty of key model inputs including the subsurface lateral inflow precipitation and pumping rates was significant to examine the impact of input uncertainty on the modeling results four modeling experiments were conducted see table 4 compared to the original modeling i e the calibrated model each experiment had one change in model inputs in experiment 1 and experiment 2 the annual groundwater inflow equaled 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 respectively these two volumes defined the range within which the groundwater inflow was adjusted in the steady state simulation in experiment 3 for each simulation time step all the hrus were assigned the basin wide average precipitation experiment 3 was for examining whether the spatial distribution of precipitation would have a notable impact on the modeling results in experiment 4 instead of using a constant annual pumping rate for each stress period we assumed that the rate was linearly increasing while keeping the multiyear average rate fixed this experiment was utilized for investigating whether the coarse temporal resolution of pumping data would significantly affect the modeling results the simulation results of the four experiments were compared against those of the original model for the period from 1977 to 2000 note that all four hypothetical experiments represented extreme situations thus the comparison results indicated the upper limits of modeling uncertainty rather than the actual modeling uncertainty 2 5 the attribution approach this study investigated how different natural and human related forces would individually and collectively impact water resources in the luanhe basin the 1990 s i e 1991 2000 and 1980 s i e 1981 1990 were chosen as the two decades for comparison mann kendall m k tests were conducted to detect any significant trends in key forces during the entire simulation period 1975 2000 because the presence of autocorrelation can affect trend detection hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002 an autocorrelation analysis was conducted prior to a trend test if a lag 1 autocorrelation was identified the method of yue et al 2002 was employed to pre whiten the time series in higher order autocorrelation situations the m k test followed the method from hamed and rao 1998 nonparametric rank sum tests were also performed to check any statistically significant differences between the two decades five variables were considered on an annual time scale to represent key natural and human driving forces including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation total upstream inflow and total surface water diversion spatial average values were considered for the first three meteorological variables the test results are presented in table 1 as the statistics indicate temperature had a strong increasing tendency from the 1980s to the 1990s for precipitation and upstream inflow although the test results were not significant the differences between the two decades are notable regarding the ten year average values as indicated by the last column in table 1 for surface water diversion however all statistics indicated no significant difference between the 1980s and 1990s groundwater pumping and land use change were also important human related forces that impacted water resources the pumping magnitude in this area has increased rapidly since the 1970s due to intensified human activities zhao 2009 on the other hand by comparing digitized land use maps from 1980 and 1995 the change in irrigated farmland area during 15 years was only 1 4 based on the above analysis tmax tmin precipitation upstream inflow and groundwater pumping were identified as the key variables needed to develop scenarios for comparison the first three meteorological variables represent climate conditions within the luanhe plain hereafter referred to as the climate factor the upstream inflow reflected the combined impact of climate conditions and human activities in the upstream area hereafter referred to as the upstream factor and groundwater pumping represented the impact of human activities hereafter referred to as the human factor the climate and human factors were key model inputs which drove the gsflow simulations while the upstream factor was the surface boundary condition of the model five scenarios see table 2 were then developed representing different combinations of the three factors a ten year gsflow simulation was performed for each scenario to guarantee the same initial conditions all five ten year simulations were started after the same transient simulation from 1977 to 1990 scenario o is the baseline scenario that represents the actual conditions in the 1990s i e 1991 2000 scenario d represents the actual conditions in the 1980s i e 1981 1990 scenarios a b and c all have one factor that is different from scenario o therefore by comparing scenarios a b and c against scenario o the individual impacts of climate variability change in upstream inflow and change in groundwater withdrawal could be assessed respectively a comparison between scenario d and scenario o revealed the combined effect of all three factors the following equations were used to separate the individual effects of the climate factor pc upstream factor pu and human factor ph as well as the synergy or counteraction between them ps 1 p c δ i c δ i 100 2 p u δ i u δ i 100 3 p h δ i h δ i 100 4 p s δ i δ i c δ i h δ i u δ i 100 here δic δiu and δih represent the changes caused by the individual climate factor upstream factor and human factor respectively and δi stands for the overall difference between the 1980s and 1990s it holds that pc pu ph ps 1 and ps can be either positive or negative the model output variables considered in the attribution analysis included river outflow groundwater level et and water volume of net sw gw exchange all these output variables were calculated as annual average 2 6 future climate scenarios a simple sensitivity analysis was first conducted to examine how water resources in the luanhe plain would respond to climate change temperature changes of 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c and 4 c and precipitation changes of 0 5 10 and 15 were assumed which lead to 35 combinations of temperature and precipitation changes each representing a future hypothetical climate scenario in all these scenarios the surface water diversion groundwater pumping and agricultural irrigation were kept at historical levels comparison of the scenarios would reveal the sensitivity of the water resources to climate change such an analysis is common in water resource impact assessments a more systematic assessment was also performed by using outputs from selected earth system models esms table 3 lists the 21 esms considered in the assessment previous studies demonstrated that these models have an adequate performance in the north china plain ncp where the study area is located chen et al 2013 chen et al 2014 du et al 2014 fu et al 2009 ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xing et al 2014 the esm data were obtained from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 model archive http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 for the medium stabilization scenario i e rcp4 5 and the high radiative forcing scenario i e rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the change factor cf method wilby and harris 2006 was deployed to downscale outputs of the esms which is a widely used and robust method for impact analyses of non extreme variables chen et al 2011 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 jackson et al 2011 morrison et al 2002 ouyang et al 2015 change factors were first derived by calculating the differences between background years 1975 2000 and future years 2075 2100 based on the esms then historical weather observations during 1975 2000 were perturbed by the change factors to establish respective climate scenarios for the years 2075 2100 the gsflow model was run with 42 total climate scenarios i e the 21 esms under the two emission scenarios with surface water diversion groundwater pumping and agricultural irrigation kept at historical levels the modeling results were then used to assess the water resources under climatic uncertainty note that keeping diversion groundwater and irrigation at historical levels did not imply that the agricultural water use is irresponsive to climate change it actually reflects the strict water resources regulation currently enforced in china the central government has set a redline for water resource exploitation at the national scale and local governments and river basin authorities all have their own redlines in the ncp where water resources are in a serious shortage the agricultural water use was unlikely to increase in the future due to the redline regulation thus the change in agricultural water use for the luanhe plain is largely policy driven rather than climate driven furthermore to mitigate the rapid drawdown of the groundwater table in the ncp the local governments are making all possible efforts to reduce pumping to reflect the water policy the gsflow model was also run for the 42 future climate scenarios 2075 2100 at three reduced levels of pumping 75 50 and 25 of historical levels the flow chart in fig 2 summarizes the modeling and analyses performed in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results as mentioned before we had no observed streamflow data for a formal goodness of fit analysis alternatively we adjusted the key parameters of the prms module to ensure an adequate model representation of the region s water budget after the parameter adjustments the simulated long term average runoff coefficient for the study area was 0 15 and the simulated average annual et was 563 mm accounting for approximately 90 of the average annual precipitation these simulation results were achieved with diversion pumping and irrigation processes turned off and were consistent with values reported in the hydrological handbooks of tangshan city and qinhuangdao city the luanhe plain is within these two cities administrative boundaries and other studies wang et al 2002 xia and li 2001 the reported values also represent the natural water cycle without human intervention fig 3 a compares the simulated and observed average groundwater levels from 1977 to 1983 each circle represents one of the 24 monitoring wells see fig 1 all of the circles were very close to the 45 degree line and only three had a deviation of over 2 m the mean error root mean square error and coefficient of determination r2 were 0 059 m 1 220 m and 0 984 respectively the results indicated that after the manual calibration the model can adequately reproduce a spatial distribution of the groundwater level from a long term average perspective it is worth emphasizing that the calibration was not aimed at precisely reproducing the dynamics of the groundwater level at individual wells as the dynamics could be notably disturbed by pumping practices common in this region unfortunately we had no temporally or spatially detailed information about these practices moreover the groundwater level was measured at specific locations but each modflow grid represented a 1 km 1 km area thus given the scarcity of pumping data and the mismatch of spatial scales it was not reasonable to expect that the model simulation results would nicely match the observed time series nevertheless at some of the wells the calibrated model still satisfactorily reproduced groundwater dynamics such as at well a well b and well c in fig 1 the calibration results for these three wells are presented in fig 3b c and d respectively the model performed especially well for well a probably because it is very close to a tributary and therefore its change in water level was dominated by stream groundwater interactions and was much less impacted by pumping practices some results of the model validation are presented in fig 4 fig 4a compares the simulated and observed average groundwater levels between 1994 and 2000 at the 13 monitoring wells see fig 1 the mean error root mean square error and r square were 0 45 m 3 61 m and 0 94 respectively the goodness of fit was acceptable although not as good as in the calibration stage fig 4b and 4c provide two examples of model validation at individual wells similarly a perfect match was not expected in these cases overall as the above results indicate after the manual calibration the gsflow model can adequately reflect the long term regional characteristics of the water cycle in the luanhe plain due to the lack of streamflow observations however the model simulation would have substantial uncertainty with regard to seasonal variability of streamflow thus the impact analysis will focus on the annual amount of streamflow rather than intra annual characteristics of hydrographs such as flood peaks and low flow conditions 3 2 basin wide water budget fig 5 illustrates the average water budget from 1977 to 2000 based on the model simulation precipitation and et were the largest inflow and outflow items respectively and upstream surface water sw inflow and outflow were the second largest items groundwater gw inflows and outflows were small however the sw gw exchanges were much more substantial and the groundwater pumping led to a notable groundwater storage decrease fig 5 also shows that the agricultural irrigation significantly altered the basin wide water cycle particularly the sw gw interaction as the numbers in the parentheses indicate if all of the pumping diversion and irrigation practices were stopped the sw gw exchanges would have been dramatically altered and there would have been approximately 17 less et 19 more outflow to the bohai sea and relatively stable even slightly increased groundwater storage fig 6 a shows the annual outflow to the bohai sea as simulated by the gsflow model the three driving forces of local precipitation inflow from the upstream mountainous area and surface water division were plotted as well the figure shows how the outflow has been largely controlled by upstream inflow the difference between the inflow and the outflow was quite small during the simulation period and correlated with local precipitation from 1979 to 1980 both the inflow and the outflow dropped dramatically because a large reservoir the panjiakou reservoir began storing water in december of 1979 the diversion was relatively stable with an average value of 0 96 billion m3 a and its impact on the outflow was trivial however the regional groundwater level continued to decrease since the late 1970 s see fig 6b at a rate of approximately 0 4 m a which was largely due to increased pumping the severe groundwater depletion may lead to various ecological and environmental problems such as wetland degradation seawater intrusion and land subsidence cao et al 2013 landes et al 2014 werner et al 2013 which have been observed in other parts of the north china plain in the next section the impacts of different factors on regional water resources will be further explored through the modeling experiments introduced in section 2 4 we further investigated how input uncertainties would impact simulation of the basin wide water budget table 4 summarizes the results for four key variables for both et and surface outflow i e streamflow into the ocean none of the four experiments demonstrated significant changes in the variables on the other hand in experiment 3 and experiment 4 all four variables were insensitive to input changes this indicates that with regard to the basin wide water budget uncertainties associated with the spatial distribution of precipitation experiment 3 and temporal variability of pumping experiment 4 have very limited impacts on the simulation results significant differences in gw storage change and net sw gw exchange are evident when the gw inflow is changed from 0 286 billion m3 a i e the calibrated value to 0 1 billion m3 a in experiment 1 and 0 5 billion m3 a in experiment 2 it is worth re emphasizing that all four experiments represented extreme situations and the results in table 4 indicate the upper limits of the modeling uncertainty rather than the actual modeling uncertainty in addition whether the uncertainty of groundwater inflow would significantly affect the attribution analysis will be further addressed in section 3 4 3 3 results of the attribution gsflow simulations were performed for the five hypothetical scenarios in table 2 and table 5 summarizes the comparison results ten year average values are presented for et surface outflow net sw gw exchange and groundwater level the δ values in the table reflect the individual and combined impacts of the three factors on different hydrological variables the decomposed contribution percentages calculated with eqs 1 through 4 are further illustrated in fig 7 as fig 7a demonstrates the decrease in basin wide et was largely caused by the climate factor and the effect of the human factor was not negligible but in the opposite direction this decrease is not likely due to temperature change as temperatures increased from the 1980 s to 1990 s and the et in this area was water limited rather than energy limited the decrease must be attributed to the change in available water which mainly consisted of local precipitation and agricultural irrigation as table 1 and fig 6a demonstrate from the 1980 s to 1990 s as local precipitation decreased the diversion remained stable and pumping increased thus the decrease in et refer to table 5 should be attributed to the decrease in local precipitation fig 7b shows that the upstream factor had the most significant impact on the change in river outflow to sea followed by the climate factor in the opposite direction the human factor was the least influential on the other hand for both groundwater level fig 7c and net sw gw exchange fig 7d the human factor dominated their changes followed by the climate factor fourth impacts from the three factors synergized with regard to et river outflow and net sw gw exchange fig 7a b and d respectively but counteracted with regard to groundwater level fig 7c nevertheless the synergetic and counteractive effects were not significant in all four cases which implies that the interaction among the three factors was not very strong with regard to the selected variables the counteractive effect fig 7c can be explained as follows in a warmer and drier climate less infiltration led to a decrease in groundwater recharge and lower instream flow led to an increase in groundwater discharge these two effects collaboratively lowered the groundwater storage however pumping i e the human factor decreased groundwater heads and higher surface inflow i e the upstream factor increased surface water heads this would enhance groundwater recharge and reduce groundwater discharge and therefore mitigate the decline in groundwater storage caused by climate change overall the above decomposition analysis revealed that the impacts of different factors on the basin water cycle are complicated the value of the integrated modeling approach used in this study was also well demonstrated 3 4 robustness of the attribution approach as discussed in section 3 2 the potential uncertainty of boundary groundwater inflow could lead to significant variability of groundwater storage changes and net sw gw exchange to investigate whether the attribution approach was robust under significant input uncertainty the decomposition in section 3 3 was repeated for both experiment 1 and experiment 2 refer to table 4 fig 8 compares the decomposition results from the original modeling case with those in experiment 1 and experiment 2 the figure clearly demonstrates that the results in the three modeling cases are very similar which proves the robustness of the attribution approach 3 5 sensitivity to climate change as indicated by fig 7 in the study area the climate factor contributed to approximately 21 of river outflow variability as a measure of the surface water resource and approximately 8 of groundwater level variability as an indicator of the groundwater resource thus regional water resource management must account for future climate change and be adaptive fig 9 presents the results of the simple sensitivity analysis see section 2 6 first higher temperatures led to smaller river outflow and faster groundwater declines whereas higher precipitation increased river outflow and slowed down groundwater declines thus increased precipitation could offset the negative impact of warming on the plain s water resources second at a higher temperature level a decline in both river outflow and groundwater were less sensitive to precipitation changes this implies that if the temperature keeps rising the offsetting effect of precipitation would be reduced third groundwater declines were more sensitive to the changes than river outflow which means that the plain s groundwater resource is more vulnerable in a changing climate with regard to overall quantity for example assuming a 4 c temperature increase occurring simultaneously with a 15 increase in precipitation river outflow would increase by approximately 2 fig 9a while the gw decline would increase by approximately 4 fig 9b a more detailed analysis of the responses of water resources to potential climate change is provided in the next section 3 6 future risk of groundwater depletion fig 10 shows the projected changes of annual mean temperature and precipitation under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the 21 esms have different projections however all predicted an increase in temperature and 19 out of 21 predicted an increase in precipitation the ensemble averages for temperature increases were 2 6 c and 4 9 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the ensemble averages of the precipitation increase are 14 1 and 23 2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this warmer and wetter tendency was consistent with previous studies in this region fu et al 2009 li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yuan et al 2005 fig 11 illustrates how the seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation would be impacted by climate change based on esm projections for temperature while the results of different esms diverged all esms predicted a temperature increase for all months on average the most significant increase in temperature occurred during december or january for precipitation a divergence in projections was only evident for the wet season mainly june through september some models predicted decreases in precipitation in certain months on average the most significant increase in precipitation occurred in july or august in the study area groundwater typically accounted for 60 70 of the total water supply the sensitivity analysis in section 3 4 revealed that with regard to overall quantity the groundwater resource is more vulnerable in a changing climate than the surface water resource thus sustainable utilization of groundwater under climatic uncertainty represents a great challenge in this area fig 12 shows the groundwater storage decline simulated by the gsflow model under the historical scenario and the two emission scenarios by comparing the bars against the dashed line it can be found that under rcp4 5 11 esm projections led to an accelerated decline where the largest acceleration was produced by csiro mk3 6 0 similarly under rcp8 5 18 esm projections resulted in an accelerated decline where the largest acceleration was produced by miroc esm the number of esms with an accelerating effect is a good indicator of the groundwater depletion risk induced by climate change clearly climate change under rcp4 5 would cause a moderate risk for groundwater depletion 11 out of 21 esms but under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 the risk would be substantial 18 out of 21 esms groundwater resources show vulnerability to future climate change and face the risk of accelerated decline in this area which is consistent with the results from the former sensitivity analysis the robustness of our methodology and conclusion was also verified it is evident that groundwater in the study area has been significantly over pumped and the storage decline is likely to be exacerbated by climate change it represents a great challenge to water resource management not only in the luanhe plain but also in the entire north china plain thus the interaction between groundwater management and climate change was further investigated the gsflow model was re run for the historical climate scenario 1975 2000 and 42 future climate scenarios 2075 2100 at three reduced levels of pumping 75 50 and 25 of the historical level it was also assumed that the reduction in groundwater pumping equaled the reduction of irrigation note that according to the gsflow model even if pumping is reduced to 25 of the historical level groundwater storage in this area would still decrease fig 13 a plots the numbers of esms with accelerated effects at the four pumping levels interestingly under rcp4 5 the groundwater depletion risk indicated by the number of esms would not vary with the pumping level however under rcp8 5 the risk would increase rapidly with enhanced pumping this implies that if climate change is substantial a reduction in groundwater pumping would not only alleviate the decline in groundwater storage i e the direct effect but would also mitigate the negative impact of climate change on storage i e the indirect effect by altering the water cycle fig 13b further illustrates the additional storage decline caused by climate change under rcp8 5 it shows that on average the climate induced storage decline would increase as pumping is enhanced however its uncertainty according to the 21 esms would also increase significantly overall fig 13 suggests that regulation of groundwater pumping is imperative for water security in this area especially when future climate change as well as its huge uncertainty is taken into consideration 4 conclusions this study successfully developed an integrated sw gw model for the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china under significant data scarcity it also developed an integrated modeling based approach to attribute variation in water resources to climate variability and human activities the sensitivity of the hydrological processes to climate change was analyzed and the risks of groundwater depletion under climatic uncertainty were investigated using downscaled data from multiple esms the major study findings include the following first both the climate factor and human factor had a significant impact on the integrated sw gw system but they played different roles in different aspects of the system for example the human factor dominated variation in groundwater level or storage whereas the change in basin wide et was largely controlled by the climate factor second complicated interactions existed between the climate factor and the human factor their impacts may either counteract each other or synergize with each other depending on the concerned part of the hydrological cycle for example the interaction between these two factors intensified their individual impacts on et third in this representative coastal area of northern china the groundwater resource was found to be much more vulnerable to projected climate change than surface water resources with regard to overall quantity it is highly possible that future climate change will amplify the risk of groundwater depletion and the climate induced risk of depletion could be dependent on pumping intensity in the luanhe plain regulation of groundwater pumping appeared to be an imperative adaptation measure for water security under climatic uncertainty overall this study demonstrated that the complicated interaction between climate change and human activities is changing the water cycle in a typical coastal area the applicability and value of an integrated modeling based approach was well represented in the study results some important issues deserve further research in this study the agricultural water use was determined externally and assumed to be unchanged or reduced by pumping regulations under future climate conditions future studies may consider an integrated surface water groundwater model with functionality of irrigation simulation condon and maxwell 2013 where potential changes in agricultural water use due to climate change can be directly investigated in addition a more sophisticated downscaling approach may be employed to further investigate the impact of climate change on extreme events acknowledgments this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china no 41622111 no 91647201 no 41501024 and the shenzhen municipal science and

7495,water resources in coastal areas can be profoundly influenced by both climate change and human activities these climatic and human impacts are usually intertwined and difficult to isolate this study developed an integrated model based approach for detection and attribution of climatic and human impacts and applied this approach to the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china an integrated surface water groundwater model was developed for the study area using gsflow coupled groundwater and surface water flow model calibration and validation were performed for background years between 1975 and 2000 the variation in water resources between the 1980s and 1990s was then quantitatively attributed to climate variability groundwater pumping and changes in upstream inflow climate scenarios for future years 2075 2100 were also developed by downscaling the projections in cmip5 potential water resource responses to climate change as well as their uncertainty were then investigated through integrated modeling the study results demonstrated the feasibility and value of the integrated modeling based analysis for water resource management in areas with complex surface water groundwater interaction specific findings for the luanhe plain included the following 1 during the historical period upstream inflow had the most significant impact on river outflow to the sea followed by climate variability whereas groundwater pumping was the least influential 2 the increase in groundwater pumping had a dominant influence on the decline in groundwater change followed by climate variability 3 synergetic and counteractive effects among different impacting factors while identified were not significant which implied that the interaction among different factors was not very strong in this case 4 it is highly probable that future climate change will accelerate groundwater depletion in the study area implying that strict regulations for groundwater pumping are imperative for adaptation keywords climate change human activities integrated surface water groundwater modeling coastal area water resources groundwater 1 introduction the majority of the world s population as well as some of the largest cities are distributed along coastal areas access to sufficient clean water is vital to the socio economic development of these areas coastal water resources have recently garnered significant research attention benini et al 2016 brinson et al 2013 chen et al 2016 sreeja et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the hydrological processes in coastal areas could be profoundly influenced by climate change miller et al 2003 schnorbus et al 2014 stefanova et al 2015 and intensive human activities teatini et al 2006 white and greer 2006 wu and chen 2013 such as water conservancy projects agricultural irrigation and urban water use in many cases the impacts of climate change and human activities are interconnected benini et al 2016 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 and are therefore difficult to assess some studies have attempted to attribute the variation in water resources to the individual influences of climatic and human factors a traditional approach evaluates paired catchments lørup et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 but this application is limited due to difficulty in finding suitable paired catchments especially at medium and large scales this research approach is also expensive a more popular approach is to perform a detrending analysis in this approach the impact of climate variability is identified and separated using statistical analyses e g non parametric tests time series analysis regression analysis etc a hydrological sensitivity analysis the elasticity method a water balance calculation or hydrological modeling then the remaining impacts can be attributed to human activities wang et al 2013 however the detrending approach usually lacks underlying physical mechanisms and assumes that the impacts of climate and human factors are independent which may not be valid in many cases zhao et al 2016 the third approach directly separates the impacts through physically based hydrological modeling for example li et al 2009 built a soil and water assessment tool swat model for an agricultural catchment on the loess plateau of china and simulated different climate and land use scenarios the individual impacts of climate variability and land use change were then assessed through a series of scenario comparisons based on the modeling results this modeling based approach can address the interaction between these two factors but has rarely been applied to integrated surface water groundwater modeling in water limited areas where groundwater accounts for a large portion of the local water supply gorelick and zheng 2015 wada et al 2010 substantial and complex surface water sw groundwater gw interactions would further complicate the interpretation of the individual and combined impacts of climate and human activities on coastal water resources as mentioned before most relevant studies have focused on surface water systems bao et al 2012 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 with regard to groundwater systems many studies have addressed the individual impact of either climate ali et al 2012 green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 or human activities cao et al 2013 liu et al 2001 pokhrel et al 2015 but only a few studies attempted to quantify their collective impact li et al 2014b pulido velazquez et al 2015 studies of integrated surface water groundwater sw gw systems are even rarer zhao et al 2016 investigated the impact of climate variability and land use change on green and blue water resources in the weihe river basin of china using swat arnold et al 2012 where the groundwater system was highly simplified landes et al 2014 used modflow harbaug 2005 a groundwater flow model to evaluate the influences of groundwater exploitation and climate change on wetland extensions groundwater recharge by infiltration was determined by an external water balance calculation while the modeling based approach is promising the sw gw interaction was highly simplified in these studies therefore a fully integrated modeling approach is desired in recent years some fully integrated sw gw models have been developed and applied in different watersheds these models include mike she graham and butts 2005 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 therrien et al 2010 parflow vanderkwaak and loague 2001 paws shen and phanikumar 2010 cathy camporese et al 2010 and gsflow markstrom et al 2008 these dynamic and spatially distributed models usually simulate a 3 d groundwater system and a 1 d or 2 d surface water system they can depict an integrated water resources system in great spatial and temporal detail and have been used to address a variety of water resource issues ajami et al 2014 goderniaux et al 2009 krause et al 2007 pérez et al 2011 tian et al 2015 however these complex models usually involve substantial simulation uncertainty wu et al 2014 especially when the data for initialization parameterization and calibration of the model are insufficient therefore hindering the wider application of these models few studies have applied these models to investigate the climate and human impacts on an entire sw gw system at a large basin scale this study performed integrated sw gw modeling for the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china this area is part of the downstream sector in the luanhe river basin lrb and is located in the northeastern north china plain fig 1 the lrb is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in china jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and intensive human activities e g large water transfer projects and agricultural irrigation have significantly altered the hydrological processes in this basin bao et al 2012 yan et al 2012 the lrb has many water related problems such as climate variability jiang et al 2015 anthropogenic influences li et al 2015 wang et al 2013 ecological deterioration yan et al 2012 and drought li et al 2014a previous hydrological modeling efforts jiang et al 2015 li et al 2015 yan et al 2015 in the lrb have focused on its upper mountainous area where surface runoff was the main concern the complicated sw gw interactions and responses to both climate change and human activities have not been systematically studied the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to demonstrate the feasibility and value of conducting an integrated sw gw model for studying coastal water resources under significant data scarcity 2 to couple integrated sw gw modeling with modeling based attributions for climatic and human impacts on water resources and 3 to investigate how the water resources in the luanhe plain would respond to future climate change and evaluate the climate induced risk of groundwater depletion in this area 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the luanhe river basin lrb is located in the northeastern north china plain ncp fig 1 it consists of two distinctive parts the upper mountainous area and the lower plain area the luanhe plain wang et al 2015 the main luanhe river as well as several small coastal streams drains water into the bohai sea this study which is concentrated on the luanhe plain has a total area of approximately 7770 km2 it is within the administrative boundaries of the cities of tangshan and qinghuangdao and covers eight counties including fengnan tanghai luanxian luannan leting lulong changli and funing the first five counties are in the western and southern parts of the plain and are governed by tangshan and the remaining three are in the northeastern part of the plain and are governed by qinhuangdao this coastal plain typically has a temperate continental climate the annual mean temperature is approximately 10 11 c the annual precipitation is approximately 620 mm and the annual actual evapotranspiration et accounts for approximately 90 of the precipitation the precipitation has significant seasonal variation and mostly occurs in july and august the study area has relatively flat topography and the elevation ranges from 0 m on the south shore area to 68 m in the north the dominant land use type on the plain is farmland which accounted for approximately 62 of the total area as of 2010 approximately 55 of the farmlands have substantial irrigation the main crops in the study area are grain crops including winter wheat summer maize and rice some high value crops such as cotton and peanuts are also planted in this region but account for no more than 20 of the farmlands or no more than 12 of the total area a major surface water diversion the yanshan headwork was built approximately 1 km downstream from the luanxian gauging station see fig 1 the headwork is a major point from which a substantial portion of the luanhe river flow is diverted to irrigate the farmlands on the plain groundwater is also a major water source for regional irrigation since the 1970s groundwater exploitation in this area has increased rapidly mainly due to growing irrigation needs and municipal water demands furthermore several large reservoirs and inter basin water transfer projects have been built in the upper lrb including the panjiakou daheiting and taolinkou reservoirs and two well known transfer projects one delivers water from the luanhe river to tianjin and the other delivers water to tangshan these two water transfer projects were established in 1983 and 1985 respectively wang et al 2015 the reservoirs and water transfer projects profoundly influenced streamflow from the mountainous area to the plain 2 2 the gsflow model this study developed an integrated surface water groundwater sw gw model for the luanhe plain using gsflow coupled groundwater and surface water flow gsflow markstrom et al 2008 is an integrated modeling tool developed by the u s geological survey usgs that has been successfully applied in many different hydrological contexts carroll et al 2017 doherty and hunt 2009 hassan et al 2014 huntington and niswonger 2012 surfleet and tullos 2013 tian et al 2015 the gsflow model reproduces all the major processes of the terrestrial water cycle it is comprised of three modules a surface module for simulating surface water and root zone soil water a subsurface module for modeling vadose zone flow and groundwater flow and a stream lake module that routes water through surface water bodies the surface module uses the prms precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 and the subsurface and stream lake modules use modflow harbaug 2005 a classic groundwater flow model in the gsflow model the 2 d surface domain is delineated into hydrologic response units hrus in terms of either irregular polygons or regular grids the subsurface domain is separated vertically into multiple layers based on hydrogeological information and horizontally delineated into finite difference grids a simulation of sw gw exchange is a critical part of modeling gsflow introduces the concept of a gravity reservoir that enables water exchange between a surface hru and its linked subsurface grid s however direct exchange between an aquifer cell and its connected river or lake segment s is calculated based on darcy s law more details about the usgs version of gsflow can be found elsewhere markstrom et al 2008 a digital elevation model dem land cover map and soil type map are the basic geographic data used to parameterize a gsflow model for the luanhe plain a dem with 90 m resolution was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm usa and used to determine the highest elevations based on modflow grids and streambeds a digitized land cover map 1 100 000 in 1980 and soil type map 1 1 000 000 were acquired from the heihe program data management centre www heihedata org and were the basis for the initial parameterization of the hrus horizontally the modeling domain was delineated into 7770 regular grids 1 km 1 km for both the surface and subsurface the subsurface modeling domain was vertically separated into three layers one shallow aquifer layer and two deep aquifer layers which was based on previous groundwater modeling studies for the entire north china plain cao et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2008 details on how the layers were conceptualized based on available hydrogeological data can be found in previous studies the stream network was divided into 194 segments and any portion of the river segment that intersected a modflow grid was referred to as a reach there are 2016 reaches total in this model meteorological data and boundary inflow data were the key inputs used to drive the model simulations in this study daily meteorological data primarily daily temperatures maximum and minimum and precipitation were collected at seven meteorological stations within or adjacent to the study area fig 1 the point observations were then interpolated to each hru using the square inverse distance weighting method because it is a coastal plain without significant topographical changes the uncertainty associated with the data interpolation based on seven stations would be relatively small especially for temperature on the other hand this study focused on the long term water budget of the entire area rather than the spatiotemporal distributions of hydrological variables within the area according to the interpolated data the annual average precipitation of the study area was 615 mm which was very close to the estimate from local meteorological agencies approximately 620 mm uncertainty in the spatial distribution of precipitation and its impacts on the simulated long term water budget are further investigated in section 2 4 daily streamflow rates at four boundary gauging stations fig 1 were used as the surface boundary inflow conditions for groundwater modeling the northern plain received subsurface lateral flow from the mountainous area and was represented using a specified groundwater inflow boundary condition however the flux of the subsurface lateral flow was largely unknown according to reports by the haihe river commission haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 the annual flux of the groundwater inflow was possibly between 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 the annual flux was adjusted within this range during model calibration see section 2 3 furthermore the coastline in the south was set to a specified groundwater head boundary condition of zero i e sea level and the west boundary was set to no flow conditions due to the existence of a groundwater divide the agriculture in the luanhe plain used surface water and groundwater conjunctively the water management practices including surface water diversion groundwater pumping and irrigation have significantly changed the natural water cycle and need to be properly reflected in the model as gsflow does not simulate agricultural irrigation based on environmental parameters e g temperature and soil moisture agricultural water use data must be prepared externally in this study annual water diversion volumes at the yanshan diversion point were determined based on the literature haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 wang and liu 2010 the annual diversion varied between 0 55 and 1 38 billion m3 from 1977 to 2000 in the model the diverted water was evenly distributed on all farmland hrus monthly variations in diversion volume were based on the crop growth cycle and the same was assumed for all farmland hrus each month the daily diversion was assumed to be constant annual pumping rates in different stress periods were determined based on references haihe river chronicle compilation committee et al 1994 huang and lin 1991 zhao 2009 unfortunately spatially and temporally detailed pumping data were not available which is a common challenge for basin scale groundwater modeling to derive daily time step simulations within each stress period constant daily pumping rates were assumed for the growing season and zero pumping was assumed for non growing season spatially the total volume of groundwater was first allocated to different counties in proportion to their crop yields then within each county the allocated volume was evenly distributed to all the hrus of irrigated farmland the groundwater was applied to where it was pumped the above spatial and temporal treatment of the pumping data inevitably involved significant uncertainty nevertheless they represented our best estimation given data scarcity because this research focused on assessing and separating basin scale hydrological responses to climate change and human activities the spatial and temporal uncertainties may not significantly affect the major conclusions of this study and will be later investigated see section 2 4 for the approach 2 3 model calibration and validation the entire calibration procedure was finished manually the groundwater model parameters i e hydraulic conductivities and specific yields were adopted from previous modeling studies of the north china plain which includes the luanhe plain cao et al 2013 liu et al 2011 2008 details on how the parameter values were determined can be found in the references note that the computational grid in previous studies was 2 km 2 km which has been refined to 1 km 1 km in this study as a regular step in running modflow a steady state simulation was first performed to set the initial conditions for the subsequent transient simulation in this step the subsurface lateral inflow was manually adjusted between 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 a and was eventually set to 0 286 billion m3 a where the steady state simulation can appropriately reproduce the observed groundwater levels since 1975 after the steady state simulation a transient simulation was performed for the period between 1975 and 2000 the first two years i e 1975 1976 were treated as a spin up period to produce reasonable initial soil water conditions for subsequent years tian et al 2015 and they were excluded from the following analyses the subsequent years were further divided into four stress periods 1977 1980 1981 1990 1991 1993 and 1994 2000 monthly groundwater level data from 24 monitoring wells see fig 1 during 1977 1983 were collected from local government agencies for the model calibration as some data were missing approximately 1500 data points were eventually used for calibration in the calibration stage to better match the simulated water levels with the observed ones the initial pumping rates were moderately adjusted if the model significantly and consistently underestimated or overestimated the observed water levels in the specific area and stress period the initial county wide pumping rate associated with the area and stress period was tuned within a range of 10 while keeping the total pumping rate of the entire luanhe plain approximately unchanged for that stress period in some local areas groundwater model parameters were also tuned to further improve the water level simulation the above steps represent a common calibration procedure in groundwater modeling it is worth emphasizing that with limited water level observations there would be no unique calibration for a complex groundwater model to examine the adequateness of the calibration the model validation was performed for the fourth stress period 1994 2000 using data from a previous study liu et al 2011 unfortunately no streamflow observations were available to calibrate the prms model i e the surface hydrology module in gsflow because there were no official gauging stations within the study area except for the four boundary sites see fig 1 alternatively the average runoff coefficients and annual et rates without human interference in this area as reported by local hydrological handbooks were referenced by adjusting key prms parameters e g maximum possible area contributing to surface runoff soil maximum available capillary water holding capacity and maximum depth where evapotranspiration can occur the model was run with all irrigation pumping and division practices turned off i e a scenario with no human interference and the simulated long term runoff coefficients and evapotranspiration were calculated and compared against values reported in the references it is worth noting that such a data scarcity situation actually reflects the strength of integrated surface water groundwater modeling rather than a shortcoming of this study in a recent study yao et al 2017 modflow with its streamflow routing package sfr2 was applied to quantify the mountain block recharge in the qinghai tibet plateau in a situation that had no groundwater level observations and only streamflow observations could be referred 2 4 analysis of input uncertainty due to the data limitation the uncertainty of key model inputs including the subsurface lateral inflow precipitation and pumping rates was significant to examine the impact of input uncertainty on the modeling results four modeling experiments were conducted see table 4 compared to the original modeling i e the calibrated model each experiment had one change in model inputs in experiment 1 and experiment 2 the annual groundwater inflow equaled 0 1 and 0 5 billion m3 respectively these two volumes defined the range within which the groundwater inflow was adjusted in the steady state simulation in experiment 3 for each simulation time step all the hrus were assigned the basin wide average precipitation experiment 3 was for examining whether the spatial distribution of precipitation would have a notable impact on the modeling results in experiment 4 instead of using a constant annual pumping rate for each stress period we assumed that the rate was linearly increasing while keeping the multiyear average rate fixed this experiment was utilized for investigating whether the coarse temporal resolution of pumping data would significantly affect the modeling results the simulation results of the four experiments were compared against those of the original model for the period from 1977 to 2000 note that all four hypothetical experiments represented extreme situations thus the comparison results indicated the upper limits of modeling uncertainty rather than the actual modeling uncertainty 2 5 the attribution approach this study investigated how different natural and human related forces would individually and collectively impact water resources in the luanhe basin the 1990 s i e 1991 2000 and 1980 s i e 1981 1990 were chosen as the two decades for comparison mann kendall m k tests were conducted to detect any significant trends in key forces during the entire simulation period 1975 2000 because the presence of autocorrelation can affect trend detection hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002 an autocorrelation analysis was conducted prior to a trend test if a lag 1 autocorrelation was identified the method of yue et al 2002 was employed to pre whiten the time series in higher order autocorrelation situations the m k test followed the method from hamed and rao 1998 nonparametric rank sum tests were also performed to check any statistically significant differences between the two decades five variables were considered on an annual time scale to represent key natural and human driving forces including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation total upstream inflow and total surface water diversion spatial average values were considered for the first three meteorological variables the test results are presented in table 1 as the statistics indicate temperature had a strong increasing tendency from the 1980s to the 1990s for precipitation and upstream inflow although the test results were not significant the differences between the two decades are notable regarding the ten year average values as indicated by the last column in table 1 for surface water diversion however all statistics indicated no significant difference between the 1980s and 1990s groundwater pumping and land use change were also important human related forces that impacted water resources the pumping magnitude in this area has increased rapidly since the 1970s due to intensified human activities zhao 2009 on the other hand by comparing digitized land use maps from 1980 and 1995 the change in irrigated farmland area during 15 years was only 1 4 based on the above analysis tmax tmin precipitation upstream inflow and groundwater pumping were identified as the key variables needed to develop scenarios for comparison the first three meteorological variables represent climate conditions within the luanhe plain hereafter referred to as the climate factor the upstream inflow reflected the combined impact of climate conditions and human activities in the upstream area hereafter referred to as the upstream factor and groundwater pumping represented the impact of human activities hereafter referred to as the human factor the climate and human factors were key model inputs which drove the gsflow simulations while the upstream factor was the surface boundary condition of the model five scenarios see table 2 were then developed representing different combinations of the three factors a ten year gsflow simulation was performed for each scenario to guarantee the same initial conditions all five ten year simulations were started after the same transient simulation from 1977 to 1990 scenario o is the baseline scenario that represents the actual conditions in the 1990s i e 1991 2000 scenario d represents the actual conditions in the 1980s i e 1981 1990 scenarios a b and c all have one factor that is different from scenario o therefore by comparing scenarios a b and c against scenario o the individual impacts of climate variability change in upstream inflow and change in groundwater withdrawal could be assessed respectively a comparison between scenario d and scenario o revealed the combined effect of all three factors the following equations were used to separate the individual effects of the climate factor pc upstream factor pu and human factor ph as well as the synergy or counteraction between them ps 1 p c δ i c δ i 100 2 p u δ i u δ i 100 3 p h δ i h δ i 100 4 p s δ i δ i c δ i h δ i u δ i 100 here δic δiu and δih represent the changes caused by the individual climate factor upstream factor and human factor respectively and δi stands for the overall difference between the 1980s and 1990s it holds that pc pu ph ps 1 and ps can be either positive or negative the model output variables considered in the attribution analysis included river outflow groundwater level et and water volume of net sw gw exchange all these output variables were calculated as annual average 2 6 future climate scenarios a simple sensitivity analysis was first conducted to examine how water resources in the luanhe plain would respond to climate change temperature changes of 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c and 4 c and precipitation changes of 0 5 10 and 15 were assumed which lead to 35 combinations of temperature and precipitation changes each representing a future hypothetical climate scenario in all these scenarios the surface water diversion groundwater pumping and agricultural irrigation were kept at historical levels comparison of the scenarios would reveal the sensitivity of the water resources to climate change such an analysis is common in water resource impact assessments a more systematic assessment was also performed by using outputs from selected earth system models esms table 3 lists the 21 esms considered in the assessment previous studies demonstrated that these models have an adequate performance in the north china plain ncp where the study area is located chen et al 2013 chen et al 2014 du et al 2014 fu et al 2009 ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xing et al 2014 the esm data were obtained from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 model archive http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 for the medium stabilization scenario i e rcp4 5 and the high radiative forcing scenario i e rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 the change factor cf method wilby and harris 2006 was deployed to downscale outputs of the esms which is a widely used and robust method for impact analyses of non extreme variables chen et al 2011 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 jackson et al 2011 morrison et al 2002 ouyang et al 2015 change factors were first derived by calculating the differences between background years 1975 2000 and future years 2075 2100 based on the esms then historical weather observations during 1975 2000 were perturbed by the change factors to establish respective climate scenarios for the years 2075 2100 the gsflow model was run with 42 total climate scenarios i e the 21 esms under the two emission scenarios with surface water diversion groundwater pumping and agricultural irrigation kept at historical levels the modeling results were then used to assess the water resources under climatic uncertainty note that keeping diversion groundwater and irrigation at historical levels did not imply that the agricultural water use is irresponsive to climate change it actually reflects the strict water resources regulation currently enforced in china the central government has set a redline for water resource exploitation at the national scale and local governments and river basin authorities all have their own redlines in the ncp where water resources are in a serious shortage the agricultural water use was unlikely to increase in the future due to the redline regulation thus the change in agricultural water use for the luanhe plain is largely policy driven rather than climate driven furthermore to mitigate the rapid drawdown of the groundwater table in the ncp the local governments are making all possible efforts to reduce pumping to reflect the water policy the gsflow model was also run for the 42 future climate scenarios 2075 2100 at three reduced levels of pumping 75 50 and 25 of historical levels the flow chart in fig 2 summarizes the modeling and analyses performed in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results as mentioned before we had no observed streamflow data for a formal goodness of fit analysis alternatively we adjusted the key parameters of the prms module to ensure an adequate model representation of the region s water budget after the parameter adjustments the simulated long term average runoff coefficient for the study area was 0 15 and the simulated average annual et was 563 mm accounting for approximately 90 of the average annual precipitation these simulation results were achieved with diversion pumping and irrigation processes turned off and were consistent with values reported in the hydrological handbooks of tangshan city and qinhuangdao city the luanhe plain is within these two cities administrative boundaries and other studies wang et al 2002 xia and li 2001 the reported values also represent the natural water cycle without human intervention fig 3 a compares the simulated and observed average groundwater levels from 1977 to 1983 each circle represents one of the 24 monitoring wells see fig 1 all of the circles were very close to the 45 degree line and only three had a deviation of over 2 m the mean error root mean square error and coefficient of determination r2 were 0 059 m 1 220 m and 0 984 respectively the results indicated that after the manual calibration the model can adequately reproduce a spatial distribution of the groundwater level from a long term average perspective it is worth emphasizing that the calibration was not aimed at precisely reproducing the dynamics of the groundwater level at individual wells as the dynamics could be notably disturbed by pumping practices common in this region unfortunately we had no temporally or spatially detailed information about these practices moreover the groundwater level was measured at specific locations but each modflow grid represented a 1 km 1 km area thus given the scarcity of pumping data and the mismatch of spatial scales it was not reasonable to expect that the model simulation results would nicely match the observed time series nevertheless at some of the wells the calibrated model still satisfactorily reproduced groundwater dynamics such as at well a well b and well c in fig 1 the calibration results for these three wells are presented in fig 3b c and d respectively the model performed especially well for well a probably because it is very close to a tributary and therefore its change in water level was dominated by stream groundwater interactions and was much less impacted by pumping practices some results of the model validation are presented in fig 4 fig 4a compares the simulated and observed average groundwater levels between 1994 and 2000 at the 13 monitoring wells see fig 1 the mean error root mean square error and r square were 0 45 m 3 61 m and 0 94 respectively the goodness of fit was acceptable although not as good as in the calibration stage fig 4b and 4c provide two examples of model validation at individual wells similarly a perfect match was not expected in these cases overall as the above results indicate after the manual calibration the gsflow model can adequately reflect the long term regional characteristics of the water cycle in the luanhe plain due to the lack of streamflow observations however the model simulation would have substantial uncertainty with regard to seasonal variability of streamflow thus the impact analysis will focus on the annual amount of streamflow rather than intra annual characteristics of hydrographs such as flood peaks and low flow conditions 3 2 basin wide water budget fig 5 illustrates the average water budget from 1977 to 2000 based on the model simulation precipitation and et were the largest inflow and outflow items respectively and upstream surface water sw inflow and outflow were the second largest items groundwater gw inflows and outflows were small however the sw gw exchanges were much more substantial and the groundwater pumping led to a notable groundwater storage decrease fig 5 also shows that the agricultural irrigation significantly altered the basin wide water cycle particularly the sw gw interaction as the numbers in the parentheses indicate if all of the pumping diversion and irrigation practices were stopped the sw gw exchanges would have been dramatically altered and there would have been approximately 17 less et 19 more outflow to the bohai sea and relatively stable even slightly increased groundwater storage fig 6 a shows the annual outflow to the bohai sea as simulated by the gsflow model the three driving forces of local precipitation inflow from the upstream mountainous area and surface water division were plotted as well the figure shows how the outflow has been largely controlled by upstream inflow the difference between the inflow and the outflow was quite small during the simulation period and correlated with local precipitation from 1979 to 1980 both the inflow and the outflow dropped dramatically because a large reservoir the panjiakou reservoir began storing water in december of 1979 the diversion was relatively stable with an average value of 0 96 billion m3 a and its impact on the outflow was trivial however the regional groundwater level continued to decrease since the late 1970 s see fig 6b at a rate of approximately 0 4 m a which was largely due to increased pumping the severe groundwater depletion may lead to various ecological and environmental problems such as wetland degradation seawater intrusion and land subsidence cao et al 2013 landes et al 2014 werner et al 2013 which have been observed in other parts of the north china plain in the next section the impacts of different factors on regional water resources will be further explored through the modeling experiments introduced in section 2 4 we further investigated how input uncertainties would impact simulation of the basin wide water budget table 4 summarizes the results for four key variables for both et and surface outflow i e streamflow into the ocean none of the four experiments demonstrated significant changes in the variables on the other hand in experiment 3 and experiment 4 all four variables were insensitive to input changes this indicates that with regard to the basin wide water budget uncertainties associated with the spatial distribution of precipitation experiment 3 and temporal variability of pumping experiment 4 have very limited impacts on the simulation results significant differences in gw storage change and net sw gw exchange are evident when the gw inflow is changed from 0 286 billion m3 a i e the calibrated value to 0 1 billion m3 a in experiment 1 and 0 5 billion m3 a in experiment 2 it is worth re emphasizing that all four experiments represented extreme situations and the results in table 4 indicate the upper limits of the modeling uncertainty rather than the actual modeling uncertainty in addition whether the uncertainty of groundwater inflow would significantly affect the attribution analysis will be further addressed in section 3 4 3 3 results of the attribution gsflow simulations were performed for the five hypothetical scenarios in table 2 and table 5 summarizes the comparison results ten year average values are presented for et surface outflow net sw gw exchange and groundwater level the δ values in the table reflect the individual and combined impacts of the three factors on different hydrological variables the decomposed contribution percentages calculated with eqs 1 through 4 are further illustrated in fig 7 as fig 7a demonstrates the decrease in basin wide et was largely caused by the climate factor and the effect of the human factor was not negligible but in the opposite direction this decrease is not likely due to temperature change as temperatures increased from the 1980 s to 1990 s and the et in this area was water limited rather than energy limited the decrease must be attributed to the change in available water which mainly consisted of local precipitation and agricultural irrigation as table 1 and fig 6a demonstrate from the 1980 s to 1990 s as local precipitation decreased the diversion remained stable and pumping increased thus the decrease in et refer to table 5 should be attributed to the decrease in local precipitation fig 7b shows that the upstream factor had the most significant impact on the change in river outflow to sea followed by the climate factor in the opposite direction the human factor was the least influential on the other hand for both groundwater level fig 7c and net sw gw exchange fig 7d the human factor dominated their changes followed by the climate factor fourth impacts from the three factors synergized with regard to et river outflow and net sw gw exchange fig 7a b and d respectively but counteracted with regard to groundwater level fig 7c nevertheless the synergetic and counteractive effects were not significant in all four cases which implies that the interaction among the three factors was not very strong with regard to the selected variables the counteractive effect fig 7c can be explained as follows in a warmer and drier climate less infiltration led to a decrease in groundwater recharge and lower instream flow led to an increase in groundwater discharge these two effects collaboratively lowered the groundwater storage however pumping i e the human factor decreased groundwater heads and higher surface inflow i e the upstream factor increased surface water heads this would enhance groundwater recharge and reduce groundwater discharge and therefore mitigate the decline in groundwater storage caused by climate change overall the above decomposition analysis revealed that the impacts of different factors on the basin water cycle are complicated the value of the integrated modeling approach used in this study was also well demonstrated 3 4 robustness of the attribution approach as discussed in section 3 2 the potential uncertainty of boundary groundwater inflow could lead to significant variability of groundwater storage changes and net sw gw exchange to investigate whether the attribution approach was robust under significant input uncertainty the decomposition in section 3 3 was repeated for both experiment 1 and experiment 2 refer to table 4 fig 8 compares the decomposition results from the original modeling case with those in experiment 1 and experiment 2 the figure clearly demonstrates that the results in the three modeling cases are very similar which proves the robustness of the attribution approach 3 5 sensitivity to climate change as indicated by fig 7 in the study area the climate factor contributed to approximately 21 of river outflow variability as a measure of the surface water resource and approximately 8 of groundwater level variability as an indicator of the groundwater resource thus regional water resource management must account for future climate change and be adaptive fig 9 presents the results of the simple sensitivity analysis see section 2 6 first higher temperatures led to smaller river outflow and faster groundwater declines whereas higher precipitation increased river outflow and slowed down groundwater declines thus increased precipitation could offset the negative impact of warming on the plain s water resources second at a higher temperature level a decline in both river outflow and groundwater were less sensitive to precipitation changes this implies that if the temperature keeps rising the offsetting effect of precipitation would be reduced third groundwater declines were more sensitive to the changes than river outflow which means that the plain s groundwater resource is more vulnerable in a changing climate with regard to overall quantity for example assuming a 4 c temperature increase occurring simultaneously with a 15 increase in precipitation river outflow would increase by approximately 2 fig 9a while the gw decline would increase by approximately 4 fig 9b a more detailed analysis of the responses of water resources to potential climate change is provided in the next section 3 6 future risk of groundwater depletion fig 10 shows the projected changes of annual mean temperature and precipitation under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the 21 esms have different projections however all predicted an increase in temperature and 19 out of 21 predicted an increase in precipitation the ensemble averages for temperature increases were 2 6 c and 4 9 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the ensemble averages of the precipitation increase are 14 1 and 23 2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this warmer and wetter tendency was consistent with previous studies in this region fu et al 2009 li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yuan et al 2005 fig 11 illustrates how the seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation would be impacted by climate change based on esm projections for temperature while the results of different esms diverged all esms predicted a temperature increase for all months on average the most significant increase in temperature occurred during december or january for precipitation a divergence in projections was only evident for the wet season mainly june through september some models predicted decreases in precipitation in certain months on average the most significant increase in precipitation occurred in july or august in the study area groundwater typically accounted for 60 70 of the total water supply the sensitivity analysis in section 3 4 revealed that with regard to overall quantity the groundwater resource is more vulnerable in a changing climate than the surface water resource thus sustainable utilization of groundwater under climatic uncertainty represents a great challenge in this area fig 12 shows the groundwater storage decline simulated by the gsflow model under the historical scenario and the two emission scenarios by comparing the bars against the dashed line it can be found that under rcp4 5 11 esm projections led to an accelerated decline where the largest acceleration was produced by csiro mk3 6 0 similarly under rcp8 5 18 esm projections resulted in an accelerated decline where the largest acceleration was produced by miroc esm the number of esms with an accelerating effect is a good indicator of the groundwater depletion risk induced by climate change clearly climate change under rcp4 5 would cause a moderate risk for groundwater depletion 11 out of 21 esms but under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 the risk would be substantial 18 out of 21 esms groundwater resources show vulnerability to future climate change and face the risk of accelerated decline in this area which is consistent with the results from the former sensitivity analysis the robustness of our methodology and conclusion was also verified it is evident that groundwater in the study area has been significantly over pumped and the storage decline is likely to be exacerbated by climate change it represents a great challenge to water resource management not only in the luanhe plain but also in the entire north china plain thus the interaction between groundwater management and climate change was further investigated the gsflow model was re run for the historical climate scenario 1975 2000 and 42 future climate scenarios 2075 2100 at three reduced levels of pumping 75 50 and 25 of the historical level it was also assumed that the reduction in groundwater pumping equaled the reduction of irrigation note that according to the gsflow model even if pumping is reduced to 25 of the historical level groundwater storage in this area would still decrease fig 13 a plots the numbers of esms with accelerated effects at the four pumping levels interestingly under rcp4 5 the groundwater depletion risk indicated by the number of esms would not vary with the pumping level however under rcp8 5 the risk would increase rapidly with enhanced pumping this implies that if climate change is substantial a reduction in groundwater pumping would not only alleviate the decline in groundwater storage i e the direct effect but would also mitigate the negative impact of climate change on storage i e the indirect effect by altering the water cycle fig 13b further illustrates the additional storage decline caused by climate change under rcp8 5 it shows that on average the climate induced storage decline would increase as pumping is enhanced however its uncertainty according to the 21 esms would also increase significantly overall fig 13 suggests that regulation of groundwater pumping is imperative for water security in this area especially when future climate change as well as its huge uncertainty is taken into consideration 4 conclusions this study successfully developed an integrated sw gw model for the luanhe plain a typical coastal area in northern china under significant data scarcity it also developed an integrated modeling based approach to attribute variation in water resources to climate variability and human activities the sensitivity of the hydrological processes to climate change was analyzed and the risks of groundwater depletion under climatic uncertainty were investigated using downscaled data from multiple esms the major study findings include the following first both the climate factor and human factor had a significant impact on the integrated sw gw system but they played different roles in different aspects of the system for example the human factor dominated variation in groundwater level or storage whereas the change in basin wide et was largely controlled by the climate factor second complicated interactions existed between the climate factor and the human factor their impacts may either counteract each other or synergize with each other depending on the concerned part of the hydrological cycle for example the interaction between these two factors intensified their individual impacts on et third in this representative coastal area of northern china the groundwater resource was found to be much more vulnerable to projected climate change than surface water resources with regard to overall quantity it is highly possible that future climate change will amplify the risk of groundwater depletion and the climate induced risk of depletion could be dependent on pumping intensity in the luanhe plain regulation of groundwater pumping appeared to be an imperative adaptation measure for water security under climatic uncertainty overall this study demonstrated that the complicated interaction between climate change and human activities is changing the water cycle in a typical coastal area the applicability and value of an integrated modeling based approach was well represented in the study results some important issues deserve further research in this study the agricultural water use was determined externally and assumed to be unchanged or reduced by pumping regulations under future climate conditions future studies may consider an integrated surface water groundwater model with functionality of irrigation simulation condon and maxwell 2013 where potential changes in agricultural water use due to climate change can be directly investigated in addition a more sophisticated downscaling approach may be employed to further investigate the impact

7496,flood impact modelling requires reliable models for the simulation of flood processes in recent years flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation flood exposure and loss analyses in this study we validate a 2d inundation model for the purpose of flood exposure analysis at the river reach scale we validate the basement simulation model with insurance claims using conventional validation metrics the flood model is established on the basis of available topographic data in a high spatial resolution for four test cases the validation metrics were calculated with two different datasets a dataset of event documentations reporting flooded areas and a dataset of insurance claims the model fit relating to insurance claims is in three out of four test cases slightly lower than the model fit computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas this comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can be compared to conventional validation data such as the flooded area however a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk keywords 2d flood model validation insurance claims model performance 1 introduction floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards accounting for a majority of all economic losses from natural events worldwide unisdr 2015 managing flood risk requires knowledge about the hazardous processes and about flood impacts in recent years flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation flood exposure and flood loss analyses a variety of models exist for different purposes and scales reaching from global scale inundation models pappenberger et al 2012 ward et al 2013 sampson et al 2015 to continental trigg et al 2016 national merz et al 2008 and finally regional and local scale models fewtrell et al 2011 neal et al 2011 pedrozo acuña et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 garrote et al 2016 another increasing use of flood inundation models is the coupling of flood models with hydrologic and hydrometeorologic models within a model cascade or a coupled component modelling framework at the river basin scale e g biancamaria et al 2009 falter et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 felder et al 2017 thus a variety of inundation models exist for different purposes e g horritt and bates 2001a hunter et al 2007 chatterjee et al 2008 bates et al 2010 crispino et al 2015 courty et al 2017 developers are validating the models with a broad set of validation techniques and data model validation here is defined after hunter et al 2007 as the process of demonstrating that a given site specific model is capable of making accurate predictions defined with respect to the application in mind for periods outside a calibration period if the accuracy and predictive capability in the validation period is proven to lie within an acceptable limit for a particular practical purpose it is defined as being validated depending on the purpose of the model used and the available data the validation methods vary remarkably in 1d simulation frameworks hydraulic models have been calibrated and validated with observed water levels at specific locations horritt and bates 2002 mark et al 2004 pappenberger et al 2005 hunter et al 2007 felder et al 2017 however with the development of 2d flood inundation models spatially explicit model performance measures have been proposed and used for model validation in many cases this is done by comparing the simulated inundation areas with observed ones as shown by woodhead et al 2007 most likely the main data used in the validation of inundation models is observation data of the wet dry boundary this leads to the comparison between modelled and observed inundation areas other validation data are aerial images and observed flood maps delineated thereof or satellite based remote sensing data bates et al 1997 describe a procedure for validating inundation models with remote sensing data especially synthetic aperture radar data have recently been used for calibration and validation horritt 2000 horritt et al 2007 mason and bates 2009 pappenberger et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 in contrast neal et al 2009 and savage et al 2016 compared inundation models with a large set of water level measurements in a study area this is probably the most reliable validation data segura beltrán et al 2016 furthermore inundation models are also validated against stage discharge relationships or time to peak horritt and bates 2002 the latter is less often used if the main purpose of the inundation model is to provide the basis for flood loss analyses for evaluating newly developed models a benchmark test against established models or models that represent an industry standard is sometimes done neal et al 2012a the comparison of the flooded areas computed by different models is shown in several studies horritt and bates 2001a 2002 tayefi et al 2007 chatterjee et al 2008 fewtrell et al 2008 castellarin et al 2009 neal et al 2012a b crispino et al 2015 trigg et al 2016 vozinaki et al 2016 lavoie and mahdi 2017 however the main limiting factor for validating inundation models is often the lack of validation data neal et al 2012a beside model validation the analyses of uncertainties or the sensitivities against model parameters are a fundamental step in model development pappenberger et al 2006 jakeman et al 2006 ratto et al 2012 freer et al 2013 pianosi et al 2016 teng et al 2017 in sensitivity analysis one focus is on the representation of the topography especially the spatial resolution horritt and bates 2001b cook and merwade 2009 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2015 2016 probabilistic models are able to incorporate a number of model runs with different parameterizations and different boundary conditions dottori et al 2013 state that deterministic models and very high spatial resolution are potentially misleading as they could induce overconfidence derived from their spuriously precise results this in turn may lead to wrong decisions in flood risk management thus the choice of the modelling strategy depends on the main purpose of the study the model complexity the needed computational resources and the available topographic data di baldassarre et al 2010 dottori et al 2013 jonkman 2013 refsgaard et al 2016 a key point in the reliability of flood inundation models is the ability to represent flood protection measures merwade et al 2008b neal et al 2012b ward et al 2013 on the reach scale the inability to accurately represent river morphology is a disadvantage of raster based models the increase in spatial resolution has a negative effect on the needed computing resources neal et al 2012b savage et al 2015 solutions for dealing with this trade off between spatial resolution and computing power are for example the use of subgrid approaches i e modelling the flow in the river channel in 1d combined with floodplain routing in 2d as exemplarily described by neal et al 2012b the coupling of 1d and 2d simulation models vozinaki et al 2016 or the use of nesting approaches as shown by bermúdez et al 2017 the latter nested a local scale flood inundation model based on irregular meshes into a basin scale model based on regular grids a third group of models dealing with this topic is the simulation based on irregular meshes these can have a high spatial resolution in the river channel and a coarser resolution in the floodplain horritt and bates 2001a thus these models are able to accurately represent river morphology and geometry this includes the consideration of flood protection measures which is required for predicting flood patterns satisfyingly fewtrell et al 2011 consequently the accurate consideration of flood protection measures must also be valid from the viewpoint of flood loss analyses as they increasingly consider single buildings zischg et al 2013 fuchs et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2017 however 2d inundation models are often evaluated regarding the ability to accurately predicting flooded areas in many cases the flooded areas predicted by the model are compared with the observed wet areas of a specific flood event however such observations may not be an adequate validation dataset in all cases especially for flood exposure and flood risk analyses a model exhibiting a good overall fit regarding inundated areas in a large floodplain may not necessarily produce good results at locations of particular interest for risk assessment pappenberger et al 2007b nevertheless a method for validating 2d inundation models explicitly used for flood exposure and flood loss analyses has not been presented yet therefore the main aim of this study is to close this gap by developing a method for validating 2d flood inundation models used in flood exposure analyses for that matter the validation data and metrics need to be adapted to that particular purpose therefore we propose alternative data for validating the model i e a dataset of geo localized insurance claims herein the main question concerns the value of validating a 2d flood model on the basis of loss data rather than on the basis of inundated areas this question is posed under the hypothesis that a validation based on insurance claims gives different weighting to urbanized areas in comparison to areas without values at risk an additional question is how the various validation metrics differ between each other when adopted to insurance claims the paper is structured as follows in the methods chapter we first describe the study areas and the method for setting up the flood model following we present the parameters and the boundary conditions for the model runs thereafter we introduce the validation method and the data used the results focus on both the performance of the model and the proposed validation method in the discussions and conclusions the results are discussed and recommendations for using insurance claims in the validation of flood models are given 2 methods we tested the validation approach on the basis of test cases for which insurance claims were available all cases represent a complex flood topology with combined riverine and lake flooding two test cases have branching river morphologies the validation is done by a full set of insurance claims in two test cases and by a sample set of claims in the other two test cases we compare different metrics for validation of models that are based on binary validation data 2 1 study area the four test cases are located in pre alpine areas of switzerland fig 1 the first two test cases are located in the canton of nidwalden the western test case in the municipality of stansstad is characterized by the giesslibach torrent the eastern part of buochs and ennetbürgen by the main river crossing the canton of nidwalden the engelberger aa both river systems contribute to lake lucerne which is a determining factor for flood risk in both study areas as well thus the flooding is also influenced by lake flooding the third test case is the floodplain in the city of thun in the canton of bern here the main process is lake flooding with combined riverine flooding downstream the outflow of lake thun is the aare river flowing through the city of thun the aare river has two branches during low flow conditions the lake level is regulated by a weir the fourth case is the floodplain of the city of interlaken this floodplain is a quaternary debris cone of the river lütschine the city is located between lake brienz upstream and lake thun downstream the aare river connects the two lakes and is also regulated by two weirs during low flow conditions thus this floodplain is affected by combined riverine and lake flooding fig 1 shows the location of the study areas 2 2 set up of the flood model flood loss analyses usually consist of flood scenarios around and above a river s discharge capacity consequently the river s geometry has to be represented as accurately as possible the river reaches of our case studies have lateral dams thus the flood model has to represent not only the correct area for calculating the river carrying capacity but also the correct geometry this means that the different heights of the left and right dams should be considered in the flood model in our research we are using the 2d inundation model basement v2 6 because it is based on flexible irregular meshes and thus it allows to represent the river bed in a higher spatial resolution than the floodplains basement stands for basic simulation environment the model is developed and maintained by the laboratory of hydraulics hydrology and glaciology vaw of the eth zurich basement is described in detail by vetsch et al 2017 and has been validated analytically it has been used for dam breach simulations vonwiller and vetsch 2015 worni et al 2012 volz et al 2012 in river restoration projects berchtold et al 2012 fah et al 2007a b bertoldi et al 2014 and for the simulation of flash floods radice et al 0000 the model is freely available and is widely used by consultants for flood risk analyses the first step in setting up the inundation model is the generation of the computational mesh within a predefined delimitation of the study area we mapped the upper and lower shorelines of the river reaches and lakes in the floodplains only the most important hydraulic structures were represented by break lines the triangulation was done with the triangle mesh generator of shewchuck 2002 this step is part of the pre processing plug in implemented in qgis basemesh vetsch et al 2017 after generating the mesh we directly attributed the z coordinates to the nodes by using the local cell values of the digital terrain models for the test sites in the canton of nidwalden we used the digital elevation model swissalti3d produced by the federal office of topography swisstopo 2017a this terrain model is available for the whole of switzerland and has a grid resolution of 2 m the vertical accuracy is expected to be around 0 5 m for the other study areas we used a purely lidar derived digital elevation model provided by the canton of bern kawa 2015 this model has a grid resolution of 0 5 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 2 m for the interpolation of the riverbed we used surveyed cross sections with a mean distance of 100 m provided by the federal office of environment foen 2017a we interpolated the riverbed levels between the cross sections by adapting the approaches proposed by merwade et al 2008a conner and tonina 2014 and costabile and macchione 2015 the points of the cross sections were connected with 3d polylines and the grid cells in between the cross sections were interpolated on the basis of the mean slope between the cross sections finally we checked if the interpolated grid cells of the riverbed lay below the water surface measured by the lidar the terrain model of the riverbed was merged with the terrain model of the floodplain the bottom of the lake was set to the minimum z level of the connected river cells from the merged digital terrain model we computed a focal statistics raster of the maximum and minimum values within a 3 x 3 raster cell environment the merged terrain model was the basis for attributing the z values to the nodes of the mesh except for the nodes located on an upper shoreline of the river or a lake and the nodes located within the river channel the z values of the nodes representing the upper shorelines were attributed from the maximum focal statistics raster the nodes within a river channel have been attributed with the z values of the minimum raster this leads to a smoothing of the river channel geometry and to a better representation of the river bank and respectively the lake shorelines the riverbed morphology is relatively simple since it is in all cases a totally anthropogenically modified river channel with approximately a trapezoidal form thus we do not expect relevant problems arising from the effects of bathymetry interpolation on hydrodynamic results as shown by conner and tonina 2014 the roughness parameters manning strickler values were delineated from the official guidelines of bwg 2001 we did not calibrate these parameters and no field investigations were made or retrospectively considered in this model setup the weirs were considered as hydraulic obstacles in the river channel given by their geometries the mesh has a maximum triangle area of 20 m2 for river channel elements 50 m2 in the case studies of thun and interlaken and 100 m2 for all other elements 1000 m2 in case studies of thun and interlaken the case studies of thun and interlaken have a coarser spatial resolution because these models are implemented in a model chain for the whole basin of the aare river upstream of bern 3000 km2 and thus are more focused on simulations at the river basin scale zischg et al 2016 an extract of the mesh from the buochs ennetbürgen case study is shown in fig 2 for the upper boundary conditions of the validation runs we used the hydrographs measured during the reference flood event in august 2005 the hydrographs of the lake levels of lake lucerne lake thun and lake brienz and the hydrographs of the rivers engelberger aa at buochs and lütschine at gsteig were delivered by the federal office for environment foen with a temporal resolution of 1 h foen 2017b in the lütschine river a dam breach occurred abruptly in the early morning of the 23rd of august 2005 we assumed that not considering the dam breach would lead to unrepresentative results thus the breach of the left lateral dam of the lütschine river was considered by using two models with the same mesh structure but slightly different z values where the dam broke as similarly shown by vorogushyn et al 2010 the first model with the intact dike at the lütschine river ran until the 23rd of august at 03 00 am water surface elevations and flow velocities were conserved and used as a inputs for the second model with the considered dike breach in addition with the continuative hydrograph in contrast the dike breach in the engelberger aa case study buochs ennetbürgen is part of a flood corridor and thus a spillway this situation is considered in the model by the dimension of the spillway after the overflow throughout the whole simulation 2 3 model validation with insurance claims in all four case studies a flood event occurred from the 22nd to 26th of august 2005 depending on the site the return period of this flood event was estimated by public authorities to be around 100 200 years we used this flood event for the validation of the inundation model 2 3 1 validation data if available georeferenced data about flood affected buildings and associated losses provide a validation dataset that is best suited for describing the performance of inundation models used for the analyses of exposure and flood losses at the level of the single buildings if insured flood losses are being paid out by the insurance company to policyholders affected by a flood event due to direct financial interests the claims are checked by experts and thus an overestimation of the number of cases is not expected losses that are smaller than a minimum threshold of re imbursements are not paid out but are still documented in the claims franchise of 200 swiss francs in nidwalden for residential buildings and 500 3000 swiss francs for industrial buildings in a monopoly situation with a mandatory insurance for all house owners a situation found in most swiss cantons the number of claims is very close to the number of affected buildings thus for a settlement affected by a flood it can be expected that a relevant number of insurance claims should be recorded the claim records report the date and the amount of damage as well as the type and address of the affected building the address can be used for geocoding and thereby to localize the losses bernet et al 2017 this results in a point dataset of geo localized flood losses the points can then be used to represent hits and non hits in a monopoly situation the non hits are also known when the total dataset of insured values is made available by the insurance company together the data provide binary information about which buildings were affected by a flood and which ones were not respectively the access to these datasets is generally heavily restricted due to privacy regulations and due to commercial sensitivities in the case of free markets in the canton of nidwalden the insurance against natural hazards is mandatory in this case the public insurance company delivered anonymized insurance claims of the flood event in 2005 and the anonymized total stock of insured values as valid per 01 january 2014 the damage data from the public insurance company for buildings picb of nidwalden were pre processed as described in bernet et al 2017 during the flood event in august 2005 period of 21st to 31st the picb received 1238 damage claims in the canton of nidwalden therefrom only 26 claims do not include precise coordinates at the building level 155 claims were rejected or are still pending these cases were not considered in the analysis 206 data points are located within the study area of stansstad and 326 within buochs and ennetbürgen additionally 95 1 of more than 1300 portfolio entries stansstad more than 450 buochs and ennetbürgen more than 800 within the study areas contain reliably localized data the buildings within the canton of bern are also insured by a picb in contrast their data were not delivered due to privacy restrictions thus the validation in the study areas of thun and interlaken has been done with data from the cooperative insurance company swiss mobiliar these data contain anonymized claim records of building content and business inventory excluding vehicles as opposed to damages to buildings in the two case studies in the canton of nidwalden this dataset as well as the provided anonymized portfolio as per 31 december 2014 does not cover all buildings since the market for content and business inventory in the canton of bern is open to all private insurance companies thus for the two case studies in the canton of bern we cannot validate the inundation model with the basic population but only with a sample dataset 311 damage claims are located in the study area of thun and 470 claims are located in the study area of interlaken in this study area only the claims that could be localized at the building level were used for validation i e 147 damage claims were not considered in the analysis because of an uncertain geo localization one problem in attributing the exposure to floods and flow depths to vulnerable objects on a local scale is the spatial representation of the objects an object represented by a point is probably less exposed than the same object represented by a polygon e g building footprint röthlisberger et al 2017 thus the point information from the insurance companies might not adequately represent the location of the building especially in regards to the exposition of floods near the outlines of the inundation area therefore we aggregated the pointwise damage and portfolio information to the building footprints of the swisstlm3d provided by the federal office of topography swisstopo 2017b because the portfolio data are valid from 01 january 2014 to 31 december 2014 and the flood event occurred in august 2005 a dissent in the datasets has to be assumed for this issue the precise dataset buildings and dwellings statistic fso 2014 from the federal statistical office containing information about the period of construction was intersected with the building footprints as described by fuchs et al 2017 and röthlisberger et al 2016 2017 by means of the known period of construction buildings built after 2005 can be detected and dismissed however the construction period is available only for residential buildings we assume that this removal of the buildings constructed after 2005 from all buildings better represents the situation at the time of the flood event in the case of nidwalden detailed information about the functionality of all buildings in the study area is given 28 1 of all buildings defined as minor constructions and auxiliary buildings do not overlay a building footprint polygon and 95 2 of all such auxiliary buildings within the mapped flood event perimeter are themselves not documented as affected whereas 77 6 show at least one entry with the same address but being exposed to the flood in contrary in practice the insurance company of the canton of nidwalden cumulates the information about losses for multiple buildings including minor constructions and auxiliary buildings such as garages from one owner to the home address of the owner the obvious errors due to this practice are considered by deleting these footprints as well as building footprint polygons not including any portfolio point the information about the building purpose allows us to distinguish between residential and non residential units in thun and interlaken where such information from the insurance company is lacking the buildings and dwellings statistic is used for this differentiation in the study areas of nidwalden 17 8 of the exploitation information residential or non residential provided by the insurance company is not consistent with the information from the buildings and dwellings statistics reasons can be found for instance in mixed usage within the same building or merged footprint polygons due to spatial proximity the validation based on insurance claims was compared with a conventional validation approach namely we used a second validation dataset i e event documentations of the cantons of nidwalden and bern these datasets delimit the flooded areas of the flood event in august 2005 and are independent from the insurance claims 2 3 2 validation metric the processed insurance data can be used to validate the model performance of the presented inundation models by adopting different metrics that allow for a spatially explicit application the most used metrics to compare real and modelled values are i the model fit measure also named as the thread score respectively the f statistics or the critical success index csi bates and deroo 2000 horritt and bates 2002 tayefi et al 2007 see eq 1 and ii the flood area index fai falter et al 2013 hereafter we use the term model fit for the first metric other metrics that can be used on these data are accuracy statistics eq 2 the bias score eq 3 the probability of detection eq 4 or hit rate the false alarm ratio eq 5 the probability of false detection or false alarm rate eq 6 and the success index eq 7 for a detailed description we refer to bennett et al 2013 we will compare the model fit with the other validation measures with a focus on the comparison between the model fit and the fai eq 8 both metrics are based on the same equation but on different validation datasets in our case the model fit is calculated on the basis of specific points in space whereas the fai is computed on the basis of areas before quantitatively analysing the model performance a visual performance analysis is done the model prediction in terms of the number of exposed building footprint polygons are compared with the observed number of exposed polygons a building is defined as exposed if its footprint intersects with a mesh element consisting of at least one node with a flow depth greater than 0 m if the building is correctly predicted as inundated it counts as a hit buildings predicted as dry by the model and observed as inundated are counted as misses correct negatives are buildings that are predicted as dry by the model and are observed as dry in the insurance claims buildings predicted as wet by the model but observed as dry in the insurance claims are defined as false alarms 1 f num s mod obs s num s mod obs s smod is the set of buildings predicted as flooded and sobs is the set of buildings flooded num denotes the number of members of the set the following metrics are used for comparison with the model fit bennett et al 2013 2 accuracy hits correct negatives total 3 bias score hits false alarms hits misses 4 probability of detection hit rate hits hits misses 5 false alarm ratio false alarms hits false alarms 6 probability of false detection false alarm rate false alarms correct negatives false alarms 7 success index 1 2 hits hits misses correct negatives correct negatives false alarms 8 fai m 1 d 1 m 1 d 1 m 1 d 0 m 0 d 1 in this equation m1d1 is the area simulated as flooded and observed as wet m1d0 is the predicted flooded area but observed as dry in the observation and m0d1 is the predicted dry area but observed as wet 3 results and discussion in this chapter the results from the model validation are presented and discussed focussing on the model performance and on the validation metrics the absolute values used for calculating the validation metrics are shown in table 1 the values needed for calculating the fai are shown in table 2 the values of the validation metrics are shown in table 3 regarding the model fit measure eq 1 including all types of buildings see table 3 only the simulation of stansstad shows a satisfactory value above 0 7 which is commonly used as a treshold for good performance in relation to insurance claims the model runs have a model fit of 0 66 in buochs ennetbürgen 0 74 in stansstad 0 56 in thun and 0 47 in interlaken only considering residential buildings which were constructed before the time of the flood event values in brackets the model fit measure is considerably higher for buochs ennetbürgen and stansstad whereas this is not the case in thun or interlaken this behaviour can be seen for every validation metric out of the already mentioned model fit measure eq 1 the bias score eq 3 the hit rate eq 4 and the false alarm ratio eq 5 in the case of thun from now on only results corresponding to all types of buildings are discussed a difference in the values of the model fit measure can be found between the case studies with a complete damage and portfolio dataset in nidwalden f 0 66 and 0 74 respectively and the two case studies in the canton of bern where only a sample dataset was provided f 0 56 and 0 47 respectively it is still an open question whether this influences the validation results and has to be addressed in the future the highest accuracy value eq 2 can be found in thun where more than 90 of all buildings were predicted correctly with regard to hits observed and modelled and correct negatives not observed and not modelled in all other study areas this value ranges from 77 to 79 the bias scores eq 3 show that in buochs ennetbürgen stansstad and thun false alarms compared to misses are overrepresented leading to a bias score greater than 1 in these cases the flood model showed a tendency to overestimate the number of exposed buildings in interlaken this relation is inverted and the bias score is below 1 the high amount of misses also influences the hit rate eq 4 in interlaken in comparison to the other model runs this value is low as well in thun and interlaken 33 34 of all modelled events are false alarms eq 5 false alarm ratio which is more than 10 higher than in all other model regions in the model region of stansstad more than half of all buildings not being observed as exposed to the flood were modelled as exposed eq 6 false alarm rate in buochs ennetbürgen this is applicable for 24 in interlaken for 13 and in thun for 7 the metric shown in equation 7 equally weights the ability of the model to correctly detect occurrences and non occurrences bennet et al 2013 the model run of stansstad shows the lowest values the ratio between the modelled area intersecting the observed area and the union of both eq 8 flood area index is showing the highest scores for buochs ennetbürgen depending on whether the modelled river area is included and assumed as an m1d1 area hit this value again gets even higher values in brackets table 3 particularly in thun the flood area index is enhanced more than 10 the corresponding maps are shown in figs 3 5 in all case studies differences between the modelled floods and the documented inundation areas can be observed in the case of buochs ennetbürgen the model run resulted in an underestimation of the inundated area in the northern part of the study area fig 3 left this can be explained by the fact that a small tributary was neglected which according to the event documentation lead to local flooding furthermore the artificial breach in the lateral dam of the main river is a special invention of the cantonal engineering administration the discharge structures are designed in a way that they can overflow without being breached in case of overflowing the lee side of the dike is eroded and the excess flow is suddenly guided towards the flood corridor in contrast to our simulation setup the overflow was in reality withheld for a longer period and suddenly increased after the overflow thus the peak discharge of the excess flow must have been slightly higher in reality than in our simulation however the flood corridor was not definitively implemented at the time of the flood and thus losses occurred in this study area another area that was underestimated by the model can be found in the case of stansstad fig 3 right in the eastern part of the study area a wider area is predicted as being dry while documented as being wet according to the event documentation this underestimation is the result of neglecting sediment transport in the small tributary gieslibach in the report of the event documentation the tributary flooded the left side because the sediment retention basin was filled with sediment and the water consequently flowed also towards the left in contrast to the evidence of the terrain model fig 3 indicates a few of buildings that are located within the flooded areas while according to the claim data no damage had been caused during the event these buildings are either associated with a low vulnerability against flooding or they are located above the water surface elevation at the micro relief scale in the case study of thun fig 4 the model remarkably overestimated the flooded area near the two branches of the aare river in comparison with the event documentation dataset however the insurance dataset shows damages in this area it is unknown whether these damages resulted from excess rainfall groundwater flooding or from riverine flooding note that we are not allowed to map single points of the losses in figs 4 and 5 due to privacy reasons the overestimation near the lake outflow can be explained by micro scale topographic features not present in the terrain model the area in the south of thun is underestimated by the model but mapped in the event documentation in reality this area was affected by groundwater flooding and not directly by lake flooding in interlaken the simulation resulted in a remarkable overestimation of the flooding north of the highway due to the dike breach on the lütschine river fig 5 however the insurance claims show a considerable number of damages in this area the model underestimated two weak points along the lütschine river the weak point downstream of the dam breach is not considered in the simulation because we used the river topography from 2014 with additional river widening and lateral dams implemented since 2005 however the underestimation of flooded areas along the aare river cannot be explained by simple topographical differences between 2014 and 2005 here the complex situation with two weirs and a branching river might not be represented with sufficient accuracy in our model the weirs are represented only as flow obstacles and not as weirs this situation needs to be optimized for future work in summary most of the false predictions can be explained by micro topographic structures and changes in the river channel due to flood prevention measures after the flood of 2005 similar observations were made by horritt and bates 2001b bates et al 2003 fewtrell et al 2008 boettle et al 2011 dottori et al 2013 and almeida et al 2016 nevertheless the results show an acceptable performance even without calibration wright et al 2017 iterative corrections of the mesh jakeman et al 2006 implementation of expert knowledge gharari et al 2014 or the discussion of the uncertainty in the boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 however adapting the computational mesh or the reconstruction of the river geometry as present during the reference flood may result in a better performance furthermore the flood event of 2005 was a remarkable but not extreme flood event the peak discharge was not substantially higher than the channel carrying capacity thus after stephens et al 2014 the validation values should be interpreted as conservative in this study we considered a building as exposed if it is affected by mesh nodes with a flow depth greater than 0 m it remains an open question if this assumption affects the validation metrics and has to be analysed in future works the model fit calculated on the basis of the insurance claims data differs from the one based on flooded areas in stansstad the f value is higher than the fai value in this case study claims are located in some areas predicted as wet by the model and observed as dry by the event documentation in addition a proportion of the areas predicted as wet but observed as dry do not contain buildings at all this leads to an f value greater than the fai value in contrast the f value is significantly lower than the fai value in the other three case studies namely relevant proportions of the areas that the model predicted well are located outside of the urbanized area while the deviations are located within the urbanized areas in the case study of interlaken this most apparent the model run erroneously predicted a relevant area in the centre of interlaken as flooded fig 5 that contains a high number of buildings in contrast in a relevant proportion of the accurately predicted wet areas no buildings are located this case demonstrates that the validation based on insurance claims is only considering points in space that are particularly relevant for flood risk assessment 4 conclusions and recommendations the comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can generally be compared to conventional validation data e g the flooded area although the model fit computed on the basis of insurance claims gives similar results the values are slightly lower than the ones computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas in three out of four test cases hence it is shown that a model with a good overall fit calculated on the basis of observed inundated areas does not necessarily exhibit a similarly good fit at locations of particular interest for risk assessment thus a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk as insurance portfolios and loss data represent the most relevant target for a validation of flood models used for exposure assessments at the scale of the single buildings this data can be recommended for validating inundation models however the considered model fit metric based on insurance claim data penalizes both misses and false alarms when a flood loss analysis aims at capturing the worst case e g for portfolio analysis the false alarms may have a lower weight which is considered by the hit rate the false alarm rate gives higher weights to false alarms but is sensitive to the correct negatives and thus to the delimitation of the study area in summary the use of additional validation metrics offers a more reliable base to assess specific aspects of the model performance rather than the model fit measure alone insurance claim data allow to calculate most of the binary validation metrics in a spatially explicit manner and thus allow to obtain more detailed insights regarding the advantages and the weak points of the selected 2d flood model nevertheless the delimitation of the study area influences the proportion of the number of buildings within and outside the flooded areas and with it some of the described validation metrics nevertheless the insurance data have to be carefully pre processed before being using it for model validation special attention has to be given to examine whether the construction date of each building corresponds to the date of the reference flood event used for validation the analysis showed that the removal of buildings constructed after the reference flood event influences the model fit another point to consider in pre processing insurance claim data is to filter out claims associated to surface water flooding as shown by bernet et al 2017 or claims associated with groundwater flooding this has not been done in this study and should be addressed in future studies nevertheless insurance claims constitute a potential validation dataset because of their consistent and relatively homogeneous records over time in contrast to flood event documentation data sets insurance claims are covering also small events and thus these data can remarkably extent the validation data in general still it remains an open question whether the flooded areas of past events can be reconstructed on the basis of insurance claims data last but not least the data availability constrained by privacy protection is a critical point this will likely remain the main limitation of the presented approach however the presented validation approach can be adapted to situations where insurance claims are not available when mapped flooded areas and a building dataset are obtainable with an overlay between the flooded areas and the buildings footprints a binary validation dataset similar to a dataset of insurance claims could be

7496,flood impact modelling requires reliable models for the simulation of flood processes in recent years flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation flood exposure and loss analyses in this study we validate a 2d inundation model for the purpose of flood exposure analysis at the river reach scale we validate the basement simulation model with insurance claims using conventional validation metrics the flood model is established on the basis of available topographic data in a high spatial resolution for four test cases the validation metrics were calculated with two different datasets a dataset of event documentations reporting flooded areas and a dataset of insurance claims the model fit relating to insurance claims is in three out of four test cases slightly lower than the model fit computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas this comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can be compared to conventional validation data such as the flooded area however a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk keywords 2d flood model validation insurance claims model performance 1 introduction floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards accounting for a majority of all economic losses from natural events worldwide unisdr 2015 managing flood risk requires knowledge about the hazardous processes and about flood impacts in recent years flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation flood exposure and flood loss analyses a variety of models exist for different purposes and scales reaching from global scale inundation models pappenberger et al 2012 ward et al 2013 sampson et al 2015 to continental trigg et al 2016 national merz et al 2008 and finally regional and local scale models fewtrell et al 2011 neal et al 2011 pedrozo acuña et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 garrote et al 2016 another increasing use of flood inundation models is the coupling of flood models with hydrologic and hydrometeorologic models within a model cascade or a coupled component modelling framework at the river basin scale e g biancamaria et al 2009 falter et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 felder et al 2017 thus a variety of inundation models exist for different purposes e g horritt and bates 2001a hunter et al 2007 chatterjee et al 2008 bates et al 2010 crispino et al 2015 courty et al 2017 developers are validating the models with a broad set of validation techniques and data model validation here is defined after hunter et al 2007 as the process of demonstrating that a given site specific model is capable of making accurate predictions defined with respect to the application in mind for periods outside a calibration period if the accuracy and predictive capability in the validation period is proven to lie within an acceptable limit for a particular practical purpose it is defined as being validated depending on the purpose of the model used and the available data the validation methods vary remarkably in 1d simulation frameworks hydraulic models have been calibrated and validated with observed water levels at specific locations horritt and bates 2002 mark et al 2004 pappenberger et al 2005 hunter et al 2007 felder et al 2017 however with the development of 2d flood inundation models spatially explicit model performance measures have been proposed and used for model validation in many cases this is done by comparing the simulated inundation areas with observed ones as shown by woodhead et al 2007 most likely the main data used in the validation of inundation models is observation data of the wet dry boundary this leads to the comparison between modelled and observed inundation areas other validation data are aerial images and observed flood maps delineated thereof or satellite based remote sensing data bates et al 1997 describe a procedure for validating inundation models with remote sensing data especially synthetic aperture radar data have recently been used for calibration and validation horritt 2000 horritt et al 2007 mason and bates 2009 pappenberger et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 in contrast neal et al 2009 and savage et al 2016 compared inundation models with a large set of water level measurements in a study area this is probably the most reliable validation data segura beltrán et al 2016 furthermore inundation models are also validated against stage discharge relationships or time to peak horritt and bates 2002 the latter is less often used if the main purpose of the inundation model is to provide the basis for flood loss analyses for evaluating newly developed models a benchmark test against established models or models that represent an industry standard is sometimes done neal et al 2012a the comparison of the flooded areas computed by different models is shown in several studies horritt and bates 2001a 2002 tayefi et al 2007 chatterjee et al 2008 fewtrell et al 2008 castellarin et al 2009 neal et al 2012a b crispino et al 2015 trigg et al 2016 vozinaki et al 2016 lavoie and mahdi 2017 however the main limiting factor for validating inundation models is often the lack of validation data neal et al 2012a beside model validation the analyses of uncertainties or the sensitivities against model parameters are a fundamental step in model development pappenberger et al 2006 jakeman et al 2006 ratto et al 2012 freer et al 2013 pianosi et al 2016 teng et al 2017 in sensitivity analysis one focus is on the representation of the topography especially the spatial resolution horritt and bates 2001b cook and merwade 2009 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2015 2016 probabilistic models are able to incorporate a number of model runs with different parameterizations and different boundary conditions dottori et al 2013 state that deterministic models and very high spatial resolution are potentially misleading as they could induce overconfidence derived from their spuriously precise results this in turn may lead to wrong decisions in flood risk management thus the choice of the modelling strategy depends on the main purpose of the study the model complexity the needed computational resources and the available topographic data di baldassarre et al 2010 dottori et al 2013 jonkman 2013 refsgaard et al 2016 a key point in the reliability of flood inundation models is the ability to represent flood protection measures merwade et al 2008b neal et al 2012b ward et al 2013 on the reach scale the inability to accurately represent river morphology is a disadvantage of raster based models the increase in spatial resolution has a negative effect on the needed computing resources neal et al 2012b savage et al 2015 solutions for dealing with this trade off between spatial resolution and computing power are for example the use of subgrid approaches i e modelling the flow in the river channel in 1d combined with floodplain routing in 2d as exemplarily described by neal et al 2012b the coupling of 1d and 2d simulation models vozinaki et al 2016 or the use of nesting approaches as shown by bermúdez et al 2017 the latter nested a local scale flood inundation model based on irregular meshes into a basin scale model based on regular grids a third group of models dealing with this topic is the simulation based on irregular meshes these can have a high spatial resolution in the river channel and a coarser resolution in the floodplain horritt and bates 2001a thus these models are able to accurately represent river morphology and geometry this includes the consideration of flood protection measures which is required for predicting flood patterns satisfyingly fewtrell et al 2011 consequently the accurate consideration of flood protection measures must also be valid from the viewpoint of flood loss analyses as they increasingly consider single buildings zischg et al 2013 fuchs et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2017 however 2d inundation models are often evaluated regarding the ability to accurately predicting flooded areas in many cases the flooded areas predicted by the model are compared with the observed wet areas of a specific flood event however such observations may not be an adequate validation dataset in all cases especially for flood exposure and flood risk analyses a model exhibiting a good overall fit regarding inundated areas in a large floodplain may not necessarily produce good results at locations of particular interest for risk assessment pappenberger et al 2007b nevertheless a method for validating 2d inundation models explicitly used for flood exposure and flood loss analyses has not been presented yet therefore the main aim of this study is to close this gap by developing a method for validating 2d flood inundation models used in flood exposure analyses for that matter the validation data and metrics need to be adapted to that particular purpose therefore we propose alternative data for validating the model i e a dataset of geo localized insurance claims herein the main question concerns the value of validating a 2d flood model on the basis of loss data rather than on the basis of inundated areas this question is posed under the hypothesis that a validation based on insurance claims gives different weighting to urbanized areas in comparison to areas without values at risk an additional question is how the various validation metrics differ between each other when adopted to insurance claims the paper is structured as follows in the methods chapter we first describe the study areas and the method for setting up the flood model following we present the parameters and the boundary conditions for the model runs thereafter we introduce the validation method and the data used the results focus on both the performance of the model and the proposed validation method in the discussions and conclusions the results are discussed and recommendations for using insurance claims in the validation of flood models are given 2 methods we tested the validation approach on the basis of test cases for which insurance claims were available all cases represent a complex flood topology with combined riverine and lake flooding two test cases have branching river morphologies the validation is done by a full set of insurance claims in two test cases and by a sample set of claims in the other two test cases we compare different metrics for validation of models that are based on binary validation data 2 1 study area the four test cases are located in pre alpine areas of switzerland fig 1 the first two test cases are located in the canton of nidwalden the western test case in the municipality of stansstad is characterized by the giesslibach torrent the eastern part of buochs and ennetbürgen by the main river crossing the canton of nidwalden the engelberger aa both river systems contribute to lake lucerne which is a determining factor for flood risk in both study areas as well thus the flooding is also influenced by lake flooding the third test case is the floodplain in the city of thun in the canton of bern here the main process is lake flooding with combined riverine flooding downstream the outflow of lake thun is the aare river flowing through the city of thun the aare river has two branches during low flow conditions the lake level is regulated by a weir the fourth case is the floodplain of the city of interlaken this floodplain is a quaternary debris cone of the river lütschine the city is located between lake brienz upstream and lake thun downstream the aare river connects the two lakes and is also regulated by two weirs during low flow conditions thus this floodplain is affected by combined riverine and lake flooding fig 1 shows the location of the study areas 2 2 set up of the flood model flood loss analyses usually consist of flood scenarios around and above a river s discharge capacity consequently the river s geometry has to be represented as accurately as possible the river reaches of our case studies have lateral dams thus the flood model has to represent not only the correct area for calculating the river carrying capacity but also the correct geometry this means that the different heights of the left and right dams should be considered in the flood model in our research we are using the 2d inundation model basement v2 6 because it is based on flexible irregular meshes and thus it allows to represent the river bed in a higher spatial resolution than the floodplains basement stands for basic simulation environment the model is developed and maintained by the laboratory of hydraulics hydrology and glaciology vaw of the eth zurich basement is described in detail by vetsch et al 2017 and has been validated analytically it has been used for dam breach simulations vonwiller and vetsch 2015 worni et al 2012 volz et al 2012 in river restoration projects berchtold et al 2012 fah et al 2007a b bertoldi et al 2014 and for the simulation of flash floods radice et al 0000 the model is freely available and is widely used by consultants for flood risk analyses the first step in setting up the inundation model is the generation of the computational mesh within a predefined delimitation of the study area we mapped the upper and lower shorelines of the river reaches and lakes in the floodplains only the most important hydraulic structures were represented by break lines the triangulation was done with the triangle mesh generator of shewchuck 2002 this step is part of the pre processing plug in implemented in qgis basemesh vetsch et al 2017 after generating the mesh we directly attributed the z coordinates to the nodes by using the local cell values of the digital terrain models for the test sites in the canton of nidwalden we used the digital elevation model swissalti3d produced by the federal office of topography swisstopo 2017a this terrain model is available for the whole of switzerland and has a grid resolution of 2 m the vertical accuracy is expected to be around 0 5 m for the other study areas we used a purely lidar derived digital elevation model provided by the canton of bern kawa 2015 this model has a grid resolution of 0 5 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 2 m for the interpolation of the riverbed we used surveyed cross sections with a mean distance of 100 m provided by the federal office of environment foen 2017a we interpolated the riverbed levels between the cross sections by adapting the approaches proposed by merwade et al 2008a conner and tonina 2014 and costabile and macchione 2015 the points of the cross sections were connected with 3d polylines and the grid cells in between the cross sections were interpolated on the basis of the mean slope between the cross sections finally we checked if the interpolated grid cells of the riverbed lay below the water surface measured by the lidar the terrain model of the riverbed was merged with the terrain model of the floodplain the bottom of the lake was set to the minimum z level of the connected river cells from the merged digital terrain model we computed a focal statistics raster of the maximum and minimum values within a 3 x 3 raster cell environment the merged terrain model was the basis for attributing the z values to the nodes of the mesh except for the nodes located on an upper shoreline of the river or a lake and the nodes located within the river channel the z values of the nodes representing the upper shorelines were attributed from the maximum focal statistics raster the nodes within a river channel have been attributed with the z values of the minimum raster this leads to a smoothing of the river channel geometry and to a better representation of the river bank and respectively the lake shorelines the riverbed morphology is relatively simple since it is in all cases a totally anthropogenically modified river channel with approximately a trapezoidal form thus we do not expect relevant problems arising from the effects of bathymetry interpolation on hydrodynamic results as shown by conner and tonina 2014 the roughness parameters manning strickler values were delineated from the official guidelines of bwg 2001 we did not calibrate these parameters and no field investigations were made or retrospectively considered in this model setup the weirs were considered as hydraulic obstacles in the river channel given by their geometries the mesh has a maximum triangle area of 20 m2 for river channel elements 50 m2 in the case studies of thun and interlaken and 100 m2 for all other elements 1000 m2 in case studies of thun and interlaken the case studies of thun and interlaken have a coarser spatial resolution because these models are implemented in a model chain for the whole basin of the aare river upstream of bern 3000 km2 and thus are more focused on simulations at the river basin scale zischg et al 2016 an extract of the mesh from the buochs ennetbürgen case study is shown in fig 2 for the upper boundary conditions of the validation runs we used the hydrographs measured during the reference flood event in august 2005 the hydrographs of the lake levels of lake lucerne lake thun and lake brienz and the hydrographs of the rivers engelberger aa at buochs and lütschine at gsteig were delivered by the federal office for environment foen with a temporal resolution of 1 h foen 2017b in the lütschine river a dam breach occurred abruptly in the early morning of the 23rd of august 2005 we assumed that not considering the dam breach would lead to unrepresentative results thus the breach of the left lateral dam of the lütschine river was considered by using two models with the same mesh structure but slightly different z values where the dam broke as similarly shown by vorogushyn et al 2010 the first model with the intact dike at the lütschine river ran until the 23rd of august at 03 00 am water surface elevations and flow velocities were conserved and used as a inputs for the second model with the considered dike breach in addition with the continuative hydrograph in contrast the dike breach in the engelberger aa case study buochs ennetbürgen is part of a flood corridor and thus a spillway this situation is considered in the model by the dimension of the spillway after the overflow throughout the whole simulation 2 3 model validation with insurance claims in all four case studies a flood event occurred from the 22nd to 26th of august 2005 depending on the site the return period of this flood event was estimated by public authorities to be around 100 200 years we used this flood event for the validation of the inundation model 2 3 1 validation data if available georeferenced data about flood affected buildings and associated losses provide a validation dataset that is best suited for describing the performance of inundation models used for the analyses of exposure and flood losses at the level of the single buildings if insured flood losses are being paid out by the insurance company to policyholders affected by a flood event due to direct financial interests the claims are checked by experts and thus an overestimation of the number of cases is not expected losses that are smaller than a minimum threshold of re imbursements are not paid out but are still documented in the claims franchise of 200 swiss francs in nidwalden for residential buildings and 500 3000 swiss francs for industrial buildings in a monopoly situation with a mandatory insurance for all house owners a situation found in most swiss cantons the number of claims is very close to the number of affected buildings thus for a settlement affected by a flood it can be expected that a relevant number of insurance claims should be recorded the claim records report the date and the amount of damage as well as the type and address of the affected building the address can be used for geocoding and thereby to localize the losses bernet et al 2017 this results in a point dataset of geo localized flood losses the points can then be used to represent hits and non hits in a monopoly situation the non hits are also known when the total dataset of insured values is made available by the insurance company together the data provide binary information about which buildings were affected by a flood and which ones were not respectively the access to these datasets is generally heavily restricted due to privacy regulations and due to commercial sensitivities in the case of free markets in the canton of nidwalden the insurance against natural hazards is mandatory in this case the public insurance company delivered anonymized insurance claims of the flood event in 2005 and the anonymized total stock of insured values as valid per 01 january 2014 the damage data from the public insurance company for buildings picb of nidwalden were pre processed as described in bernet et al 2017 during the flood event in august 2005 period of 21st to 31st the picb received 1238 damage claims in the canton of nidwalden therefrom only 26 claims do not include precise coordinates at the building level 155 claims were rejected or are still pending these cases were not considered in the analysis 206 data points are located within the study area of stansstad and 326 within buochs and ennetbürgen additionally 95 1 of more than 1300 portfolio entries stansstad more than 450 buochs and ennetbürgen more than 800 within the study areas contain reliably localized data the buildings within the canton of bern are also insured by a picb in contrast their data were not delivered due to privacy restrictions thus the validation in the study areas of thun and interlaken has been done with data from the cooperative insurance company swiss mobiliar these data contain anonymized claim records of building content and business inventory excluding vehicles as opposed to damages to buildings in the two case studies in the canton of nidwalden this dataset as well as the provided anonymized portfolio as per 31 december 2014 does not cover all buildings since the market for content and business inventory in the canton of bern is open to all private insurance companies thus for the two case studies in the canton of bern we cannot validate the inundation model with the basic population but only with a sample dataset 311 damage claims are located in the study area of thun and 470 claims are located in the study area of interlaken in this study area only the claims that could be localized at the building level were used for validation i e 147 damage claims were not considered in the analysis because of an uncertain geo localization one problem in attributing the exposure to floods and flow depths to vulnerable objects on a local scale is the spatial representation of the objects an object represented by a point is probably less exposed than the same object represented by a polygon e g building footprint röthlisberger et al 2017 thus the point information from the insurance companies might not adequately represent the location of the building especially in regards to the exposition of floods near the outlines of the inundation area therefore we aggregated the pointwise damage and portfolio information to the building footprints of the swisstlm3d provided by the federal office of topography swisstopo 2017b because the portfolio data are valid from 01 january 2014 to 31 december 2014 and the flood event occurred in august 2005 a dissent in the datasets has to be assumed for this issue the precise dataset buildings and dwellings statistic fso 2014 from the federal statistical office containing information about the period of construction was intersected with the building footprints as described by fuchs et al 2017 and röthlisberger et al 2016 2017 by means of the known period of construction buildings built after 2005 can be detected and dismissed however the construction period is available only for residential buildings we assume that this removal of the buildings constructed after 2005 from all buildings better represents the situation at the time of the flood event in the case of nidwalden detailed information about the functionality of all buildings in the study area is given 28 1 of all buildings defined as minor constructions and auxiliary buildings do not overlay a building footprint polygon and 95 2 of all such auxiliary buildings within the mapped flood event perimeter are themselves not documented as affected whereas 77 6 show at least one entry with the same address but being exposed to the flood in contrary in practice the insurance company of the canton of nidwalden cumulates the information about losses for multiple buildings including minor constructions and auxiliary buildings such as garages from one owner to the home address of the owner the obvious errors due to this practice are considered by deleting these footprints as well as building footprint polygons not including any portfolio point the information about the building purpose allows us to distinguish between residential and non residential units in thun and interlaken where such information from the insurance company is lacking the buildings and dwellings statistic is used for this differentiation in the study areas of nidwalden 17 8 of the exploitation information residential or non residential provided by the insurance company is not consistent with the information from the buildings and dwellings statistics reasons can be found for instance in mixed usage within the same building or merged footprint polygons due to spatial proximity the validation based on insurance claims was compared with a conventional validation approach namely we used a second validation dataset i e event documentations of the cantons of nidwalden and bern these datasets delimit the flooded areas of the flood event in august 2005 and are independent from the insurance claims 2 3 2 validation metric the processed insurance data can be used to validate the model performance of the presented inundation models by adopting different metrics that allow for a spatially explicit application the most used metrics to compare real and modelled values are i the model fit measure also named as the thread score respectively the f statistics or the critical success index csi bates and deroo 2000 horritt and bates 2002 tayefi et al 2007 see eq 1 and ii the flood area index fai falter et al 2013 hereafter we use the term model fit for the first metric other metrics that can be used on these data are accuracy statistics eq 2 the bias score eq 3 the probability of detection eq 4 or hit rate the false alarm ratio eq 5 the probability of false detection or false alarm rate eq 6 and the success index eq 7 for a detailed description we refer to bennett et al 2013 we will compare the model fit with the other validation measures with a focus on the comparison between the model fit and the fai eq 8 both metrics are based on the same equation but on different validation datasets in our case the model fit is calculated on the basis of specific points in space whereas the fai is computed on the basis of areas before quantitatively analysing the model performance a visual performance analysis is done the model prediction in terms of the number of exposed building footprint polygons are compared with the observed number of exposed polygons a building is defined as exposed if its footprint intersects with a mesh element consisting of at least one node with a flow depth greater than 0 m if the building is correctly predicted as inundated it counts as a hit buildings predicted as dry by the model and observed as inundated are counted as misses correct negatives are buildings that are predicted as dry by the model and are observed as dry in the insurance claims buildings predicted as wet by the model but observed as dry in the insurance claims are defined as false alarms 1 f num s mod obs s num s mod obs s smod is the set of buildings predicted as flooded and sobs is the set of buildings flooded num denotes the number of members of the set the following metrics are used for comparison with the model fit bennett et al 2013 2 accuracy hits correct negatives total 3 bias score hits false alarms hits misses 4 probability of detection hit rate hits hits misses 5 false alarm ratio false alarms hits false alarms 6 probability of false detection false alarm rate false alarms correct negatives false alarms 7 success index 1 2 hits hits misses correct negatives correct negatives false alarms 8 fai m 1 d 1 m 1 d 1 m 1 d 0 m 0 d 1 in this equation m1d1 is the area simulated as flooded and observed as wet m1d0 is the predicted flooded area but observed as dry in the observation and m0d1 is the predicted dry area but observed as wet 3 results and discussion in this chapter the results from the model validation are presented and discussed focussing on the model performance and on the validation metrics the absolute values used for calculating the validation metrics are shown in table 1 the values needed for calculating the fai are shown in table 2 the values of the validation metrics are shown in table 3 regarding the model fit measure eq 1 including all types of buildings see table 3 only the simulation of stansstad shows a satisfactory value above 0 7 which is commonly used as a treshold for good performance in relation to insurance claims the model runs have a model fit of 0 66 in buochs ennetbürgen 0 74 in stansstad 0 56 in thun and 0 47 in interlaken only considering residential buildings which were constructed before the time of the flood event values in brackets the model fit measure is considerably higher for buochs ennetbürgen and stansstad whereas this is not the case in thun or interlaken this behaviour can be seen for every validation metric out of the already mentioned model fit measure eq 1 the bias score eq 3 the hit rate eq 4 and the false alarm ratio eq 5 in the case of thun from now on only results corresponding to all types of buildings are discussed a difference in the values of the model fit measure can be found between the case studies with a complete damage and portfolio dataset in nidwalden f 0 66 and 0 74 respectively and the two case studies in the canton of bern where only a sample dataset was provided f 0 56 and 0 47 respectively it is still an open question whether this influences the validation results and has to be addressed in the future the highest accuracy value eq 2 can be found in thun where more than 90 of all buildings were predicted correctly with regard to hits observed and modelled and correct negatives not observed and not modelled in all other study areas this value ranges from 77 to 79 the bias scores eq 3 show that in buochs ennetbürgen stansstad and thun false alarms compared to misses are overrepresented leading to a bias score greater than 1 in these cases the flood model showed a tendency to overestimate the number of exposed buildings in interlaken this relation is inverted and the bias score is below 1 the high amount of misses also influences the hit rate eq 4 in interlaken in comparison to the other model runs this value is low as well in thun and interlaken 33 34 of all modelled events are false alarms eq 5 false alarm ratio which is more than 10 higher than in all other model regions in the model region of stansstad more than half of all buildings not being observed as exposed to the flood were modelled as exposed eq 6 false alarm rate in buochs ennetbürgen this is applicable for 24 in interlaken for 13 and in thun for 7 the metric shown in equation 7 equally weights the ability of the model to correctly detect occurrences and non occurrences bennet et al 2013 the model run of stansstad shows the lowest values the ratio between the modelled area intersecting the observed area and the union of both eq 8 flood area index is showing the highest scores for buochs ennetbürgen depending on whether the modelled river area is included and assumed as an m1d1 area hit this value again gets even higher values in brackets table 3 particularly in thun the flood area index is enhanced more than 10 the corresponding maps are shown in figs 3 5 in all case studies differences between the modelled floods and the documented inundation areas can be observed in the case of buochs ennetbürgen the model run resulted in an underestimation of the inundated area in the northern part of the study area fig 3 left this can be explained by the fact that a small tributary was neglected which according to the event documentation lead to local flooding furthermore the artificial breach in the lateral dam of the main river is a special invention of the cantonal engineering administration the discharge structures are designed in a way that they can overflow without being breached in case of overflowing the lee side of the dike is eroded and the excess flow is suddenly guided towards the flood corridor in contrast to our simulation setup the overflow was in reality withheld for a longer period and suddenly increased after the overflow thus the peak discharge of the excess flow must have been slightly higher in reality than in our simulation however the flood corridor was not definitively implemented at the time of the flood and thus losses occurred in this study area another area that was underestimated by the model can be found in the case of stansstad fig 3 right in the eastern part of the study area a wider area is predicted as being dry while documented as being wet according to the event documentation this underestimation is the result of neglecting sediment transport in the small tributary gieslibach in the report of the event documentation the tributary flooded the left side because the sediment retention basin was filled with sediment and the water consequently flowed also towards the left in contrast to the evidence of the terrain model fig 3 indicates a few of buildings that are located within the flooded areas while according to the claim data no damage had been caused during the event these buildings are either associated with a low vulnerability against flooding or they are located above the water surface elevation at the micro relief scale in the case study of thun fig 4 the model remarkably overestimated the flooded area near the two branches of the aare river in comparison with the event documentation dataset however the insurance dataset shows damages in this area it is unknown whether these damages resulted from excess rainfall groundwater flooding or from riverine flooding note that we are not allowed to map single points of the losses in figs 4 and 5 due to privacy reasons the overestimation near the lake outflow can be explained by micro scale topographic features not present in the terrain model the area in the south of thun is underestimated by the model but mapped in the event documentation in reality this area was affected by groundwater flooding and not directly by lake flooding in interlaken the simulation resulted in a remarkable overestimation of the flooding north of the highway due to the dike breach on the lütschine river fig 5 however the insurance claims show a considerable number of damages in this area the model underestimated two weak points along the lütschine river the weak point downstream of the dam breach is not considered in the simulation because we used the river topography from 2014 with additional river widening and lateral dams implemented since 2005 however the underestimation of flooded areas along the aare river cannot be explained by simple topographical differences between 2014 and 2005 here the complex situation with two weirs and a branching river might not be represented with sufficient accuracy in our model the weirs are represented only as flow obstacles and not as weirs this situation needs to be optimized for future work in summary most of the false predictions can be explained by micro topographic structures and changes in the river channel due to flood prevention measures after the flood of 2005 similar observations were made by horritt and bates 2001b bates et al 2003 fewtrell et al 2008 boettle et al 2011 dottori et al 2013 and almeida et al 2016 nevertheless the results show an acceptable performance even without calibration wright et al 2017 iterative corrections of the mesh jakeman et al 2006 implementation of expert knowledge gharari et al 2014 or the discussion of the uncertainty in the boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 however adapting the computational mesh or the reconstruction of the river geometry as present during the reference flood may result in a better performance furthermore the flood event of 2005 was a remarkable but not extreme flood event the peak discharge was not substantially higher than the channel carrying capacity thus after stephens et al 2014 the validation values should be interpreted as conservative in this study we considered a building as exposed if it is affected by mesh nodes with a flow depth greater than 0 m it remains an open question if this assumption affects the validation metrics and has to be analysed in future works the model fit calculated on the basis of the insurance claims data differs from the one based on flooded areas in stansstad the f value is higher than the fai value in this case study claims are located in some areas predicted as wet by the model and observed as dry by the event documentation in addition a proportion of the areas predicted as wet but observed as dry do not contain buildings at all this leads to an f value greater than the fai value in contrast the f value is significantly lower than the fai value in the other three case studies namely relevant proportions of the areas that the model predicted well are located outside of the urbanized area while the deviations are located within the urbanized areas in the case study of interlaken this most apparent the model run erroneously predicted a relevant area in the centre of interlaken as flooded fig 5 that contains a high number of buildings in contrast in a relevant proportion of the accurately predicted wet areas no buildings are located this case demonstrates that the validation based on insurance claims is only considering points in space that are particularly relevant for flood risk assessment 4 conclusions and recommendations the comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can generally be compared to conventional validation data e g the flooded area although the model fit computed on the basis of insurance claims gives similar results the values are slightly lower than the ones computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas in three out of four test cases hence it is shown that a model with a good overall fit calculated on the basis of observed inundated areas does not necessarily exhibit a similarly good fit at locations of particular interest for risk assessment thus a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk as insurance portfolios and loss data represent the most relevant target for a validation of flood models used for exposure assessments at the scale of the single buildings this data can be recommended for validating inundation models however the considered model fit metric based on insurance claim data penalizes both misses and false alarms when a flood loss analysis aims at capturing the worst case e g for portfolio analysis the false alarms may have a lower weight which is considered by the hit rate the false alarm rate gives higher weights to false alarms but is sensitive to the correct negatives and thus to the delimitation of the study area in summary the use of additional validation metrics offers a more reliable base to assess specific aspects of the model performance rather than the model fit measure alone insurance claim data allow to calculate most of the binary validation metrics in a spatially explicit manner and thus allow to obtain more detailed insights regarding the advantages and the weak points of the selected 2d flood model nevertheless the delimitation of the study area influences the proportion of the number of buildings within and outside the flooded areas and with it some of the described validation metrics nevertheless the insurance data have to be carefully pre processed before being using it for model validation special attention has to be given to examine whether the construction date of each building corresponds to the date of the reference flood event used for validation the analysis showed that the removal of buildings constructed after the reference flood event influences the model fit another point to consider in pre processing insurance claim data is to filter out claims associated to surface water flooding as shown by bernet et al 2017 or claims associated with groundwater flooding this has not been done in this study and should be addressed in future studies nevertheless insurance claims constitute a potential validation dataset because of their consistent and relatively homogeneous records over time in contrast to flood event documentation data sets insurance claims are covering also small events and thus these data can remarkably extent the validation data in general still it remains an open question whether the flooded areas of past events can be reconstructed on the basis of insurance claims data last but not least the data availability constrained by privacy protection is a critical point this will likely remain the main limitation of the presented approach however the presented validation approach can be adapted to situations where insurance claims are not available when mapped flooded areas and a building dataset are obtainable with an overlay between the flooded areas and the buildings footprints a binary validation dataset similar to a dataset of insurance claims could be

yuan et al 2015 the north american multi model ensemble nmme system consists of many coupled climate models related to meteorological forecasting although the prediction accuracy of dynamic models may not be as high as statistical methods dynamic systems gained much popularity in the last decades because they simulate real atmosphere land ocean interaction physics it seems promising to combine statistical and dynamic models to reach a better forecasting accuracy hao et al 2016 however few of the existing studies focused on this area the potential reason may be that data driven and model driven methods are two different mechanisms it is hard to find a way to connect them and fix the uncertainty madadgar et al developed a statistical dynamic hybrid framework to forecast drought in the southwestern united states madadgar et al 2016 the statistical and dynamic parts were linked by expert advice algorithm which aimed to minimize the accumulated error in the training period to determine the weights the results showed that the prediction accuracy of dynamic models was improved by incorporating statistical methods the nmme has showed good prediction performance in some areas and received much attention in recent years the eight models including 99 ensemble members in the nmme provide climate information for global drought prediction for several months in advance the ensemble models can be weighted or averaged to obtain better accuracy some weighting schemes such as ensemble mean em ensemble median linear regression principal component regression pcr and bayesian model averaging bma are commonly used najafi and moradkhani 2015 these methods try to optimize the weights between members according to respective rules in this study we also used weighted nmme models to investigate their abilities in forecasting drought in china in recent years drought representation using standardized indices has entered a stage of rapid development in the field of remote sensing the developed drought indices such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 has been widely used recently some new indices depicting drought were proposed due to the development of satellite sensors and mathematic models hao and aghakouchak 2013 xia et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 sehgal et al used wavelet and bma to estimate the high resolution soil moisture in the contiguous united states by combining two land surface models and in situ observations sehgal et al 2017 rajsekhar et al proposed a new drought index called mdi by combining spei standardized runoff index sri and climate prediction center cpc soil moisture index smi by kernel entropy component analysis keca rajsekhar et al 2015 besides the thermal remote sensing based atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 1997 has shown promising potentials for estimating evapotranspiration and soil water content at medium to high spatial resolutions diak et al 2004 and the soil moisture active passive smap satellite entekhabi et al 2010 provides a new way for soil moisture estimation below the surface based on microwave radiometry in this study we wouldn t go much into details of the drought indices but focused on the drought forecasting techniques the main objective of this study is to examine the ability of statistical dynamic and hybrid models for drought prediction in china we developed a hybrid method combining statistical and dynamic models where these models can be used for drought prediction was also explored the results were compared with ensemble mean bayesian model averaging sole svr and sole dynamic models the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 described the methods and materials used section 3 displayed the results and section 4 discussed model performances and drought predictability section 5 concluded this study 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area this study focuses on the mainland china where annual average rainfall exhibits a declining trend from south to north fig 1 there are mainly four climate patterns in china the subtropical humid monsoon climate in southern china the temperate monsoon climate in northern china the temperate continental climate in northwestern china and the alpine climate in tibet plateau in western china the rainfall anomaly in china was found to be mainly influenced by east asian summer monsoon easm yihui and chan 2005 ei nino southern oscillation enso zhang et al 1999 west pacific subtropical high wpsh mao et al 2010 and snow cover in tibetan plateau zhang et al 2004 weaker easm stronger enso and stronger southerly wpsh would commonly lead to floods in yangtze river and southern china conversely stronger easm la nina and northerly wpsh would cause floods in northern china however a strong enso may not lead to extreme drought in northern china as many climatic variables interact with each other especially in the context of climate change wang et al 2017 the 0 5 0 5 monthly rainfall dataset http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html developed by china meteorological data service center cmdc were interpolated from 2472 rain gauge stations using thin plate spline method hutchinson 1998 the 0 5 degree rainfall dataset were interpolated by inverse distance weighting to match the center coordinates of dynamic models the rainfall grid data had been validated under strict quality control we did a correlation analysis between monthly rainfall from 824 rain gauge observations during 1980 2015 obtained from cmdc and the interpolated data from rainfall grid by inverse distance weighting the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc was 0 95 and the mean absolute error mae was 14 7 mm fig s1 the spatial distribution of monthly mae between station observations and interpolated data from 0 5 degree rainfall was also computed fig s2 although there are non ignorable errors in many areas in fact we are more concerned in large scale climate predictions the 2472 rain gauge stations can largely cover the 1 1 grids 968 grids over china in this study the precipitation anomaly percentage pap was used to represent drought severity pap is defined as the ratio of precipitation anomaly in a specific time period to the historically averaged precipitation at that time 1 pap p p p 100 where p represents the precipitation in a specific month and p denotes the historically averaged precipitation in this month specifically p is calculated as 2 p 1 n i 1 n p i where n indicates the years used i 1 2 n the classification of meteorological drought was based on national drought classification standard of china gb t 20481 2006 pap 0 25 no drought 0 5 pap 0 25 mild drought 0 7 pap 0 5 moderate drought 0 8 pap 0 7 severe drought pap 0 8 exceptional drought which is similar to spi and pdsi pap and spi were both used in china to monitor drought conditions while pdsi was seldomly used due to its high level data requirement 2 2 statistical climate signals weighting climate signals such as atmosphere ocean teleconnections can be effective predictors for regional climatic anomaly najafi et al 2012 several drought and flood events occurred in china had been found to be related to enso and la nina phenomena chan and zhou 2005 lau and weng 2001 tong et al 2006 large scale sea surface temperature sst anomalies change regional atmospheric circulation and may cause extreme climate events thus in this study a few climate indices were used as predictors to forecast rainfall in china these climate signals table s1 came from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and china meteorological administration cma specifically the first 21 climate indices were obtained from noaa and the last one namely wpsh including its area intensity ridge line and western extend was from cma besides the 72 monthly averaged circulation indices from cma http cmdp ncc cma net cn download htm were also used therefore a total of 97 climate indices were used in this study as for the weights the most four correlated climate indices were selected as independent variables based on pearson s correlation coefficient before selecting climate indices the dependent variable precipitation and independent variables climate indices were deseasonalized by using monthly time series subtracting their historically averaged values in each month we compared the selections of climate indices between correlation using the entire dataset and correlation using the data in a specific month spanning all the years as shown in fig s3 the overall distribution of selections with or without considering seasonality was different as for the climate index selections in different months fig s4 and regions fig s5 differences can also be seen clearly in this study we performed monthly precipitation forecasts by selecting climate indices monthly although this may lead to fewer samples in the regressions the selected climate indices and monthly precipitation were regressed by support vector machine svm svm first proposed by vladimir vapnik vapnik 2013 and his workers in 1992 is a machine learning method for classification and regression based on vc theory vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 vapnik and kotz 1982 and the rule of structural risk minimization support vector regression performs nonlinear regressions by incorporating kernel functions to map the input data to a high dimensional feature space all the svr models were created using matlab r2016b https www mathworks com products new products release2016b html in this study the parameters c and ε were selected based on default parameters the radial basis function rbf kernel was selected as the kernel function the precipitation observations from 1982 to 2010 were chosen as the training dataset and the rest as the forecasting data in the training process a time series of 6 observations xl 1 xl 2 xl 6 were taken as input and the next xl 7 as the output the trained model was then used to predict future precipitations up to 8 months in advance before applying the nonlinear regression rainfall data and climate indices were preprocessed by subtracting their historical averaged values the climate index anomaly and precipitation anomaly were linked by svr 2 3 the nmme the nmme is a global climatic prediction system that incorporates multiple dynamic models kirtman et al 2014 and provides intraseasonal to seasonal to interannual isi climate forecasts globally the biggest advantage of the nmme lies in the fact that the ensemble mean of numerous models generally show better forecasting accuracy than a single dynamic model becker et al 2014 although the nmme is first developed for use in north america it provides global climate variables forecasts such as temperature and precipitation that can be used for drought and extreme events prediction eight models including 99 ensemble members table 1 were used in this study the spatial resolution of nmme is 1 1 the lead times of forecasts range from 0 5 to 11 5 months the nmme has been widely used to forecast enso sst climatic variables and hydrometeorological events barnston et al 2016 becker and van den dool 2016 larson and kirtman 2014 shukla et al 2016 yuan 2016 in this study the ensemble mean and bayesian model averaging of nmme models were used nmme em is a simple arithmetic average of multiple dynamic nmme models nmme bma employed the post processing technique to reduce the uncertainty of multi model ensemble estimates bma leamer 1978 can be used to reduce multi model overconfidence and improve out of sample predictive capability which had been used in numerous hydrologic and atmospheric applications duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 vrugt and robinson 2007 detained information of bma could be referred to hoeting et al 1999 the implementation of bma was based on the r package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in this study for the bma model the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation method gilks et al 1995 was employed to determine the weights of multiple climate models before assigning the weights a preliminary data quality analysis was conducted nasa gmao 062 012 and ncep cfsv2 were removed in seasonal precipitation prediction as they contain many missing values cmc1 cancm3 and cmc2 cancm4 were excluded in the ensemble mean model due to poor correlation between nmme models and precipitation 2 4 the hybrid model the accuracy of dynamic models may be improved with the help of statistical methods statistical climate signals weighting and nmme models can be combined to develop a statistical dynamic approach in this study statistical model nmme em and nmme bma were combined by assigning different weights based on their historical performances the weighting scheme was similar to inverse distance weighting idw specifically monthly mses of statistical and dynamic models were computed and regarded as the distances in the idw then the weights of respective models were determined by the distances with larger weights matching smaller distance the training period spanned from 1982 to 2010 and the validating period was from 2011 to 2015 the performances of statistical dynamic and hybrid models used for seasonal rainfall prediction in china were evaluated and compared based on pcc mse and mae the predictability of these models for two specific drought events namely china 2011 winter spring drought and 2013 summer drought was explored a direct presentation of the methodology used in this study was listed in fig 2 in the statistical model climate indices from noaa and cma were used for the inputs of svm nmme em and nmme bma models were constructed by ensemble mean and bma statistical and dynamic components were then weighted to form hybrid forecasts finally the sole svm model based on observations statistical climate indices model nmme em nmme bma hybrid model and individual nmme forecasts were compared overall and in specific drought events for a comparison of the prediction performance of different models three mathematical indicators including pearson s correlation coefficient mean square error mse and mean absolute error were adopted to evaluate the prediction capability the pcc measures the linear correlation between two variables x and y pearson 1895 pcc equaling to 0 denotes no correlation while 1 represents total correlation the pcc is defined as follows 3 pcc x y e xy e x e y σ x σ y where e is the expectation of a random variable and σ is the standard deviation the mse measures the quality of an estimator it is the average squared deviations between estimated values and observations the formula can be described as 4 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi is the estimated value and ŷi is the observation the mae is a measure of how close the predictions and true values or observations the formula can be expressed as 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where yi is the forecasting value and ŷi is the true value or observations n is the sample size the smaller the mae the better the prediction accuracy 3 results 3 1 overall forecast skill in the training period the observed and forecasted precipitation anomalies were exhibited in fig 3 it can be roughly seen that statistical and hybrid models were more consistent with observed precipitation anomalies than nmme em and nmme bma models for all lead times the nmme em model generally overestimates precipitation suggesting a large systematic bias although the bias can be adjusted in the nmme bma model overestimation could also be seen in some seasons some of the seasonal precipitation forecasts were shown in fig 4 generally statistical model underestimates rainfall in mam and son seasons while nmme em overestimates rainfall in nearly all seasons nmme bma estimates more rainfall in mam and djf seasons while less rainfall in jja season the hybrid model seems to be more close to observations than dynamic models in nearly all seasons the overall performances of dynamic models remain lower than statistical or hybrid models the spatial distribution of relative error re of different models for precipitation anomaly forecasts was exhibited in fig 5 the relative error was computed by differencing the forecasted values and observations and dividing by the historically monthly averaged observations for overall precipitation anomaly pa statistical and hybrid models seem to be better than nmme models nmme em and nmme bma the majority of areas in china own a below 0 5 relative error for statistical model while some areas in southern xinjiang western xizang and western neimenggu may exceed that nmme models exhibit high forecasting error in western and northern china for positive precipitation anomaly ppa the patterns of these models were similar with that in pa overall statistical and hybrid models have lower res large errors could also be seen in some areas in northwestern china in hybrid model low forecasting error shows in western sichuan and eastern xizang for negative precipitation anomaly npa the performance is much better than ppa predictions less than 0 25 relative error can be found in most parts of china in statistical model places in southern china and northern xinjiang also exhibited low error less than a fourth in hybrid model however low forecasting error can only be found in southern china in nmme models the absolute forecasting error of rainfall prediction was also calculated to map the absolute accuracy fig 6 for total precipitation anomalies the absolute error ae of rainfall forecasts in southern china is larger than that in northern areas the majority of northern areas have less than 50 mm ae in statistical or hybrid models while the ae in southern areas may reach up to 150 mm the ae in nmme models reaches 200 mm in some areas in southern china the ae of ppa forecasts is larger than that of npa less than 100 mm and 50 mm aes can be found in npa forecasts in most of the areas in southern china and northern china respectively here we compared the sole svr model khan and coulibaly 2006 six nmme models statistical climate signals weighting nmme em nmme bma and the hybrid model for seasonal rainfall predictions based on ppc and mae generally svr climate indices weighting and hybrid models owned higher pcc fig 7 and lower mae fig 8 than the others nmme bma showed better correlation with observations and lower error than six dynamic models suggesting an advantage of multi model ensembles over a single dynamic model although nmme em may seem inferior to the best dynamic model it is relatively good by averaging selected dynamic models the hybrid model improved the accuracy of nmme em and nmme bma models significantly by incorporating statistical methods 3 2 case study of 2011 china winter spring drought here the 2011 china winter spring drought was taken as an example to examine the drought prediction capability of different models from january to march mild to exceptional drought occurred in almost all over china where the mid lower reaches of yangtze river mlryr northeastern china eastern neimenggu southern xinjiang and western xizang suffered the most for 1 to 6 lead months the statistical method is the one most capable of forecasting drought fig 9 in the statistical model drought severities in the northern and western china were well predicted while the drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated for nmme models only drought in southern china was forecasted while the rainfall was highly overestimated in northern and western china in spite of this drought severity forecasted by nmme models in southern china was more consistent with observations than statistical models the hybrid model could detect drought in some areas however the performance was not as skillful as statistical model from march to may mild to severe drought still pervaded in the mlryr region western neimenggu and some areas in qinghai gansu and xinjiang fig 10 although the statistical model foresaw the drought occurrence in those areas it underestimated the severity the nmme models could not forecast the drought in most of the areas except southern china as for the hybrid model drought was underestimated in northern china and was unpredictable in northern china although the total forecasting error seemed lower than nmme models 3 3 case study of 2013 china summer drought in summer 2013 high temperature and lower than normal precipitation intensified drought rapidly in southern china http politics people com cn n 2013 0806 c70731 22467486 html nearly 6 million hectares of crops were affected and 9 5 million people were in shortage of drinking water as reported the mlryr region hunan and guizhou provinces suffered the most this summer drought began in june and largely relieved in late august due to coming rainfall the statistical model forecasted npa in large parts of china fig 11 however ppa occurred in northern and western china as shown in observations drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated in the statistical model the nmme em forecasts match well with observations in the mlryr region and northeastern china rainfall in almost all the areas in northern china was falsely predicted in the nmme bma model as for the hybrid model a compromise between statistical model and dynamic models could be expected it estimated fewer droughts in northwestern china and less rainfall in southwestern china relative to nmme models resulting in less forecasting error the hybrid model also showed below than normal rainfall in the mlryr region 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of model performance on average statistical and hybrid models are more consistent with observations with less absolute and relative errors relative to nmme models in the 2011 china drought the statistical model predicted npa well nationally although drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated nmme models could only foresee drought occurrence in southern china in 2013 china drought the nmme em forecasts performed the best in eastern china while the nmme bma model falsely detected drought occurrence in northern china the statistical model forecasted npa in the mlryr region but underestimated the severity for both drought events the hybrid model seems to seek a tradeoff between statistical and dynamic models because it is a weighted average of them based on their historical performances although the hybrid model intends to combine the strengths of statistical and dynamic models the performance was not desirable in this study the underlying reason may be attributed to the poor forecasts of dynamic model especially in northern and western areas of china actually the forecasting error in some areas was lower than both statistical and dynamic models figs 5 and 6 if statistical and dynamic models exhibited comparative performance the merging results should be better the drought mechanisms of 2011 and 2013 droughts were different here we wouldn t go into detail about the formation of drought events nationwide because different places may have different forcing factors the causes of droughts in the mlryr region were taken as an example to account for model performances in spring 2011 weaker than normal and easterly wpsh resulted in weaker monsoonal moist air from the south lu et al 2014 on the other hand the anomalous northerly wind in higher latitudes brought cold dry air to the mlryr region frequently the once in a fifty year drought occurred in spring 2011 in the mlryr region was very different from previous droughts its intrinsic mechanism was discussed and studied by many researches jin et al 2013 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in summer 2013 stronger and anomalously westerly wpsh led to continuous high temperature hovering in the mlryr region weaker than normal monsoon from south china sea also contributed to the drying air although the two drought events in the mlryr region can be explained by the atmospheric circulation anomaly other factors such as topography vegetation evapotranspiration and human activities may also influence drought development from january to may 2011 the statistical dynamic and hybrid models could all forecast the drought occurrence in the mlryr region figs 9 and 10 but the severity was underestimated more or less especially in mam season nmme models still have some difficulty in simulating sophisticated weather systems in the statistical model a few climate indices were selected among large climate signals after linear correlation the selected climate signals may well represent atmosphere ocean teleconnections but may not describe complicated interactions among multiple climatic variables other typical and relevant climate variables such as wind should also be considered in specific drought events besides how to select the most representative signals or their combinations needs further studied how much the error below a certain threshold can be used for drought prediction is an important concern in the national drought classification standard of china 0 25 seasonal pap was set as the interval between no drought mild drought and moderate drought classes therefore the one fourth relative error may be considered as the threshold for justifying model performance of drought prediction although the preparation resistance and recovery abilities for drought and flood in different places vary in this case a rough picture of areas suitable for pa ppa and npa forecasts in different models can be obtained in fig 5 specifically the statistical model is appropriate for npa forecasts in many areas of china except western neimenggu xizang and southern xinjiang the nmme models are applicable in some areas of southern china while the hybrid model is useful in southern china and northern xinjiang as for ppa forecasts all these models seem not satisfactory for regions whose water storage can support themselves for a relatively long time e g months the rainfall demands may be lower if the 0 5 seasonal pap relative error can be accepted in some areas the statistical and hybrid models can be used for drought prediction in most parts of china while the nmme models are only suitable for southern china 4 2 drought predictability and implications in this study it was found that the 2011 china winter spring drought and the 2013 summer drought events could be predicted but were underestimated in some areas to improve the accuracy regional climate variability mechanism and accurate climate simulation need to be further studied on the other hand the sample size and its distribution may also influence the forecasting error validation and assessment in the 2011 drought event the underestimation in the severity may also be due to insufficient samples to train the statistical model because exceptional drought events rarely happened in this subtropical humid area the problem of inadequate samples may be offset by refined dynamic models it is highlighted here to combine the statistical and dynamic models because both models have strengths the statistical model could capture atmosphere ocean teleconnections which may not be well simulated in regional climate patterns the dynamic models are soundly based on physical mechanisms and have advantages in simulating global climate circulations it has been validated that multi model ensembles have obvious advantages over a single dynamic model kirtman et al 2014 suggesting higher confidence in multiple climate model combination however large uncertainties still existed in some areas therefore it is encouraged to examine some new ways such as statistical dynamic model combinations ensemble of multiple statistical models and ensemble of multiple hybrid models a number of statistical or statistical dynamic models may also have great potential for drought prediction since a series of dynamic models showed the superiority this conceptual thought needs more experiments by merging state of the art statistical and dynamic models 5 conclusion this study examined a statistical model namely large scale climate signals weighting two dynamic models namely the ensemble mean and bayesian model averaging of nmme ensemble members and a hybrid model combining statistical and dynamic components for drought predictions in china the overall results demonstrated the advantage of statistical and hybrid models over weighted nmme combinations the nmme models show relatively good performance only in southern china in the 2011 china winter spring drought event the statistical model exhibited the best forecasting ability while the nmme models only forecasted the drought occurrence in southern china correctly in the 2013 china summer drought the nmme em model performed the best in eastern china especially in the mlryr region while the statistical and hybrid models falsely detected npa in some areas and underestimated the severity in the mlryr region the statistical method developed in this study can be used for npa forecasts in most parts of china based on 0 25 seasonal pap threshold the nmme models only showed desirable npa forecasts in southern china while the hybrid model also had potential for npa predictions in northern xinjiang however the forecasting ability for ppa was poor as the relative error in many areas was above the threshold for the places where water demands are not heavily relied on rainfall these models can also be applicable as shown in fig 5 with the help of statistical method the forecasting accuracy of dynamic models in northern and western china was improved figs 5 and 6 for systems that only utilize dynamic models for early drought warnings incorporating the statistical model to help capture climatic teleconnections may assist drought diagnosis besides incorporating multiple statistical approaches or multiple hybrid models was also highlighted there are some uncertainties with the rainfall dataset as they are interpolated based on station observations actually the dense rain gauge stations should be enough for 1 degree spatial resolution used in this study more accurate assessment of forecast performances in different models may need statistical or dynamic downscaling which also contains uncertainty in selection of the predictors and data availability this study examined the feasibility of large scale climate signals weighting nmme models and a combination of them for drought prediction in china which received little attention in previous studies ma et al 2015 further work should focus on how to improve the accuracy of drought prediction by utilizing state of the art statistical methods and dynamic models

7497,drought is an extreme natural disaster that can lead to huge socioeconomic losses drought prediction ahead of months is helpful for early drought warning and preparations in this study we developed a statistical model two weighted dynamic models and a statistical dynamic hybrid model for 1 6 month lead drought prediction in china specifically statistical component refers to climate signals weighting by support vector regression svr dynamic components consist of the ensemble mean em and bayesian model averaging bma of the north american multi model ensemble nmme climatic models and the hybrid part denotes a combination of statistical and dynamic components by assigning weights based on their historical performances the results indicate that the statistical and hybrid models show better rainfall predictions than nmme em and nmme bma models which have good predictability only in southern china in the 2011 china winter spring drought event the statistical model well predicted the spatial extent and severity of drought nationwide although the severity was underestimated in the mid lower reaches of yangtze river mlryr region the nmme em and nmme bma models largely overestimated rainfall in northern and western china in 2011 drought in the 2013 china summer drought the nmme em model forecasted the drought extent and severity in eastern china well while the statistical and hybrid models falsely detected negative precipitation anomaly npa in some areas model ensembles such as multiple statistical approaches multiple dynamic models or multiple hybrid models for drought predictions were highlighted these conclusions may be helpful for drought prediction and early drought warnings in china keywords drought prediction nmme statistical dynamic 1

al 2012 statistical approaches aghakouchak 2014 belayneh et al 2014 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 and dynamic statistical combinations madadgar et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 however the corresponding prediction accuracy and uncertainty are limited due to the complexity of global or regional climatic variability dai 2013 xu et al 2017 statistical forecasting methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima linear regression bayesian networks support vector regression svr belayneh et al 2014 artificial neural network ann le et al 2017 mishra and desai 2006 and deep learning are all data driven models mishra and singh 2011 these models take one or more climatic variables as inputs and the corresponding drought variables or indices as outputs the underlying physical process of meteorology soil moisture or hydrology was not well considered the data driven models concentrate more on the intrinsic property of data trying to find features or rules inside the variables through some measures such as wavelet transformation belayneh et al 2016 however in some cases it may be hard to find a general pattern of climatic variable e g precipitation because climatology or phenology is influenced by numerous factors the ann or deep learning method may capture the complexity of atmospheric phenomenon with enough neurons or hidden layers but the networks

yuan et al 2015 the north american multi model ensemble nmme system consists of many coupled climate models related to meteorological forecasting although the prediction accuracy of dynamic models may not be as high as statistical methods dynamic systems gained much popularity in the last decades because they simulate real atmosphere land ocean interaction physics it seems promising to combine statistical and dynamic models to reach a better forecasting accuracy hao et al 2016 however few of the existing studies focused on this area the potential reason may be that data driven and model driven methods are two different mechanisms it is hard to find a way to connect them and fix the uncertainty madadgar et al developed a statistical dynamic hybrid framework to forecast drought in the southwestern united states madadgar et al 2016 the statistical and dynamic parts were linked by expert advice algorithm which aimed to minimize the accumulated error in the training period to determine the weights the results showed that the prediction accuracy of dynamic models was improved by incorporating statistical methods the nmme has showed good prediction performance in some areas and received much attention in recent years the eight models including 99 ensemble members in the nmme provide climate information for global drought prediction for several months in advance the ensemble models can be weighted or averaged to obtain better accuracy some weighting schemes such as ensemble mean em ensemble median linear regression principal component regression pcr and bayesian model averaging bma are commonly used najafi and moradkhani 2015 these methods try to optimize the weights between members according to respective rules in this study we also used weighted nmme models to investigate their abilities in forecasting drought in china in recent years drought representation using standardized indices has entered a stage of rapid development in the field of remote sensing

dynamic models the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 described the methods and materials used section 3 displayed the results and section 4 discussed model performances and drought predictability section 5 concluded this study 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area this study focuses on the mainland china where annual average rainfall exhibits a declining trend from south to north fig 1 there are mainly four climate patterns in china the subtropical humid monsoon climate in southern china the temperate monsoon climate in northern china the temperate continental climate in northwestern china and the alpine climate in tibet plateau in western china the rainfall anomaly in china was found to be mainly influenced by east asian summer monsoon easm yihui and chan 2005 ei nino southern oscillation enso zhang et al 1999 west pacific subtropical high wpsh mao et al 2010 and snow cover in tibetan plateau zhang et al 2004 weaker easm stronger enso and stronger southerly wpsh would commonly lead to floods in yangtze river and southern china conversely stronger easm la nina and northerly wpsh would cause floods in northern china however a strong enso may not lead to extreme drought in northern china as many climatic variables interact with each other especially in the context of climate change wang et al 2017 the 0 5 0 5 monthly rainfall dataset http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html developed by china meteorological data service center cmdc were interpolated from 2472 rain gauge stations using thin plate spline method hutchinson 1998 the 0 5 degree rainfall dataset were interpolated by inverse distance weighting to match the center coordinates of dynamic models the rainfall grid data had been validated under strict quality control we did a correlation analysis between monthly rainfall from 824 rain gauge observations during 1980 2015 obtained from cmdc and the interpolated data from rainfall grid by inverse distance weighting the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc was 0 95 and the mean absolute error mae was 14 7 mm fig s1 the spatial distribution of monthly mae between station observations and interpolated data from 0 5 degree rainfall was also computed fig s2 although there are non ignorable errors in many areas in fact we are more concerned in large scale climate predictions the 2472 rain gauge stations can largely cover the 1 1 grids 968 grids over china in this study the precipitation anomaly percentage pap was used to represent drought severity pap is defined as the ratio of precipitation anomaly in a specific time period to the historically averaged precipitation at that time 1 pap p p p 100 where p represents the precipitation in a specific month and p denotes the historically averaged precipitation in this month specifically p is calculated as 2 p 1 n i 1 n p i where n indicates the years used i 1 2 n the classification of meteorological drought was based on national drought classification standard of china gb t 20481 2006 pap 0 25 no drought 0 5 pap 0 25 mild drought 0 7 pap 0 5 moderate drought 0 8 pap 0 7 severe drought pap 0 8 exceptional drought which is similar to spi and pdsi pap and spi were both used in china to monitor drought conditions while pdsi was seldomly used due to its high level data requirement 2 2 statistical climate signals weighting climate signals such as atmosphere ocean teleconnections can be effective predictors for regional climatic anomaly najafi et al 2012 several drought and flood events occurred in china had been found to be related to enso and la nina phenomena chan and zhou 2005 lau and weng 2001 tong et al 2006 large scale sea surface temperature sst anomalies change regional atmospheric circulation and may cause extreme climate events thus in this study a few climate indices were used as predictors to forecast rainfall in china these climate signals table s1 came from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and china meteorological administration cma specifically the first 21 climate indices were obtained from noaa and the last one namely wpsh including its area intensity ridge line and western extend was from cma besides the 72 monthly averaged circulation indices from cma http cmdp ncc cma net cn download htm were also used therefore a total of 97 climate indices were used in this study as for the weights the most four correlated climate indices were selected as independent variables based on pearson s correlation coefficient before selecting climate indices the dependent variable precipitation and independent variables climate indices were deseasonalized by using monthly time series subtracting their historically averaged values in each month we compared the selections of climate indices between correlation using the entire dataset and correlation using the data in a specific month spanning all the years as shown in fig s3 the overall distribution of selections with or without considering seasonality was different as for the climate index selections in different months fig s4 and regions fig s5 differences can also be seen clearly in this study we performed monthly precipitation forecasts by selecting climate indices monthly although this may lead to fewer samples in the regressions the selected climate indices and monthly precipitation were regressed by support vector machine svm svm first proposed by vladimir vapnik vapnik 2013 and his workers in 1992 is a machine learning method for classification and regression based on vc theory vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 vapnik and kotz 1982 and the rule of structural risk minimization support vector regression performs nonlinear regressions by incorporating kernel functions to map the input data to a high dimensional feature space all the svr models were created using matlab r2016b https www mathworks com products new products release2016b html in this study the parameters c and ε were selected based on default parameters the radial basis function rbf kernel was selected as the kernel function the precipitation observations from 1982 to 2010 were chosen as the training dataset and the rest as the forecasting data in the training process a time series of 6 observations xl 1 xl 2 xl 6 were taken as input and the next xl 7 as the output the trained model was then used to predict future precipitations up to 8 months in advance before applying the nonlinear regression rainfall data and climate indices were preprocessed by subtracting their historical averaged values the climate index anomaly and precipitation anomaly were linked by svr 2 3 the nmme the nmme is a global climatic prediction system that incorporates multiple dynamic models kirtman et al 2014 and provides intraseasonal to seasonal to interannual isi climate forecasts globally the biggest advantage of the nmme lies in the fact that the ensemble mean of numerous models generally show better forecasting accuracy than a single dynamic model becker et al 2014 although the nmme is first developed for use in north america it provides global climate variables forecasts such as temperature and precipitation that can be used for drought and extreme events prediction eight models including 99 ensemble members table 1 were used in this study the spatial resolution of nmme is 1 1 the lead times of forecasts range from 0 5 to 11 5 months the nmme has been widely used to forecast enso sst climatic variables and hydrometeorological events barnston et al 2016 becker and van den dool 2016 larson and kirtman 2014 shukla et al 2016 yuan 2016 in this study the ensemble mean and bayesian model averaging of nmme models were used nmme em is a simple arithmetic average of multiple dynamic nmme models nmme bma employed the post processing technique to reduce the uncertainty of multi model ensemble estimates bma leamer 1978 can be used to reduce multi model overconfidence and improve out of sample predictive capability which had been used in numerous hydrologic and atmospheric applications duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 vrugt and robinson 2007 detained information of bma could be referred to hoeting et al 1999 the implementation of bma was based on the r package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in this study for the bma model the markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation method gilks et al 1995 was employed to determine the weights of multiple climate models before assigning the weights a preliminary data quality analysis was conducted nasa gmao 062 012 and ncep cfsv2 were removed in seasonal precipitation prediction as they contain many missing values cmc1 cancm3 and cmc2 cancm4 were excluded in the ensemble mean model due to poor correlation between nmme models and precipitation 2 4 the hybrid model the accuracy of dynamic models may be improved with the help of statistical methods statistical climate signals weighting and nmme models can be combined to develop a statistical dynamic approach in this study statistical model nmme em and nmme bma were combined by assigning different weights based on their historical performances the weighting scheme was similar to inverse distance weighting idw specifically monthly mses of statistical and dynamic models were computed and regarded as the distances in the idw then the weights of respective models were determined by the distances with larger weights matching smaller distance the training period spanned from 1982 to 2010 and the validating period was from 2011 to 2015 the performances of statistical dynamic and hybrid models used for seasonal rainfall prediction in china were evaluated and compared based on pcc mse and mae the predictability of these models for two specific drought events namely china 2011 winter spring drought and 2013 summer drought was explored a direct presentation of the methodology used in this study was listed in fig 2 in the statistical model climate indices from noaa and cma were used for the inputs of svm nmme em and nmme bma models were constructed by ensemble mean and bma statistical and dynamic components were then weighted to form hybrid forecasts finally the sole svm model based on observations statistical climate indices model nmme em nmme bma hybrid model and individual nmme forecasts were compared overall and in specific drought events for a comparison of the prediction performance of different models three mathematical indicators including pearson s correlation coefficient mean square error mse and mean absolute error were adopted to evaluate the prediction capability the pcc measures the linear correlation between two variables x and y pearson 1895 pcc equaling to 0 denotes no correlation while 1 represents total correlation the pcc is defined as follows 3 pcc x y e xy e x e y σ x σ y where e is the expectation of a random variable and σ is the standard deviation the mse measures the quality of an estimator it is the average squared deviations between estimated values and observations the formula can be described as 4 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi is the estimated value and ŷi is the observation the mae is a measure of how close the predictions and true values or observations the formula can be expressed as 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where yi is the forecasting value and ŷi is the true value or observations n is the sample size the smaller the mae the better the prediction accuracy 3 results 3 1 overall forecast skill in the training period the observed and forecasted precipitation anomalies were exhibited in fig 3 it can be roughly seen that statistical and hybrid models were more consistent with observed precipitation anomalies than nmme em and nmme bma models for all lead times the nmme em model generally overestimates precipitation suggesting a large systematic bias although the bias can be adjusted in the nmme bma model overestimation could also be seen in some seasons some of the seasonal precipitation forecasts were shown in fig 4 generally statistical model underestimates rainfall in mam and son seasons while nmme em overestimates rainfall in nearly all seasons nmme bma estimates more rainfall in mam and djf seasons while less rainfall in jja season the hybrid model seems to be more close to observations than dynamic models in nearly all seasons the overall performances of dynamic models remain lower than statistical or hybrid models the spatial distribution of relative error re of different models for precipitation anomaly forecasts was exhibited in fig 5 the relative error was computed by differencing the forecasted values and observations and dividing by the historically monthly averaged observations for overall precipitation anomaly pa statistical and hybrid models seem to be better than nmme models nmme em and nmme bma the majority of areas in china own a below 0 5 relative error for statistical model while some areas in southern xinjiang western xizang and western neimenggu may exceed that nmme models exhibit high forecasting error in western and northern china for positive precipitation anomaly ppa the patterns of these models were similar with that in pa overall statistical and hybrid models have lower res large errors could also be seen in some areas in northwestern china in hybrid model low forecasting error shows in western sichuan and eastern xizang for negative precipitation anomaly npa the performance is much better than ppa predictions less than 0 25 relative error can be found in most parts of china in statistical model places in southern china and northern xinjiang also exhibited low error less than a fourth in hybrid model however low forecasting error can only be found in southern china in nmme models the absolute forecasting error of rainfall prediction was also calculated to map the absolute accuracy fig 6 for total precipitation anomalies the absolute error ae of rainfall forecasts in southern china is larger than that in northern areas the majority of northern areas have less than 50 mm ae in statistical or hybrid models while the ae in southern areas may reach up to 150 mm the ae in nmme models reaches 200 mm in some areas in southern china the ae of ppa forecasts is larger than that of npa less than 100 mm and 50 mm aes can be found in npa forecasts in most of the areas in southern china and northern china respectively here we compared the sole svr model khan and coulibaly 2006 six nmme models statistical climate signals weighting nmme em nmme bma and the hybrid model for seasonal rainfall predictions based on ppc and mae generally svr climate indices weighting and hybrid models owned higher pcc fig 7 and lower mae fig 8 than the others nmme bma showed better correlation with observations and lower error than six dynamic models suggesting an advantage of multi model ensembles over a single dynamic model although nmme em may seem inferior to the best dynamic model it is relatively good by averaging selected dynamic models the hybrid model improved the accuracy of nmme em and nmme bma models significantly by incorporating statistical methods 3 2 case study of 2011 china winter spring drought here the 2011 china winter spring drought was taken as an example to examine the drought prediction capability of different models from january to march mild to exceptional drought occurred in almost all over china where the mid lower reaches of yangtze river mlryr northeastern china eastern neimenggu southern xinjiang and western xizang suffered the most for 1 to 6 lead months the statistical method is the one most capable of forecasting drought fig 9 in the statistical model drought severities in the northern and western china were well predicted while the drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated for nmme models only drought in southern china was forecasted while the rainfall was highly overestimated in northern and western china in spite of this drought severity forecasted by nmme models in southern china was more consistent with observations than statistical models the hybrid model could detect drought in some areas however the performance was not as skillful as statistical model from march to may mild to severe drought still pervaded in the mlryr region western neimenggu and some areas in qinghai gansu and xinjiang fig 10 although the statistical model foresaw the drought occurrence in those areas it underestimated the severity the nmme models could not forecast the drought in most of the areas except southern china as for the hybrid model drought was underestimated in northern china and was unpredictable in northern china although the total forecasting error seemed lower than nmme models 3 3 case study of 2013 china summer drought in summer 2013 high temperature and lower than normal precipitation intensified drought rapidly in southern china http politics people com cn n 2013 0806 c70731 22467486 html nearly 6 million hectares of crops were affected and 9 5 million people were in shortage of drinking water as reported the mlryr region hunan and guizhou provinces suffered the most this summer drought began in june and largely relieved in late august due to coming rainfall the statistical model forecasted npa in large parts of china fig 11 however ppa occurred in northern and western china as shown in observations drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated in the statistical model the nmme em forecasts match well with observations in the mlryr region and northeastern china rainfall in almost all the areas in northern china was falsely predicted in the nmme bma model as for the hybrid model a compromise between statistical model and dynamic models could be expected it estimated fewer droughts in northwestern china and less rainfall in southwestern china relative to nmme models resulting in less forecasting error the hybrid model also showed below than normal rainfall in the mlryr region 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of model performance on average statistical and hybrid models are more consistent with observations with less absolute and relative errors relative to nmme models in the 2011 china drought the statistical model predicted npa well nationally although drought severity in the mlryr region was underestimated nmme models could only foresee drought occurrence in southern china in 2013 china drought the nmme em forecasts performed the best in eastern china while the nmme bma model falsely detected drought occurrence in northern china the statistical model forecasted npa in the mlryr region but underestimated the severity for both drought events the hybrid model seems to seek a tradeoff between statistical and dynamic models because it is a weighted average of them based on their historical performances although the hybrid model intends to combine the strengths of statistical and dynamic models the performance was not desirable in this study the underlying reason may be attributed to the poor forecasts of dynamic model especially in northern and western areas of china actually the forecasting error in some areas was lower than both statistical and dynamic models figs 5 and 6 if statistical and dynamic models exhibited comparative performance the merging results should be better the drought mechanisms of 2011 and 2013 droughts were different here we wouldn t go into detail about the formation of drought events nationwide because different places may have different forcing factors the causes of droughts in the mlryr region were taken as an example to account for model performances in spring 2011 weaker than normal and easterly wpsh resulted in weaker monsoonal moist air from the south lu et al 2014 on the other hand the anomalous northerly wind in higher latitudes brought cold dry air to the mlryr region frequently the once in a fifty year drought occurred in spring 2011 in the mlryr region was very different from previous droughts its intrinsic mechanism was discussed and studied by many researches jin et al 2013 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in summer 2013 stronger and anomalously westerly wpsh led to continuous high temperature hovering in the mlryr region weaker than normal monsoon from south china sea also contributed to the drying air although the two drought events in the mlryr region can be explained by the atmospheric circulation anomaly other factors such as topography vegetation evapotranspiration and human activities may also influence drought development from january to may 2011 the statistical dynamic and hybrid models could all forecast the drought occurrence in the mlryr region figs 9 and 10 but the severity was underestimated more or less especially in mam season nmme models still have some difficulty in simulating sophisticated weather systems in the statistical model a few climate indices were selected among large climate signals after linear correlation the selected climate signals may well represent atmosphere ocean teleconnections but may not describe complicated interactions among multiple climatic variables other typical and relevant climate variables such as wind should also be considered in specific drought events besides how to select the most representative signals or their combinations needs further studied how much the error below a certain threshold can be used for drought prediction is an important concern in the national drought classification standard of china 0 25 seasonal pap was set as the interval between no drought mild drought and moderate drought classes therefore the one fourth relative error may be considered as the threshold for justifying model performance of drought prediction although the preparation resistance and recovery abilities for drought and flood in different places vary in this case a rough picture of areas suitable for pa ppa and npa forecasts in different models can be obtained in fig 5 specifically the statistical model is appropriate for npa forecasts in many areas of china except western neimenggu xizang and southern xinjiang the nmme models are applicable in some areas of southern china while the hybrid model is useful in southern china and northern xinjiang as for ppa forecasts all these models seem not satisfactory for regions whose water storage can support themselves for a relatively long time e g months the rainfall demands may be lower if the 0 5 seasonal pap relative error can be accepted in some areas the statistical and hybrid models can be used for drought prediction in most parts of china while the nmme models are only suitable for southern china 4 2 drought predictability and implications in this study it was found that the 2011 china winter spring drought and the 2013 summer drought events could be predicted but were underestimated in some areas to improve the accuracy regional climate variability mechanism and accurate climate simulation need to be further studied on the other hand the sample size and its distribution may also influence the forecasting error validation and assessment in the 2011 drought event the underestimation in the severity may also be due to insufficient samples to train the statistical model because exceptional drought events rarely happened in this subtropical humid area the problem of inadequate samples may be offset by refined dynamic models it is highlighted here to combine the statistical and dynamic models because both models have strengths the statistical model could capture atmosphere ocean teleconnections which may not be well simulated in regional climate patterns the dynamic models are soundly based on physical mechanisms and have advantages in simulating global climate circulations it has been validated that multi model ensembles have obvious advantages over a single dynamic model kirtman et al 2014 suggesting higher confidence in multiple climate model combination however large uncertainties still existed in some areas therefore it is encouraged to examine some new ways such as statistical dynamic model combinations ensemble of multiple statistical models and ensemble of multiple hybrid models a number of statistical or statistical dynamic models may also have great potential for drought prediction since a series of dynamic models showed the superiority this conceptual thought needs more experiments by merging state of the art statistical and dynamic models 5 conclusion this study examined a statistical model namely large scale climate signals weighting two dynamic models namely the ensemble mean and bayesian model averaging of nmme ensemble members and a hybrid model combining statistical and dynamic components for drought predictions in china the overall results demonstrated the advantage of statistical and hybrid models over weighted nmme combinations the nmme models show relatively good performance only in southern china in the 2011 china winter spring drought event the statistical model exhibited the best forecasting ability while the nmme models only forecasted the drought occurrence in southern china correctly in the 2013 china summer drought the nmme em model performed the best in eastern china especially in the mlryr region while the statistical and hybrid models falsely detected npa in some areas and underestimated the severity in the mlryr region the statistical method developed in this study can be used for npa forecasts in most parts of china based on 0 25 seasonal pap threshold the nmme models only showed desirable npa forecasts in southern china while the hybrid model also had potential for npa predictions in northern xinjiang however the forecasting ability for ppa was poor as the relative error in many areas was above the threshold for the places where water demands are not heavily relied on rainfall these models can also be applicable as shown in fig 5 with the help of statistical method the forecasting accuracy of dynamic models in northern and western china was improved figs 5 and 6 for systems that only utilize dynamic models for early drought warnings incorporating the statistical model to help capture climatic teleconnections may assist drought diagnosis besides incorporating multiple statistical approaches or multiple hybrid models was also highlighted there are some uncertainties with the rainfall dataset as they are interpolated based on station observations actually the dense rain gauge stations should be enough for 1 degree spatial resolution used in this study more accurate assessment of forecast performances in different models may need statistical or dynamic downscaling which also contains uncertainty in selection of the predictors and data availability this study examined the feasibility of large scale climate signals weighting nmme models and a combination of them for drought prediction in china which received little attention in previous studies ma et al 2015 further work should focus on how to improve the accuracy of drought prediction by utilizing state of the art statistical methods and dynamic models

wetter conditions to understand better the mechanisms that control surface subsurface salinity exchanges during regional dry wet climate cycles we made a detailed geoelectrical study of a closed basin prairie wetland p1 in the cottonwood lake study area north dakota that is currently experiencing record wet conditions we found saline lenses of sulfate rich porewater tds 10 g l 1 contained in fine

1993 the wetland switched from a groundwater discharge to recharge function allowing salts dissolved in surface runoff to move into wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the basin however groundwater levels during this time did not decline to the elevation of the saline lenses suggesting these features formed during more extended paleo droughts and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial timescales we hypothesize a drought induced recharge mechanism that allows wetland ponds to maintain moderate salinity under semiarid climate discharge of drought derived saline

and biological investigations during the period of long term study wetlands in this complex experienced highly variable atmospheric conditions ranging from extreme drought to deluge winter 2003 the pond in wetland p1 repeatedly dried and re wetted each summer during a period of moderate to extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 before deluge conditions in 1993 caused the pond to expand to its current

distribution of porewater salinity under a typical closed basin prairie occurring over fine grained glacial till with a brackish semipermanent pond 2 determine the drivers of subsurface salinity patterns from the long term hydrological record and 3 extend current conceptual models of prairie wetland subsurface surface salinity cycling to explain the patterns we observed during wet climate

minerals in the till are smectite illite and chlorite goldhaber et al 2014 well sorted glaciofluvial deposits of clay silt sand and gravel occur in the clsa but are limited in extent excepting a

drought in the vicinity of the clsa lasted from 1988 to 1993 and was the second most extreme in duration and intensity in the 20th century winter and rosenberry 1998 record deluge beginning in july of 1993 ended the drought and marked the onset of wetter climate in the region with pre drought 1958 1987 mean annual precipitation of 447 mm rising to 505 mm in the subsequent 22 years 1993 2014 mushet et al 2015 the clsa a site of long term ecological monitoring since 1967 and long term hydrological monitoring since 1979 contains 17 wetlands across a hummocky glacial landscape with over 33 m of local topographic relief fig 1b the clsa contains an extensive network of water table monitoring wells piezometers and staff gages that the usgs monitors regularly study wetlands designated with a t have temporary or seasonal surface ponds those designated with a p have semipermanent ponds that typically persist year round except during droughts euliss et al 2014 all of the wetland ponds in the clsa have dried completely at least once during the period of long term study winter 2003 when the wetlands dry efflorescent salt crusts e g epsomite mirabolite gypsum form on the exposed substrate and vegetation communities change markedly swanson et al 2006 deflation removal by wind of surface salts from the wetland bed can be an important loss mechanism in some wetland basins depending on their morphology labaugh et al 1998 wetland p1 the focus of our study occupies a steep sloped basin at intermediate elevation in the clsa and typifies a closed basin wetland occurring over fine grained glacial till in the ppr it supports a semipermanent pond with oligosaline mg so4 type water and a long term 1967 2002 mean specific conductance of 2 1 ms cm 1 euliss et al 2014 in this study we differentiate the transient wetland pond from the wetland itself which is defined on the basis of soil type and vegetation e g van der kamp et al 2016 what was initially identified as wetland p1 in early studies e g winter and carr 1980 is actually part of a contiguous wetland that was delineated by hydric soils to include two adjacent sub basins t1 and t3 winter 2003 following the onset of record wet conditions in 1993 the ponded area of p1 expanded to merge with the surface pond of t1 the merging of the two ponds in the p1 t1 basin has persisted to present fig 1 additionally in 1995 the combined p1 t1 pond merged with the t3 pond the high storage capacity and lack of surface drainage outlets within the p1 basin have allowed it to contain surface water for most of the period of record though it has dried to expose the wetland s substrate in 1961 1974 1976 1977 1988 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 labaugh et al 1996 swanson et al 2006 the steep slopes of the p1 basin prevent

3 1 hydrological measurements to better understand how p1 responded to an extreme shift in atmospheric conditions from drought to deluge we present groundwater and pond stage data collected from 1979 to 2014 as part of the clsa s long term monitoring program mushet et al 2016 2017 water levels in the clsa are measured weekly during the open water season with permanent staff gages that are re surveyed annually and calibrated to the bathymetric low point of each wetland euliss and mushet 2011 the water level in groundwater wells is measured once every other week from april to october and once per month during the winter details on well installation and lithology can be found in winter and carr 1980 winter and rosenberry 1995 and winter 2003 on august 25 2015 we installed a temporary steel piezometer 3 29 m beneath the sediment surface in the center of p1 we developed the piezometer with pondwater and a drive rod and allowed it to recover for two days before head measurement on august 27 2015 we estimated the historic extent of the ponded area of p1 from several sources winter and rosenberry 1995 present the pond area during pre drought 1979 1988 conditions delineated by plane table survey around the date of july 26 1983 to estimate the area of transient ponding recorded during drought conditions on july 2 1992 we hand contoured an isoline corresponding to the measured pond elevation from p1 basin bathymetry we measured along our geoelectrical field survey lines section 3 2 we used georeferenced aerial photographs from the u s department of agriculture s national agriculture imagery program naip to estimate the area of the merged p1 t1 pond on july 20 2014 esri 2017 all hydrological elevation data were surveyed to a common benchmark and have been presented in numerous studies e g winter and rosenberry 1995 1998 mushet et al 2016 in 2008 light detection and ranging lidar data were collected over the entire clsa and translated into a digital elevation model dem of surface topography in order for archival well and surface water elevation data to be consistent with the dem a correction factor of 0 36 m was added to all prior elevation measurements for example prior studies report the bathymetric low point of p1 as 557 7 m whereas our study reports this elevation as 558 06 m despite this datum shift all hydrological measurements remain internally consistent and are reported in meters above the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 3 2 geoelectrical field surveys in august 2010 we collected five 8 m length 5 cm diameter cores at the p1 pond margin and adjacent uplands core geochemistry data presented in goldhaber et al 2014 using a direct push truck mounted geoprobe tool gp01 gp05 fig 1 the geoprobe electrical conductivity system collected downhole electrical conductivity ec measurements at 0 015 m intervals using a 4 point electrode array with alternating current kejr inc 2015 details the specifications of the geoprobe electrical conductivity system in august 2014 we made an underwater electrical resistivity imaging eri survey beneath the ponded area of p1 to evaluate subsurface stratigraphy and wetland porewater salinity the eri method induces direct current dc between multiple combinations of source and potential electrode pairs located along survey lines at the land surface apparent resistivity values calculated from hundreds to thousands of different electrode combinations represent the weighted average of resistivity or its inverse conductivity for earth materials along electric current flowpaths data inversion produces non unique 2d and 3d models herein termed inversion models of gridded resistivity conductivity values representing the subsurface that best explain surface measurements robinson et al 2008 we used a supersting r1 ip advanced geosciences inc with 28 electrode marine cables at 6 m spacing total survey line length was 162 m in the extended dipole dipole array configuration included in the earthimager 2d program agi 2009 we designed our configuration with a 4 m and n 6 electrode spacing where a is the spacing between both potential and current electrode pairs and n is the maximum dipole dipole separation this array configuration has a lateral resolution of 3 m a vertical resolution of approximately 1 5 m and a median depth of investigation of 35 m loke 2000 at the time of our survey the deepest portion of the wetland pond was 2 m we collected data along seven different survey transects traversing the ponded area of p1 fig 1c two survey lines overlapped in the center of p1 to form a 210 m transect a to a in fig 1c we anchored one end of the marine eri cables to the exposed wetland sediments fringing the pond shoreline and extended cables into the open water area from a rowboat ensuring lines were taut before lightly tamping into the underlying soft sediments by foot we manually recorded pond depth along the survey lines at regular intervals and used a total station beijing topcon auto level at 22 to record the relative elevation of sections of our survey lines that ran onto land we manually measured the conductivity of the pondwater using a wtw multi 3400i meter and tetracon 325 conductivity cell we inverted our eri survey data with earthimager 2d using the smooth model inversion setting with smoothness and damping factors of 10 this inversion algorithm also known as occam s inversion finds the smoothest possible model to fit the data that fits an a priori chi squared statistic agi 2009 we jointly inverted the two overlapping survey lines on the transect from a to a fig 1c to create a single merged 2d inversion since underwater eri inversions are sensitive to the specified surface water conductivity e g loke and lane 2004 we input the measured pondwater conductivity as an a priori value in all of our inversions and also inverted our data with no specified pondwater conductivity we found no substantial differences in the models generated using these two inversion approaches and present results using the measured pondwater conductivity 3 0 ms cm 1 as an upper boundary condition in the model 3 3 wetland sediment cores in march 2015 we recovered 6 sediment core profiles from the p1 basin fig 1c ranging from 0 97 to 2 10 m depths below the sediment surface to calibrate geophysical measurements directly to the physical and chemical properties of the wetland sediments we augured a hole through the ice at each location and collected a first drive for each profile using a livingstone type drive rod with a bolivia adapter a 7 cm diameter polycarbonate barrel in which the sample is stored until analysis myrbo and wright 2008 for subsequent drives at each location we used a livingstone corer with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel barrel which required extrusion in the field before wrapping in plastic film and placing in polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes for storage we collected a duplicate sediment profile in the center of p1 for core rehydration experiments section 3 4 we refrigerated the cores at 4 c and transported by van to syracuse university for laboratory analyses at syracuse university we split individual cores lengthwise and analyzed one half for bulk ec at 10 cm intervals and the other half for wet density water content organic matter content and porosity at three corresponding 2 cm intervals 0 2 cm 4 6 cm 8 10 cm using standard american society for testing and material methods astm 2010 2014 we also analyzed subsamples from the core collected in the center of p1 for grain size using a coulter ls 230 laser diffraction particle size analyzer in order to measure bulk ec of the cores we used a scintrex geopulse with a four point electrode array the geopulse measures resistance r using a commutated dc square wave we fabricated circular 7cm diameter stainless steel plates to use as current electrodes and secured one to each end of individual cores using spectra 360 conductive electrode gel to ensure good contact at the electrode sediment interface we inserted two stainless steel potential electrode leads 1 2cminto the sediment at the center of the core and maintained constant spacing between electrodes as we made measurements down the length of the core at 10 cm intervals we measured r using a 5 ma current converted r to resistivity ρ by multiplying r by the core segment s cross sectional area to length ratio a l and calculated bulk solid and fluid ec as the inverse of that measurement since ec is also a function of temperature we recorded internal core temperatures at the center of each 10 cm sampling interval using a thermocouple and corrected all bulk ec values to 10 c the average annual sediment temperature below p1 at depth using the following equation adapted from hayley et al 2007 1 σ 10 m t i 25 1 m t std 25 1 σ i where σi and σ10 are the initial bulk ec measurement and corresponding correction to 10 c in ms cm 1 respectively ti and tstd are the measured temperature and the correction temperature in this case 10 c respectively and m is the fractional change of bulk ec per degree celsius we assumed the latter to be 0 0183 based on laboratory experiments for a range of glacial sediments between 0 and 25 c hayley et al 2007 3 4 core hydration experiment we rehydrated relatively homogenous wetland mineral sediments with synthetic saline fluids in a controlled laboratory setting to build an empirical petrophysical relationship between bulk and fluid ec for this experimental study we used a duplicate core of mineral wetland sediment collected from the center of p1 at 0 90 to 1 66 m depths below the sediment water interface we segmented this 0 76 m core interval into eleven 6 7cm length core segments and measured bulk ec using a supersting r1 ip advanced geosciences inc with voltage divider and using the 4 point electrode array setup described above with current and potential electrode spacing of 6 7cm and 3cm respectively we calculated bulk ec and temperature corrected all measurements to 10 c as described above we weighed and oven dried the core segments for 24 h at 60 c then weighed again wrapped in cheesecloth and secured with string we used deionized di water and fischer scientific 99 extra pure magnesium sulfate heptahydrate or epsomite mgso4 7h2o to prepare 8 different fluid treatment levels di and 50 150 250 350 450 550 650 molal solutions of mgso4 we randomly placed core segments in individual plastic ziplock bags containing 200 ml of fluid at each treatment level with duplicates at the di 250 and 450 levels 8 levels 3 duplicates 11 total treatments we then lowered the bags into 10 gallon buckets of water until all air evacuated from the bags and sealed them with duct tape prior to complete submersion so no water from the bucket could leak into the bags we left the bags at the bottom of the buckets where they rehydrated for 10 days with treatment fluids under the hydrostatic pressure of the overlying water column 0 5 m this approach is widely used in the ceramic industry to rehydrate desiccated pottery clay we did an initial pilot experiment using a treatment fluid containing a dye tracer and found by visual inspection that the treatment fluid had penetrated to the center of the core during the rehydration process and appeared evenly distributed within the core segment after 10 days we removed core segments from treatment baths weighed them and measured bulk ec at three locations around the circumference of the core temperature correcting to 10 c as described above we then split segments into two 80 g subsamples and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for one hour we measured the fluid ec temperature corrected to 25 c of the resulting supernatant using an amber science model 4083 ec meter and with 535 545 multi purpose cell 3 5 groundwater geochemistry we obtained archival geochemical data mushet et al 2017 for select wells in the p1 t1 basin 13 14 15 16 17 20 23 25 26 for fluid ec and tds which were sampled between 1980 and 1991 using standard methods described in labaugh et al 1987 samples were analyzed for fluid ec major ions ca mg na k cl so4 and total alkalinity at the usgs national laboratory in denver using methods described by fishman and friedman 1989 or the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory using methods described by swanson et al 1988 we calculated tds as the sum of major ions and total alkalinity in august 2013 we re sampled select wells 13 14 16 17 20 for fluid ec with a peristaltic pump and measured fluid ec in the field with a wtw multi 3400i meter and tetracon 325 conductivity cell 4 results 4 1 hydrological record the pond level in wetland p1 fluctuated in response to regional dry wet meteorological cycles during the period of long term study fig 2 a b as shown by the palmer drought severity index pdsi http www ncdc noaa gov cag north dakota climate region 5 an integrated metric of drought that is a function of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and antecedent soil moisture palmer 1965 values of the pdsi above and below 4 and 4 indicate extreme wet or drought conditions respectively millett et al 2009 during initial observations 1979 1988 the p1 pond was shallow mean depth 0 7 m with annual oscillations of pond stage driven by snowmelt runoff and evapotranspiration during the open water season parkhurst et al 1998 surrounding groundwater elevations were mostly above pond stage at this time indicating groundwater discharged to the pond except in mid to late summer when drawdown driven by evapotranspiration of riparian vegetation caused water table depressions to form around the wetland that were highly variable in space and time fig 2 winter and rosenberry 1995 during an extended regional drought 1988 1993 a shallow pond mean depth 0 2 m formed in the spring or mid summer in response to snowmelt and rain events that occurred following the complete drying of the wetland in 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 fig 2a throughout the drought water levels in wells located at the margin of the wetland 13 15 17 20 23 25 26 repeatedly dropped below both the pond stage and the bathymetric low of the pond inducing a recharge gradient towards the underlying sediments figs 2c and 3 discharge gradients from marginal wells into the central pond temporarily resumed following recharge events driven by snowmelt and mid summer rain in 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 fig 3 heavy rains beginning in the july of 1993 marked the onset of a period of wetter climate in east central north dakota that has persisted to present during this time the two ponded areas of p1 and t1 expanded and merged the maximum pond depth in the basin oscillated around 2 m and reached a peak of nearly 3 m in 1999 fig 2b groundwater levels quickly responded to the onset of wet conditions with water levels in surrounding upland wells rising approximately 1 5 m above pond stage to steepen the groundwater gradient towards the center of the basin fig 2c however drawdown of the water table at the wetland margin to below pond stage still occurred in response to riparian transpiration during wet conditions fig 2c during this recent high stand of the p1 pond august 2015 we measured a vertical head gradient of 0 011 beneath the center of the wetland from a depth of 3 29 m below the sediment water interface to the pond indicating that groundwater was discharging upwards beneath the center of the wetland at this time 4 2 physical properties of wetland sediments all six sediment profiles consisted of a 0 5 m upper layer of organic rich mud overlying fine textured mineral sediments except for the core closest to the eastern shore of p1 which consisted of sand and gravel below the organic rich upper layer since a large amount of water was lost from the latter core during extrusion we omit quantitative analyses of its core segments from the following results samples from the upper 0 5 m layer of organic rich sediments n 60 had higher means and standard deviations for organic matter content 18 9 gravimetric water content 1 91 1 05 and porosity 0 60 0 12 and a lower mean for wet density 1 15 0 26 g cm 3 than the more homogenous underlying mineral sediments 7 2 0 41 0 10 0 46 0 08 1 60 0 17 g cm 3 respectively n 127 the average texture of the mineral sediments from the core we collected in the center of p1 was 6 sand 63 silt and 31 clay 4 3 geoelectrical properties of glacial sediments inversions of our eri survey data produced six 2d cross sectional models of the bulk electrical conductivity bulk ec distribution of the wetland subsurface fig 4 here we present trimmed inversion model results removing the a priori water column boundary and all model cells unconstrained by data individual 2d inversion models representing the subsurface below p1 comprised 673 704 grid cells except for the merged line of 1393 cells 4796 cells across all 6 survey transects with a total of inferred conductivity values ranging from approximately 0 5 to 3 5 ms cm 1 and individual model root mean square rms errors between 1 and 4 fig 4 independent inversion results among the lines showed consistent spatial patterns delineating a vertical transition in the subsurface from a 6 8 m upper layer of conductive fine grained wetland sediments bulk ec 1 0 ms cm 1 to lower conductivity glacial till bulk ec of 0 5 1 0 ms cm 1 at elevations between 550 and 552 m fig 4 the lower conductivity value range is in excellent agreement with prior eri surveys of dense glacial till containing pre modern porewater in the ppr 0 42 0 66 ms cm 1 in berthold et al 2004 0 75 ms cm 1 in heagle et al 2013 our measured depth of wetland sediments also agrees well with those from a similar wetland in the ppr 8 m in heagle et al 2013 as well as the expected depth of fill considering regional rates of sediment accumulation in uncultivated ppr catchments over the 12 ka following glaciation e g skagen et al 2016 the bulk ec of the organic rich core segments 1 92 0 4 ms cm 1 n 30 was higher than the underlying mineral sediments mean s d 1 5 0 2 ms cm 1 n 46 due to the higher porosity and water content of the former fig 5 a however our meter scale eri survey did not capture the thin organic surface layer due to its shallow depth 0 5 m and lack of geoelectrical contrast with the overlying pond e g loke and lane 2004 the 321 inversion grid cells positioned directly beneath the pond boundary at elevations between 557 and 559 m mean s d 1 4 0 2 ms cm 1 matched well with direct measurements of fine grained wetland sediments we recovered from our sediment cores mean s d 1 5 0 2 ms cm 1 n 46 fig 5b c the 1 m sand and gravel core not measured for bulk ec due to water loss from the easternmost location of our coring transect a to a in fig 1c agrees with the location of a lower ec zone 1 0 ms cm 1 in the upper layer of the corresponding inversion model fig 4 arndt and richardson 1993 also found a deposit of coarse textured alluvium in the subsurface of p1 which aligns with a zone of similarly low ec in our westernmost n s oriented inversion model next to the surface spillway from an adjacent wetland t3 fig 4 the most striking features in our inversion models were discrete and overlapping zones of bulk ec 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 elevated from that of the surrounding mineral sediments 1 0 2 0 ms cm 1 the mean and median values of all model grid cells within the former conductivity range were 3 0 ms cm 1 since the bulk ec of prairie wetland sediments is a direct function of porewater salinity e g heagle et al 2013 we identify these features as saline lenses taken together our 6 inversions consistently assigned 95 of all model grid cells with conductivity values of 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 to elevations between 554 and 556 m delineating the extent of two saline lenses located 2 4 m under the bathymetric low of p1 and near its western margin beneath the currently ponded area fig 4 the saline lenses are bounded by more discontinuous transitional zones of intermediate ec 2 0 2 5 ms cm 1 within the same elevation range the geoprobe produced 8 m logs of borehole ec at high depth resolution 1 5 cm beneath four upland sites gp01 gp04 and the western margin of p1 gp05 fig 6 for the most part the range of values collected by this in situ measurement method 0 1 4 4 ms cm 1 fell within the range of our model inversions 0 5 3 5 ms cm 1 borehole ec values that were lower and higher than the value range of our inversion models respectively corresponded to the upper 1 m of vadose zone in upland areas and extremely fine cm scale saline features beneath the western margin of p1 that were far beneath the vertical resolution of our eri survey 1 5 m upland borehole ec mostly oscillated between values of 0 5 and 1 2 ms cm 1 matching well with the lower geoelectrical layer of our eri survey 0 5 1 0 ms cm 1 and further confirming that the geoelectrical contrast in our inversion models between 550 and 552 m is the boundary between glacial till extending from the uplands and more conductive overlying wetland fill borehole ec of wetland sediments along the western margin of p1 gp05 identified two zones with higher ec compared to that of surrounding shallow mineral sediments and upland tills fig 6 in this area a thin 0 10 m less conductive 0 5 ms cm 1 zone occurred over the more conductive 2 5 ms cm 1 upper 1 m of wetland sediments 559 560 m both were within the elevation range where the water table fluctuated 558 561 m as inferred from co located well 17 during the period of long term study a lower elevation 552 556 m zone 4 8 m beneath the land surface had similarly high conductivity 2 5 ms cm 1 with a large conductivity peak occurring over a 0 5 m depth interval with a maximum value of 4 3 ms cm 1 at 555 8 m fig 6 this peak is notably located within the elevation range where we estimate the offshore saline lenses to occur beneath the ponded area of p1 554 556 m 4 4 relation of sediment bulk ec to porewater salinity the bulk ec of saturated wetland sediments in the ppr is a direct function of porewater ec though physical properties such as clay content and porosity influence this relationship e g waxman and smits 1968 berthold et al 2004 the bulk ec of sediment samples prior to treatment varied within a narrow range mean s d 1 5 0 2 n 11 consistent with samples from duplicate cores presented in fig 4b the bulk ec of samples treated with di water did not change substantially after treatment mean s d 1 4 0 1 n 2 whereas the bulk ec of samples treated with saline fluid increased with porewater ec least squares regression yielded a tight linear relationship r2 0 94 between bulk and fluid ec which we further constrained by 95 confidence bands to account for variability of physical properties among the different core samples fig 7 a heagle et al 2013 also developed a linear relationship between bulk and fluid ec for wetland sediments in the ppr which differs from ours in slope and intercept likely due to of site specific differences in sediment texture and lithology we used samples of groundwater ec and tds collected from wells in the p1 t1 basin from 1980 to 1991 to both validate and extend experimental results all groundwater samples were of the mg so4 or ca so4 types fluid ec has a power law relationship r2 0 93 to groundwater tds in the p1 basin fig 7b similar to that found elsewhere in the ppr heagle et al 2013 for the most part the p1 basin contains brackish groundwater with fluid ec and tds varying from around 1 5 ms cm 1 and 1 5 g l 1 respectively however two monitoring wells in the wetland 13 and 17 produced saline waters with fluid ec and tds ranging from around 10 16 ms cm 1 and 12 22 g l 1 respectively sulfate was the dominant component of groundwater salinity comprising 52 75 and 71 84 of the tds by weight in brackish and saline groundwater respectively the two wells that produced saline groundwater tds 10 g l 1 are screened within the elevation range of the saline lenses we imaged by eri beneath the ponded area and have fluid ec within the range that we independently estimated for the saline lenses using our petrophysical model fig 7 the select wells we re sampled for groundwater ec in 2013 were not substantially different from values measured from 1980 to 1991 table 1 indicating that groundwater salinity in the p1 t1 basin is extremely stable on decadal timescales consistent with the findings of berthold et al 2004 for groundwater elsewhere in the ppr we used the relationships defined in fig 7 for bulk ec vs fluid ec and fluid ec vs tds to estimate the mass of tds contained in porefluids occupying the saline lenses we contoured two areas beneath the ponded area of p1 where bulk sediment ec ranged between 2 5 and 3 5 ms cm 1 delineating a large saline lens beneath the center of the wetland basin 5850 m2 and a smaller lens beneath the southwestern portion of the currently ponded area 223 m2 fig 4 we assumed the porosity of wetland sediments to be 0 5 based on our core measurements the pore fluid ec in the saline lenses should range from approximately 10 to 23 ms cm 1 based on our re hydration experiments which corresponds to a tds range from 12 5 to 37 5 g l 1 fig 7b if we assume the bulk ec of the saline lenses can be approximated by the mean median of their combined grid cell values 3 0 ms cm 1 they would contain a fluid of 16 6 ms cm 1 with tds of 23 7 g l 1 inversion model nodes with bulk ec 2 5 ms cm 1 had a narrow range of elevations 554 556 m with a vertical resolution of 1 5 m as a conservative estimate we assumed the average thickness of saline lenses is 2 m using the full range of bulk ec values 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 we estimate that the saline lenses we imaged in the p1 wetland sediments contain from 7 59 104 to 2 28 105 kg of dissolved solids or 1 46 105 kg assuming a uniform bulk ec value of 3 0 ms cm 1 at the time of our eri survey the p1 t1 pond contained a tds load of approximately 1 69 105 kg based on measured pondwater ec 3 0 ms cm 1 and stage volume fluid ec tds relationships developed by labaugh et al 2016 therefore the saline lenses we imaged in our eri survey could store anywhere from 45 to 135 of the current pond salinity in liquid phase in the subsurface or 86 assuming a uniform bulk ec of 3 0 ms cm 1 5 discussion 5 1 influence of surface hydrology on subsurface salinity in semiarid regions discrete pockets of saline groundwater can develop in recharge areas due to mobilization and evapoconcentration of surface salts by infiltrating waters rabemanana et al 2005 massuel et al 2006 cartwright et al 2007a in our study we imaged and directly sampled saline porewater tds 10 g l 1 in the subsurface of p1 contrasting with brackish porewater tds from 1 to 10 g l 1 of surrounding wetland sediments fig 7 and uplands goldhaber et al 2014 although p1 functioned as a groundwater discharge wetland for the majority of the period of long term study evapotranspiration induced outseepage of pondwater to the shallow subsurface around the wetland margin during summer months under both wet and dry climate winter and rosenberry 1995 labaugh et al 2016 additionally complete drying of the wetland pond and associated groundwater drawdown during the moderate to extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 effectively transformed p1 into a recharge basin swanson et al 2006 to understand the surface processes that control the subsurface distribution of salinity in p1 we compared areal patterns of bulk ec from our eri survey to historic variations of pond extent fig 8 we found the saline porewaters within the sediments of p1 were localized beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland where intermittent ponding occurred during extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 fig 2 we identify the reduced area of the pond during this time by the july 1992 shoreline which corresponds to the mean pond depth during the drought 0 2 m additionally peripheral saline features around the margin of p1 align with the location of the pond shoreline in pre drought conditions 1979 1988 we identify this intermediate area by the july 1983 shoreline during this time the pond shoreline fluctuated within a large band of riparian vegetation e g bulrush cattails which later submerged and drowned in response to pond expansion in 1993 labaugh et al 1996 poiani et al 1996 although we measured a discharge gradient from the sediments beneath the bathymetric low of p1 up towards the pond during the recent high stand 0 011 in august 2015 the reduced area of the central pond became a zone of depression focused recharge e g lissey 1971 following snowmelt and rain events during the extended drought between 1988 and 1993 fig 3 during this time surface solutes in the pond concentrated within center of the basin elevating pond ec from 2 ms cm 1 in pre drought conditions to 7 ms cm 1 when the ponded area contracted labaugh et al 2016 solutes subsequently moved downward into the wetland subsurface as the wetland repeatedly dried and filled within the reduced pond area in response to seasonal cycles of evapotranspiration infiltration rainfall and surface runoff the lattermost two processes diluted the surface pond back to 2 ms cm 1 by 1992 and allowed the salt sensitive hybrid cattail typha glauca to germinate in the shallow wetland sediments swanson et al 2006 labaugh et al 2016 this manner of depression focused recharge probably constitutes the ubiquitous mechanism by which surface salinity is able to concentrate beneath the bathymetric low of discharge wetlands during droughts e g eisenlohr et al 1972 heagle et al 2013 which over the long term serves to maintain the unexpectedly low surface water salinity of closed basin wetlands under semiarid climate saline rings with porewater ec 10 ms cm 1 and abundant sulfur salts occur in the riparian fringe of prairie wetlands where evapotranspiration drives lateral outseepage from ponds into the shallow subsurface e g arndt and richardson 1989 berthold et al 2004 nachshon et al 2013 our imaging of a relict saline ring beneath the current ponded area corresponds well with the location of an evapotranspiration induced groundwater trough that often formed along the margin of p1 during late summer when the pond occupied the intermediate area fig 8 fig 11 in winter and rosenberry 1995 this study to our knowledge is the first to document a relict saline ring under an inundated portion of a prairie wetland the long term persistence of both peripheral and centrally located saline features following pond inundation and expansion 20 years is a novel finding and suggests that the location of prior pond areas may be reconstructed using geophysics where long term hydrological records are unavailable 5 2 response of groundwater levels to drought the relative position of the water table within wetland basins controls the ability of surface salts to migrate into underlying sediments sloan 1972 jolly et al 2008 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 multiple survey methods eri borehole ec groundwater sampling independently corroborate a zone of elevated porewater salinity several meters below the land surface within a narrow elevation range 554 556 m since groundwater gradients towards p1 prevail during wet times drawdown of the water table during drought must define the lower extent to which surface salts can mobilize into underlying wetland sediments to contextualize modern and prehistoric responses of the water table to drought in the p1 basin we compiled the long term record of water table elevations and borehole lithology for the wells occupying the p1 t1 lowland and two local drainage divides separating the basin from the downslope valley and uplands flanking its western and eastern margins respectively fig 9 table 1 water level maxima occurred during the recent wet period post july 1993 deluge when pondwater pooled in the basin lowlands and elevated water levels in surrounding hummocks drove groundwater to discharge towards the pond in contrast well water levels reached record minima during the 1988 1993 drought but did not decline into the hypothesized zone of salt accumulation therefore although the modern record identifies the fundamental hydrologic processes that could lead to the areal distribution of saline features we observed in the p1 basin fig 8 the saline lenses we imaged must have formed during a prior period of even more severe or extended drought when the water table dropped deeper below the wetland the last regional drought of comparable intensity and duration that could have potentially affected such a drawdown was that of the 1930s dust bowl winter and rosenberry 1998 which was not quite as severe and only slightly longer than the 1988 1993 drought thus the saline lenses must have formed at or before that time and persist in the surface on at least centennial timescales the position of the brown grey till transition provides further indirect evidence that the water table in the p1 basin maintained equilibrium levels in the geologic past at lower elevations than achieved during transient drawdowns that occurred during the 1988 1993 drought several geochemical studies of ppr till independently conclude that the thick 2 m veneer of oxidized till throughout the ppr must have formed by exposure to atmospheric oxygen over millennial timescales remenda and birks 1999 hendry et al 1986 grasby et al 2010 goldhaber et al 2011 therefore the brown grey till transition is broadly considered as an indicator of paleo water table depths that occurred under warmer and drier climate conditions in the mid to late holocene e g the altithermal period ca 7500 4000 bp hendry et al 1986 grasby et al 2010 the fact that the brown grey till transition extends below the bathymetric low of p1 throughout its basin fig 9 suggests that the recharge function observed during the 1988 1992 drought fig 3 may have been the norm on millennial timescales in the geologic past when the water table was several meters lower than present the lithology of the clsa suggests a physical mechanism by which the water table could be constrained at a lower elevation beneath the p1 basin during paleo droughts a large sinuous buried sand body extends from the uplands to the east of p1 around its southern and westerns margins and intersects with a lower elevation wetland p8 occupying the valley to the northwest fig 1d groundwater buffering by this sand lens caused p8 to show the slowest decline in pond stage of any of the clsa wetlands during the 1988 1992 drought labaugh et al 1996 winter 2003 groundwater flowpaths refract towards buried sand lenses embedded in low permeability glacial till that can act as under drains freeze and cherry 1979 p 202 to prairie wetland basins winter 2003 berthold et al 2004 the elevation of the sand lens intersecting local drainage divides bookending the p1 t1 basin coincides with the zone of salinity accumulation fig 9 this groundwater drain could further reduce the elevation of the water table below p1 during extended droughts allowing runoff that pools in the center of the basin to infiltrate to depths where we observed salinity to accumulate in the subsurface 5 3 drought induced recharge a process with implications for long term salt cycling in prairie wetlands wet climate typically enhances groundwater recharge in semiarid regions scanlon et al 2006 hayashi and farrow 2014 in the hummocky glacial landscape of the ppr depression focused recharge is an important mechanism by which runoff collecting in small depressions can overcome the warm season atmospheric moisture deficit and recharge local aquifers lissey 1971 van der kamp and hayashi 1998 berthold et al 2004 previously this process has only been considered to be important beneath wetlands in high landscape positions and not low lying closed basin wetlands where surrounding groundwater levels are higher than wetland ponds creating hydraulic barriers against basin outseepage winter 1999 hayashi et al 2016 based on the results of this study we define here drought induced recharge a process that occurs when an inland water body located in a groundwater discharge setting develops a recharge function during drought this reversal of hydrologic function allows intermittent runoff to mobilize surface salts towards the bathymetric low where they can infiltrate to the water table which can decline to some depth beneath the wetland bed in response to drought fig 10 heagle et al 2013 proposed a similar model by which closed basin wetlands recharge surface salts during drought leading to the accumulation of gypsum and saline porewaters in the shallow subsurface they also found that the portion of porewater salinity that did not precipitate as solid salts gradually moved back to the pond after re wetting 3 4 years to reach pre drawdown salinity levels by complex mixing processes that are not well understood but are thought to include diffusion bioturbation and short range advection dispersion caused by fluctuations in pond stage labaugh et al 2016 observed similar increases in the salinity of pond water in the years following the re wetting of p1 and attributed this mainly to the re dissolution of peripheral surface salts and expansion of the pond s groundwater shed here we extend prior work by showing that a portion of porewater salinity that recharges during drought i e the saline lenses remains extremely stable in the wetland subsurface under wet conditions and persists there on at least centennial timescales if not longer fig 10 interrelated hydrological and petrophysical factors can promote the long term storage of drought induced recharge in wetland sediments during droughts the vertical permeability of fine grained wetland sediments is enhanced by the oxidation of organic sediments penetration by terrestrial plant roots and formation of numerous desiccation fractures the elevation of the water table beneath the wetland necessarily controls the vertical extent of this secondary porosity therefore salinity can rapidly timescale of minutes be flushed down from the sediment surface to the water table by runoff and direct rainfall however this secondary porosity does not remain when wet times resume and the wetland sediments are once again saturated desiccation cracks swell shut and flooded roots die and decay reducing sediment permeability and leading to a hysteresis with respect to solute transport systems between wet and dry times using first order darcy calculations for average linear velocity freeze and cherry 1979 based on the vertical hydraulic gradient we measured beneath the bathymetric low of p1 during the recent high stand 0 011 in august 2015 and the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity of fine grained wetland sediments at similar depths 10 6 cm s 1 heagle et al 2013 we estimate that groundwater at 3 m depths discharges to the pond on at least centennial timescales furthermore groundwater discharge typically decreases from the margin to the center of wetlands and lakes pfannkuch and winter 1984 reducing the potential for salts beneath the central deepest part of the wetland basin to move back into the wetland pond saline lenses could also occupy stagnation zones in groundwater flow systems where flowpaths diverge e g winter 1978 when discharge gradients resume or that are beneath the zone where the shallow mixing processes discussed by heagle et al 2013 are active additionally contact of desiccated sediments with mg and na in saline recharge could promote swelling of clay rich wetland sediments and associated decreases in hydraulic conductivity levy et al 1988 shainberg et al 1988 jolly et al 1994 solutes in recharge that hydrates hydraulically disconnected stagnant micropores in dry clays during drought would be slow to diffuse back into active porespaces and discharge to the surface when wet times resume e g cartwright et al 2007b dried and fractured sediment samples consolidated and swelled when we hydrated with mgso4 treatment fluids under hydrostatic pressure during our laboratory experiments raising the bulk ec of the sample our sediment re hydration experiment may very well simulate saline lens formation in response to drought induced recharge and subsequent re wetting of the surface pond subsurface storage of dissolved and solid phase salts allows closed basin wetlands and lakes to maintain moderate surface water salinity a semiarid climate langbein 1961 heagle et al 2013 although we estimate saline lenses to comprise approximately 45 135 of the modern pond salinity this is likely only a small fraction of the total subsurface salt storage heagle et al 2013 estimated that the mass of solid phase sulfate mostly in the form of gypsum beneath a similar wetland was an order of magnitude greater than that dissolved in the surrounding porewaters while a full accounting of subsurface salt storage in the p1 basin is outside the scope of the current study it is clear that gypsum carbonates and other sulfate salts accumulate in the sediments of p1 and likely comprise a larger fraction of the total subsurface pool arndt and richardson 1989 pennock et al 2014 sulfate rich runoff that recharges through the wetland bed during drought likely reacts with calcium in the groundwater below the wetlands derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals to precipitate gypsum which is also promoted by evapoconcentration of porewater near the capillary fringe heagle et al 2013 dissolution of gypsum in wetland sediments that co precipitates during saline lens formation could buffer porewater salinity when wet times resume contributing to the long term persistence of saline porewaters in the subsurface although the saline lenses are only a fraction of the total subsurface salt storage they merit consideration as they represent salts explicitly removed from the wetland surface water cycle that remain in the mobile dissolved form in contrast sedimentary gypsum formed during droughts is not likely to be re mobilized back to the pond during wet times by the gypsum saturated groundwater that discharges into p1 from the surrounding uplands e g goldhaber et al 2014 therefore saline lenses represent important salt sinks on timescales intermediate to long term storage in the solid phase and short term storage in shallower porewaters that more easily re suspend into wetland ponds after re wetting the response of wetland and lake hydrochemistry to drought depends on hydrogeologic setting webster et al 1996 winter 2000 goldhaber et al 2016 presented a time series of surface water chemistries for 167 prairie pothole lakes and wetland ponds in stutsman and kidder counties nd comparing pre deluge 1966 1976 and post deluge 2012 2013 sampling periods they found that while in most cases increased precipitation and runoff diluted surface waters a subset of ponds and lakes showed marked increases in dissolved sulfate during the recent period of wet climate of interest to the current study inverse mass balance modeling showed that saline groundwater a sample from well 17 at clsa was used had to be mixed with atmospheric endmembers to achieve measured surface water chemistries of the ponds that gained salinity further the latter occurred over fine grained tills with thicker oxidized surface layers than those associated with cross bedded sands table 5 in goldhaber et al 2016 these data provide additional evidence that saline groundwater is stored in zones where large water table drawdowns occur during paleo droughts and has the potential to increase the surface water salinity of prairie lakes and wetlands under wet climate this work fundamentally addresses climatic and physiographic factors that control subsurface salt storage and release in palustrine wetlands within and beyond the ppr switching of wetland hydrologic function between recharge and discharge has been observed in response to annual scale variations in evapotranspiration and rainfall e g winter 1999 mclaughlin and cohen 2013 additionally saline porewaters have been measured beneath depressional wetlands located in arid and semiarid climates that are exposed to periodic or episodic flooding events e g mccarthy 2006 skrzypek et al 2013 however few studies have explicitly linked reversals of wetland hydrologic function with longer term centennial to millennial scale climate oscillations and subsurface surface salinity exchanges better understanding the interrelated factors that contribute to saline porewater formation and persistence beneath palustrine waterbodies is essential to improve conceptualizations of wetland paleohydrology and forecast the fate of freshwater resources in response to changes in climate 6 conclusions we made a detailed geoelectrical study of a closed basin prairie wetland typical of those occurring in the ppr over low permeability glacial till that is currently experiencing record wet conditions we identified saline lenses of sulfate rich porewater tds 10 g l 1 contained in fine grained wetland sediments 2 4 m beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland and within the currently ponded area along the shoreline of a prior pond stand c 1983 during the most recent drought 1988 1992 the wetland switched from a discharge to a recharge function allowing surface salts to move into wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the basin however groundwater levels during this time did not decline to the elevation of the saline lenses suggesting these features formed during more extended or severe paleo droughts and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial

modern times the cottonwood lake study area clsa is a prairie wetland complex located in stutsman county north dakota nd and has been the site of long term groundwater and surface water monitoring by the u s geological survey usgs since 1979 fig 1 we focus here on a closed basin wetland p1 with a semipermanent pond of moderate salinity in the clsa that has been the subject of numerous hydrological and biological investigations during the period of long term study wetlands in this complex experienced highly variable atmospheric conditions ranging from extreme drought to deluge winter 2003 the pond in wetland p1 repeatedly dried and re wetted each summer during a period of moderate to extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 before deluge conditions in 1993 caused the pond to expand to its current

jointly inverted the two overlapping survey lines on the transect from a to a fig 1c to create a single merged 2d inversion since underwater eri inversions are sensitive to the specified surface water conductivity e g loke and lane 2004 we input the measured pondwater conductivity as an a priori value in all of our inversions and also inverted our data with no specified pondwater conductivity we found no substantial differences in the models generated using these two inversion approaches and present results using the measured pondwater conductivity 3 0 ms cm 1 as an upper boundary condition in the model 3 3 wetland sediment cores in march 2015 we recovered 6 sediment core profiles from the p1 basin fig 1c ranging from 0 97 to 2 10 m depths below the sediment surface to calibrate geophysical measurements directly to the physical and chemical properties of the wetland sediments we augured a hole through the ice at each location and collected a first drive for each profile using a livingstone type drive rod with a bolivia adapter a 7 cm diameter polycarbonate barrel in which the sample is stored until analysis myrbo and wright 2008 for subsequent drives at each location we used a livingstone corer with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel barrel which required extrusion in the field before wrapping in plastic film and placing in polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes for storage we collected a duplicate sediment profile in the center of p1 for core rehydration experiments section 3 4 we refrigerated the cores at 4 c and transported by van to syracuse university for laboratory analyses at syracuse university we split individual cores lengthwise and analyzed one half for bulk ec at 10 cm intervals and the other half for wet density water content organic matter content and porosity at three corresponding 2 cm intervals 0 2 cm 4 6 cm 8 10 cm using standard american society for testing and material methods astm 2010 2014 we also analyzed subsamples from the core collected in the center of p1 for grain size using a coulter ls 230 laser diffraction particle size analyzer in order to measure bulk ec of the cores we used a scintrex geopulse with a four point electrode array the geopulse measures resistance r using a commutated dc square wave we fabricated circular 7cm diameter stainless steel plates to use as current electrodes and secured one to each end of individual cores using spectra 360 conductive electrode gel to ensure good contact at the electrode sediment interface we inserted two stainless steel potential electrode leads 1 2cminto the sediment at the center of the core and maintained constant spacing between electrodes as we made measurements down the length of the core at 10 cm intervals we measured r using a 5 ma current converted r to resistivity ρ by multiplying r by the core segment s cross sectional area to length ratio a l and calculated bulk solid and fluid ec as the inverse of that measurement since ec is also a function of temperature we recorded internal core temperatures at the center of each 10 cm sampling interval using a thermocouple and corrected all bulk ec values to 10 c the average annual sediment temperature below p1 at depth using the following equation adapted from hayley et al 2007 1 σ 10 m t i 25 1 m t std 25 1 σ i where σi and σ10 are the initial bulk ec measurement and corresponding correction to 10 c in ms cm 1 respectively ti and tstd are the measured temperature and the correction temperature in this case 10 c respectively and m is the fractional change of bulk ec per degree celsius we assumed the latter to be 0 0183 based on laboratory experiments for a range of glacial sediments between 0 and 25 c hayley et al 2007 3 4 core hydration experiment we rehydrated relatively homogenous wetland mineral sediments with synthetic saline fluids in a controlled laboratory setting to build an empirical petrophysical relationship between bulk and fluid ec for this experimental study we used a duplicate core of mineral wetland sediment collected from the center of p1 at 0 90 to 1 66 m depths below the sediment water interface we segmented this 0 76 m core interval into eleven 6 7cm length core segments and measured bulk ec using a supersting r1 ip advanced geosciences inc with voltage divider and using the 4 point electrode array setup described above with current and potential electrode spacing of 6 7cm and 3cm respectively we calculated bulk ec and temperature corrected all measurements to 10 c as described above we weighed and oven dried the core segments for 24 h at 60 c then weighed again wrapped in cheesecloth and secured with string we used deionized di water and fischer scientific 99 extra pure magnesium sulfate heptahydrate or epsomite mgso4 7h2o to prepare 8 different fluid treatment levels di and 50 150 250 350 450 550 650 molal solutions of mgso4 we randomly placed core segments in individual plastic ziplock bags containing 200 ml of fluid at each treatment level with duplicates at the di 250 and 450 levels 8 levels 3 duplicates 11 total treatments we then lowered the bags into 10 gallon buckets of water until all air evacuated from the bags and sealed them with duct tape prior to complete submersion so no water from the bucket could leak into the bags we left the bags at the bottom of the buckets where they rehydrated for 10 days with treatment fluids under the hydrostatic pressure of the overlying water column 0 5 m this approach is widely used in the ceramic industry to rehydrate desiccated pottery clay we did an initial pilot experiment using a treatment fluid containing a dye tracer and found by visual inspection that the treatment fluid had penetrated to the center of the core during the rehydration process and appeared evenly distributed within the core segment after 10 days we removed core segments from treatment baths weighed them and measured bulk ec at three locations around the circumference of the core temperature correcting to 10 c as described above we then split segments into two 80 g subsamples and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for one hour we measured the fluid ec temperature corrected to 25 c of the resulting supernatant using an amber science model 4083 ec meter and with 535 545 multi purpose cell 3 5 groundwater geochemistry we obtained archival geochemical data mushet et al 2017 for select wells in the p1 t1 basin 13 14 15 16 17 20 23 25 26 for fluid ec and tds which were sampled between 1980 and 1991 using standard methods described in labaugh et al 1987 samples were analyzed for fluid ec major ions ca mg na k cl so4 and total alkalinity at the usgs national laboratory in denver using methods described by fishman and friedman 1989 or the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory using methods described by swanson et al 1988 we calculated tds as the sum of major ions and total alkalinity in august 2013 we re sampled select wells 13 14 16 17 20 for fluid ec with a peristaltic pump and measured fluid ec in the field with a wtw multi 3400i meter and tetracon 325 conductivity cell 4 results 4 1 hydrological record the pond level in wetland p1 fluctuated in response to regional dry wet meteorological cycles during the period of long term study fig 2 a b as shown by the palmer drought severity index pdsi http www ncdc noaa gov cag north dakota climate region 5 an integrated metric of drought that is a function of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and antecedent soil moisture palmer 1965 values of the pdsi above and below 4 and 4 indicate extreme wet or drought conditions respectively millett et al 2009 during initial observations 1979 1988 the p1 pond was shallow mean depth 0 7 m with annual oscillations of pond stage driven by snowmelt runoff and evapotranspiration during the open water season parkhurst et al 1998 surrounding groundwater elevations were mostly above pond stage at this time indicating groundwater discharged to the pond except in mid to late summer when drawdown driven by evapotranspiration of riparian vegetation caused water table depressions to form around the wetland that were highly variable in space and time fig 2 winter and rosenberry 1995 during an extended regional drought 1988 1993 a shallow pond mean depth 0 2 m formed in the spring or mid summer in response to snowmelt and rain events that occurred following the complete drying of the wetland in 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 fig 2a throughout the drought water levels in wells located at the margin of the wetland 13 15 17 20 23 25 26 repeatedly dropped below both the pond stage and the bathymetric low of the pond inducing a recharge gradient towards the underlying sediments figs 2c and 3 discharge gradients from marginal wells into the central pond temporarily resumed following recharge events driven by snowmelt and mid summer rain in 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 fig 3 heavy rains beginning in the july of 1993 marked the onset of a period of wetter climate in east central north dakota that has persisted to present during this time the two ponded areas of p1 and t1 expanded and merged the maximum pond depth in the basin oscillated around 2 m and reached a peak of nearly 3 m in 1999 fig 2b groundwater levels quickly responded to the onset of wet conditions with water levels in surrounding upland wells rising approximately 1 5 m above pond stage to steepen the groundwater gradient towards the center of the basin fig 2c however drawdown of the water table at the wetland margin to below pond stage still occurred in response to riparian transpiration during wet conditions fig 2c during this recent high stand of the p1 pond august 2015 we measured a vertical head gradient of 0 011 beneath the center of the wetland from a depth of 3 29 m below the sediment water interface to the pond indicating that groundwater was discharging upwards beneath the center of the wetland at this time 4 2 physical properties of wetland sediments all six sediment profiles consisted of a 0 5 m upper layer of organic rich mud overlying fine textured mineral sediments except for the core closest to the eastern shore of p1 which consisted of sand and gravel below the organic rich upper layer since a large amount of water was lost from the latter core during extrusion we omit quantitative analyses of its core segments from the following results samples from the upper 0 5 m layer of organic rich sediments n 60 had higher means and standard deviations for organic matter content 18 9 gravimetric water content 1 91 1 05 and porosity 0 60 0 12 and a lower mean for wet density 1 15 0 26 g cm 3 than the more homogenous underlying mineral sediments 7 2 0 41 0 10 0 46 0 08 1 60 0 17 g cm 3 respectively n 127 the average texture of the mineral sediments from the core we collected in the center of p1 was 6 sand 63 silt and 31 clay 4 3 geoelectrical properties of glacial sediments inversions of our eri survey data produced six 2d cross sectional models of the bulk electrical conductivity bulk ec distribution of the wetland subsurface fig 4 here we present trimmed inversion model results removing the a priori water column boundary and all model cells unconstrained by data individual 2d inversion models representing the subsurface below p1 comprised 673 704 grid cells except for the merged line of 1393 cells 4796 cells across all 6 survey transects with a total of inferred conductivity values ranging from approximately 0 5 to 3 5 ms cm 1 and individual model root mean square rms errors between 1 and 4 fig 4 independent inversion results among the lines showed consistent spatial patterns delineating a vertical transition in the subsurface from a 6 8 m upper layer of conductive fine grained wetland sediments bulk ec 1 0 ms cm 1 to lower conductivity glacial till bulk ec of 0 5 1 0 ms cm 1 at elevations between 550 and 552 m fig 4 the lower conductivity value range is in excellent agreement with prior eri surveys of dense glacial till containing pre modern porewater in the ppr 0 42 0 66 ms cm 1 in berthold et al 2004 0 75 ms cm 1 in heagle et al 2013 our measured depth of wetland sediments also agrees well with those from a similar wetland in the ppr 8 m in heagle et al 2013 as well as the expected depth of fill considering regional rates of sediment accumulation in uncultivated ppr catchments over the 12 ka following glaciation e g skagen et al 2016 the bulk ec of the organic rich core segments 1 92 0 4 ms cm 1 n 30 was higher than the underlying mineral sediments mean s d 1 5 0 2 ms cm 1 n 46 due to the higher porosity and water content of the former fig 5 a however our meter scale eri survey did not capture the thin organic surface layer due to its shallow depth 0 5 m and lack of geoelectrical contrast with the overlying pond e g loke and lane 2004 the 321 inversion grid cells positioned directly beneath the pond boundary at elevations between 557 and 559 m mean s d 1 4 0 2 ms cm 1 matched well with direct measurements of fine grained wetland sediments we recovered from our sediment cores mean s d 1 5 0 2 ms cm 1 n 46 fig 5b c the 1 m sand and gravel core not measured for bulk ec due to water loss from the easternmost location of our coring transect a to a in fig 1c agrees with the location of a lower ec zone 1 0 ms cm 1 in the upper layer of the corresponding inversion model fig 4 arndt and richardson 1993 also found a deposit of coarse textured alluvium in the subsurface of p1 which aligns with a zone of similarly low ec in our westernmost n s oriented inversion model next to the surface spillway from an adjacent wetland t3 fig 4 the most striking features in our inversion models were discrete and overlapping zones of bulk ec 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 elevated from that of the surrounding mineral sediments 1 0 2 0 ms cm 1 the mean and median values of all model grid cells within the former conductivity range were 3 0 ms cm 1 since the bulk ec of prairie wetland sediments is a direct function of porewater salinity e g heagle et al 2013 we identify these features as saline lenses taken together our 6 inversions consistently assigned 95 of all model grid cells with conductivity values of 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 to elevations between 554 and 556 m delineating the extent of two saline lenses located 2 4 m under the bathymetric low of p1 and near its western margin beneath the currently ponded area fig 4 the saline lenses are bounded by more discontinuous transitional zones of intermediate ec 2 0 2 5 ms cm 1 within the same elevation range the geoprobe produced 8 m logs of borehole ec at high depth resolution 1 5 cm beneath four upland sites gp01 gp04 and the western margin of p1 gp05 fig 6 for the most part the range of values collected by this in situ measurement method 0 1 4 4 ms cm 1 fell within the range of our model inversions 0 5 3 5 ms cm 1 borehole ec values that were lower and higher than the value range of our inversion models respectively corresponded to the upper 1 m of vadose zone in upland areas and extremely fine cm scale saline features beneath the western margin of p1 that were far beneath the vertical resolution of our eri survey 1 5 m upland borehole ec mostly oscillated between values of 0 5 and 1 2 ms cm 1 matching well with the lower geoelectrical layer of our eri survey 0 5 1 0 ms cm 1 and further confirming that the geoelectrical contrast in our inversion models between 550 and 552 m is the boundary between glacial till extending from the uplands and more conductive overlying wetland fill borehole ec of wetland sediments along the western margin of p1 gp05 identified two zones with higher ec compared to that of surrounding shallow mineral sediments and upland tills fig 6 in this area a thin 0 10 m less conductive 0 5 ms cm 1 zone occurred over the more conductive 2 5 ms cm 1 upper 1 m of wetland sediments 559 560 m both were within the elevation range where the water table fluctuated 558 561 m as inferred from co located well 17 during the period of long term study a lower elevation 552 556 m zone 4 8 m beneath the land surface had similarly high conductivity 2 5 ms cm 1 with a large conductivity peak occurring over a 0 5 m depth interval with a maximum value of 4 3 ms cm 1 at 555 8 m fig 6 this peak is notably located within the elevation range where we estimate the offshore saline lenses to occur beneath the ponded area of p1 554 556 m 4 4 relation of sediment bulk ec to porewater salinity the bulk ec of saturated wetland sediments in the ppr is a direct function of porewater ec though physical properties such as clay content and porosity influence this relationship e g waxman and smits 1968 berthold et al 2004 the bulk ec of sediment samples prior to treatment varied within a narrow range mean s d 1 5 0 2 n 11 consistent with samples from duplicate cores presented in fig 4b the bulk ec of samples treated with di water did not change substantially after treatment mean s d 1 4 0 1 n 2 whereas the bulk ec of samples treated with saline fluid increased with porewater ec least squares regression yielded a tight linear relationship r2 0 94 between bulk and fluid ec which we further constrained by 95 confidence bands to account for variability of physical properties among the different core samples fig 7 a heagle et al 2013 also developed a linear relationship between bulk and fluid ec for wetland sediments in the ppr which differs from ours in slope and intercept likely due to of site specific differences in sediment texture and lithology we used samples of groundwater ec and tds collected from wells in the p1 t1 basin from 1980 to 1991 to both validate and extend experimental results all groundwater samples were of the mg so4 or ca so4 types fluid ec has a power law relationship r2 0 93 to groundwater tds in the p1 basin fig 7b similar to that found elsewhere in the ppr heagle et al 2013 for the most part the p1 basin contains brackish groundwater with fluid ec and tds varying from around 1 5 ms cm 1 and 1 5 g l 1 respectively however two monitoring wells in the wetland 13 and 17 produced saline waters with fluid ec and tds ranging from around 10 16 ms cm 1 and 12 22 g l 1 respectively sulfate was the dominant component of groundwater salinity comprising 52 75 and 71 84 of the tds by weight in brackish and saline groundwater respectively the two wells that produced saline groundwater tds 10 g l 1 are screened within the elevation range of the saline lenses we imaged by eri beneath the ponded area and have fluid ec within the range that we independently estimated for the saline lenses using our petrophysical model fig 7 the select wells we re sampled for groundwater ec in 2013 were not substantially different from values measured from 1980 to 1991 table 1 indicating that groundwater salinity in the p1 t1 basin is extremely stable on decadal timescales consistent with the findings of berthold et al 2004 for groundwater elsewhere in the ppr we used the relationships defined in fig 7 for bulk ec vs fluid ec and fluid ec vs tds to estimate the mass of tds contained in porefluids occupying the saline lenses we contoured two areas beneath the ponded area of p1 where bulk sediment ec ranged between 2 5 and 3 5 ms cm 1 delineating a large saline lens beneath the center of the wetland basin 5850 m2 and a smaller lens beneath the southwestern portion of the currently ponded area 223 m2 fig 4 we assumed the porosity of wetland sediments to be 0 5 based on our core measurements the pore fluid ec in the saline lenses should range from approximately 10 to 23 ms cm 1 based on our re hydration experiments which corresponds to a tds range from 12 5 to 37 5 g l 1 fig 7b if we assume the bulk ec of the saline lenses can be approximated by the mean median of their combined grid cell values 3 0 ms cm 1 they would contain a fluid of 16 6 ms cm 1 with tds of 23 7 g l 1 inversion model nodes with bulk ec 2 5 ms cm 1 had a narrow range of elevations 554 556 m with a vertical resolution of 1 5 m as a conservative estimate we assumed the average thickness of saline lenses is 2 m using the full range of bulk ec values 2 5 3 5 ms cm 1 we estimate that the saline lenses we imaged in the p1 wetland sediments contain from 7 59 104 to 2 28 105 kg of dissolved solids or 1 46 105 kg assuming a uniform bulk ec value of 3 0 ms cm 1 at the time of our eri survey the p1 t1 pond contained a tds load of approximately 1 69 105 kg based on measured pondwater ec 3 0 ms cm 1 and stage volume fluid ec tds relationships developed by labaugh et al 2016 therefore the saline lenses we imaged in our eri survey could store anywhere from 45 to 135 of the current pond salinity in liquid phase in the subsurface or 86 assuming a uniform bulk ec of 3 0 ms cm 1 5 discussion 5 1 influence of surface hydrology on subsurface salinity in semiarid regions discrete pockets of saline groundwater can develop in recharge areas due to mobilization and evapoconcentration of surface salts by infiltrating waters rabemanana et al 2005 massuel et al 2006 cartwright et al 2007a in our study we imaged and directly sampled saline porewater tds 10 g l 1 in the subsurface of p1 contrasting with brackish porewater tds from 1 to 10 g l 1 of surrounding wetland sediments fig 7 and uplands goldhaber et al 2014 although p1 functioned as a groundwater discharge wetland for the majority of the period of long term study evapotranspiration induced outseepage of pondwater to the shallow subsurface around the wetland margin during summer months under both wet and dry climate winter and rosenberry 1995 labaugh et al 2016 additionally complete drying of the wetland pond and associated groundwater drawdown during the moderate to extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 effectively transformed p1 into a recharge basin swanson et al 2006 to understand the surface processes that control the subsurface distribution of salinity in p1 we compared areal patterns of bulk ec from our eri survey to historic variations of pond extent fig 8 we found the saline porewaters within the sediments of p1 were localized beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland where intermittent ponding occurred during extreme drought from 1988 to 1993 fig 2 we identify the reduced area of the pond during this time by the july 1992 shoreline which corresponds to the mean pond depth during the drought 0 2 m additionally peripheral saline features around the margin of p1 align with the location of the pond shoreline in pre drought conditions 1979 1988 we identify this intermediate area by the july 1983 shoreline during this time the pond shoreline fluctuated within a large band of riparian vegetation e g bulrush cattails which later submerged and drowned in response to pond expansion in 1993 labaugh et al 1996 poiani et al 1996 although we measured a discharge gradient from the sediments beneath the bathymetric low of p1 up towards the pond during the recent high stand 0 011 in august 2015 the reduced area of the central pond became a zone of depression focused recharge e g lissey 1971 following snowmelt and rain events during the extended drought between 1988 and 1993 fig 3 during this time surface solutes in the pond concentrated within center of the basin elevating pond ec from 2 ms cm 1 in pre drought conditions to 7 ms cm 1 when the ponded area contracted labaugh et al 2016 solutes subsequently moved downward into the wetland subsurface as the wetland repeatedly dried and filled within the reduced pond area in response to seasonal cycles of evapotranspiration infiltration rainfall and surface runoff the lattermost two processes diluted the surface pond back to 2 ms cm 1 by 1992 and allowed the salt sensitive hybrid cattail typha glauca to germinate in the shallow wetland sediments swanson et al 2006 labaugh et al 2016 this manner of depression focused recharge probably constitutes the ubiquitous mechanism by which surface salinity is able to concentrate beneath the bathymetric low of discharge wetlands during droughts e g eisenlohr et al 1972 heagle et al 2013 which over the long term serves to maintain the unexpectedly low surface water salinity of closed basin wetlands under semiarid climate saline rings with porewater ec 10 ms cm 1 and abundant sulfur salts occur in the riparian fringe of prairie wetlands where evapotranspiration drives lateral outseepage from ponds into the shallow subsurface e g arndt and richardson 1989 berthold et al 2004 nachshon et al 2013 our imaging of a relict saline ring beneath the current ponded area corresponds well with the location of an evapotranspiration induced groundwater trough that often formed along the margin of p1 during late summer when the pond occupied the intermediate area fig 8 fig 11 in winter and rosenberry 1995 this study to our knowledge is the first to document a relict saline ring under an inundated portion of a prairie wetland the long term persistence of both peripheral and centrally located saline features following pond inundation and expansion 20 years is a novel finding and suggests that the location of prior pond areas may be reconstructed using geophysics where long term hydrological records are unavailable 5 2 response of groundwater levels to drought the relative position of the water table within wetland basins controls the ability of surface salts to migrate into underlying sediments sloan 1972 jolly et al 2008 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 multiple survey methods eri borehole ec groundwater sampling independently corroborate a zone of elevated porewater salinity several meters below the land surface within a narrow elevation range 554 556 m since groundwater gradients towards p1 prevail during wet times drawdown of the water table during drought must define the lower extent to which surface salts can mobilize into underlying wetland sediments to contextualize modern and prehistoric responses of the water table to drought in the p1 basin we compiled the long term record of water table elevations and borehole lithology for the wells occupying the p1 t1 lowland and two local drainage divides separating the basin from the downslope valley and uplands flanking its western and eastern margins respectively fig 9 table 1 water level maxima occurred during the recent wet period post july 1993 deluge when pondwater pooled in the basin lowlands and elevated water levels in surrounding hummocks drove groundwater to discharge towards the pond in contrast well water levels reached record minima during the 1988 1993 drought but did not decline into the hypothesized zone of salt accumulation therefore although the modern record identifies the fundamental hydrologic processes that could lead to the areal distribution of saline features we observed in the p1 basin fig 8 the saline lenses we imaged must have formed during a prior period of even more severe or extended drought when the water table dropped deeper below the wetland the last regional drought of comparable intensity and duration that could have potentially affected such a drawdown was that of the 1930s dust bowl winter and rosenberry 1998 which was not quite as severe and only slightly longer than the 1988 1993 drought thus the saline lenses must have formed at or before that time and persist in the surface on at least centennial timescales the position of the brown grey till transition provides further indirect evidence that the water table in the p1 basin maintained equilibrium levels in the geologic past at lower elevations than achieved during transient drawdowns that occurred during the 1988 1993 drought several geochemical studies of ppr till independently conclude that the thick 2 m veneer of oxidized till throughout the ppr must have formed by exposure to atmospheric oxygen over millennial timescales remenda and birks 1999 hendry et al 1986 grasby et al 2010 goldhaber et al 2011 therefore the brown grey till transition is broadly considered as an indicator of paleo water table depths that occurred under warmer and drier climate conditions in the mid to late holocene e g the altithermal period ca 7500 4000 bp hendry et al 1986 grasby et al 2010 the fact that the brown grey till transition extends below the bathymetric low of p1 throughout its basin fig 9 suggests that the recharge function observed during the 1988 1992 drought fig 3 may have been the norm on millennial timescales in the geologic past when the water table was several meters lower than present the lithology of the clsa suggests a physical mechanism by which the water table could be constrained at a lower elevation beneath the p1 basin during paleo droughts a large sinuous buried sand body extends from the uplands to the east of p1 around its southern and westerns margins and intersects with a lower elevation wetland p8 occupying the valley to the northwest fig 1d groundwater buffering by this sand lens caused p8 to show the slowest decline in pond stage of any of the clsa wetlands during the 1988 1992 drought labaugh et al 1996 winter 2003 groundwater flowpaths refract towards buried sand lenses embedded in low permeability glacial till that can act as under drains freeze and cherry 1979 p 202 to prairie wetland basins winter 2003 berthold et al 2004 the elevation of the sand lens intersecting local drainage divides bookending the p1 t1 basin coincides with the zone of salinity accumulation fig 9 this groundwater drain could further reduce the elevation of the water table below p1 during extended droughts allowing runoff that pools in the center of the basin to infiltrate to depths where we observed salinity to accumulate in the subsurface 5 3 drought induced recharge a process with implications for long term salt cycling in prairie wetlands wet climate typically enhances groundwater recharge in semiarid regions scanlon et al 2006 hayashi and farrow 2014 in the hummocky glacial landscape of the ppr depression focused recharge is an important mechanism by which runoff collecting in small depressions can overcome the warm season atmospheric moisture deficit and recharge local aquifers lissey 1971 van der kamp and hayashi 1998 berthold et al 2004 previously this process has only been considered to be important beneath wetlands in high landscape positions and not low lying closed basin wetlands where surrounding groundwater levels are higher than wetland ponds creating hydraulic barriers against basin outseepage winter 1999 hayashi et al 2016 based on the results of this study we define here drought induced recharge a process that occurs when an inland water body located in a groundwater discharge setting develops a recharge function during drought this reversal of hydrologic function allows intermittent runoff to mobilize surface salts towards the bathymetric low where they can infiltrate to the water table which can decline to some depth beneath the wetland bed in response to drought fig 10 heagle et al 2013 proposed a similar model by which closed basin wetlands recharge surface salts during drought leading to the accumulation of gypsum and saline porewaters in the shallow subsurface they also found that the portion of porewater salinity that did not precipitate as solid salts gradually moved back to the pond after re wetting 3 4 years to reach pre drawdown salinity levels by complex mixing processes that are not well understood but are thought to include diffusion bioturbation and short range advection dispersion caused by fluctuations in pond stage labaugh et al 2016 observed similar increases in the salinity of pond water in the years following the re wetting of p1 and attributed this mainly to the re dissolution of peripheral surface salts and expansion of the pond s groundwater shed here we extend prior work by showing that a portion of porewater salinity that recharges during drought i e the saline lenses remains extremely stable in the wetland subsurface under wet conditions and persists there on at least centennial timescales if not longer fig 10 interrelated hydrological and petrophysical factors can promote the long term storage of drought induced recharge in wetland sediments during droughts the vertical permeability of fine grained wetland sediments is enhanced by the oxidation of organic sediments penetration by terrestrial plant roots and formation of numerous desiccation fractures the elevation of the water table beneath the wetland necessarily controls the vertical extent of this secondary porosity therefore salinity can rapidly timescale of minutes be flushed down from the sediment surface to the water table by runoff and direct rainfall however this secondary porosity does not remain when wet times resume and the wetland sediments are once again saturated desiccation cracks swell shut and flooded roots die and decay reducing sediment permeability and leading to a hysteresis with respect to solute transport systems between wet and dry times using first order darcy calculations for average linear velocity freeze and cherry 1979 based on the vertical hydraulic gradient we measured beneath the bathymetric low of p1 during the recent high stand 0 011 in august 2015 and the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity of fine grained wetland sediments at similar depths 10 6 cm s 1 heagle et al 2013 we estimate that groundwater at 3 m depths discharges to the pond on at least centennial timescales furthermore groundwater discharge typically decreases from the margin to the center of wetlands and lakes pfannkuch and winter 1984 reducing the potential for salts beneath the central deepest part of the wetland basin to move back into the wetland pond saline lenses could also occupy stagnation zones in groundwater flow systems where flowpaths diverge e g winter 1978 when discharge gradients resume or that are beneath the zone where the shallow mixing processes discussed by heagle et al 2013 are active additionally contact of desiccated sediments with mg and na in saline recharge could promote swelling of clay rich wetland sediments and associated decreases in hydraulic conductivity levy et al 1988 shainberg et al 1988 jolly et al 1994 solutes in recharge that hydrates hydraulically disconnected stagnant micropores in dry clays during drought would be slow to diffuse back into active porespaces and discharge to the surface when wet times resume e g cartwright et al 2007b dried and fractured sediment samples consolidated and swelled when we hydrated with mgso4 treatment fluids under hydrostatic pressure during our laboratory experiments raising the bulk ec of the sample our sediment re hydration experiment may very well simulate saline lens formation in response to drought induced recharge and subsequent re wetting of the surface pond subsurface storage of dissolved and solid phase salts allows closed basin wetlands and lakes to maintain moderate surface water salinity a semiarid climate langbein 1961 heagle et al 2013 although we estimate saline lenses to comprise approximately 45 135 of the modern pond salinity this is likely only a small fraction of the total subsurface salt storage heagle et al 2013 estimated that the mass of solid phase sulfate mostly in the form of gypsum beneath a similar wetland was an order of magnitude greater than that dissolved in the surrounding porewaters while a full accounting of subsurface salt storage in the p1 basin is outside the scope of the current study it is clear that gypsum carbonates and other sulfate salts accumulate in the sediments of p1 and likely comprise a larger fraction of the total subsurface pool arndt and richardson 1989 pennock et al 2014 sulfate rich runoff that recharges through the wetland bed during drought likely reacts with calcium in the groundwater below the wetlands derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals to precipitate gypsum which is also promoted by evapoconcentration of porewater near the capillary fringe heagle et al 2013 dissolution of gypsum in wetland sediments that co precipitates during saline lens formation could buffer porewater salinity when wet times resume contributing to the long term persistence of saline porewaters in the subsurface although the saline lenses are only a fraction of the total subsurface salt storage they merit consideration as they represent salts explicitly removed from the wetland surface water cycle that remain in the mobile dissolved form in contrast sedimentary gypsum formed during droughts is not likely to be re mobilized back to the pond during wet times by the gypsum saturated groundwater that discharges into p1 from the surrounding uplands e g goldhaber et al 2014 therefore saline lenses represent important salt sinks on timescales intermediate to long term storage in the solid phase and short term storage in shallower porewaters that more easily re suspend into wetland ponds after re wetting the response of wetland and lake hydrochemistry to drought depends on hydrogeologic setting webster et al 1996 winter 2000 goldhaber et al 2016 presented a time series of surface water chemistries for 167 prairie pothole lakes and wetland ponds in stutsman and kidder counties nd comparing pre deluge 1966 1976 and post deluge 2012 2013 sampling periods they found that while in most cases increased precipitation and runoff diluted surface waters a subset of ponds and lakes showed marked increases in dissolved sulfate during the recent period of wet climate of interest to the current study inverse mass balance modeling showed that saline groundwater a sample from well 17 at clsa was used had to be mixed with atmospheric endmembers to achieve measured surface water chemistries of the ponds that gained salinity further the latter occurred over fine grained tills with thicker oxidized surface layers than those associated with cross bedded sands table 5 in goldhaber et al 2016 these data provide additional evidence that saline groundwater is stored in zones where large water table drawdowns occur during paleo droughts and has the potential to increase the surface water salinity of prairie lakes and wetlands under wet climate this work fundamentally addresses climatic and physiographic factors that control subsurface salt storage and release in palustrine wetlands within and beyond the ppr switching of wetland hydrologic function between recharge and discharge has been observed in response to annual scale variations in evapotranspiration and rainfall e g winter 1999 mclaughlin and cohen 2013 additionally saline porewaters have been measured beneath depressional wetlands located in arid and semiarid climates that are exposed to periodic or episodic flooding events e g mccarthy 2006 skrzypek et al 2013 however few studies have explicitly linked reversals of wetland hydrologic function with longer term centennial to millennial scale climate oscillations and subsurface surface salinity exchanges better understanding the interrelated factors that contribute to saline porewater formation and persistence beneath palustrine waterbodies is essential to improve conceptualizations of wetland paleohydrology and forecast the fate of freshwater resources in response to changes in climate 6 conclusions we made a detailed geoelectrical study of a closed basin prairie wetland typical of those occurring in the ppr over low permeability glacial till that is currently experiencing record wet conditions we identified saline lenses of sulfate rich porewater tds 10 g l 1 contained in fine grained wetland sediments 2 4 m beneath the bathymetric low of the wetland and within the currently ponded area along the shoreline of a prior pond stand c 1983 during the most recent drought 1988 1992 the wetland switched from a discharge to a recharge function allowing surface salts to move into wetland sediments beneath the bathymetric low of the basin however groundwater levels during this time did not decline to the elevation of the saline lenses suggesting these features formed during more extended or severe paleo droughts and are stable in the subsurface on at least centennial timescales we hypothesize a drought induced recharge mechanism that allows wetland ponds to maintain moderate salinity under semiarid climate drought derived saline groundwater has the potential to increase the salinity of wetland ponds during wet climate acknowledgements this work would not have been possible without the support of syracuse university and the national science foundation award

7499,this article examines impacts of infrastructure development and climate variability on economic outcomes for the amu darya basin in central asia it aims to identify the most economically productive mix of expanded reservoir storage for economic benefit sharing to occur in which economic welfare of all riparians is improved policies examined include four combinations of storage infrastructure for each of two climate futures an empirical optimization model is developed and applied to identify opportunities for improving the welfare of tajikistan uzbekistan afghanistan and turkmenistan the analysis 1 characterizes politically constrained and economically optimized water use patterns for these combinations of expanded reservoir storage capacity 2 describes pareto improving packages of expanded storage capacity that could raise economic welfare for all four riparians and accounts for impacts for each of two climate scenarios results indicate that a combination of targeted water storage infrastructure and efficient water allocation could produce outcomes for which the discounted net present value of benefits are favorable for each riparian results identify a framework to provide economic motivation for all riparians to cooperate through development of water storage infrastructure our findings illustrate the principle that development of water infrastructure can expand the negotiation space by which all communities can gain economic benefits in the face of limited water supply still despite our optimistic findings patient and deliberate negotiation will be required to transform potential improvements into actual gains keywords benefit sharing integrated basin scale analysis central asia amu darya 1 background successful methods to negotiate transboundary water conflicts remains high on the international policy agenda the search for these methods is elevated in the face of fluctuating food prices population growth increased needs for water use efficiency growing water scarcity and the need to feed a un forecasted 9 7 billion by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs 2015 the connection among water food and energy security is complex methods to design efficient equitable and sustainable policies that respect that nexus face numerous challenges allan et al 2015 climate variability growing population droughts and floods elevate water conflict in many regions rosegrant and cline 2003 still there are well recognized benefits of basin scale cooperation in financing development and sharing use that could accrue to all nations serving to motivate all to share the development and use of a basin s water the extent to which cooperation can occur turns on each party s belief of the added benefits it can secure from cooperation sadoff and grey 2005 compared to acting in isolation the world bank 2015 in transboundary basins each community calculates the benefits of acting alone compared to the benefits of various cooperation strategies granit et al 2012 madani 2010 a pareto improving transboundary water management plan will find a negotiation space in which all parties can be made better off with rather than without the plan madani 2010 teasley and mckinney 2011 the challenges posed by the difficulties of effective cooperation in the face of potential conflict in water scarce basins take on compelling significance for countries drained by the amu darya basin in central asia hereafter the basin the basin encompasses four republics of the former soviet union kyrgyzstan tangentially tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and afghanistan fig 1 among those countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan and afghanistan are the poorest in which more than half the population subsists beneath the poverty line defined as less than 1 90 daily per capita income in 2015 prices world bank 2015 water carries special hydrologic economic and political significance for the basin wegerich 2008 the lack of a consensus based water sharing framework to guide cooperation among the basin s riparians has produced few institutional mechanisms to guide the management of the basin s water supplies and use sadoff and grey refer to such institutional mechanisms as modes of cooperation sadoff and grey 2005 despite their innovative and celebrated insights they acknowledge the considerable logistical cultural and inertia challenges facing diplomatic arrangements that would design apply and sustain those mechanisms an empirical integrated river basin scale framework to inform management and policy choices could supply the foundation for organizing such modes of cooperation cai et al 2003a heinz et al 2007 a rigorous quantitative framework for assessing the effects of various proposed modes of cooperation would guide the search for greater efficiency and resilience in sharing water related benefits among spatially diverse users and uses in the face of unknowable future water supplies griffin and chang 1991 the typical river basin consists of a number of water related activities including water storage diversion seepage distribution pumping evaporation and use basin scale analysis is the acknowledged state of the arts approach to provide a comprehensive framework for informing management and policy decisions cai et al 2003a moy et al 1986 such an informed policy could produce an efficient just and lasting allocation of economic benefits and costs related to water resource interventions rogers et al 2002 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 despite the practical benefits of integrated analysis little basin scale work has been conducted to date for this basin identifying pareto improving interventions in which each riparian could secure economic gains however some previous work has been published for example a 2005 work described principles of optimization of long term water supplies that account for ecological impacts schlüter et al 2005 an earlier study on water sharing in central asia developed and implemented a model of water supply and demand for the entire aral sea basin including both the amu darya and syr darya basins raskin et al 1992 some studies have examined water allocation economic improvement potentials in the basin cai et al 2003b jalilov et al 2013a jalilov et al 2016 for example examined irrigation water management in aral sea basin glantz 2005 conducted a comprehensive analysis of the water climate environment demographic situation in central asia wegerich 2008 characterized several connections between water used for energy and production agriculture schlüter and pähle 2011 analyzed institutional resilience in the face of interdependent economic and ecological constraints in the basin still an empirical foundation for the modes of cooperation described by sadoff and grey 2005 remains elusive that is most of the existing literature has seen little rigorous quantitative analysis to guide discovery of the kinds of integrated programs that could improve economic welfare of all riparians that share the waters of a transboundary basin welfare improvement for all riparians is an ambitious goal however the concept of a pareto improvement could be a guide such a pareto improvement represents a change from the status quo business as usual for which a program treaty policy or management plan makes at least one community better off while making none worse off habteyes et al 2015 pitafi and roumasset 2009 rogers 1993 stavins et al 2003 yapo et al 1998 it has been recognized for some time that the search for welfare improving water policies can be enhanced through integrated basin scale analysis that combines the disciplines of hydrology agronomy and economics maass et al 1962 basin scale analysis has seen much development since us federal funding for the tennessee valley authority began in the 1930 s straffin and heaney 1981 two of the more celebrated examples of published basin scale optimization modelling work include cai 2008 duckstein and opricovic 1980 despite extensive published research in basin scale analysis we are unaware of any analysis for the amu darya basin that describes the methods to discover and expand a negotiation space jennings et al 2001 in which all communities can achieve a benefit sharing outcome to address their resource problems of quality quantity timing or location these resource problems include those associated with water food and energy demands for which resource endowments vary widely among the four basin countries of tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and afghanistan this paper addresses that gap above by presenting a basin scale analysis of the amu darya basin that seeks and finds a negotiation space in which all parties could be better off than under status quo development and management of the basin s water and storage infrastructure our work examines alternative measures to expand water storage capacity while also efficiently allocating water stored over time location and use to guide discovery of a pareto improving development and use of energy water and food for the basin its intent is to inform ongoing policy debates for discovering measures to improve economic welfare for all countries in a transboundary basin in which each country s welfare is vulnerable to impacts on its water energy and food security from droughts and climate variability we conduct our search for a pareto improving mix of programs by measuring whether or not the discounted net present value dnpv of each proposed intervention is greater than or equal to zero for all communities for both a normal and dry climate in which costs include both financing development as well as opportunity costs of the water itself our analysis achieves this by measuring dnpv for the sum of hydroelectric power and irrigated agriculture in future work as better quality data become available we hope to incorporate physical and economic dimensions of urban water supply as well as key water related ecological assets our study achieves these aims by investigating proposed developments of new storage capacity in the basin if developed two new storage facilities investigated are the dastijum dam on the pyanj river and the rogun dam on the vakhsh river fig 1 and fig 3 there have been numerous widely publicized political debates for years over the rogun dam for which tajikistan s development aims are to secure large scale and strategically important energy benefits granit et al 2012 much of the debate has occurred in the political arena despite much debate there has been little rigorous peer reviewed research conducted that has investigated the level or distribution of economic benefits among the countries associated with that additional storage provided by the rogun dam if developed in addition to proposals for additional storage from rogun another enhancement of storage capacity sometimes labeled as the dastijum dam has been proposed by tajikistan strong development of hydropower in the mekong amazon and nile basins suggests that unilateral moves by tajikistan to build the rogun dam or tajikistan and afghanistan for the dastijum dam are also possible based on foreign capital investments grumbine et al 2012 this journal has published several recent papers establishing an approach that address basin scale challenges similar to ours which included integrations of economics hydrology policy and diplomacy chen et al 2017 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 lobanova et al 2017 wang et al 2017 one version of that proposal would be built on the international border of afghanistan and tajikistan fig 1 and fig 3 dastijum if built and operated could secure energy and some agricultural benefits for both countries as is the case with the rogun dam little peer reviewed research has been conducted out to assess the contribution of the dastijum dam regarding to economic efficiency equity or sustainability to any of the basin s countries the contribution of the present research over earlier similar work e g jalilov et al 2016 comes from the investigation of several combinations of storage capacity expansions and operation plans rather than addition of a single proposed reservoir in isolation jalilov et al 2013a b 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area the amu darya river the river is the largest in central asia both in length and discharge glantz 2005 with a river length of 2540 km wegerich 2004 and a recent average annual supply of about 73 6 cubic km spoor and krutov 2003 the mainstem river is supplied by the confluence of two main tributaries the vakhsh and pyanj rivers fig 1 the basin drained by the river terminates in the aral sea which has undergone a considerable shrinking since the 1970s micklin 2007 water users in afghanistan turkmenistan tajikistan and uzbekistan share the basin s supplies the basin includes about 309 000 km2 wegerich 2008 and is home to 55 million central intelligence agency 2011 on route from the headwaters to the aral sea the river borders or drains these four countries most of the basin occupies a steppe climate too dry to support forests but insufficiently dry to be a true desert this climate condition combined with fertile soils give rise to heavy water demands to support crop irrigation spoor and krutov 2003 for this reason there have been considerable policy debates in the basin for years on the best ways to manage water for its many competing uses wegerich 2007 there have also been numerous debates over measures needed to develop new irrigation lands to produces economic benefits for domestic food security as well as for export varis 2014 2 2 basin scale framework our basin scale analysis treats the entire basin as an integrated manageable unit the integrated approach brings the region s hydrology economics and institutions within a unified framework for policy analysis integrated basin analysis has been discussed for many years and in many places for example rosegrant et al 2000 fig 2 presents the data we used summarizing mean water supply by source month and water supply scenario ours is a mathematical model of a river basin system i e a mathematical description of the system using parameters variables and equations described in appendix a our model helps explain this basin and is used to investigate effects of various components and to make predictions about system and human behavior especially predictions resulting from policies not yet enacted the model begins with the basic water supply which includes all major tributaries fig 3 stochastic supplies are based on the historical mean and variance of annual discharges of the basin s water inflows based on a 50 year period of record haddeland et al 2011 our analysis integrates the hydrology agronomy economics and policy choices at the basin level in terms of economic values contributed the two most important water users are irrigated agriculture and the potential for hydropower production for which that hydropower remains unrealized to date that hydropower remains undeveloped to date in part because of difficulties of affected countries in successfully hammering out a lasting water sharing agreement smaller amounts of water are also used in the basin to support key ecological assets supplied by streams reservoirs and wetlands martius et al 2009 combined with high demands for food production met by heavy water demands by crop irrigation this basin faces a classic challenge in the design of policy to weave a fine line among energy food and water that challenge is elevated by the complex interdependent energy food water nexus with acceptable and sustainable flexibility in the face of future uncertain supplies nohara et al 2006 each of the four proposed water programs considered in this paper would likely incur environmental costs however a lack of reliable data on these environmental costs unique to this region precludes their inclusion in our framework we hope to be able to secure better data on key water related ecological assets and their economic values and economic costs for future work the model takes into account the economic importance of irrigated agriculture in the four basin countries as well as the potential for energy production in the headwater region of both tajikistan and afghanistan we define total benefits by water supply scenario as tb sp u t m ab utmsp r t m eb rtmsp where abutmsp is agricultural benefits at node u year t month m scenario s and policy p ebrtmsp is energy benefits at reservoir r for the same remaining subscripts we formulated the model as a dynamic optimization for which the goal is to maximize a single objective function subject to a number of hydrologic economic equity sustainability and institutional constraints the optimized objective is the discounted net present value of the basin s water development and use over a 20 year analysis the model predicts the patterns of crop output land use hydroelectric power production reservoir levels and water use by country use season and year while achieving that constrained maximization results from each water supply scenario and each policy choice require a separate model run sadoff and grey 2005 that constraint requires a workable policy to be pareto improving compared to the status quo a pareto improvement is required by our model for each of the downstream countries with the additional storage developments and operation compared to without that added storage and management that is the analysis seeks a water development and use plan that could promote and sustain cooperation rather than conflict by sharing the benefits of development 2 3 data table 1 shows assumptions on design characteristics used for each of two storage reservoirs used for our analysis it shows reservoir capacity and hydroelectric power potential included are reservoir height hydraulic head maximum volume surface area depth hydropower capacity power prices and estimated construction costs water supply is stochastic and is characterized by two scenarios base and dry the dry scenario reflects progressive global warming that according to some investigators continues to affect central asia kohler et al 2016 an increase of up to 1 2 c in surface temperature has been recorded in the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan over the past 70 years this trend may continue as under likely climate change scenarios for the region average temperatures are predicted to increase by 1 3 c by 2050 climate change scenarios also forecast reduced precipitation in the southern parts of the region kohler et al 2016 for these reasons we specified a dry scenario in which the volume of water flow from amu darya reaches an average of 50 of its historical level average historical annual water discharge of amu darya river in the base year is just over 70 cubic kilometers and is set to half that much for the dry scenario the base mean water supply reflects historical mean water discharge from inside the basin while the dry supply scenario is a simple 50 supply reduction compared to the base level a simple 50 of base supply is likely too extreme to reflect impacts of a future climate drying despite its simplicity we selected that level to establish an upper bound on reductions likely to occur in the face of a dry future climate the main tributaries of amu darya the pyanj and vakhsh rivers constitute 49 and 30 of total mainstem s flow respectively four other tributaries kunduz kafirnigan surkhandarya and sherabad contribute on average about 21 of that mainstem s flow unece 2007 table 2 presents data on agriculture by country crop and season irrigated lands in tajikistan and afghanistan receive water supply from the vakhsh and pyanj rivers each country s most important agricultural production occurs from three crops cotton wheat and vegetables the climate of central asia typically permits two cropping seasons per year crop prices are sensitive to total production levels in which the price of each crop falls and food security correspondingly grows with increased output reflecting additional consumer surplus and greater food security from reduced prices as it relates to food security consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is prepared to pay and the actual price they pay if a consumer is willing to pay more than the current price they secure more benefit from the purchased food than they pay out in expenditures food is a good example of a service with a high consumer surplus especially in communities that face a risk of food insecurity as seen in periods of famine people will pay high prices for food when it is scarce as they require it to survive the difference in the price that they are prepared to pay if necessary and the amount actually charged is their consumer surplus consumer surplus is an important factor guiding the design of agricultural and water resources policy especially when water policies can be designed to reduce food scarcity as well as associated water scarcity butt et al 2005 crop prices depend on crop supply not known in advance so these prices are an outcome of the model s constrained optimization that model optimization both influences and is affected by the allocation of water among crops and countries under all infrastructure development and water supply alternatives for that reason both the hydrologic and policy scenarios affect crop prices for a classic demand function price depends on production the prices we used are based on published prices and published price elasticities combined with a linear demand price response at historically observed prices and production levels griffin and chang 1991 local estimates of crop price elasticities of demand for central asia were unavailable we turned to data from the outside of the region to check the sensitivity of these elasticities transferred from an outside study area to our target area we raised and lowered price elasticity by 20 to check their impact on discounted net present value that impact was less than 0 3 the integrated analysis treats the basin as a single unit its unique approach lies in bringing the basin s hydrology and economics into a single framework for policy analysis the model starts with the basic water supply including flows from all major tributaries that basic water supply represents the contribution of all water sources in the basin the model integrates the hydrology agronomy economics and policy choices at the basin level it also accounts for the political and economic importance of irrigated agriculture in the basin s four countries in addition to the potential for energy production from constructed hydroelectric storage reservoirs in two headwater regions of the basin using long term data on the basin s energy potential water supplies land area and crop water use total economic welfare in the basin was analyzed for a time horizon of 20 years the model was set up to maximize discounted net present value of the algebraic sum of power and irrigation economic benefits over 20 year forecast period constrained by available water supplies and potential storage infrastructure we assumed that water resource planners have perfect foresight to plan for and adapt to stochastic inflows moy et al 1986 our analysis contains a separate constrained optimization for each combination of two water supply scenarios and four infrastructure developments for eight model runs in total we developed this model and its documentation for application to the amu darya basin and to the two potential storage reservoirs described however is adaptable to the hydrology land use patterns economics and institutions of any basin the main principle underlying the hydrology model is mass balance both for surface flows reservoir storage levels and use patterns model code is written to constrain total benefits to exceed total costs including financial costs and opportunity costs of water use displaced for each country and for each of the alternatives with the new reservoir s compared to the base condition without reservoirs groundwater was not explicitly addressed in our work khan and hanjra 2009 1 for the pakistan case when water schemes work badly growers often switch towards groundwater pumping then because of financial impacts surface systems degrade and control of groundwater extractions becomes difficult 1 2 4 economics economic benefits from water come by its contribution to support crop production in places where food security has already been achieved water used for hydropower typically produces a higher commercial value than water used for irrigated agriculture a higher value of water used for hydropower occurs because of power s higher price lower variable costs and smaller water consumption compared to water use by irrigated agriculture however in conditions where food security is at risk water used for crop irrigation can temporarily take on a higher value than for hydropower because of elevated crop prices which leads to a higher marginal economic value of water in agriculture ward and michelsen 2002 data were assembled on observed crop water use as well as cropping patterns by country crop and season farm production details included crop prices cost of production and crop yields net profitability per hectare as well as total observed land in production by country crop and season came from published data sources for the baseline scenario described above profitability for any single crop per unit land was measured as crop price multiplied by yield minus average costs of production per unit land salman et al 2014 we specified equations for each of the two reservoirs water storage volume based on starting storage inflows and outflows the model used information shown in table 1 equations tracked water storage by month year water supply scenario and policy each reservoir s water storage equals its storage in the previous month minus release plus inflow into the reservoir from upstream sources appendix a greater quantities of electric power come from releasing a given outflow of water when there is a higher elevation hydraulic head a higher storage volume of water in a given reservoir means that a given volume released from the reservoir falls a greater distance and reaches a greater velocity when spinning the turbines turbines convert the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy and then into electric power the hydraulic head for each reservoir s dam varies by month year scenario and policy the model predicted that head as it was unknown in advance energy benefits were measured as the quantity of energy produced multiplied by the estimated price of energy equal to us 0 04 per kwh constant for all months years scenarios and policies optimized energy production is also unknown in advance in principle power production depends on the head over which water falls to turn the turbines reservoir water released gravity and a coefficient representing the technical efficiency of turbines by which falling water is converted to power the model of energy production closely reproduced maximum energy capacity of the rogun and dastijum reservoirs used in most of the recently published planning documents for each crop a single demand function for the basin is specified as a declining price that is a function of total production in the basin this reflects a price dependent linear demand function model validation is important for credibility when the optimization model is constrained to reproduce base water supply water use and crop production and price levels the model approximately reproduces historical calculated farm income by irrigated area the base condition has no reservoirs so direct validation of reservoir operation and its economic value against historical conditions was not possible 2 5 programs investigated our investigation examined programs that could bring more agricultural and energy benefits to the four countries sharing the basin s waters accordingly we examined the building of one or two dams on main tributaries of amu darya 1 the dastijum dam on the pyanj river and 2 the rogun dam on the vakhsh river fig 3 because of geographic placement of those dams and location on those rivers each dam has the potential to influence economic benefits in a unique way the dastijum dam would be located on the pyanj a natural border between afghanistan and tajikistan so both countries could benefit from dastijum if operated to reflect the economic needs of both countries in the case of the rogun dam tajikistan would secure the larger share of hydropower benefits because the rogun site is located exclusively within tajikistan we investigated four programs for each of two climate scenarios normal and dry tajikistan is assumed to bear 100 of the costs of the rogun dam at us 2 8 billion tajikistan and afghanistan are assumed to evenly split the costs of dastijum dam at us 1 6 billion each with those assumptions the four programs are the status quo situation in the basin in which no new storage development occurs whatsoever we term this option with with no dams all other programs are compared to this base both dams are built and operated we label this option as with both dams this case provides the largest gross economic benefits summed over the water sharing riparians but also incurs the largest development costs the rogun dam is built and operated without the dastijum dam we label this choice as with rogun only the dastijum dam is built and operated without the rogun dam we label it with dastijum only 3 results 3 1 overview broadly results described below show that a combination of added water storage capacity infrastructure and economically optimized delivery of water supplies while respecting the constraints required to secure an actual pareto improvement by securing an actual pareto improvement we mean that the new infrastructure for either or both dams can produce outcomes for which added economic benefits exceed added economic costs for each country several related findings complement those results the economic value of useable water supplies available for use after the building of dams need not decline for any country in fact under the optimized operation of either or both reservoirs the economic benefits to all four countries could increase in supporting irrigated agriculture for both normal and drought conditions the economic value of agricultural production of all riparian countries except tajikistan has the potential to increase in the face of better timed water application to irrigated agriculture as a consequence of the reservoir regulating capacity of either or both dams of course hydropower brings the biggest benefit to tajikistan afghanistan and tajikistan have the potential to secure significant economic benefit from energy production for the dastijum and rogun reservoirs especially if future water supplies are low total basinwide discounted water related economic benefits with both dams in place increase on average by 30 for both the normal and drought scenario the results described present a foundation for cooperation through benefit sharing sadoff and grey 2005 that could promote a peaceful sharing of water related benefits among the four riparian countries our results raise the importance of showing the level and distribution of cooperative solutions because those pareto improving benefit sharing solutions are rarely reached in most parts of the world a typical outcome in several basins worldwide such as the jordan murray darling colorado and indus is that during dry periods upstream countries maintain their water diversions while downstream countries bear most of the burden of the shortages however our results are more illustrative of the actual rio grande compact signed in 1938 which spreads out the burden of shortages among the three us basin states colorado new mexico and texas ward et al 2006 those benefits would be available for sharing for which all stand to gain something we summarize details below 3 2 agriculture appendix table b1 shows model optimized farmland area under crop production by country policy water supply scenario crop and cropping season using baseline data bucknall et al 2003 frenken 2013 it shows two cropping regions for both afghanistan and tajikistan because each can secure water from both the pyanj and vakhsh rivers in the case of afghanistan the first irrigation region shown takes water from the kunduz while the second farming takes water from the pyanj river for tajikistan the first irrigated area shown area is supplied uses water from the vakhsh while the second would draw supplies from the pyanj river the table s central message is that total irrigated land in production for each country need produce no reduction with either or both dams compared to without both in fact both afghanistan and tajikistan show the highest increase in irrigated lands with water supplied from the pyanj river even downstream uzbekistan and turkmenistan could irrigate more lands with the water made available by the dams this could occur even in the drought water supply scenario thanks to the capacity of reservoirs to hold wet year flows for future dry years or to hold wet winter flows that would otherwise be unused in agriculture for use in the peak summer demand period results show that higher economic valued management could increase land area under irrigation by up to a factor of 1 3 still afghanistan and tajikistan with existing land irrigated by the kunduz and vakhsh respectively show only a modest increase of farmland with the reservoirs so cropped area need not be reduced by reservoir construction this finding occurs because of the constraint that requires of an equitable distribution of benefits among riparians closer inspection of the table shows that in the presence of either or both dams each basin country could sustain an equal or higher level of irrigated land with the dams than without them especially in the drought water scenario dams can serve the role of seasonal regulators of farmland in all countries investigated wheat is a major staple crop for all countries in the basin and it performs an important role in contributing to domestic food security as the most efficient wheat supplier in the basin uzbekistan has the most land under wheat cultivation abdullaev et al 2009 followed by turkmenistan under the base policy however the situation changes for each of the three alternative policies for all alternatives uzbekistan still produces the greatest water related economic benefit but afghanistan takes silver and tajikistan gets bronze because wheat is essential for food security it also makes up an important part of the crop mix in both tajikistan and afghanistan chabot and dorosh 2007 both afghanistan and tajikistan use more than half of total irrigated land for wheat production for all policies and both water supply scenarios results show similar water use patterns for vegetable production in tajikistan which uses about one sixth of its total irrigated land for vegetables for all policy scenarios while wheat and vegetables are important for the upstream countries of tajikistan and afghanistan their production also meets important food security and export needs for the downstream countries thus uzbekistan and turkmenistan see wheat as a priority for food security cotton an important source of hard currency in uzbekistan müller 2006 consumes large amounts of national labor at harvest time securing irrigation water for uzbek cotton has long been a national priority each year during the three month harvest period uzbek authorities shut down hundreds of schools hospitals and public offices thousands of teachers doctors and public administrators work the fields mirovalev and kramer 2013 the upstream countries generally cultivate less cotton because of their higher elevations and colder climate 3 3 energy national motivations for energy independence and its support to expand exports are important driving force for the desire by both afghanistan and tajikistan to secure additional hydroelectric storage table 3 shows that dam construction and operation have the potential to improve energy security for both countries at first look energy production seems higher with only one dam than when both dams are in place but closer examination reveals a different story when both dams are in place a large amount of power is produced from each and total power production from the two facilities 10 481 17 276 gwh year for base water supply conditions with both in place is nearly twice as high as when either single dam is built as a standalone project 10 543 or 17 364 gwh year this outcome reduces the need for either dam to approach its capacity because the two work as complements in meeting overall basin power demands building and operating either facility in isolation or developing both jointly could contribute to energy self sufficiency with added potential to export unused energy outside the basin moreover under a carefully designed reservoir operation scheme the projects could simultaneously serve energy requirements of those both upstream countries while also helping to reduce food prices and or raise farm income in the downstream parts of the basin so our findings suggest that with careful negotiation on water use rights downstream of the dams all riparians could be better off with dams than without them permitting all to achieve priority economic development goals according to the table the reservoirs could produce power at a high level even operating six months per year in a base water supply scenario they could produce at half of their capacity in the dry scenario maximum electricity production capacity of the dastijum and rogun reservoirs are 15 6 and 13 3 terawatts tw per year respectively the general pattern of water filling at the two dams shows water storage levels rising from early fall until early spring after which water is released from march august to support farming for the peak summer irrigation demand season the reservoirs produce almost 100 of their maximum power production from march august when irrigation demand is high that happens because of the politically important equity constraint required by our analysis that equity constraint states that irrigated land with either or both dams can be no less than irrigated land under the base policy of no dams therefore the model shows a supply of irrigated agriculture with water as well as supplying as much energy as possible without violating the equity constraint still even with the above reservoir operation pattern the dams generate some energy in fall this desirability of operating the reservoirs to release water in the spring and summer occurs because releases during that period simultaneously produce power and irrigation benefits which for that season are a complementary choice lacombe et al 2014 under the equity constrained optimization the reservoirs peak energy production occurs in may for all water supply scenarios one interesting result occurs in the months of september january and february reservoirs generate no power whatsoever this timed lack of power production occurs because of our constraint requiring agricultural land in production with either or both dams to be at least equal to base condition agricultural land with no dams when this equity constraint is enforced reservoirs act as regulators during the year practically achieving this equity constraint will require patient thoughtful and deliberate political negotiations among all riparians without such negotiations the reservoirs could produce very high amounts of energy at the expense of irrigated agriculture worsening the cost to the downstream countries farm sector brought on by drought raising the threat of food shortages as well as setting a stage for growing conflict 3 4 economics 3 4 1 economic value of agriculture table 4 describes farm income by country policy and scenario discounted at 5 even with an efficient development and allocation of water operating throughout the model s time horizon drought imposes costs without dams drought imposes higher costs but those costs fall considerably after the investment to develop storage reservoirs dams even when producing power for afghanistan and tajikistan are a mechanism to regulate flows they therefore limit economic costs suffered by drought by irrigators and energy buyers generally for all countries the difference between farm income in the base and dry water supply scenario is about 30 results show that farmers earn the highest income in uzbekistan producing more than half of the basin total farm income uzbekistan alone earns about 75 of total farm income in the basin for all policy and water supply scenarios much of which originates from cotton ibragimov et al 2007 afghanistan secures only modest gains in farm income with either or both dams this occurs because afghanistan relies on production of wheat which shows a marginal performance for commercial profitability but is consumed where possible to guard against the threat of food insecurity an fao report food and agriclultural organization 2010 estimated several indicators of weak food security in afghanistan data showed that among all children 59 were under normal height for their age and 9 were under normal weight for their age these hardships undermine rural livelihoods food security and net incomes in that country the main reason for taking land out of production is unreliable and or inadequate water supplies since 2000 several droughts have occurred that have caused considerable damage to irrigated agriculture undermined already weak food security and contributed to out migration data from 2010 indicate about 36 of irrigated systems in the country failed to function as of 2010 food and agriclultural organization 2010 if large tracts of afghan lands could be converted to cotton production in regions warm enough for it afghanistan would earn the second highest commercial farm income in the basin after uzbekistan still it would also risk a reduced capacity for domestic wheat food security many studies published since 2000 have shown that afghanistan continues to suffer heavily from drought because of its scarce in country reservoir storage as well as its weakly developed water institutions for sharing water shortages gohar et al 2013 numerous ongoing planning efforts by the afghan government are examining measures to handle these two related challenges an unpublished draft national water resources and irrigation development program plan from 2012 written by the afghan government presented a vision to improve agricultural production raise access to basic services such as potable drinking water and improved sanitation services for livelihoods and economic growth there are sufficient water resources in the country to allow for further improvement of the water service reliability however practically achieving this may require the establishment of reservoirs for storing water during periods of high runoff from the upper catchments and releasing it gradually during periods of low supply as well as a water sharing water right system needed to support high beneficial use of water produced by the reservoirs undertaking such projects is costly and requires considerable preparation not only because of the technical challenges but also for the need to assess the project against wider river basin development plans an additional complication occurs where projects change the flow regime of a river crossing into a neighboring country improvement of quality and expansion of irrigation services therefore requires considerable preparation and a high level of government capacity that is not currently present in afghanistan our results show that the basin countries taken together could increase their income by just under us 2 billion in the base water supply scenario or by us 1 5 billion in the dry scenario storage takes on a higher economic value as droughts become more severe or as river water supplies exhibit a higher variability this finding takes on considerable importance to the basin s riparians who will likely be looking for ways to design more resilient water shortage sharing technologies and institutions for adapting to future climate change 3 4 2 economic value of energy table 5 show the trend of the value of energy production by policy and water supply scenario for rogun and dastijum reservoirs respectively for the base water supply scenario average annual energy production value is us 215 million and us 129 million respectively for the drought scenario energy production takes on the much smaller value of 90 and 51 million respectively as reservoir storage declines in the face of increased water demands for irrigated agriculture our results show that either or both dams possess considerable potential to help afghanistan and tajikistan achieve economically and politically important energy security furthermore economic benefits earned by energy production with either or both dams stand to be a considerable addition to the resources of those electric power poor countries the exception to the trend of high energy related economic benefits with additional storage occurs in the first year when the reservoirs begin accumulating water from their starting level of zero storage those reservoirs reach nearly their maximum energy production in the second year with energy benefits of us 211 and 83 million for rogun for the base and dry water supply scenario respectively it produces us 364 and 160 million for dastijum in the base and dry scenario respectively the table shows that on a monthly basis afghanistan can secure on average us 18 million in the base and us 7 5 million in the dry scenario energy economic benefits summed over 20 year period are huge for both countries 3 4 3 total economic value appendix table b2 shows total economic benefits summed over irrigated agriculture and hydroelectric power discounted at 5 it shows a comparison between the value of water for agriculture and energy averaged over 20 year period by country policy and water supply scenario the table s message is that all countries of the basin have the potential to be better off with either or both dams depending on the country those total benefits vary considerably in comparison to total benefits without dams still all show an increase this provides evidence that an actual pareto improvement is possible this outcome could occur while securing sizeable energy benefits for both afghanistan and tajikistan all basin countries could secure enhanced agricultural benefits with either or both storage capacity expansions however those gains vary among countries for instance downstream turkmenistan and upstream afghanistan have the greatest increase of up to four times the benefits with dams compared to with no dams respectively tajikistan and uzbekistan see about 1 1 1 3 times the level of agricultural benefits in the presence of both dams both afghanistan and tajikistan would benefit considerably from greatly increased energy production if both dams are built afghanistan and tajikistan could increase their total economic value of water by 3 and 1 7 times respectively in base water supply conditions and by 5 and 2 3 times respectively in drought conditions the essential point here is that both those countries are poor and incapable of building dams of this scale without significant external financial assistance as seen from appendix table b2 the cost of each dam is high and may consume a large part of the national budget of either country if entirely self financed in summary all countries in the amu darya basin stand to sustain or increase their water related economic benefits with the construction and operation of the dams and reservoirs even afghanistan could discover higher valued uses of water from the mainstem of the river and thereby secure considerable benefits from the dams and reservoirs inaccessible to date findings of our analysis also point to the importance of timed water flows released from the proposed storage reservoirs tajikistan could receive winter hydroelectric power that is important to meet currently unmet energy needs from our results the downstream countries especially uzbekistan could secure at least as much summer irrigation water with the dams as without them thus increasing total economic values of water for the three downstream countries while some of those welfare improvements could be secured by trading flow diversion and use rights alone most could not be achieved absent the additional infrastructure development to permit a better timing of storage and releases 4 conclusions this paper has addressed the energy food water nexus in the amu darya basin in central asia an important case for which methods of analysis are generalizable to analysis worldwide the challenge facing all countries in the basin is compelling as it includes the increasing competition and conflicts of interests between upstream and downstream countries between energy and irrigation economic activities and between economic activities and environmental protection important questions addressed by this paper address the allocation of scarce water among locations economic sectors and ecosystems remaining questions needing future attention would address the serious water quality problems from salinity loads in soils and return flows degradation of water resources in the basin is having considerable negative impacts on both human activities and ecosystems this paper has focused on the expansion of reservoir storage that would build and operate the rogun and dastijum dams results support our optimism in that they show that the energy and irrigation benefits from building the dams could improve economic benefits for all four countries in the basin opening a negotiating space large enough to permit a true pareto improvement becker 1995 compared to the status quo this makes for an important finding although the really difficult task ahead is to organize the political and administrative cooperation needed for financing the large investments altering the allocation of water in the basin among locations sectors and crops all could require some degree of improvement in irrigation technologies and management as well as including afghanistan in negotiating the sharing of basin water if dastijum is going to be built challenges remain to achieve politically workable implementation to share the gains of water development and allocation among the four riparians our results only indicate possibilities one notable template for success is the north american rio grande compact of 1938 hill 1974 paddock 2001 that compact designed an accounting formula summarizing then recent historical allocations of the basin s headwater flows at the time of negotiating the compact criteria for adjusting the historical record could include things like population levels the human right to water flows assigned to national watersheds of origin and historical injustices ward 2013 important limits of this study include weak hydrologic information throughout the basin as a consequence of a damaged or destroyed hydrometric network making it hard to track recent streamflow data in the basin a similar problem comes from a long history of poor data sharing among the four riparians so little verifiable and consistently collected agricultural data are available on the level of crop production cost yields or crop water use therefore our study required major assumptions on cropped area crop water linkages crop mix streamflows and crop water use few of which were supported by research grade data and reall of which were difficult to verify while a few of the basin s farms continue to use pre 1990 soviet collective resource allocation methods in agriculture our model is based on the presence of efficient institutions such as markets for allocating land water crops and energy it is also based on the presumption that it is both possible and desirable to move scarce water to its highest valued uses another important limit of the study comes from the fact that our conclusions show only the potential economic gains from the development of the dastijum and rogun dam with no details on how that potential could be realized through political negotiation or other action such as the drafting of sustainable self enforcing treaties it is very likely that sustained patient and flexible political negotiations among the riparian countries will be needed to implement policies that could secure and sustain the potential benefits for which our results indicate are only possibilities a further limitation of this work comes from the fact that we conducted no separate analysis for the benefits of flood control or the environmental benefits of protecting or restoring the aral sea it is well known that the soviet government decided in the 1960s to divert the rivers of the amu darya and syr darya to irrigate the desert region surrounding the sea to favor agriculture at the expense of flows to the aral sea by setting up a program to promote agriculture especially cotton the soviet government cut off the aral sea from its two main sources with consequences that have lasted to this day the water level in the aral sea started declining from the 1960s and for the most part has continued before the 1960s the aral sea received about one fifth of its water supply through rainfall while the remainder was supplied by the amu darya and syr darya rivers evaporation losses were about as high as inflows making it sustainable as long as inflows were maintained therefore river diversions for irrigated agriculture have been the main reason for reduction of the aral sea s levels since the 1960s teasley and mckinney 2011 in future work we hope to conduct a research grade economic analysis of the costs and benefits of protecting or restoring the aral sea a longer planning period magnifies the importance of questions about the adequacy of data and increases the value of investments to upgrade the quality and reliability of those data our analysis uses stochastic future water supplies that are compatible with observed data over the available period of record however a more comprehensive analysis would account for stochastic crop prices and yields stochastic water demands and a range of risks associated with future climate variability despite these limits this paper has taken a first step at conducting a comprehensive analysis of policy options for addressing the potential for programs that could improve the

hydrology the essential principle linking the hydrology element is mass balance both for surface flow interactions reservoir levels the hydrology elements use mass balance principles to account for headwater flows river flows reservoir levels water from surface applied to various uses and impact of surface flows on current and future reservoir storage levels a 6 2 river flow fig 3 shows that the amu darya river system has several gauges indicated by rectangular boxes river flow at each v th river gauge in each time period in scenario n and policy p x p v y t n p equals the sum of flows over any upstream node for which activities directly influence that flow these include 1 headwater inflows 2 upstream river gauges 3 upstream diversions 4 upstream surface return flows 5 upstream reservoir releases total flows which cannot be negative are defined for each of those five types of nodes respectively as a1 x v v y t n p h b p hv x p h y t n p v b p vv x v v y t n p d b p dv x v d y t n p r b p rv x v r y t n p l b p lv x v l y t n p where the set v defines all river gauges and x v v y t n p is the river flow at any river gauge node in which each river gauge is a single element of the set v each of the five vectors of b p coefficients takes on values of 0 for non contributing sources 1 for sources that add flow and 1 for sources that reduce flow so positive signs in the equation require adding flows and subtractions occur whenever a b p coefficient is negative for example the first term on the right hand of the equal sign h b p hv x v h y t n p sums contributions over the set h of headwater nodes that vector b p hv contains a value of 1 for all immediately upstream headwater gauges that contribute to a river s flow and 0 otherwise where x p h y t n p are known flows at a headwater gauge the second right hand side term v b p vv x v v y t n p sums contributions over the set v of relevant upstream river gauge elements the vector b p vv typically contains a single 1 and the rest zeros the third term d b p dv x v d y t n p sums river flow reductions over the set d of upstream diversion nodes by accounting for upstream diversions the b p dv vector s coefficients are 0 for non diverting locations and for diversions that do not affect the given node s flow but 1 where upstream diversions directly reduce that flow the last two terms similarly account for upstream surface return flows in the set r and upstream reservoir releases that affect river flows in the set l a 6 3 water diverted agricultural irrigation water use is met by river diversions however in many of the world s rivers in dry periods historical record often show periods of zero flow in periods of high demand and low runoff the following equation a wet water condition requires that no diversion exceeds available river flow at the point of diversion so each diversion must be less than the sum of all five classes of upstream sources 1 headwater inflows 2 upstream river gauges 3 upstream diversions 4 upstream surface return flows 5 upstream reservoir releases a diversion which cannot be negative is a2 x p d y t n p h b p hd x v h y t n p v b p vd x v v y t n p d b p dd x v d y t n p r b p rd x v r y t n p l b p ld x v l y t n p where the right hand side terms sum all contributions to or depletions from flow from upstream sources at the point of diversion the various b p terms which indicate presence 1 or absence 0 of upstream flow sources for a given node configure the basin s geometry a 6 4 water applied like water diverted total water applied to a use at any node in month t of year y in scenario n and policy p x v a y t n p is a choice variable influenced by the institution or policy being debated water applied can come from two sources a stream diversion x v d y t n p or water pumped x v p y t n p pumping in the current implementation is set at zero due to data unavailability but can be made active total water applied is a3 x v a y t n p d b p da x v d y t n p p b p pa x v p y t n p the parameters b p da and b p pa are identity matrices to conform equivalent nodes in the basin for each agricultural node in the basin total water applied to agricultural lands is expressed as a4 x v a y t n p j k b p a j k u b p ua land v u j k y t n p total irrigation water applied from surface source at each water application node equals total demands these demands are summed over crops j and cropping seasons k for empirically estimated water application requirement per hectare by crop and season b p a j k the result is multiplied by an identity matrix b p ua that conforms nodes and the number of hectares irrigated at the u th use node land v u j k y t n p the model solves for the node by node distribution of area by crop season time scenario and policy land v u j k y t n p that solution determines the total demand for irrigation water applications by node and time period x v a y t n p a 6 5 water consumed any water use node s consumptive use x v u y t n p is an empirically determined proportion of total water applied x v a y t n p for irrigation consumptive is the quantity of water lost through plant evapotranspiration et to any current use in the system for hydropower generation use consumptive use is the quantity of water flowing through turbines however that water quantity could be reused downstream for irrigation if it occurs in the irrigation season that water use generates energy which cannot be negative it is measured as a5 energy prod v y t n p geh v y t n p x v y t n p the parameter energy prod v y t n p is energy production h v y t n p is a reservoir head x v y t n p is total water flow to generate energy in month t of year y in scenario n and policy p remaining coefficients are g gravitational constant g 9 8 n kg e efficiency which can vary from 0 to 1 for agricultural nodes water use is measured as a6 x v u y t n p j k b v u j k u b p uu l v u y t n p consumptive use by irrigation et is derived from total land area in production that use is measured as the sum over crops j and seasons k of empirically estimated et amounts per hectare by node crop and season b v u j k multiplied by an identity matrix b p uu that conforms nodes the result is multiplied by the quantity of land irrigated a 6 6 gross surface returns to river surface return flow to a stream x v r y t n p is another proportion of water applied at each return flow node the return flow coefficient per unit applied b p ar is a return flow proportion of the quantity of water applied x v a y t n p total return flow at a node is a7 x v r y t n p a b p ar x v a y t n p hydrologic balance requires that total water applied is divided among consumptive use seepage and return flow so for any node b p au b p as b p ar must sum to 1 0 although any one of those terms can vary widely by node for example nodes located at a greater hydrologic distance from a stream will see a smaller proportion of surface return flow from a given amount of water applied decisions by policymakers or actions by water users that alter any one of the three coefficients will affect one or both of the other two for agricultural nodes total surface returns to the river are a8 x v r y t n p j k b p r j k u b p ur land v u j k y t n p irrigation surface return flows at each agricultural node r in the month t of year y in scenario n and policy p are derived from total cropped area that return flow is measured as the sum over crops j and cropping season k of empirically estimated return flows per hectare by crop and season b p u j k times an identity matrix b p ur that conforms like nodes the result is multiplied by the number of hectares of land irrigated in month t of year y in scenario n and policy p a 6 7 reservoir storage storage at each r th reservoir rogun and dastijum is tracked for all periods each reservoir s stock z v r y t n p equals its stock in the previous month minus the net release outflow minus inflow from the reservoir x v l y t n p that contributes to added flow at the downstream node in that month a vector of coefficients lying between 0 and 1 b p lr keep track of each r th reservoir s location in the basin assuring that river flow into it adds to the reservoir s contents outflows reduce contents and also adding to river flow in the downstream reach for the basin as a whole the term b p el is an identity matrix consisting of 1 s on the main diagonal reservoir contents are a9 z v r y t n p z v r t 1 e b p el l b p lr x v l y t n p electric power comes from building and operating a reservoir that has an elevation drop there are few hydroelectric plants in flat places each dam stores water at its reservoir and a higher storage volume of water in the reservoir means that the water falls a greater distance and reaches a greater velocity when passing through the turbines the turbine converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy the hydroelectric generator converts this mechanical energy into electricity the hydraulic head for the r th reservoir s dam in the month t of year y scenario n and policy p was empirically estimated to fit conditions for both rogun and dastijum reservoirs a10 h v r y t n p b 0 b 1 1 z v r y t n p the principle behind this equation is this on the basis of known limited data on both reservoirs water volume which if operated to produce power depends on height of dam to find nonlinear relation between storage volume and head of the dam so the model tracks head based on reservoir storage contents of the r th reservoir in the initial period 0 z v r0 a11 z v r 0 0 the upper bound on each r th reservoir s contents is a12 z v r y t n p max c r this equation guarantees that the r th reservoir s level never exceeds its capacity policies that would change a reservoir s capacity such as dredging or adding to a dam s height are simulated by altering the value of c r a 6 8 land use land use patterns affect the demand for water for irrigated agriculture total land in production is expressed as a13 j k land v u j k y t n p land p u y t n p this states that irrigated land in production by node crop season and time summed over crops and seasons cannot exceed available land land p u y t n p in most dry rural regions of the world like the amu darya basin water can be more limiting than land we used the maximum current capacity in irrigated land for countries of the basin as the upper limit on available land still more area will likely become available if greater long term water supplies can be secured and if institutions adjust to permit the extra water to be used by agriculture the baseline policy analysis is constrained to replicate historical irrigated land by country and crop for the two alternative policies those constraints are removed by allowing water tradeoffs to occur either within a single or among irrigated areas either policy permits existing water to be reallocated to higher economic valued water uses where the economics would support such a reallocation a 6 9 economics economic benefits are secured by water consumption at use nodes for irrigated agriculture and by water flowing through turbines to generate energy at reservoir nodes for agricultural uses the willingness to pay is measured by the contribution of water to net farm income which equals crop price multiplied by yield minus cost of production plus any unpriced consumer surplus consumer surplus is an unpriced value equal to the amount by which power buyers economic welfare exceeds the actual price charged it is measured as the area beneath the demand function and above actual price charged for energy benefits total revenue is measured as the price of electricity multiplied by the quantity produced in the current implementation of the model that electricity price is set at recent observed levels in the basin reduced prices from additional hydropower will raise consumer surplus while increased prices will reduce consumer surplus for regions of the basin that currently have little access to power increases in consumer surplus are economically and politically very important to achieve agricultural benefits are measured as a14 ag ben v u y t n p j k p p j y t np yield p u j k c p u j k where ag ben v u y t n p is agricultural benefits p p j y t n p is price of each crop yield p u j k crop yield

7499,this article examines impacts of infrastructure development and climate variability on economic outcomes for the amu darya basin in central asia it aims to identify the most economically productive mix of expanded reservoir storage for economic benefit sharing to occur in which economic welfare of all riparians is improved policies examined include four combinations of storage infrastructure for each of two climate futures an empirical optimization model is developed and applied to identify opportunities for improving the welfare of tajikistan uzbekistan afghanistan and turkmenistan the analysis 1 characterizes politically constrained and economically optimized water use patterns for these combinations of expanded reservoir storage capacity 2 describes pareto improving packages of expanded storage capacity that could raise economic welfare for all four riparians and accounts for impacts for each of two climate scenarios results indicate that a combination of targeted water storage infrastructure and efficient water allocation could produce outcomes for which the discounted net present value of benefits are favorable for each riparian results identify a framework to provide economic motivation for all riparians to cooperate through development of water storage infrastructure our findings illustrate the principle that development of water infrastructure can expand the negotiation space by which all communities can gain economic benefits in the face of limited water supply still despite our optimistic findings patient and deliberate negotiation will be required to transform potential improvements into actual gains keywords benefit sharing integrated basin scale analysis central asia amu darya 1 background successful methods to negotiate transboundary water conflicts remains high on the international policy agenda the search for these methods is elevated in the face of fluctuating food prices population growth increased needs for water use efficiency growing water scarcity and the need to feed a un forecasted 9 7 billion by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs 2015 the connection among water food and energy security is complex methods to design efficient equitable and sustainable policies that respect that nexus face numerous challenges allan et al 2015 climate variability growing population droughts and floods elevate water conflict in many regions rosegrant and cline 2003 still there are well recognized benefits of basin scale cooperation in financing development and sharing use that could accrue to all nations serving to motivate all to share the development and use of a basin s water the extent to which cooperation can occur turns on each party s belief of the added benefits it can secure from cooperation sadoff and grey 2005 compared to acting in isolation the world bank 2015 in transboundary basins each community calculates the benefits of acting alone compared to the benefits of various cooperation strategies granit et al 2012 madani 2010 a pareto improving transboundary water management plan will find a negotiation space in which all parties can be made better off with rather than without the plan madani 2010 teasley and mckinney 2011 the challenges posed by the difficulties of effective cooperation in the face of potential conflict in water scarce basins take on compelling significance for countries drained by the amu darya basin in central asia hereafter the basin the basin encompasses four republics of the former soviet union kyrgyzstan tangentially tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and afghanistan fig 1 among those countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan and afghanistan are the poorest in which more than half the population subsists beneath the poverty line defined as less than 1 90 daily per capita income in 2015 prices world bank 2015 water carries special hydrologic economic and political significance for the basin wegerich 2008 the lack of a consensus based water sharing framework to guide cooperation among the basin s riparians has produced few institutional mechanisms to guide the management of the basin s water supplies and use sadoff and grey refer to such institutional mechanisms as modes of cooperation sadoff and grey 2005 despite their innovative and celebrated insights they acknowledge the considerable logistical cultural and inertia challenges facing diplomatic arrangements that would design apply and sustain those mechanisms an empirical integrated river basin scale framework to inform management and policy choices could supply the foundation for organizing such modes of cooperation cai et al 2003a heinz et al 2007 a rigorous quantitative framework for assessing the effects of various proposed modes of cooperation would guide the search for greater efficiency and resilience in sharing water related benefits among spatially diverse users and uses in the face of unknowable future water supplies griffin and chang 1991 the typical river basin consists of a number of water related activities including water storage diversion seepage distribution pumping evaporation and use basin scale analysis is the acknowledged state of the arts approach to provide a comprehensive framework for informing management and policy decisions cai et al 2003a moy et al 1986 such an informed policy could produce an efficient just and lasting allocation of economic benefits and costs related to water resource interventions rogers et al 2002 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 despite the practical benefits of integrated analysis little basin scale work has been conducted to date for this basin identifying pareto improving interventions in which each riparian could secure economic gains however some previous work has been published for example a 2005 work described principles of optimization of long term water supplies that account for ecological impacts schlüter et al 2005 an earlier study on water sharing in central asia developed and implemented a model of water supply and demand for the entire aral sea basin including both the amu darya and syr darya basins raskin et al 1992 some studies have examined water allocation economic improvement potentials in the basin cai et al 2003b jalilov et al 2013a jalilov et al 2016 for example examined irrigation water management in aral sea basin glantz 2005 conducted a comprehensive analysis of the water climate environment demographic situation in central asia wegerich 2008 characterized several connections between water used for energy and production agriculture schlüter and pähle 2011 analyzed institutional resilience in the face of interdependent economic and ecological constraints in the basin still an empirical foundation for the modes of cooperation described by sadoff and grey 2005 remains elusive that is most of the existing literature has seen little rigorous quantitative analysis to guide discovery of the kinds of integrated programs that could improve economic welfare of all riparians that share the waters of a transboundary basin welfare improvement for all riparians is an ambitious goal however the concept of a pareto improvement could be a guide such a pareto improvement represents a change from the status quo business as usual for which a program treaty policy or management plan makes at least one community better off while making none worse off habteyes et al 2015 pitafi and roumasset 2009 rogers 1993 stavins et al 2003 yapo et al 1998 it has been recognized for some time that the search for welfare improving water policies can be enhanced through integrated basin scale analysis that combines the disciplines of hydrology agronomy and economics maass et al 1962 basin scale analysis has seen much development since us federal funding for the tennessee valley authority began in the 1930 s straffin and heaney 1981 two of the more celebrated examples of published basin scale optimization modelling work include cai 2008 duckstein and opricovic 1980 despite extensive published research in basin scale analysis we are unaware of any analysis for the amu darya basin that describes the methods to discover and expand a negotiation space jennings et al 2001 in which all communities can achieve a benefit sharing outcome to address their resource problems of quality quantity timing or location these resource problems include those associated with water food and energy demands for which resource endowments vary widely among the four basin countries of tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and afghanistan this paper addresses that gap above by presenting a basin scale analysis of the amu darya basin that seeks and finds a negotiation space in which all parties could be better off than under status quo development and management of the basin s water and storage infrastructure our work examines alternative measures to expand water storage capacity while also efficiently allocating water stored over time location and use to guide discovery of a pareto improving development and use of energy water and food for the basin its intent is to inform ongoing policy debates for discovering measures to improve economic welfare for all countries in a transboundary basin in which each country s welfare is vulnerable to impacts on its water energy and food security from droughts and climate variability we conduct our search for a pareto improving mix of programs by measuring whether or not the discounted net present value dnpv of each proposed intervention is greater than or equal to zero for all communities for both a normal and dry climate in which costs include both financing development as well as opportunity costs of the water itself our analysis achieves this by measuring dnpv for the sum of hydroelectric power and irrigated agriculture in future work as better quality data become available we hope to incorporate physical and economic dimensions of urban water supply as well as key water related ecological assets our study achieves these aims by investigating proposed developments of new storage capacity in the basin if developed two new storage facilities investigated are the dastijum dam on the pyanj river and the rogun dam on the vakhsh river fig 1 and fig 3 there have been numerous widely publicized political debates for years over the rogun dam for which tajikistan s development aims are to secure large scale and strategically important energy benefits granit et al 2012 much of the debate has occurred in the political arena despite much debate there has been little rigorous peer reviewed research conducted that has investigated the level or distribution of economic benefits among the countries associated with that additional storage provided by the rogun dam if developed in addition to proposals for additional storage from rogun another enhancement of storage capacity sometimes labeled as the dastijum dam has been proposed by tajikistan strong development of hydropower in the mekong amazon and nile basins suggests that unilateral moves by tajikistan to build the rogun dam or tajikistan and afghanistan for the dastijum dam are also possible based on foreign capital investments grumbine et al 2012 this journal has published several recent papers establishing an approach that address basin scale challenges similar to ours which included integrations of economics hydrology policy and diplomacy chen et al 2017 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 lobanova et al 2017 wang et al 2017 one version of that proposal would be built on the international border of afghanistan and tajikistan fig 1 and fig 3 dastijum if built and operated could secure energy and some agricultural benefits for both countries as is the case with the rogun dam little peer reviewed research has been conducted out to assess the contribution of the dastijum dam regarding to economic efficiency equity or sustainability to any of the basin s countries the contribution of the present research over earlier similar work e g jalilov et al 2016 comes from the investigation of several combinations of storage capacity expansions and operation plans rather than addition of a single proposed reservoir in isolation jalilov et al 2013a b 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area the amu darya river the river is the largest in central asia both in length and discharge glantz 2005 with a river length of 2540 km wegerich 2004 and a recent average annual supply of about 73 6 cubic km spoor and krutov 2003 the mainstem river is supplied by the confluence of two main tributaries the vakhsh and pyanj rivers fig 1 the basin drained by the river terminates in the aral sea which has undergone a considerable shrinking since the 1970s micklin 2007 water users in afghanistan turkmenistan tajikistan and uzbekistan share the basin s supplies the basin includes about 309 000 km2 wegerich 2008 and is home to 55 million central intelligence agency 2011 on route from the headwaters to the aral sea the river borders or drains these four countries most of the basin occupies a steppe climate too dry to support forests but insufficiently dry to be a true desert this climate condition combined with fertile soils give rise to heavy water demands to support crop irrigation spoor and krutov 2003 for this reason there have been considerable policy debates in the basin for years on the best ways to manage water for its many competing uses wegerich 2007 there have also been numerous debates over measures needed to develop new irrigation lands to produces economic benefits for domestic food security as well as for export varis 2014 2 2 basin scale framework our basin scale analysis treats the entire basin as an integrated manageable unit the integrated approach brings the region s hydrology economics and institutions within a unified framework for policy analysis integrated basin analysis has been discussed for many years and in many places for example rosegrant et al 2000 fig 2 presents the data we used summarizing mean water supply by source month and water supply scenario ours is a mathematical model of a river basin system i e a mathematical description of the system using parameters variables and equations described in appendix a our model helps explain this basin and is used to investigate effects of various components and to make predictions about system and human behavior especially predictions resulting from policies not yet enacted the model begins with the basic water supply which includes all major tributaries fig 3 stochastic supplies are based on the historical mean and variance of annual discharges of the basin s water inflows based on a 50 year period of record haddeland et al 2011 our analysis integrates the hydrology agronomy economics and policy choices at the basin level in terms of economic values contributed the two most important water users are irrigated agriculture and the potential for hydropower production for which that hydropower remains unrealized to date that hydropower remains undeveloped to date in part because of difficulties of affected countries in successfully hammering out a lasting water sharing agreement smaller amounts of water are also used in the basin to support key ecological assets supplied by streams reservoirs and wetlands martius et al 2009 combined with high demands for food production met by heavy water demands by crop irrigation this basin faces a classic challenge in the design of policy to weave a fine line among energy food and water that challenge is elevated by the complex interdependent energy food water nexus with acceptable and sustainable flexibility in the face of future uncertain supplies nohara et al 2006 each of the four proposed water programs considered in this paper would likely incur environmental costs however a lack of reliable data on these environmental costs unique to this region precludes their inclusion in our framework we hope to be able to secure better data on key water related ecological assets and their economic values and economic costs for future work the model takes into account the economic importance of irrigated agriculture in the four basin countries as well as the potential for energy production in the headwater region of both tajikistan and afghanistan we define total benefits by water supply scenario as tb sp u t m ab utmsp r t m eb rtmsp where abutmsp is agricultural benefits at node u year t month m scenario s and policy p ebrtmsp is energy benefits at reservoir r for the same remaining subscripts we formulated the model as a dynamic optimization for which the goal is to maximize a single objective function subject to a number of hydrologic economic equity sustainability and institutional constraints the optimized objective is the discounted net present value of the basin s water development and use over a 20 year analysis the model predicts the patterns of crop output land use hydroelectric power production reservoir levels and water use by country use season and year while achieving that constrained maximization results from each water supply scenario and each policy choice require a separate model run sadoff and grey 2005 that constraint requires a workable policy to be pareto improving compared to the status quo a pareto improvement is required by our model for each of the downstream countries with the additional storage developments and operation compared to without that added storage and management that is the analysis seeks a water development and use plan that could promote and sustain cooperation rather than conflict by sharing the benefits of development 2 3 data table 1 shows assumptions on design characteristics used for each of two storage reservoirs used for our analysis it shows reservoir capacity and hydroelectric power potential included are reservoir height hydraulic head maximum volume surface area depth hydropower capacity power prices and estimated construction costs water supply is stochastic and is characterized by two scenarios base and dry the dry scenario reflects progressive global warming that according to some investigators continues to affect central asia kohler et al 2016 an increase of up to 1 2 c in surface temperature has been recorded in the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan over the past 70 years this trend may continue as under likely climate change scenarios for the region average temperatures are predicted to increase by 1 3 c by 2050 climate change scenarios also forecast reduced precipitation in the southern parts of the region kohler et al 2016 for these reasons we specified a dry scenario in which the volume of water flow from amu darya reaches an average of 50 of its historical level average historical annual water discharge of amu darya river in the base year is just over 70 cubic kilometers and is set to half that much for the dry scenario the base mean water supply reflects historical mean water discharge from inside the basin while the dry supply scenario is a simple 50 supply reduction compared to the base level a simple 50 of base supply is likely too extreme to reflect impacts of a future climate drying despite its simplicity we selected that level to establish an upper bound on reductions likely to occur in the face of a dry future climate the main tributaries of amu darya the pyanj and vakhsh rivers constitute 49 and 30 of total mainstem s flow respectively four other tributaries kunduz kafirnigan surkhandarya and sherabad contribute on average about 21 of that mainstem s flow unece 2007 table 2 presents data on agriculture by country crop and season irrigated lands in tajikistan and afghanistan receive water supply from the vakhsh and pyanj rivers each country s most important agricultural production occurs from three crops cotton wheat and vegetables the climate of central asia typically permits two cropping seasons per year crop prices are sensitive to total production levels in which the price of each crop falls and food security correspondingly grows with increased output reflecting additional consumer surplus and greater food security from reduced prices as it relates to food security consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is prepared to pay and the actual price they pay if a consumer is willing to pay more than the current price they secure more benefit from the purchased food than they pay out in expenditures food is a good example of a service with a high consumer surplus especially in communities that face a risk of food insecurity as seen in periods of famine people will pay high prices for food when it is scarce as they require it to survive the difference in the price that they are prepared to pay if necessary and the amount actually charged is their consumer surplus consumer surplus is an important factor guiding the design of agricultural and water resources policy especially when water policies can be designed to reduce food scarcity as well as associated water scarcity butt et al 2005 crop prices depend on crop supply not known in advance so these prices are an outcome of the model s constrained optimization that model optimization both influences and is affected by the allocation of water among crops and countries under all infrastructure development and water supply alternatives for that reason both the hydrologic and policy scenarios affect crop prices for a classic demand function price depends on production the prices we used are based on published prices and published price elasticities combined with a linear demand price response at historically observed prices and production levels griffin and chang 1991 local estimates of crop price elasticities of demand for central asia were unavailable we turned to data from the outside of the region to check the sensitivity of these elasticities transferred from an outside study area to our target area we raised and lowered price elasticity by 20 to check their impact on discounted net present value that impact was less than 0 3 the integrated analysis treats the basin as a single unit its unique approach lies in bringing the basin s hydrology and economics into a single framework for policy analysis the model starts with the basic water supply including flows from all major tributaries that basic water supply represents the contribution of all water sources in the basin the model integrates the hydrology agronomy economics and policy choices at the basin level it also accounts for the political and economic importance of irrigated agriculture in the basin s four countries in addition to the potential for energy production from constructed hydroelectric storage reservoirs in two headwater regions of the basin using long term data on the basin s energy potential water supplies land area and crop water use total economic welfare in the basin was analyzed for a time horizon of 20 years the model was set up to maximize discounted net present value of the algebraic sum of power and irrigation economic benefits over 20 year forecast period constrained by available water supplies and potential storage infrastructure we assumed that water resource planners have perfect foresight to plan for and adapt to stochastic inflows moy et al 1986 our analysis contains a separate constrained optimization for each combination of two water supply scenarios and four infrastructure developments for eight model runs in total we developed this model and its documentation for application to the amu darya basin and to the two potential storage reservoirs described however is adaptable to the hydrology land use patterns economics and institutions of any basin the main principle underlying the hydrology model is mass balance both for surface flows reservoir storage levels and use patterns model code is written to constrain total benefits to exceed total costs including financial costs and opportunity costs of water use displaced for each country and for each of the alternatives with the new reservoir s compared to the base condition without reservoirs groundwater was not explicitly addressed in our work khan and hanjra 2009 1 for the pakistan case when water schemes work badly growers often switch towards groundwater pumping then because of financial impacts surface systems degrade and control of groundwater extractions becomes difficult 1 2 4 economics economic benefits from water come by its contribution to support crop production in places where food security has already been achieved water used for hydropower typically produces a higher commercial value than water used for irrigated agriculture a higher value of water used for hydropower occurs because of power s higher price lower variable costs and smaller water consumption compared to water use by irrigated agriculture however in conditions where food security is at risk water used for crop irrigation can temporarily take on a higher value than for hydropower because of elevated crop prices which leads to a higher marginal economic value of water in agriculture ward and michelsen 2002 data were assembled on observed crop water use as well as cropping patterns by country crop and season farm production details included crop prices cost of production and crop yields net profitability per hectare as well as total observed land in production by country crop and season came from published data sources for the baseline scenario described above profitability for any single crop per unit land was measured as crop price multiplied by yield minus average costs of production per unit land salman et al 2014 we specified equations for each of the two reservoirs water storage volume based on starting storage inflows and outflows the model used information shown in table 1 equations tracked water storage by month year water supply scenario and policy each reservoir s water storage equals its storage in the previous month minus release plus inflow into the reservoir from upstream sources appendix a greater quantities of electric power come from releasing a given outflow of water when there is a higher elevation hydraulic head a higher storage volume of water in a given reservoir means that a given volume released from the reservoir falls a greater distance and reaches a greater velocity when spinning the turbines turbines convert the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy and then into electric power the hydraulic head for each reservoir s dam varies by month year scenario and policy the model predicted that head as it was unknown in advance energy benefits were measured as the quantity of energy produced multiplied by the estimated price of energy equal to us 0 04 per kwh constant for all months years scenarios and policies optimized energy production is also unknown in advance in principle power production depends on the head over which water falls to turn the turbines reservoir water released gravity and a coefficient representing the technical efficiency of turbines by which falling water is converted to power the model of energy production closely reproduced maximum energy capacity of the rogun and dastijum reservoirs used in most of the recently published planning documents for each crop a single demand function for the basin is specified as a declining price that is a function of total production in the basin this reflects a price dependent linear demand function model validation is important for credibility when the optimization model is constrained to reproduce base water supply water use and crop production and price levels the model approximately reproduces historical calculated farm income by irrigated area the base condition has no reservoirs so direct validation of reservoir operation and its economic value against historical conditions was not possible 2 5 programs investigated our investigation examined programs that could bring more agricultural and energy benefits to the four countries sharing the basin s waters accordingly we examined the building of one or two dams on main tributaries of amu darya 1 the dastijum dam on the pyanj river and 2 the rogun dam on the vakhsh river fig 3 because of geographic placement of those dams and location on those rivers each dam has the potential to influence economic benefits in a unique way the dastijum dam would be located on the pyanj a natural border between afghanistan and tajikistan so both countries could benefit from dastijum if operated to reflect the economic needs of both countries in the case of the rogun dam tajikistan would secure the larger share of hydropower benefits because the rogun site is located exclusively within tajikistan we investigated four programs for each of two climate scenarios normal and dry tajikistan is assumed to bear 100 of the costs of the rogun dam at us 2 8 billion tajikistan and afghanistan are assumed to evenly split the costs of dastijum dam at us 1 6 billion each with those assumptions the four programs are the status quo situation in the basin in which no new storage development occurs whatsoever we term this option with with no dams all other programs are compared to this base both dams are built and operated we label this option as with both dams this case provides the largest gross economic benefits summed over the water sharing riparians but also incurs the largest development costs the rogun dam is built and operated without the dastijum dam we label this choice as with rogun only the dastijum dam is built and operated without the rogun dam we label it with dastijum only 3 results 3 1 overview broadly results described below show that a combination of added water storage capacity infrastructure and economically optimized delivery of water supplies while respecting the constraints required to secure an actual pareto improvement by securing an actual pareto improvement we mean that the new infrastructure for either or both dams can produce outcomes for which added economic benefits exceed added economic costs for each country several related findings complement those results the economic value of useable water supplies available for use after the building of dams need not decline for any country in fact under the optimized operation of either or both reservoirs the economic benefits to all four countries could increase in supporting irrigated agriculture for both normal and drought conditions the economic value of agricultural production of all riparian countries except tajikistan has the potential to increase in the face of better timed water application to irrigated agriculture as a consequence of the reservoir regulating capacity of either or both dams of course hydropower brings the biggest benefit to tajikistan afghanistan and tajikistan have the potential to secure significant economic benefit from energy production for the dastijum and rogun reservoirs especially if future water supplies are low total basinwide discounted water related economic benefits with both dams in place increase on average by 30 for both the normal and drought scenario the results described present a foundation for cooperation through benefit sharing sadoff and grey 2005 that could promote a peaceful sharing of water related benefits among the four riparian countries our results raise the importance of showing the level and distribution of cooperative solutions because those pareto improving benefit sharing solutions are rarely reached in most parts of the world a typical outcome in several basins worldwide such as the jordan murray darling colorado and indus is that during dry periods upstream countries maintain their water diversions while downstream countries bear most of the burden of the shortages however our results are more illustrative of the actual rio grande compact signed in 1938 which spreads out the burden of shortages among the three us basin states colorado new mexico and texas ward et al 2006 those benefits would be available for sharing for which all stand to gain something we summarize details below 3 2 agriculture appendix table b1 shows model optimized farmland area under crop production by country policy water supply scenario crop and cropping season using baseline data bucknall et al 2003 frenken 2013 it shows two cropping regions for both afghanistan and tajikistan because each can secure water from both the pyanj and vakhsh rivers in the case of afghanistan the first irrigation region shown takes water from the kunduz while the second farming takes water from the pyanj river for tajikistan the first irrigated area shown area is supplied uses water from the vakhsh while the second would draw supplies from the pyanj river the table s central message is that total irrigated land in production for each country need produce no reduction with either or both dams compared to without both in fact both afghanistan and tajikistan show the highest increase in irrigated lands with water supplied from the pyanj river even downstream uzbekistan and turkmenistan could irrigate more lands with the water made available by the dams this could occur even in the drought water supply scenario thanks to the capacity of reservoirs to hold wet year flows for future dry years or to hold wet winter flows that would otherwise be unused in agriculture for use in the peak summer demand period results show that higher economic valued management could increase land area under irrigation by up to a factor of 1 3 still afghanistan and tajikistan with existing land irrigated by the kunduz and vakhsh respectively show only a modest increase of farmland with the reservoirs so cropped area need not be reduced by reservoir construction this finding occurs because of the constraint that requires of an equitable distribution of benefits among riparians closer inspection of the table shows that in the presence of either or both dams each basin country could sustain an equal or higher level of irrigated land with the dams than without them especially in the drought water scenario dams can serve the role of seasonal regulators of farmland in all countries investigated wheat is a major staple crop for all countries in the basin and it performs an important role in contributing to domestic food security as the most efficient wheat supplier in the basin uzbekistan has the most land under wheat cultivation abdullaev et al 2009 followed by turkmenistan under the base policy however the situation changes for each of the three alternative policies for all alternatives uzbekistan still produces the greatest water related economic benefit but afghanistan takes silver and tajikistan gets bronze because wheat is essential for food security it also makes up an important part of the crop mix in both tajikistan and afghanistan chabot and dorosh 2007 both afghanistan and tajikistan use more than half of total irrigated land for wheat production for all policies and both water supply scenarios results show similar water use patterns for vegetable production in tajikistan which uses about one sixth of its total irrigated land for vegetables for all policy scenarios while wheat and vegetables are important for the upstream countries of tajikistan and afghanistan their production also meets important food security and export needs for the downstream countries thus uzbekistan and turkmenistan see wheat as a priority for food security cotton an important source of hard currency in uzbekistan müller 2006 consumes large amounts of national labor at harvest time securing irrigation water for uzbek cotton has long been a national priority each year during the three month harvest period uzbek authorities shut down hundreds of schools hospitals and public offices thousands of teachers doctors and public administrators work the fields mirovalev and kramer 2013 the upstream countries generally cultivate less cotton because of their higher elevations and colder climate 3 3 energy national motivations for energy independence and its support to expand exports are important driving force for the desire by both afghanistan and tajikistan to secure additional hydroelectric storage table 3 shows that dam construction and operation have the potential to improve energy security for both countries at first look energy production seems higher with only one dam than when both dams are in place but closer examination reveals a different story when both dams are in place a large amount of power is produced from each and total power production from the two facilities 10 481 17 276 gwh year for base water supply conditions with both in place is nearly twice as high as when either single dam is built as a standalone project 10 543 or 17 364 gwh year this outcome reduces the need for either dam to approach its capacity because the two work as complements in meeting overall basin power demands building and operating either facility in isolation or developing both jointly could contribute to energy self sufficiency with added potential to export unused energy outside the basin moreover under a carefully designed reservoir operation scheme the projects could simultaneously serve energy requirements of those both upstream countries while also helping to reduce food prices and or raise farm income in the downstream parts of the basin so our findings suggest that with careful negotiation on water use rights downstream of the dams all riparians could be better off with dams than without them permitting all to achieve priority economic development goals according to the table the reservoirs could produce power at a high level even operating six months per year in a base water supply scenario they could produce at half of their capacity in the dry scenario maximum electricity production capacity of the dastijum and rogun reservoirs are 15 6 and 13 3 terawatts tw per year respectively the general pattern of water filling at the two dams shows water storage levels rising from early fall until early spring after which water is released from march august to support farming for the peak summer irrigation demand season the reservoirs produce almost 100 of their maximum power production from march august when irrigation demand is high that happens because of the politically important equity constraint required by our analysis that equity constraint states that irrigated land with either or both dams can be no less than irrigated land under the base policy of no dams therefore the model shows a supply of irrigated agriculture with water as well as supplying as much energy as possible without violating the equity constraint still even with the above reservoir operation pattern the dams generate some energy in fall this desirability of operating the reservoirs to release water in the spring and summer occurs because releases during that period simultaneously produce power and irrigation benefits which for that season are a complementary choice lacombe et al 2014 under the equity constrained optimization the reservoirs peak energy production occurs in may for all water supply scenarios one interesting result occurs in the months of september january and february reservoirs generate no power whatsoever this timed lack of power production occurs because of our constraint requiring agricultural land in production with either or both dams to be at least equal to base condition agricultural land with no dams when this equity constraint is enforced reservoirs act as regulators during the year practically achieving this equity constraint will require patient thoughtful and deliberate political negotiations among all riparians without such negotiations the reservoirs could produce very high amounts of energy at the expense of irrigated agriculture worsening the cost to the downstream countries farm sector brought on by drought raising the threat of food shortages as well as setting a stage for growing conflict 3 4 economics 3 4 1 economic value of agriculture table 4 describes farm income by country policy and scenario discounted at 5 even with an efficient development and allocation of water operating throughout the model s time horizon drought imposes costs without dams drought imposes higher costs but those costs fall considerably after the investment to develop storage reservoirs dams even when producing power for afghanistan and tajikistan are a mechanism to regulate flows they therefore limit economic costs suffered by drought by irrigators and energy buyers generally for all countries the difference between farm income in the base and dry water supply scenario is about 30 results show that farmers earn the highest income in uzbekistan producing more than half of the basin total farm income uzbekistan alone earns about 75 of total farm income in the basin for all policy and water supply scenarios much of which originates from cotton ibragimov et al 2007 afghanistan secures only modest gains in farm income with either or both dams this occurs because afghanistan relies on production of wheat which shows a marginal performance for commercial profitability but is consumed where possible to guard against the threat of food insecurity an fao report food and agriclultural organization 2010 estimated several indicators of weak food security in afghanistan data showed that among all children 59 were under normal height for their age and 9 were under normal weight for their age these hardships undermine rural livelihoods food security and net incomes in that country the main reason for taking land out of production is unreliable and or inadequate water supplies since 2000 several droughts have occurred that have caused considerable damage to irrigated agriculture undermined already weak food security and contributed to out migration data from 2010 indicate about 36 of irrigated systems in the country failed to function as of 2010 food and agriclultural organization 2010 if large tracts of afghan lands could be converted to cotton production in regions warm enough for it afghanistan would earn the second highest commercial farm income in the basin after uzbekistan still it would also risk a reduced capacity for domestic wheat food security many studies published since 2000 have shown that afghanistan continues to suffer heavily from drought because of its scarce in country reservoir storage as well as its weakly developed water institutions for sharing water shortages gohar et al 2013 numerous ongoing planning efforts by the afghan government are examining measures to handle these two related challenges an unpublished draft national water resources and irrigation development program plan from 2012 written by the afghan government presented a vision to improve agricultural production raise access to basic services such as potable drinking water and improved sanitation services for livelihoods and economic growth there are sufficient water resources in the country to allow for further improvement of the water service reliability however practically achieving this may require the establishment of reservoirs for storing water during periods of high runoff from the upper catchments and releasing it gradually during periods of low supply as well as a water sharing water right system needed to support high beneficial use of water produced by the reservoirs undertaking such projects is costly and requires considerable preparation not only because of the technical challenges but also for the need to assess the project against wider river basin development plans an additional complication occurs where projects change the flow regime of a river crossing into a neighboring country improvement of quality and expansion of irrigation services therefore requires considerable preparation and a high level of government capacity that is not currently present in afghanistan our results show that the basin countries taken together could increase their income by just under us 2 billion in the base water supply scenario or by us 1 5 billion in the dry scenario storage takes on a higher economic value as droughts become more severe or as river water supplies exhibit a higher variability this finding takes on considerable importance to the basin s riparians who will likely be looking for ways to design more resilient water shortage sharing technologies and institutions for adapting to future climate change 3 4 2 economic value of energy table 5 show the trend of the value of energy production by policy and water supply scenario for rogun and dastijum reservoirs respectively for the base water supply scenario average annual energy production value is us 215 million and us 129 million respectively for the drought scenario energy production takes on the much smaller value of 90 and 51 million respectively as reservoir storage declines in the face of increased water demands for irrigated agriculture our results show that either or both dams possess considerable potential to help afghanistan and tajikistan achieve economically and politically important energy security furthermore economic benefits earned by energy production with either or both dams stand to be a considerable addition to the resources of those electric power poor countries the exception to the trend of high energy related economic benefits with additional storage occurs in the first year when the reservoirs begin accumulating water from their starting level of zero storage those reservoirs reach nearly their maximum energy production in the second year with energy benefits of us 211 and 83 million for rogun for the base and dry water supply scenario respectively it produces us 364 and 160 million for dastijum in the base and dry scenario respectively the table shows that on a monthly basis afghanistan can secure on average us 18 million in the base and us 7 5 million in the dry scenario energy economic benefits summed over 20 year period are huge for both countries 3 4 3 total economic value appendix table b2 shows total economic benefits summed over irrigated agriculture and hydroelectric power discounted at 5 it shows a comparison between the value of water for agriculture and energy averaged over 20 year period by country policy and water supply scenario the table s message is that all countries of the basin have the potential to be better off with either or both dams depending on the country those total benefits vary considerably in comparison to total benefits without dams still all show an increase this provides evidence that an actual pareto improvement is possible this outcome could occur while securing sizeable energy benefits for both afghanistan and tajikistan all basin countries could secure enhanced agricultural benefits with either or both storage capacity expansions however those gains vary among countries for instance downstream turkmenistan and upstream afghanistan have the greatest increase of up to four times the benefits with dams compared to with no dams respectively tajikistan and uzbekistan see about 1 1 1 3 times the level of agricultural benefits in the presence of both dams both afghanistan and tajikistan would benefit considerably from greatly increased energy production if both dams are built afghanistan and tajikistan could increase their total economic value of water by 3 and 1 7 times respectively in base water supply conditions and by 5 and 2 3 times respectively in drought conditions the essential point here is that both those countries are poor and incapable of building dams of this scale without significant external financial assistance as seen from appendix table b2 the cost of each dam is high and may consume a large part of the national budget of either country if entirely self financed in summary all countries in the amu darya basin stand to sustain or increase their water related economic benefits with the construction and operation of the dams and reservoirs even afghanistan could discover higher valued uses of water from the mainstem of the river and thereby secure considerable benefits from the dams and reservoirs inaccessible to date findings of our analysis also point to the importance of timed water flows released from the proposed storage reservoirs tajikistan could receive winter hydroelectric power that is important to meet currently unmet energy needs from our results the downstream countries especially uzbekistan could secure at least as much summer irrigation water with the dams as without them thus increasing total economic values of water for the three downstream countries while some of those welfare improvements could be secured by trading flow diversion and use rights alone most could not be achieved absent the additional infrastructure development to permit a better timing of storage and releases 4 conclusions this paper has addressed the energy food water nexus in the amu darya basin in central asia an important case for which methods of analysis are generalizable to analysis worldwide the challenge facing all countries in the basin is compelling as it includes the increasing competition and conflicts of interests between upstream and downstream countries between energy and irrigation economic activities and between economic activities and environmental protection important questions addressed by this paper address the allocation of scarce water among locations economic sectors and ecosystems remaining questions needing future attention would address the serious water quality problems from salinity loads in soils and return flows degradation of water resources in the basin is having considerable negative impacts on both human activities and ecosystems this paper has focused on the expansion of reservoir storage that would build and operate the rogun and dastijum dams results support our optimism in that they show that the energy and irrigation benefits from building the dams could improve economic benefits for all four countries in the basin opening a negotiating space large enough to permit a true pareto improvement becker 1995 compared to the status quo this makes for an important finding although the really difficult task ahead is to organize the political and administrative cooperation needed for financing the large investments altering the allocation of water in the basin among locations sectors and crops all could require some degree of improvement in irrigation technologies and management as well as including afghanistan in negotiating the sharing of basin water if dastijum is going to be built challenges remain to achieve politically workable implementation to share the gains of water development and allocation among the four riparians our results only indicate possibilities one notable template for success is the north american rio grande compact of 1938 hill 1974 paddock 2001 that compact designed an accounting formula summarizing then recent historical allocations of the basin s headwater flows at the time of negotiating the compact criteria for adjusting the historical record could include things like population levels the human right to water flows assigned to national watersheds of origin and historical injustices ward 2013 important limits of this study include weak hydrologic information throughout the basin as a consequence of a damaged or destroyed hydrometric network making it hard to track recent streamflow data in the basin a similar problem comes from a long history of poor data sharing among the four riparians so little verifiable and consistently collected agricultural data are available on the level of crop production cost yields or crop water use therefore our study required major assumptions on cropped area crop water linkages crop mix streamflows and crop water use few of which were supported by research grade data and reall of which were difficult to verify while a few of the basin s farms continue to use pre 1990 soviet collective resource allocation methods in agriculture our model is based on the presence of efficient institutions such as markets for allocating land water crops and energy it is also based on the presumption that it is both possible and desirable to move scarce water to its highest valued uses another important limit of the study comes from the fact that our conclusions show only the potential economic gains from the development of the dastijum and rogun dam with no details on how that potential could be realized through political negotiation or other action such as the drafting of sustainable self enforcing treaties it is very likely that sustained patient and flexible political negotiations among the riparian countries will be needed to implement policies that could secure and sustain the potential benefits for which our results indicate are only possibilities a further limitation of this work comes from the fact that we conducted no separate analysis for the benefits of flood control or the environmental benefits of protecting or restoring the aral sea it is well known that the soviet government decided in the 1960s to divert the rivers of the amu darya and syr darya to irrigate the desert region surrounding the sea to favor agriculture at the expense of flows to the aral sea by setting up a program to promote agriculture especially cotton the soviet government cut off the aral sea from its two main sources with consequences that have lasted to this day the water level in the aral sea started declining from the 1960s and for the most part has continued before the 1960s the aral sea received about one fifth of its water supply through rainfall while the remainder was supplied by the amu darya and syr darya rivers evaporation losses were about as high as inflows making it sustainable as long as inflows were maintained therefore river diversions for irrigated agriculture have been the main reason for reduction of the aral sea s levels since the 1960s teasley and mckinney 2011 in future work we hope to conduct a research grade economic analysis of the costs and benefits of protecting or restoring the aral sea a longer planning period magnifies the importance of questions about the adequacy of data and increases the value of investments to upgrade the quality and reliability of those data our analysis uses stochastic future water supplies that are compatible with observed data over the available period of record however a more comprehensive analysis would account for stochastic crop prices and yields stochastic water demands and a range of risks associated with future climate variability despite these limits this paper has taken a first step at conducting a comprehensive analysis of policy options for addressing the potential for programs that could improve the

hydrology the essential principle linking the hydrology element is mass balance both for surface flow interactions reservoir levels the hydrology elements use mass balance principles to account for

amu darya river system has several gauges indicated by rectangular boxes river flow at each v th river gauge in each time period in scenario n and policy p x p v y t n p equals the sum of flows over any upstream node for which activities directly influence that flow these include 1 headwater inflows 2 upstream river gauges 3 upstream diversions 4 upstream surface return flows 5 upstream reservoir releases total flows which cannot be negative are defined for each of those five types of nodes respectively as a1 x v v y t n p h b p hv x p h y t n p v b p vv x v v y t n p d b p dv x v d y t n p r b p rv x v r y t n p l b p lv x v l y t n p where the set v defines all river gauges and x v v y t n p is the river flow at any river gauge node in which each river gauge is a single element of the set v each of the five vectors of b p coefficients takes on values of 0 for non contributing sources 1 for sources that add flow and 1 for sources that reduce flow so positive signs in the equation require adding flows and subtractions occur whenever a b p coefficient is negative for example the first term on the right hand of the equal sign h b p hv x v h y t n p sums contributions over the set h of headwater nodes that vector b p hv contains a value of 1 for all immediately upstream headwater gauges that contribute to a river s flow and 0 otherwise where x p h y t n p are known flows at a headwater gauge the second right hand side term v b p vv x v v y t n p sums contributions over the set v of relevant upstream river gauge elements the vector b p vv typically contains a single 1 and the rest zeros the third term d b p dv x v d y t n p sums river flow reductions over the set d of upstream diversion nodes by accounting for upstream diversions the b p dv vector s coefficients are 0 for non diverting locations and for diversions that do not affect the given node s flow but 1 where upstream diversions directly reduce that flow the last two terms similarly account for upstream surface return flows in the set r and upstream reservoir releases that affect river flows in the set l a 6 3 water diverted agricultural irrigation water use is met by river diversions however in many of the world s rivers in dry periods historical record often show periods of zero flow in periods of high demand and low runoff the following equation a wet water condition requires that no diversion exceeds available river flow at the point of diversion so each diversion must be less than the sum of all five classes of upstream sources 1 headwater inflows 2 upstream river gauges 3 upstream diversions 4 upstream surface return flows 5 upstream reservoir releases a diversion which cannot be negative is a2 x p d y t n p h b p hd x v h y t n p v b p vd x v v y t n p d b p dd x v d y t n p r

is an empirically determined proportion of total water applied x v a y t n p for irrigation consumptive is the quantity of water lost through plant evapotranspiration et to any current use in the system for hydropower generation use consumptive use is the quantity of water flowing through turbines however that water quantity could be reused downstream for irrigation if it occurs in the irrigation season that water use generates energy which cannot be negative it is measured as a5 energy prod v y t n p geh v y t n p x v y t n p the parameter energy prod v y t n p is energy production h v y t n p is a reservoir head x v y t n p is total water flow to generate energy in month t of year y in scenario n and policy p remaining coefficients are g gravitational constant g 9 8 n kg e efficiency which can vary from 0 to 1 for agricultural nodes water use is measured as a6 x v u y t n p j k b v u j k u b p uu l v u y t n p consumptive use by irrigation et is derived from total land area in production that use is measured as the sum over crops j and seasons k of empirically estimated et amounts per hectare by node crop and season b v u j k multiplied by an identity matrix b p uu that conforms nodes the result is multiplied by the quantity of land irrigated a 6 6 gross surface returns to river surface return flow to a stream x v r y t n p is another proportion of water applied at each return flow node the return flow coefficient per unit applied b p ar is a return flow proportion of the quantity of water applied x v a y t n p total return flow at a node is a7 x v r y t n p a b p ar x v a y t n p hydrologic balance requires that total water applied is divided among consumptive use seepage and return flow so for any node b p au b p as b p ar must sum to 1 0 although any one of those terms can vary widely by node for example nodes located at a greater hydrologic distance from a stream will see a smaller proportion of surface return flow from a given amount of water applied decisions by policymakers or actions by water users that alter any one of the three coefficients will affect one or both of the other two for agricultural nodes total surface returns to the river are a8 x v r y t n p j k b p r j k u b p ur land v u j k y t n p irrigation surface return flows at each agricultural node r in the month t of year y in scenario n and policy p are derived from

that river flow into it adds to the reservoir s contents outflows reduce contents and also adding to river flow in the downstream reach for the basin as a whole the term b p el is an identity matrix consisting of 1 s on the main diagonal reservoir contents are a9 z v r y t n p z v r t 1 e b p el l b p lr x v l y t n p electric power comes from building and operating a reservoir that has an elevation drop there are few hydroelectric plants in flat places each dam stores water at its reservoir and a higher storage volume of water in the reservoir means that the water falls a greater distance and reaches a greater velocity when passing through the turbines the turbine converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy the hydroelectric generator converts this mechanical energy into electricity the hydraulic head for the r th reservoir s dam in the month t of year y scenario n and policy p was empirically estimated to fit conditions for both rogun and dastijum reservoirs a10 h v r y t n p b 0 b 1 1 z v r y t n p the principle behind this equation is this on the basis of known limited data on both reservoirs water volume which if operated to produce power depends on height of dam to find nonlinear relation between storage volume and head of the dam so the model tracks head based on reservoir storage contents of the r th reservoir in the initial period 0 z v r0 a11 z v r 0 0 the upper bound on each r th reservoir s contents is a12 z v r y t n p max c r this equation guarantees that the r th reservoir s level never exceeds its capacity policies that would change a reservoir s capacity such as dredging or adding to a dam s height are simulated by altering the value of c r a 6 8 land use land use patterns affect the demand for water for irrigated agriculture total land in production is expressed as a13 j k land v u j k y t n p land p u y t n p this states that irrigated land in production by node crop season and time summed over crops and seasons cannot exceed available land land p u y t n p in most dry rural regions of the world like the amu darya basin water can be more limiting than land we used the maximum current capacity in irrigated land for countries of the basin as the upper limit on available land still more area will likely become available if greater long term water supplies can be secured and if institutions adjust to permit the extra water to be used by agriculture the baseline policy analysis is constrained to replicate historical irrigated land by country and crop for the two alternative policies those constraints are removed by allowing water tradeoffs to occur either within a single or among irrigated areas either policy permits existing water to be reallocated to higher economic valued water uses where the economics would support such a reallocation a 6 9 economics economic benefits are secured by water consumption at use nodes for irrigated agriculture and by water flowing through turbines to generate energy at reservoir nodes for agricultural uses the willingness to pay is measured by the contribution of water to net farm income which equals crop price multiplied by yield minus cost of production plus any unpriced consumer surplus consumer surplus is an unpriced value equal to the amount by which power buyers economic welfare exceeds the actual price charged it is measured as the area beneath the demand function and above actual price charged for energy benefits total revenue is measured as the price of electricity multiplied by the quantity produced in the current implementation of the model that electricity price is set at recent observed levels in the basin reduced prices from additional hydropower will raise consumer surplus while increased prices will reduce consumer surplus for regions of the basin that currently have little access to power increases in consumer surplus are economically and politically very important to achieve agricultural benefits are measured as a14 ag ben v u y t n p j k p p j y t np yield p u j k c p u j k where ag ben v u y t n p is agricultural benefits p p j y t n p is price of each crop yield p u j k crop yield in u node and c p u j k is cost of production in that node u per crop j in season k the parameters yield p u j k and c p u j k are given however p p j y t n p price of particular crop is a negatively sloping demand function which means that one price is set for each crop for all riparian countries so any crop can migrate to its most favorable economic conditions this means that a15 p p j y t n p γ
