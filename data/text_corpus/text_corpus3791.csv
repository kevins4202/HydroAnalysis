efficiency this study aims to investigate the impact of humic acids ha on the various processes in a batch anaerobic digestion process for this purpose clean sludge was cultivated in a laboratory to avoid hss presence the cultivated sludge was used in a series of batch experiments with humic acids added at different levels a complete ad test as well as three sub phase tests hydrolytic phase acidogenic phase methanogenic phase was performed and analyzed with and without ha dosing in the single phase ad system dosing with ha inhibited the methanogenic efficiency by 35 1 at ha vss 15 however the effects of ha on the three sub phases revealed something very different ha inhibited hydrolytic efficiency by 38 2 promoted acidogenic efficiency by 101 5 and finally inhibited methanogenic efficiency by 52 2 the combined efficiency of the three sub phases without ha dosing is calculated at 15 7 and with ha dosing ha vss 15 at 10 2 overall the combined inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases is equal to 35 0 which is almost identical 35 1 to the result observed in the single phase ad process the possible mechanisms behind the phenomena were analyzed and summarized

wastewater treatment plants wwtps toward carbon neutrality is a key issue around the world and so means of capturing organic energy from excess sludge have made anaerobic digestion ad regain popularity again appels et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 hao et al 2015 2017b although ad can convert excess sludge into biogas ch4 relatively easily appels et al 2011 its conversion efficiency is not very great due to the stable structure of bacterial cells and refractory organics such as lignocellulose substances and humic substances hss liu et al 2016 moreover hss contained in excess sludge account for about 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss which are produced during the decay and transformation of organic substances and can inhibit the process of ad and thus become an obstacle to the conversion of organic compounds into energy chen et al 2008 li et al 2014 azman et al 2017 as a major form of hss humic acids ha have very complicated chemical structures and contain many active functional groups such as carboxylic acid phenolic alcoholic hydroxyls quinone and ketone groups yang et al 2014 which have hydrophobic surfactant properties and behave with a high degree of aromaticity h c 1 dang et al 2016 the complexity of ha makes it difficult to understand the effects and mechanisms of ha on an ad system kyzas et al 2017 long et al 2017 the inhibiting phenomena of ha on the hydrolysis of organic substances has been extensively observed with key hydrolytic enzymes qi et al 2004 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ye et al 2016 azman et al 2017 and the effect is often related to the carboxylic and phenolic groups however ha could enhance acidification potentially due to quinone and ketone groups with the ability to shuttle electrons electron transferring capacity etc thauer et al 1977 piepenbrock and kappler 2012 yuan et al 2017 finally ha can also inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and or aceticlastic methanogenesis supposedly due to its negative charge on its surface and or the capacity as terminal electron acceptor tea khadem et al 2017 liu et al 2015 there have been some studies about ha evolving in ad but always with model substances or synthesized wastewater moura et al 2007 feng et al 2008 azman et al 2017 individual studies focusing on single phases of ad only reveal evidence of ha partially inhibiting ad and there is still much to be done before full understanding is achieved however this study does demonstrate some progress towards a fuller understanding in it clean excess sludge which was cultured in a sbr tank with a synthetic substrate containing no hss was used to ascertain the effects of different levels of ha on both the single and the sub phases hydrolytic phase acidogenic phase hydrolytic phase of the processes of ad the intention of the study was to ascertain the mechanisms of how ha can affect a lab scale ad system as well as the efficiency of inhibition or promotion 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultured and inoculum sludge there are both original hss and metal irons like ca2 mg2 al3 fe3 etc in excess sludge from wwtps for this reason difficulties arise when studying the inhibiting effect of hss on ad due to the possible interactions between hss and metal ions azman et al 2015 cruz zavala et al 2016 therefore a synthetic substrate with trace metals and no hss was used to culture clean excess sludge the composition of this synthetic substrate is listed in table 1 a sbr tank was used to culture the sludge and was operated at v 60 l hrt 3 d and srt 12 d with aeration for 22 h and settlement for 2 h every day the sludge was collected and concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter sieved and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was taken from a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german with srt 32 d which was originally used for feeding municipal excess sludge and was later to be fed with the clean cultured sludge for half a year in this way hss contained in the fermenter were fully washed out and the clean inoculum sludge was obtained prior to taking inoculum sludge for the experiments the fermenter cease to both feed and discharge for a week so that biodegradable low molecular dissolved organics blmdo could be totally consumed to avoid a sudden initial biogas peak in the experiments the characteristics of both concentrated and inoculum sludge are listed in table 2 2 2 characteristics of humic acids ha in this study a merchant ha was selected to replace the genuine ha contained in excess sludge the similarity of the two types of has was first evaluated using a thermo fisher ftir fourier transform infrared spectrometer as shown in fig 1 in which specific molecular structures and chemical functional groups can easily be compared fig 1 shows there were no significant difference between two types of has at the wavenumber from 4 000 to 1700 cm 1 two wide strong absorption peaks occurred between 3500 and 3100 cm 1 which are considered to have been caused by the absorption of associative oh stretching vibration in the hydroxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups respectively the acromion peaks at 2925 and 2850 cm 1 represent the anti symmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration of the groups ch2 in the aliphatic alkane structures respectively which are the typical absorption peaks of alkane structures in short the results demonstrate that both types of has contain phenolic hydroxyl alcoholic hydroxyl groups and alkane structures minor changes occur between 1700 and 1250 cm 1 the typical absorption peaks of the ha used in this study at 1583 and 1395 cm 1 are caused by anti symmetric shrinkage of functional groups carboxylate coo phenolic carbonyl co phenolic carboxylate coo and phenolic hydroxyl oh vibration however the typical absorption peaks of ha in the real sludge occur at 1658 and 1534 cm 1 representing highly conjugated carbonyl c o and aromatic carbonyl c o amide vibration in ii bending plane major differences occur between 1250 and 400 cm 1 it is possible that these are caused by some impurities in ha and have nothing to do with the structures of ha finally a quantitative analysis at the wavenumber from 4000 to 1250 cm 1 by ftir spectrometer identification software reveals that the similarity between the two types of ha is as high as 87 3 which demonstrates that the merchant ha used in this study functions as a suitable replacement for ha in real sludge 2 3 set up of batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 600 ml serum bottles working volume 400 ml headspace volume 200 ml 20 bottle tests each time each bottle was fed with mixed sludge concentrated and inoculum sludge to 400 ml at a vss ratio of 3 1 designed dosages of ha were also added followed by ph being adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m the testing bottles were divided into four groups to analyze their hydrolytic acidogenic and methanogenic phases i group a had the ch4 inhibitor bres the methyl com enzyme like substance added to it to prevent methanogenic phase occurring it was mainly used for analyzing the liquid samples in both the hydrolytic and acidogenic phases ii groups mg two sub groups mg1 and mg2 in parallel were used to analyze biogas and ch4 production in which the liquid samples were held in to minimize experimental errors following this the liquid samples were prepared for analysis of the methanogenic phase iii group w was used to analyze the whole ad process including both liquid and gas samples in each of the group tests five different concentrations of ha ha vss were added as follows 0 r0 5 r1 10 r2 15 r3 and 20 r4 filled testing bottles were all purged with n2 for 3 min and were then sealed with rubber stoppers and moved into an air bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c the ending period of ad was determined by biogas volume produced some 1 2 of the totally accumulated volume of biogas in a tested period the operational parameters of the group tests are illustrated in table 3 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples were separated from testing bottles and were immediately analyzed for ph and orp oxidation reduction potential following which they were centrifuged at 11 000 rpm and 4 c for 5 min centrifuged supernatant samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters to analyze i scod by the standard method k2cr2o7 apha et al 1998 ii vfas using ion chromatographer 883 basic ic plus metrohm ag iii soluble polysaccharide and protein by phenol sulfuric acid and the lorry method respectively apha et al 1998 biogas production was measured by a gas liquid device and the biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatographer gc126 shanghai inesa five strains of microorganisms associated with the acidogenic phase and two stains of microorganisms associated with the methanogenic phase were respectively detected by fish fluorescence in situ hybridization with the help of a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm700 according to the procedure of our previous studies hao et al 2017b fluorescence labels of the oligonucleotide probes and their target microorganisms and corresponding gene sequences are listed in table 4 other liquid samples were washed with 100 mm phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 4 mlss samples were sonicated at 4 c for 30 min and then separated by centrifuging at 11 000 rpm and 4 c for 30 min treated supernatants were placed on ice bags in order to analyze the activities of their enzymes different enzymes were analyzed by different methods including amylase dns method protease l lysine

single phase anaerobic digestion ad 3 1 1 biogas production the accumulated biogas produced in the group w tests is shown in fig 2 the biogas production tended to decrease with increasing dosages of ha until above ha 10 an inhibition level of approximately 35 in biogas production was reached the results confirm that ha can indeed inhibit biogas production in the batch ad system however the ch4 content in each group test did not change significantly all being within the range of 66 p 0 05 daily see the upper left corner and accumulated ch4 productions are shown in fig 3 the daily ch4 production in each test steadily increased until they reached their peak points but the blank test reached its peak point two days earlier day 6 than other tests with ha dosed again confirming ha inhibiting on the batch ad process thus it can be seen that the organic conversion efficiency to energy ch4 was largely inhibited with increased ha dosage 3 1 2 energy ch4 conversion efficiency the ad efficiency calculated by eq 2 is respectively at 15 8 r0 13 7 r1 11 1 r2 10 1 r3 and 10 4 r4 clearly energy conversion efficiency decreased along with increasing ha dosage in the tests according to eq 3 the ch4 inhibition efficiency of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are respectively at 12 3 28 8 35 1 and 33 5 as shown in fig 4 the strongest inhibition 35 1 occurred at over ha vss 5 the mechanisms of ha inhibiting the batch ad system should also be evaluated hereto the sub phases of the ad system hydrolytic acidogenic and methanogenic phase was further studied respectively 3 2 effect of ha on the hydrolytic phase 3 2 1 scod in the group a tests with the activity of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria being only due to the addition of inhibitor bres for methanogens biogas could not be produced and scod remained in the liquid phase under these conditions the scod level in the group a tests represented the maximum produced and accumulated scod amounts in the batch ad system as shown in fig 5 scod showed a waving mode with the same changing trend in all three experiments firstly increasing due to hydrolytic bacteria and then decreasing due to consumption by acidogenic bacteria and also being bound by ha owing to the electrostatic force and sweep flocculation by its functional groups fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 in which the hydrolytic rate of the substrate could not be judged as increasing or decreasing and the differences of scod between the tests were caused by dosed ha also scod 3 2 2 first order kinetic rate applying eq 1 the first order kinetic rate can be estimated based on the data in fig 3 with the results being shown in table 5 the calculated results reveal that ha decreased the hydrolytic rate of the substrate 3 2 3 activity of the hydrolytic enzymes the first order kinetic rate only represents the hydrolytic rate of the substrate while hydrolytic efficiency depends on the activity of the associated hydrolytic enzymes liu et al 2015 the concentrations of polysaccharide and protein and the activities of α amylase and protease on day 3 are shown in fig 6 the activities of α amylase and proteinase slightly decreased at the beginning and then sharply decreased with increasing ha dosages in the test of r4 ha vss 20 the activities of the key enzymes were strongly inhibited and the inhibited efficiencies of α amylase and proteinase were at 59 0 and 87 6 respectively as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of both polysaccharide and protein in the r0 test are at the lowest values almost fully hydrolyzed while those in the r4 test are at the highest values partly hydrolyzed possible mechanisms behind the phenomena could be attributed to three pathways as shown in fig 7 i electrostatic force ii covalent bond iii sweep flocculation brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 in general only a small dosage of ha would behave the impact on the enzymes by electrostatic force which would inhibit hydrolysis brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 however with increasing ha dosage the rejection from negative charge of ha would become stronger than its hydrophobic interaction with the enzymes ha would release the bound enzymes and mitigate the hydrolysis inhibition to some extent fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 moreover there are always interactions of covalent bond and sweep flocculation between ha and the enzymes fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 when ha dosage increases to a certain level the dominant interaction would become covalent bond which would cause the strong inhibiting effect on the hydrolytic phase due to its irreversibility 3 2 4 hydrolytic efficiency ha also contributed to scod refractory when added to the testing bottles and so the different ha dosage in the tests contributed to the concentrations of scod in the supernatants an accurate measurement of hydrolytic efficiency must exclude this part of scod and thus the changed values of scod δscod from the starting point 30 min to the ending point day 11 were taken as shown in fig 8 calculated by eq 3 the hydrolytic efficiency in the r0 test is at top 1 10 2 followed by r4 10 1 r1 9 7 r2 9 3 and r3 6 3 which confirms that ha can indeed inhibit the hydrolytic process above a certain level of ha moura et al 2007 feng et al 2008 azman et al 2017 interestingly the hydrolytic efficiency increased with ha vss 20 in r4 which can be attributed to the increase in electrostatic repulsion by the ionization process from the functional groups of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl as a result the organics bound by ha were released into the liquid phase and the inhibition of ha on the hydrolytic phase was weakened feng et al 2008 long et al 2017 3 3 effect of ha on the acidogenic phase 3 3 1 orp the monitored orp and ph values in the group a tests are shown in fig 9 the initial orp values were all in the region of 425 mv which reveals that ha had no biochemical function for changing orp at the start of the process polak et al 2009 however the orp situation gradually changed as particular organics were oxidized to small molecule organics and vfas which led to orp suddenly increasing on day 2 and stabilizing on day 5 also with decrease in ph levels the changing opr values meant that acidification was occurring and a high ha content corresponded to a low orp fig 9 in short use of ha led to a decrease in orp clearly ha influenced the biochemical conversion after the tests started in fact the functional groups of ha quinone and other nitrogen sulfur groups etc make good electron transferring chains etc and play a key role as electron transport agents in the acidogenic phase similar to the function of the catalyst ha as an electron transferring carrier on accelerating the reaction rate for this reason ha can promote the electron transferring ability of organic conversion in the acidogenic phase and also change the oxidation reduction quality of the system after which it causes a decrease in orp as the ha dosage is increased 3 3 2 vfas and activities of key enzymes variable orp meant different acidogenic efficiencies the changing concentrations of vfas acetate propionate butyrate isobutyrate valerate and isovalerate are shown in fig 10 due to the inhibition of bres in the conversion of vfas into ch4 vfas accumulated with increasing ha dosage on day 7 fig 10 the total vfas tvfa concentration in the r0 r4 tests reached up to 1145 1325 mg l with the increased percentages in the r1 r4 tests respectively at 8 11 3 13 4 and 15 7 compared to the r0 test ha existing in the batch ad system was able to stimulate the acidogenic phase on day 11 the acidogenic process reached its maximum levels 1193 1386 mg l compared to r0 the maximal acidification efficiency in r4 increased by 13 8 although there were no important differences in the accumulated vfa contents at different ha dosages the time it took to reach peak levels was quite different a high ha dosage corresponded to a fast acidification rate as described above the polysaccharides and proteins the substrate of acidification formed from the hydrolytic were also different in the group a tests we can see therefore that there were both negative and positive different effects of ha dosage i inhibiting the hydrolytic phase ii stimulating the acidogenic phase finally it is noteworthy that the two effects on tvfa increased along with ha dosing various vfa concentrations steadily increased along with ha dosing as shown in fig 11 higher acetate and propionate concentrations in the dosed ha tests demonstrate that ha can indeed stimulate the acidogenic phase from day 9 to day 11 surprisingly propionate in r2 r3 and r4 gradually decreased and acetate correspondingly increased for the stimulation mechanism of ha on the acidogenic phase there are two possible explanations 1 ha directly changed the activities of enzymes or microorganisms and then stimulated the acidogenic phase in fact as shown in table 6 the associated key enzymes por ak pta bk ptb etc underwent no significant changes in any of the tests p 0 05 moreover as shown in fig 12 fish was applied to analyze the impact of ha on the microbial community the sum of integral optical density iod was used to represent the abundance of microorganisms instead of average iod the results illustrate that the microorganisms involved in the acidogenic phase fish also behaved no significances for this reason ha seemed not to simulate acidification by changing the activities of enzymes 2 ha could stimulate acidification as an active terminal electron acceptor tea or the electron transferring chains etc from the functional groups quinone etc in the normal acidogenic phase there are two obstacles which inhibit acidification i non methanogens like fermenting bacteria lack the electron transport system and have to release surplus electrons produced by the fermenting process to other substrates otherwise the acetate produced process would be hindered ii the thermodynamics of bio conversions indicates that the gibbs free energy g0ˊ of different vfas converted into acetate is over zero g0ˊ 0 as shown in table 7 thauer et al 1977 cervantes et al 2000 which means that the bio conversions occur spontaneously by controlling the hydrogen pressure otherwise they would consume outer energy and hinder their metabolisms when ha was added in the tests for example anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonnat aqds a ha quinone analogue would not only act as tea for accepting the surplus electrons from propionate the bio conversion could also lead to a spontaneous reaction g0ˊ 0 after which the hydrogen pressure in the tests would no longer be a decisive factor moreover decreased orps could indirectly stimulate the conversion of vfas so we can see that ha therefore had the positive effect on the acidogenic phase of improving the acidogenic efficiency 3 3 3 acidogenic efficiency the acidogenic efficiency was calculated by eq 4 and the results are shown in fig 13 the acidogenic efficiencies 78 124 of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are all higher than those of r0 61 6 specifically the acidogenic efficiency 124 1 of r3 is two times higher that of r0 the acidogenic efficiency over 100 implies that not only δsocd was all converted into vfas but some initial scod was also converted into vfas as tea the capacity of ha for accepting electrons in the system could increase along with the ha dosage which would cause higher levels of acidogenic efficiency as shown in fig 13 however the acidogenic efficiency at the highest ha dosage r4 ha vss 20 did not reach the highest level below 124 in r3 table 7 indicates that 1 mol of propionate can directly be converted into 2 mol of acetate at least in theory with ha involved in the tests however only 1 mol of acetate could be acquired in other words the highest ha dosage did not correspond to the highest acidogenic efficiency as most of hydrolytic organics are likely to be converted into co2 not into acetate 3 4 effect of ha on the methanogenic phase 3 4 1 activities of key enzymes and microorganisms the methanogenic phase was analyzed in a whole batch ad system group mg the activities of a key enzyme f420 reducing hydrogenase are shown in table 8 the relative activities of f420 are at 100 r0 87 5 r1 81 0 r2 70 8 r3 and 63 2 r4 respectively clearly ha is able to lower the activities of the key enzyme and inhibit the methanogenic phase the abundance of the involved fermentative bacteria measured by fish is illustrated in fig 14 there are minor differences among different tests revealing almost no impact of ha on the involved microorganisms ha could inhibit the methanogenic phase via two pathways i as a terminal electron acceptor tea ha directly accepts the electrons from acetate and prevents them from being converted to ch4 eq 12 in table 9 although g0ˊfor the direct oxidation of ha with acetate eq 12 and for the conversion of acetate to ch4 eq 11 are all less than zero spontaneous reactions eq 11 is more successful with the help of methanogenic bacteria in the system while eq 12 is based on the respiration of special functional bacteria humic substance reducing bacteria etc lovley et al 1996 therefore this inhibiting pathway was probably not relevant in our systems since the cultures were grown in absence of ha cervantes et al 2000 ii ha can resemble a metabolic intermediate substance and hinder the successful transformation of acetate to ch4 and ha might compete for metabolites which could lead to the normal methane pathway being blocked liu et al 2016 as for the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the reaction rate of h2 with co2 eq 13 in table 9 could be much faster than that of h2 with ha eq 14 the impact of ha on this bioreaction is not as yet clear moreover other studies smith et al 2015 dang et al 2016 conclude that ha might promote the metabolisms of other syntrophic bacteria and cause the failure of methanogens competition in the ad system instead of decreasing ch4 production li et al 2015 azman 2016 despite progress made it is clear that a further study is still needed to address this question 3 4 2 methanogenic efficiency the methanogenic efficiency calculated by eq 6 is shown in fig 15 in the r0 test this reached up to 250 0 for which not only all vfas but also other organics were involved accounting for about 150 in addition the methanogenic efficiency in r1 r2 r3 and r4 reached 131 176 but they are noticeably lower than in r0 revealing that ha had indeed inhibited the ch4 production with a maximal reduced efficiency of up to 120 r3 in other words the methanogenic efficiency was suppressed by approximately half 52 2 calculated by eq 3 3 5 summary of the possible mechanisms the possible mechanisms of ha inhibition in the batch ad system are shown in fig 16 the red data line label represents the negative effects of ha on the ad process and the green data line label stands for the positive effects ha behaved differently in the three phases during the hydrolysis phase the activities of the associated key enzymes were lower and the hydrolytic process was inhibited the hydrolytic efficiency in the test without ha dosage was at 10 2 while the test with ha dosed ha vss 15 decreased to 6 3 accounting for an inhibition efficiency up to 38 2 in the acidogenic phase ha acted as terminal electron acceptors tea or electron transferring chains etc to promote the acidogenic process and the acidogenic efficiency increased to 124 1 ha vss 15 from 61 6 ha vss 0 elucidating a promotion efficiency up to 101 5 in the methanogenic phase however ha decreased the methanogenic efficiency by 52 2 250 at ha vss 0 was lowered to 130 5 at ha vss 15 due to inhibiting the activities of the involved key enzymes the fish results demonstrate that ha had almost no effect on the involved microorganisms by fish in both acidogenic and methanogenic phase with ha dosed overall the combined efficiency of the three sub phases without ha dosing is calculated at 10 2 61 6 250 15 7 which is in accordance with the calculated result by eq 2 as for the test with ha vss 15 the combined efficiency of the three sub phases is at 6 3 124 1 130 5 10 2 finally the whole inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases can be calculated by eq 3 at 15 7 10 2 15 7 35 0 which is almost identical 35 1 to the result observed in the single phase ad process section 3 1 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion ad of excess sludge can convert contained organics into energy ch4 but the existence of humic acid ha contained in sludge acts to create a negative effect on the energy efficiency in this study a single phase and three sub phases hydrolytic phase acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase of ad were respectively tested and analyzed without and with ha dosing in the batch ad systems in the single phase ad dosed ha did indeed inhibit the methanogenic efficiency by 35 1 at ha vss 15 due to the complex chemical structural characteristics however the effects of ha on the three sub phases was totally different ha resulted in lowering the activities of the associated enzymes and also the first order kinetic rates in the hydrolytic phase acting as an inhibiting agent by 38 2 at ha vss 15 in the acidogenic phase ha acted in the role of etc or tea stimulating acidification and resulting in a promoting function by 101 5 at ha vss 15 finally in the methanogenic phase ha inhibited a key enzyme f420 and reduced the ch4 production by 52 2 at ha vss 15 overall the combined efficiency of the three sub phases without ha dosing is calculated at 15 7 and that of the three sub phases at ha vss 15 at 10 2 finally the whole inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases is equal to 35 0 which is almost identical 35 1 to the result observed in the single phase ad process agreement all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript they warrant that the article is the

obstacle to the conversion of organic compounds into energy chen et al 2008 li et al 2014 azman et al 2017 as a major form of hss humic acids ha have very complicated chemical structures and contain many active functional groups such as carboxylic acid phenolic alcoholic hydroxyls quinone and ketone groups yang et al 2014 which have hydrophobic surfactant properties and behave with a high degree of aromaticity h c 1 dang et al 2016 the complexity of ha makes it difficult to understand the effects and mechanisms of ha on an ad system kyzas et al 2017 long et al 2017 the inhibiting phenomena of ha on the hydrolysis of organic substances has been extensively observed with key hydrolytic enzymes qi et al 2004 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ye et al 2016 azman et al 2017 and the effect is often related to the carboxylic and phenolic groups however ha could enhance acidification potentially due to quinone and ketone groups with the ability to shuttle electrons electron transferring capacity etc thauer et al 1977 piepenbrock and kappler 2012 yuan et al 2017 finally ha can also inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and or aceticlastic methanogenesis supposedly due to its negative charge on its surface and or the capacity as terminal electron acceptor tea khadem et al 2017 liu et al 2015 there have been some studies about ha evolving in ad but always with model substances or synthesized wastewater moura et al 2007 feng et al 2008 azman et al 2017 individual studies focusing on single phases of ad only reveal evidence of ha partially inhibiting ad and there is still much to be done before full understanding is achieved however this study does demonstrate some progress towards a fuller understanding in it clean excess sludge which was cultured in a sbr tank with a synthetic substrate containing no hss was used to ascertain the effects of different levels of ha on both the single and the sub phases hydrolytic phase acidogenic phase hydrolytic phase of the processes of ad the intention of the study was to ascertain the mechanisms of how ha can affect a lab scale ad system as well as the efficiency of inhibition or promotion 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultured and inoculum sludge there are both original hss and metal irons like ca2 mg2 al3 fe3 etc in excess sludge from wwtps for this reason difficulties arise when studying the inhibiting effect of hss on ad due to the possible interactions between hss and metal ions azman et al 2015 cruz zavala et al 2016 therefore a synthetic substrate with trace metals and no hss was used to culture clean excess sludge the composition of this synthetic substrate is listed in table 1 a sbr tank was used to culture the sludge and was operated at v 60 l hrt 3 d and srt 12 d with aeration for 22 h and settlement for 2 h every day the sludge was collected and concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter sieved and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was taken from a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german with srt 32 d which was originally used for feeding municipal excess sludge and was later to be fed with the clean cultured sludge for half a year in this way hss contained in the fermenter were fully washed out and the clean inoculum sludge was obtained prior to taking inoculum sludge for the experiments the fermenter cease to both feed and discharge for a week so that biodegradable low molecular dissolved organics blmdo could be totally consumed to avoid a sudden initial biogas peak in the experiments the characteristics of both concentrated and inoculum sludge are listed in table 2 2 2 characteristics of humic acids ha in this study a merchant ha was selected to replace the genuine ha contained in excess sludge the similarity of the two types of has was first evaluated using a thermo fisher ftir fourier transform infrared spectrometer as shown in fig 1 in which specific molecular structures and chemical functional groups can easily be compared fig 1 shows there were no significant difference between two types of has at the wavenumber from 4 000 to 1700 cm 1 two wide strong absorption peaks occurred between 3500 and 3100 cm 1 which are considered to have been caused by the absorption of associative oh stretching vibration in the hydroxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups respectively the acromion peaks at 2925 and 2850 cm 1 represent the anti symmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration of the groups ch2 in the aliphatic alkane structures respectively which are the typical absorption peaks of alkane structures in short the results demonstrate that both types of has contain phenolic hydroxyl alcoholic hydroxyl groups and alkane structures minor changes occur between 1700 and 1250 cm 1 the typical absorption peaks of the ha used in this study at 1583 and 1395 cm 1 are caused by anti symmetric shrinkage of functional groups carboxylate coo phenolic carbonyl co phenolic carboxylate coo and phenolic hydroxyl oh vibration however the typical absorption peaks of ha in the real sludge occur at 1658 and 1534 cm 1 representing highly conjugated carbonyl c o and aromatic carbonyl c o amide vibration in ii bending plane major differences occur between 1250 and 400 cm 1 it is possible that these are caused by some impurities in ha and have nothing to do with the structures of ha finally a quantitative analysis at the wavenumber from 4000 to 1250 cm 1 by ftir spectrometer identification software reveals that the similarity between the two types of ha is as high as 87 3 which demonstrates that the merchant ha used in this study functions as a suitable replacement for ha in real sludge 2 3 set up of batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 600 ml serum bottles working volume 400 ml headspace volume 200 ml 20 bottle tests each time each bottle was fed with mixed sludge concentrated and inoculum sludge to 400 ml at a vss ratio of 3 1 designed dosages of ha were also added followed by ph being adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m the testing bottles were divided into four groups to analyze their hydrolytic acidogenic and methanogenic phases i group a had the ch4 inhibitor bres the methyl com enzyme like substance added to it to prevent methanogenic phase occurring it was mainly used for analyzing the liquid samples in both the hydrolytic and acidogenic phases ii groups mg two sub groups mg1 and mg2 in parallel were used to analyze biogas and ch4 production in which the liquid samples were held in to minimize experimental errors following this the liquid samples were prepared for analysis of the methanogenic phase iii group w was used to analyze the whole ad process including both liquid and gas samples in each of the group tests five different concentrations of ha ha vss were added as follows 0 r0 5 r1 10 r2 15 r3 and 20 r4 filled testing bottles were all purged with n2 for 3 min and were then sealed with rubber stoppers and moved into an air bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c the ending period of ad was determined by biogas volume produced some 1 2 of the totally accumulated volume of biogas in a tested period the operational parameters of the group tests are illustrated in table 3 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples were separated from testing bottles and were immediately analyzed for ph and orp oxidation reduction potential following which they

by a gas liquid device and the biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatographer gc126 shanghai inesa five strains of microorganisms associated with the acidogenic phase and two stains of microorganisms associated with the methanogenic phase were respectively detected by fish fluorescence in situ hybridization with the help of a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm700 according to the procedure of our previous studies hao et al 2017b fluorescence labels of the oligonucleotide probes and their target microorganisms and corresponding gene sequences are listed in table 4 other liquid samples were washed with 100 mm phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 4 mlss samples were sonicated at 4 c for 30 min and then separated by centrifuging at 11 000 rpm and 4 c for 30 min

single phase anaerobic digestion ad 3 1 1 biogas production the accumulated biogas produced in the group w tests is shown in fig 2 the biogas production tended to decrease with increasing dosages of ha until above ha 10 an inhibition level of approximately 35 in biogas production was reached the results confirm that ha can indeed inhibit biogas production in the batch ad system however the ch4 content in each group test did not change significantly all being within the range of 66 p 0 05 daily see the upper left corner and accumulated ch4 productions are shown in fig 3 the daily ch4 production in each test steadily increased until they reached their peak points but the blank test reached its peak point two days earlier day 6 than other tests with ha dosed again confirming ha inhibiting on the batch ad process thus it can be seen that the organic conversion efficiency to energy ch4 was largely inhibited with increased ha dosage 3 1 2 energy ch4 conversion efficiency the ad efficiency calculated by eq 2 is respectively at 15 8 r0 13 7 r1 11 1 r2 10 1 r3 and 10 4 r4 clearly energy conversion efficiency decreased along with increasing ha dosage in the tests according to eq 3 the ch4 inhibition efficiency of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are respectively at 12 3 28 8 35 1 and 33 5 as shown in fig 4 the strongest inhibition 35 1 occurred at over ha vss 5 the mechanisms of ha inhibiting the batch ad system should also be evaluated hereto the sub phases of the ad system hydrolytic acidogenic and methanogenic phase was further studied respectively 3 2 effect of ha on the hydrolytic phase 3 2 1 scod in the group a tests with the activity of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria being only due to the addition of inhibitor bres for methanogens biogas could not be produced and scod remained in the liquid phase under these conditions the scod level in the group a tests represented the maximum produced and accumulated scod amounts in the batch ad system as shown in fig 5 scod showed a waving mode with the same changing trend in all three experiments firstly increasing due to hydrolytic bacteria and then decreasing due to consumption by acidogenic bacteria and also being bound by ha owing to the electrostatic force and sweep flocculation by its functional groups fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 in which the hydrolytic rate of the substrate could not be judged as increasing or decreasing and the differences of scod between the tests were caused by dosed ha also scod 3 2 2 first order kinetic rate applying eq 1 the first order kinetic rate can be estimated based on the data in fig 3 with the results being shown in table 5 the calculated results reveal that ha decreased the hydrolytic rate of the substrate 3 2 3 activity of the hydrolytic enzymes the first order kinetic rate only represents the hydrolytic rate of the substrate while hydrolytic efficiency depends on the activity of the associated hydrolytic enzymes liu et al 2015 the concentrations of polysaccharide and protein and the activities of α amylase and protease on day 3 are shown in fig 6 the activities of α amylase and proteinase slightly decreased at the beginning and then sharply decreased with increasing ha dosages in the test of r4 ha vss 20 the activities of the key enzymes were strongly inhibited and the inhibited efficiencies of α amylase and proteinase were at 59 0 and 87 6 respectively as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of both polysaccharide and protein in the r0 test are at the lowest values almost fully hydrolyzed while those in the r4 test are at the highest values partly hydrolyzed possible mechanisms behind the phenomena could be attributed to three pathways as shown in fig 7 i electrostatic force ii covalent bond iii sweep flocculation brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 in general only a small dosage of ha would behave the impact on the enzymes by electrostatic force which would inhibit hydrolysis brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 however with increasing ha dosage the rejection from negative charge of ha would become stronger than its hydrophobic interaction with the enzymes ha would release the bound enzymes and mitigate the hydrolysis inhibition to some extent fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 moreover there are always interactions of covalent bond and sweep flocculation between ha and the enzymes fernandes et al 2015 liu et al 2015 when ha dosage increases to a certain level the dominant interaction would become covalent bond which would cause the strong inhibiting effect on the hydrolytic phase due to its irreversibility 3 2 4 hydrolytic efficiency ha also contributed to scod refractory when added to the testing bottles and so the different ha dosage in the tests contributed to the concentrations of scod in the supernatants an accurate measurement of hydrolytic efficiency must exclude this part of scod and thus the changed values of scod δscod from the starting point 30 min to the ending point day 11 were taken as shown in fig 8 calculated by eq 3 the hydrolytic efficiency in the r0 test is at top 1 10 2 followed by r4 10 1 r1 9 7 r2 9 3 and r3 6 3 which confirms that ha can indeed inhibit the hydrolytic process above a certain level of ha moura et al 2007 feng et al 2008 azman et al 2017 interestingly the hydrolytic efficiency increased with ha vss 20 in r4 which can be attributed to the increase in electrostatic repulsion by the ionization process from the functional groups of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl as a result the organics bound by ha were released into the liquid phase and the inhibition of ha on the hydrolytic phase was weakened feng et al 2008 long et al 2017 3 3 effect of ha on the acidogenic phase 3 3 1 orp the monitored orp and ph values in the group a tests are shown in fig 9 the initial orp values were all in the region of 425 mv which reveals that ha had no biochemical function for changing orp at the start of the process polak et al 2009 however the orp situation gradually changed as particular organics were oxidized to small molecule organics and vfas which led to orp suddenly increasing on day 2 and stabilizing on day 5 also with decrease in ph levels the changing opr values meant that acidification was occurring and a high ha content corresponded to a low orp fig 9 in short use of ha led to a decrease in orp clearly ha influenced the biochemical conversion after the tests started in fact the functional groups of ha quinone and other nitrogen sulfur groups etc make good electron transferring chains etc and play a key role as electron transport agents in the acidogenic phase similar to the function of the catalyst ha as an electron transferring carrier on accelerating the reaction rate for this reason ha can promote the electron transferring ability of organic conversion in the acidogenic phase and also change the oxidation reduction quality of the system after which it causes a decrease in orp as the ha dosage is increased 3 3 2 vfas and activities of key enzymes variable orp meant different acidogenic efficiencies the changing concentrations of vfas acetate propionate butyrate isobutyrate valerate and isovalerate are shown in fig 10 due to the inhibition of bres in the conversion of vfas into ch4 vfas accumulated with increasing ha dosage on day 7 fig 10 the total vfas tvfa concentration in the r0 r4 tests reached up to 1145 1325 mg l with the increased percentages in the r1 r4 tests respectively at 8 11 3 13 4 and 15 7 compared to the r0 test ha existing in the batch ad system was able to stimulate the acidogenic phase on day 11 the acidogenic process reached its maximum levels 1193 1386 mg l compared to r0 the maximal acidification efficiency in r4 increased by 13 8 although there were no important differences in the accumulated vfa contents at different ha dosages the time it took to reach peak levels was quite different a high ha dosage corresponded to a fast acidification rate as described above the polysaccharides and proteins the substrate of acidification formed from the hydrolytic were also different in the group a tests we can see therefore that there were both negative and positive different effects of ha dosage i inhibiting the hydrolytic phase ii stimulating the acidogenic phase finally it is noteworthy that the two effects on tvfa increased along with ha dosing various vfa concentrations steadily increased along with ha dosing as shown in fig 11 higher acetate and propionate concentrations in the dosed ha tests demonstrate that ha can indeed stimulate the acidogenic phase from day 9 to day 11 surprisingly propionate in r2 r3 and r4 gradually decreased and acetate correspondingly increased for the stimulation mechanism of ha on the acidogenic phase there are two possible explanations 1 ha directly changed the activities of enzymes or microorganisms and then stimulated the acidogenic phase in fact as shown in table 6 the associated key enzymes por ak pta bk ptb etc underwent no significant changes in any of the tests p 0 05 moreover as shown in fig 12 fish was applied to analyze the impact of ha on the microbial community the sum of integral optical density iod was used to represent the abundance of microorganisms instead of average iod the results illustrate that the microorganisms involved in the acidogenic phase fish also behaved no significances for this reason ha seemed not to simulate acidification by changing the activities of enzymes 2 ha could stimulate acidification as an active terminal electron acceptor tea or the electron transferring chains etc from the functional groups quinone etc in the normal acidogenic phase there are two obstacles which inhibit acidification i non methanogens like fermenting bacteria lack the electron transport system and have to release surplus electrons produced by the fermenting process to other substrates otherwise the acetate produced process would be hindered ii the thermodynamics of bio conversions indicates that the gibbs free energy g0ˊ of different vfas converted into acetate is over zero g0ˊ 0 as shown in table 7 thauer et al 1977 cervantes et al 2000 which means that the bio conversions occur spontaneously by controlling the hydrogen pressure otherwise they would consume outer energy and hinder their metabolisms when ha was added in the tests for example anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonnat aqds a ha quinone analogue would not only act as tea for accepting the surplus electrons from propionate the bio conversion could also lead to a spontaneous reaction g0ˊ 0 after which the hydrogen pressure in the tests would no longer be a decisive factor moreover decreased orps could indirectly stimulate the conversion of vfas so we can see that ha therefore had the positive effect on the acidogenic phase of improving the acidogenic efficiency 3 3 3 acidogenic efficiency the acidogenic efficiency was calculated by eq 4 and the results are shown in fig 13 the acidogenic efficiencies 78 124 of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are all higher than those of r0 61 6 specifically the acidogenic efficiency 124 1 of r3 is two times higher that of r0 the acidogenic efficiency over 100 implies that not only δsocd was all converted into vfas but some initial scod was also converted into vfas as tea the capacity of ha for accepting electrons in the system could increase along with the ha dosage which would cause higher levels of acidogenic efficiency as shown in fig 13 however the acidogenic efficiency at the highest ha dosage r4 ha vss 20 did not reach the highest level below 124 in r3 table 7 indicates that 1 mol of propionate can directly be converted into 2 mol of acetate at least in theory with ha involved in the tests however only 1 mol of acetate could be acquired in other words the highest ha dosage did not correspond to the highest acidogenic efficiency as most of hydrolytic organics are likely to be converted into co2 not into acetate 3 4 effect of ha on the methanogenic phase 3 4 1 activities of key enzymes and microorganisms the methanogenic phase was analyzed in a whole batch ad system group mg the activities of a key enzyme f420 reducing hydrogenase are shown in table 8 the relative activities of f420 are at 100 r0 87 5 r1 81 0 r2 70 8 r3 and 63 2 r4 respectively clearly ha is able to lower the activities of the key enzyme and inhibit the methanogenic phase the abundance of the involved fermentative bacteria measured by fish is illustrated in fig 14 there are minor differences among different tests revealing almost no impact of ha on the involved microorganisms ha could inhibit the methanogenic phase via two pathways i as a terminal electron acceptor tea ha directly accepts the electrons from acetate and prevents them from being converted to ch4 eq 12 in table 9 although g0ˊfor the direct oxidation of ha with acetate eq 12 and for the conversion of acetate to ch4 eq 11 are all less than zero spontaneous reactions eq 11 is more successful with the help of methanogenic bacteria in the system while eq 12 is based on the respiration of special functional bacteria humic substance reducing bacteria etc lovley et al 1996 therefore this inhibiting pathway was probably not relevant in our systems since the cultures were grown in absence of ha cervantes et al 2000 ii ha can resemble a metabolic intermediate substance and hinder the successful transformation of acetate to ch4 and ha might compete for metabolites which could lead to the normal methane pathway being blocked liu et al 2016 as for the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the reaction rate of h2 with co2 eq 13 in table 9 could be much faster than that of h2 with ha eq 14 the impact of ha on this bioreaction is not as yet clear moreover other studies smith et al 2015 dang et al 2016 conclude that ha might promote the metabolisms of other syntrophic bacteria and cause the failure of methanogens competition in the ad system instead of decreasing ch4 production li et al 2015 azman 2016 despite progress made it is clear that a further study is still needed to address this question 3 4 2 methanogenic efficiency the methanogenic efficiency calculated by eq 6 is shown in fig 15 in the r0 test this reached up to 250 0 for which not only all vfas but also other organics were involved accounting for about 150 in addition the methanogenic efficiency in r1 r2 r3 and r4 reached 131 176 but they are noticeably lower than in r0 revealing that ha had indeed inhibited the ch4 production with a maximal reduced efficiency of up to 120 r3 in other words the methanogenic efficiency was suppressed by approximately half 52 2 calculated by eq 3 3 5 summary of the possible mechanisms the possible mechanisms of ha inhibition in the batch ad system are shown in fig 16 the red data line label represents the negative effects of ha on the ad process and the green data line label stands for the positive effects ha behaved differently in the three phases during the hydrolysis phase the activities of the associated key enzymes were lower and the hydrolytic process was inhibited the hydrolytic efficiency in the test without ha dosage was at 10 2 while the test with ha dosed ha vss 15 decreased to 6 3 accounting for an inhibition efficiency up to 38 2 in the acidogenic phase ha acted as terminal electron acceptors tea or electron transferring chains etc to promote the acidogenic process and the acidogenic efficiency increased to 124 1 ha vss 15 from 61 6 ha vss 0 elucidating a promotion efficiency up to 101 5 in the methanogenic phase however ha decreased the methanogenic efficiency by 52 2 250 at ha vss 0 was lowered to 130 5 at ha vss 15 due to inhibiting the activities of the involved key enzymes the fish results demonstrate that ha had almost no effect on the involved microorganisms by fish in both acidogenic and methanogenic phase with ha dosed overall the combined efficiency of the three sub phases without ha dosing is calculated at 10 2 61 6 250 15 7 which is in accordance with the calculated result by eq 2 as for the test with ha vss 15 the combined efficiency of the three sub phases is at 6 3 124 1 130 5 10 2 finally the whole inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases can be calculated by eq 3 at 15 7 10 2 15 7 35 0 which is almost identical 35 1 to the result observed in the single phase ad process section 3 1 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion ad of excess sludge can convert contained organics into energy ch4 but the existence of humic acid ha contained in sludge acts to create a negative effect on the energy efficiency in this study a single phase and three sub phases hydrolytic phase acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase of ad were respectively tested and analyzed without and with ha dosing in the batch ad systems in the single phase ad dosed ha did indeed inhibit the methanogenic efficiency by 35 1 at ha vss 15 due to the complex chemical structural characteristics however the effects of ha on the three sub phases was totally different ha resulted in lowering the activities of the associated enzymes and also the first order kinetic rates in the hydrolytic phase acting as an inhibiting agent by 38 2 at ha vss 15 in the acidogenic phase ha acted in the role of etc or tea stimulating acidification and resulting in a promoting function by 101 5 at ha vss 15 finally in the methanogenic phase ha inhibited a key enzyme f420 and reduced the ch4 production by 52 2 at ha vss 15 overall the combined efficiency of the three sub phases without ha dosing is calculated at 15 7 and that of the three sub phases at ha vss 15 at 10 2 finally the whole inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases is equal to 35 0 which is almost identical 35 1 to the result observed in the single phase ad process agreement all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript they warrant that the article is the

18956,iron electrocoagulation is a promising contaminant e g arsenic removal technology that is based on electrochemical fe ii production from steel electrodes and subsequent transport of fe ii to the bulk solution where contaminant removal occurs although fe electrocoagulation systems have been shown to effectively remove contaminants in extended field trials the efficiency of field systems can be lower than in laboratory studies one hypothesis for this disparity is that the faradaic efficiency of short term laboratory experiments is higher than field systems operated over extended periods the faradaic efficiency is a pivotal performance indicator that we define as the measured fe dosage normalized by the theoretical fe dosage calculated by faraday s law in this work we investigated the faradaic efficiency in laboratory experiments for up to 35 operating cycles 2 months with varied fe 0 anode purity charge dosage rate and electrolyte composition our results showed that the faradaic efficiency decreased continuously during repeated operation under typical field conditions charge dosage rate 4 c l min synthetic groundwater regardless of the fe 0 anode purity leading to a faradaic efficiency 0 6 after 2 months by contrast increasing the charge dosage rate to 15 c l min produced a faradaic efficiency 0 85 over the entire experiment for both fe 0 anode purities electrolyte solutions free of oxyanions also resulted in sustained faradaic efficiency 0 85 regardless of the charge dosage rate our results confirm a previously proposed relationship between low faradaic efficiency and the formation of macroscopic electrode surface layers which consist of fe oxyhydr oxides on the anode and a mixture of fe oxyhydr oxides and calcite on the cathode based on these results we discuss potential strategies to maintain a high faradaic efficiency during fe electrocoagulation field treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron electrocoagulation faradaic

on applying an electric current to a sacrificial fe 0 metal anode to produce fe ii in solution lakshmanan et al 2009 fe0 fe2 2e equation 1 contaminant removal in fe ec relies on the migration of electrochemically generated fe ii from the electrode to the bulk solution where it can directly reduce contaminants e g cr vi pan et al 2016 or be oxidized by dissolved oxygen do to produce fe coagulants that bind co occurring solutes fe ec has been shown to effectively remove a range of contaminants such as heavy metals and metalloids akbal and camcı 2011 oil chen et al 2000 and escherichia coli delaire et al 2015 from different source waters although fe ec can be implemented in conventional water treatment plants this technology has found particular application in decentralized communities e g arsenic affected regions in south asia because fe ec systems can be manufactured operated and maintained using only locally available materials amrose et al 2013 kumar et al 2004 for example extended fe ec field trials in west bengal india showed consistent removal of arsenic from local groundwater to below 5 μg l for several months amrose et al 2014 however despite these encouraging field results the arsenic removal efficiency of field systems operated over extended periods has been reported to be up to five times lower than laboratory systems which are typically only operated over a limited number of cycles amrose et al 2014 van genuchten et al 2016 one explanation for the reported disparity in treatment efficiency relates to a decrease in the faradaic efficiency fe of field fe ec systems over repeated cycles of operation i e cycles of fe ec cell operation and overnight electrode air drying in fe ec the applied current is directly related to the concentration of fe ii produced by faraday s law equation 2 fe faraday i t n f v where i represents the current c s applied for an electrolysis time t s n represents the number of transferred electrons 2 for fe ii production f represents faraday s constant 96485 c mol and v represents the electrolyte volume l following previous work van genuchten et al 2017 we define the faradaic efficiency fe as the total fe concentration measured in the bulk suspension normalized by the fe concentration predicted by faraday s law assuming n 2 in equation 2 we note that our definition encompasses two independent processes one related to the electrochemical production of aqueous fe and one related to the migration of electrochemically generated fe from the electrode surface to the bulk solution based on this definition an ideal fe of 1 0 indicates that all charge passed through the anode goes to fe ii production and transport to the bulk suspension a fe 1 indicates poor fe ii production and or transport to the bulk electrolyte resulting in a lower fe dose per coulomb of charge passed since contaminant removal in fe ec relies on effective fe ii production and transport to the bulk electrolyte delaire et al 2016 kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 a decrease in fe over time would decrease fe ec treatment performance low fe in fe ec systems can originate from two principal processes dubrawski et al 2015 schultze and lohrengel 2000 timmes et al 2010 i the applied current oxidizes fe 0 to produce fe ii but the transport of fe ii from the electrode to the bulk is inhibited or ii the applied current is diverted to competing electrochemical side reactions rather than fe 0 oxidation in the first case a low fe would occur if fe ii is the primary product of electrochemical fe 0 oxidation but the generated fe ii deposits on the fe 0 electrodes to form a macroscopic electrode surface layer sl timmes et al 2010 once formed this sl of oxidized fe can subsequently trap more ec generated fe ii leading to sl growth over time at the expense of the fe this process has been proposed previously to explain the reduced efficiency of field fe ec systems based on observations of extensive electrode sl formation but has not been tested systematically in controlled experiments timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 in this scheme solution conditions i e ph ionic composition and fe ec operating parameters that favor sl growth would decrease the fe over extended operation which would impair contaminant removal performance one key operating parameter hypothesized to impact sl formation is the charge dosage rate cdr which is proportional to the operating current table s1 by increasing the cdr the rate of fe ii addition increases and strong chemical gradients and electric fields near the anode are produced that can alter the transport or local accumulation of fe ii poor fe can also occur when the applied current oxidizes redox active solutes or water instead of the fe 0 anode van genuchten et al 2017 in this case the anodic interface potential ip is a key factor with high ip favoring competing oxidation reactions by the butler volmer equation table s1 the anodic ip is directly proportional to the applied current density bard and faulkner 2001 therefore as shown in previous work the ip during fe ec treatment can easily increase above 3 4 v vs ag agcl at high current densities i 10 ma cm2 which can lead to the oxidation of h2o to form o2 dubrawski et al 2015 van genuchten et al 2017 the ip can also be impacted by other factors including the composition of the electrolyte solution van genuchten et al 2017 and the presence of poorly conducting electrode sls cornell and schwertmann 2003 schultze and lohrengel 2000 taken together both causes of reduced fe i e sl formation or competing oxidation reactions reveal the potential importance of several factors on the long term fe and thus sustained fe ec system performance however the concomitant influence of these factors on the fe behavior over extended periods is unknown in this study we track the fe and anodic ip of fe ec systems over repeated cycles of operation for up to 2 months 35 runs as a function of the fe 0 electrode purity solution composition and ec operating parameters we focus on the release of aqueous fe from the fe 0 electrode rather than the removal efficiency of any particular contaminant since fe ii production is the fundamental process that underpins contaminant removal during fe ec treatment delaire et al 2016 kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 experiments were designed partly to replicate the operation of field fe ec systems that currently treat arsenic contaminated groundwater in west bengal india i e identical fe dosage variables electrode storage and polarity reversal amrose et al 2014 to identify the parameters that govern the fe over extended operation we examined a range of applied currents which correspond to charge dosage rates cdr from 4 to 54 c l min and varied systematically the electrolyte composition the growth of electrode sls was measured in each experiment and the sl mineralogy was characterized by x ray diffraction and fe k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy our results show that a specific range of electro chemical conditions can sustain efficient fe for month timescales which is necessary for the upscaling and widespread adoption of fe ec in both high and low income countries based on these results we propose options that can be implemented by operators of fe ec systems in the field to ensure reliable treatment over time 2 methods 2 1 electrolytes synthetic groundwater sgw composition summarized in table 1 was prepared in 10 l batches following previous approaches with the composition selected to best represent arsenic contaminated groundwater in south asia which is often targeted for treatment by fe ec bgs and dphe 2001 roberts et al 2004 van genuchten et al 2014 each 10 l batch of sgw was prepared by adding defined volumes of stock solutions of 0 8 m nahco3 0 3 m cacl2 and 0 2 m mgcl2 6h2o to ultrapure deionized di water following the addition of these components solution ph was set to 7 by conveying co2 g through the solution until the ph was reached under vigorous stirring silicate was added from a freshly prepared 0 02 m stock solution na2sio3 9h2o finally phosphate was added from a 0 1 m stock solution na2hpo4 7h2o due to its trace concentration arsenic was not added to the sgw recipe after adding all components the dissolved oxygen do was decreased to 2 8 3 7 mg l by bubbling n2 g and if needed co2 g to ensure the ph was 7 the sgw batches were stored in air tight containers with a small head space the do and ph of the sgw solutions were measured with hach ldo101 and phc101 probes before and after each operating cycle table 2 the solution conductivity was measured with a hach cdc401 probe before each experimenal series two types of modified sgw were prepared in 2 l batches by excluding ca and mg soft sgw to prevent the formation of ca mg bearing minerals during the experiments or by excluding carbonate silicate and phosphate oxyanion free which have high affinities to co precipitate with fe oxides we also prepared an electrolyte solution containing only 10 mm nacl to ensure equal chloride concentrations in all sgw variations table 1 nacl was added to soft sgw sodium concentrations were not equal 2 2 electrocoagulation experiments 2 2 1 ec cell operation the ec cell typically consisted of two steel electrodes spaced 1 cm apart with a submerged anodic surface area of 18 cm2 fig s1 prior to the first operating cycle the electrodes were cleaned with concentrated hydrochloric acid rinsed with di water and polished with fine grained sandpaper no electrode cleaning occurred after the initial operating cycle experiments were performed in 200 ml solutions open to the atmosphere at 20 c the solution was stirred with a magnetic stir bar at speeds representative of the typical mixing of fe ec field systems amrose et al 2014 experiments were initiated by applying a constant current to the submerged electrodes using a bench top power supply tenma 72 10500 that was equipped with a voltmeter to measure the total cell potential the total cell potential is an important parameter that determines the power required to pass charge during fe ec treatment and includes the anodic and cathodic ip and resistance across the aqueous solution standard experiments were performed using a current of roughly 14 5 ma applied for 105 min in sgw to yield 2 3 mm total fe ii with a current density of 0 8 ma cm2 and a cdr of 4 3 c l min these operational parameters were selected to reproduce fe ec operating parameters used in the field and are referred to as reference experiments amrose et al 2014 the ip was measured after 40 and 85 min of electrolysis with an ag agcl reference electrode double junction 3 m kcl the fe 0 electrodes were removed after electrolysis and stored on a rack open to the atmosphere thus ending one cycle of fe ec cell operation a wide mouth pipette was used to obtain aliquots of the final suspension for measurements of total fe following a modified smww protocol apha 2005 these general procedures were followed for all experiments with systematic changes in operating and chemical parameters described below 2 2 2 experimental conditions the influence of fe 0 electrode purity was evaluated by using anodes of 99 fe by mass lab anodes and anodes obtained directly from an existing fe ec field system installed in west bengal india field anodes 92 fe composition reported previously van genuchten et al 2016 a smaller electrolyte volume was used in field anode experiments to account for their smaller size and maintain a constant surface area to volume ratio a v 90 cm2 l the impact of the cdr was investigated by systematically varying this parameter in individual experiments from 4 to 54 c l min for brevity we identify experiments with the higher and lower purity electrodes as lab and field respectively with the cdr indicated in the suffix i e field 54 corresponds to field anode experiments operated at 54 c l min in sgw all additional experiments described below were conducted with lab electrodes only which is not explicitly stated in the code to evaluate the impact of electrolyte composition we performed experiments in each of the solutions described in the previous section sgw soft sgw oxyanion free nacl for these experiments the cdr was 4 c l min unless otherwise noted in the suffix in the last series of experiments we investigated a number of previously proposed strategies to increase the long term fe including alternating the electrode polarity and varying the electrode storage conditions timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 xie et al 2017 alternating the polarity of the electrodes which is common practice in fe ec field system operation amrose et al 2014 was performed in sgw once polarity 1 and 5 times polarity 5 every 21 min per experiment we examined the effect of drying the electrodes overnight by submerging the electrodes in sgw immediately after electrolysis sgw storage instead of air drying an overview of the various experimental conditions and corresponding codes is given in table 2 2 3 characterization of electrode surface layers the mass of sls formed on the anodes and cathodes was quantified by mechanically removing the sls with a brass brush the sl mass was measured gravimetrically and normalized by the electrode surface area this method of sl removal was favorable compared to other techniques e g abrasion with sand paper chemical extraction because it minimized systematic error due to removing or extracting fe 0 from the electrode the sls were then ground with a mortar and pestle and characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas powder xrd measurements cu k α radiation were performed with a bruker d 8 diffractometer using a rotating sample stage diffraction patterns were collected from 15 to 75 2θ 0 01 step sizes with a total data collection time of approximately 4 h per sample fe k edge x ray absorption spectra were collected for a subset of samples at the dutch belgium beam line dubble bm 26a of the european synchrotron radiation facility borsboom et al 1998 nikitenko et al 2008 procedures for xas sample preparation data collection and data analysis are given in the supplementary information in addition an extraction method was used to measure the fe content of the sls by treating a solid sample aliquot in 69 nitric acid for 12 h the fe concentration in the extracts was measured colourimetrically apha 2005 3 results 3 1 temporal evolution of lab and field anode reference experiments 3 1 1 faradaic efficiency fig 1 a compares the fe of the lab and field anode experiments at cdr 4 c l min in sgw reference conditions for up to 35 repeated operating cycles i e cycles of ec cell operation and overnight air drying the fe of the lab 04 experiment began at 0 85 and decreased continuously to 0 66 over 20 runs with strong reproducibility between replicate experiments increasing the number of operating cycles from n 20 to n 35 over 2 months of operation which is the longest continuous experiment in this study decreased the fe of the lab 04 experiment to 0 6 only the final data point is shown in fig 1 the behavior of the fe for the field 04 experiment was similar to that of the lab 04 experiment showing an initial fe near 0 85 and a continuous decrease to 0 62 over 20 operating cycles the match between the fe of the lab 04 and field 04 experiments indicates that the fe 0 anode purity does not play a critical role in determining the fe at cdr 4 c l min 3 1 2 anode interface potential the behavior of the ip over extended operation for the lab 04 and field 04 experiments is shown in fig 1b the ip of the lab 04 experiment increased from approximately 0 v vs ag agcl in the first run to 0 2 v vs ag agcl after 10 runs despite a continuous decrease in fe from operating cycle 10 to 35 the ip of the lab 04 experiment remained stable at 0 2 v vs ag agcl although the lab 04 and field 04 experiments showed nearly identical fe over time slight differences in the ip of these experiments was observed the field 04 experiment had a lower initial ip 0 4 v vs ag agcl than the lab anode but the ip of the field 04 experiment increased almost linearly over 20 runs resulting in a slightly higher final ip 0 3 v vs ag agcl than in the lab 04 experiment the total cell voltage of the field 04 experiment also increased slightly over time from 1 4 v to 2 4 v whereas the lab 04 experiment was stable at 2 3 v 3 1 3 surface layer formation fig 2 shows visually the macroscopic electrode sls formed after 35 operating cycles in the reference experiments fig s2 presents a detailed time series the onset of a sl occurred on the lab 04 anode after the first run and by operating cycle 8 the sl completely covered the fe 0 surface over 35 runs the texture of this sl became rough and the colour changed from yellow to dark orange macroscopic anodic sls were also observed in field 04 experiments fig 2 slightly more sl was produced in the lab anode 1 8 mg cm2 experiment relative to the field anode 0 6 mg cm2 table 2 x ray diffraction revealed that the anodic sls for both lab 04 and field 04 experiments consisted of ferrihydrite like poorly ordered fe iii precipitates based on the broad peak near 35 2θ fig 3 the line shape and positions of major oscillations in the fe k edge exafs spectrum fig s3 of the lab 04 anodic sls are consistent with oxyanion rich disordered fe iii precipitates with less fefe polymerization than 2 line ferrihydrite no features in the x ray diffractograms of the anodic sls of the lab 04 and field 04 experiments were consistent with goethite lepidocrocite or other fe ii iii minerals common in corrosion layers cook 2005 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates in the sls is likely due to the composition of the sgw electrolyte which contains high concentrations of surface poisoning silicate and phosphate senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2013 the formation and growth of cathodic sls were also observed in the lab 04 and field 04 experiments but the properties of these sls were different than the anodic sls for both cathodes orange sls formed after 3 7 runs and after 20 35 runs the cathodic sls became darker and more heterogeneous with clear white spots fig 2 in contrast to the anodic sls the cathodic sls were brittle cracked and did not adhere strongly to the electrode nearly identical sl quantities formed on the lab 04 6 6 mg cm2 and field 04 6 8 mg cm2 cathodes which is consistent with their similar colour and texture table 2 in contrast to the x ray diffractograms of the anodic sls diffraction peaks from caco3 were the dominant features of the x ray diffractograms of the cathodic sls fig 3 while no evidence for crystalline fe mineral phases appeared in the x ray diffractograms of the cathodic sls the brownish sl colour and the detection of fe in hno3 digested samples by wet chemical methods suggests that the sls contained fe iii precipitates the fe k edge xanes and exafs spectrum of the lab 04 cathodic sl fig s3 confirmed the presence of disordered fe iii precipitates which were also present in the lab 04 anodic sl the presence of a greater fraction of caco3 in the cathodic sls is consistent with the larger masses of these sls relative to the anodic sls and suggests that different processes contribute to anodic and cathodic sl formation 3 2 impact of charge dosage rate 3 2 1 faradaic efficiency fig 1c shows the fe for lab and field anode experiments performed at different cdr values over 15 to 20 operating cycles in sgw the fe was highly dependent on the cdr using lab anodes with increasing cdr favoring increased and sustained fe at cdr 15 c l min the fe for the lab anodes on the first run was between 0 9 and 1 0 which is higher than the 0 85 fe of the first cycle of the reference experiments at cdr of 4 c l min the first run of the experiment using the field anode at increased cdr 54 c l min also showed a high fe above 0 95 fig 1 remarkably the fe at cdr 15 c l min remained above 0 85 throughout the entire 15 to 20 runs in both lab and field anode experiments which contrasts the continuous fe decrease in experiments at low cdr experiments performed at cdr of 15 32 and 54 c l min all yielded similarly high and sustained fe which suggests a threshold cdr exists between 4 and 15 c l min that sustains high fe 3 2 2 anode interface potential the effect of cdr on the ip is shown in fig 1d the ip of the initial runs for both lab and field anodes increased with increasing cdr which is consistent with the butler volmer relationship bard and faulkner 2001 in contrast to the stable ip of the low cdr experiments the ip of experiments at elevated cdr increased with the number of operating cycles this trend in ip was most pronounced for the field 54 experiment which was below 0 5 v vs ag agcl initially but exceeded 2 v vs ag agcl after 15 runs despite ip values above 2 v vs ag agcl a fe 0 85 was maintained in these experiments indicating the production of fe ii was the dominant reaction on the anode consistent with the ip measurements the total cell voltage of all experiments increased over repeated operation with the largest increase from 7 to 11 v observed in the field 54 experiment after 16 runs 3 2 3 surface layer formation the macroscopic properties of the electrode sls depended strongly on the cdr fig 2 fig s4 for experiments at cdr 15 c l min only small quantities of anodic sls were produced 0 2 mg cm2 and these were darker compared to experiments at low cdr on the cathodes a very bright sl developed orange at the electrode center white near the edge and none of the macroscopic cracks found in the cathodic sls for low cdr experiments were observed in addition the quantity of cathodic sls at cdr 15 c l min 0 7 1 5 mg cm2 table 2 was substantially smaller than the low cdr experiments 6 mg cm2 3 3 electrolyte composition effects 3 3 1 faradaic efficiency the composition of the electrolyte played a critical role in the behavior of the fe over extended operating cycles fig 4 a regardless of the low cdr a stable fe 0 9 was observed for all runs in electrolytes containing no oxyanions such as the oxyanion free sgw electrolyte oxyanion free and the nacl electrolyte when oxyanions p si and inorganic carbon were present the decrease in fe over extended operating cycles was similar in the presence and absence of ca and mg for example the fe in the soft sgw electrolyte over 15 operating cycles closely resembled the reference experiments in sgw beginning near 0 85 and decreasing to below 0 7 the observations of sustained fe over repeated operating cycles in sgw at high cdr and in oxyanion free sgw at low cdr indicates that maintaining high fe depends on both the electrolyte composition and the cdr because the fe was already above 0 9 for the nacl 04 experiment increasing the cdr in this electrolyte did not further increase the fe 3 3 2 anode interface potential a considerably lower ip was observed in the absence of oxyanions fig 4b with the oxyanion free and nacl experiments remaining near 0 4 to 0 3 v vs ag agcl over the entire experimental duration consistent with the behavior of the fe in the soft sgw experiment the presence or absence of bivalent cations ca and mg did not impact the ip in agreement with the high cdr experiments in sgw increasing cdr from 4 to 54 c l min also increased the initial ip in the nacl electrolyte from 0 4 to 0 7 v vs ag agcl however the same continued increase in ip over 20 runs observed in sgw was not observed in the nacl electrolyte 3 3 3 surface layer formation the composition of the electrolyte altered the formation and growth of sls on both anodes and cathodes in the oxyanion free experiments where a high fe was sustained only 0 3 mg cm2 of dark reddish sl was produced on the anode during the experiment fig s5 table 2 by contrast 1 8 mg cm2 was removed from the anode used in the soft sgw experiments which was the same anodic sl amount in the analogous sgw experiment the anodic sls for the soft sgw experiment consisted of primarily poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates which was also observed in the reference experiments fig 3 approximately 1 2 and 0 2 mg cm2 were removed from the anodes in the nacl 04 and nacl 54 experiments and lepidocrocite was the major phase detected by xrd in these sls fig 3 the amount of cathodic sls that formed in the oxyanion free experiment 6 2 mg cm2 matched that of the analogous sgw experiment 6 6 mg cm2 in the soft sgw electrolyte which contained no bivalent cations and prevented caco3 formation bare metal was still observed on the cathode after the entire experimental duration 15 operating cycles and only 0 7 mg cm2 was removed table 2 the cathodic sls generated in the soft sgw electrolyte were found to consist of primarily poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates based on xrd fig 3 black sls displaying magnetite peaks in xrd formed on the cathodes in nacl 04 and nacl 54 experiments with greater sl mass formed in the nacl 04 experiment 1 6 mg cm2 relative to nacl 54 0 8 mg cm2 3 4 polarization alteration and electrode storage 3 4 1 faradaic efficiency fig 4c shows that single polarity reversal polarity 1 between every operating cycle decreased the fe similar to the experiments without polarity reversal the lab 04 reference experiments until run number 10 after run 10 the fe of polarity 1 experiments was consistently lower than experiments without polarity reversal reversing the polarity 5 times during each operating cycle resulted in a more rapid decrease in fe to below 0 5 after only 10 runs overnight electrode storage in sgw was also unsuccessful at sustaining fe over extended operating cycles fig 4c shows that the fe of sgw storage experiments decreased more rapidly than for dry storage conditions reaching 0 5 after 20 runs 3 4 2 anode interface potential although the polarity alteration experiments did not sustain the fe these experiments did produce a lower ip over extended operation fig 4d with a final ip for the polarity 1 and polarity 5 experiments near 0 3 v vs ag agcl the total cell voltages of these experiments were also the lowest in our study and decreased with increasing operating cycles table s2 the ip of the sgw storage experiments was slightly lower than dry storage conditions and ended at 0 2 v vs ag agcl after 20 runs 3 4 3 surface layer formation reversing the electrode polarity strongly impacted properties of the electrode sls the polarity 1 and polarity 5 electrodes displayed a brittle orange layer that chipped away from the electrode easily which is similar to the cathodic sls formed in other experiments these results are consistent with both electrodes serving as anode and cathode large sl quantities formed on these electrodes 7 2 mg cm2 for polarity 1 and 10 mg cm2 for polarity 5 table 2 the x ray diffractograms of the polartiy 1 and polarity 5 sls indicated the presence of caco3 fig 3 while the fe k edge exafs spectrum of the polarity 1 sls indicated the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates with similar structure to the solids contained in the reference lab 04 anodic sl fig s3 the sgw storage electrodes produced the largest quantity of anodic sls 20 mg cm2 and both anodic and cathodic sls consisted of a mixture of caco3 and poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates 4 discussion 4 1 repeated operation decreases fe in conditions representative of fe ec field treatment the results for fe ec experiments with operating parameters and solution composition representative of fe ec field treatment support the hypothesis that operating fe ec under field conditions can lead to a decrease in fe which adversely effects fe ec performance the lab 04 field 04 and polarity 1 experiments replicate closely the raw water composition and operating conditions i e cdr electrolysis time current density a v ratio dry storage used in existing fe ec plants that treat arsenic contaminated groundwater van genuchten et al 2016 our results showed a systematic decrease in the fe with repeated operation in each of these experiments for example the fe continuously decreased over the two month long duration of the lab 04 experiment leading to a 40 lower fe dose to solution than expected by faraday s law this decrease in fe would impair contaminant removal efficiency by decreasing the amount of fe available to sorb or reduce the target species for a given coulomb of charge passed a decrease in fe over extended operation was also observed in the field 04 and polarity 1 experiments which replicate even closer fe ec field treatment field 04 uses a lower purity anode taken from an existing fe ec plant in india polarity 1 applies the same cycle of polarity reversal therefore our results confirm a previous hypothesis that a decrease in fe contributes to the poorer contaminant removal efficiency observed for fe ec electrodes with a large sl build up relative to newly cleaned and well maintained fe ec electrodes van genuchten et al 2016 this conclusion is consistent with the similar growth of fe bearing anodic sls in the lab 04 field 04 and polarity 1 experiments and the sls documented in fe ec field systems operated for many months 4 2 electrochemical and solution chemical variables that sustain high fe although the experiments designed to mimic existing fe ec plant operation showed a decreased fe over time our results revealed at least two electro chemical variables that could be manipulated to sustain high fe for 1 2 months i the charge dosage rate cdr and ii the electrolyte composition furthermore we observed that a sustained fe in these experiments correlated with low anodic sl growth in the following sections we discuss and provide explanations for the impact of cdr and electrolyte composition on the fe and electrode sls 4 2 1 charge dosage rate as shown in fig 1c experiments at cdr 15 c l min produced a larger initial fe 0 9 compared to cdr 4 c l min 0 85 and more importantly sustained this high fe over repeated operating cycles simultaneously experiments at high cdr showed a decrease in anodic sl mass the beneficial effect of increasing cdr on the fe can be explained by processes related to the accumulation of fe oxides at the electrode surface in ec systems the cdr is directly proportional to the addition rate of fe ii speciated as the free fe2 ion at circumneutral ph therefore an increase in cdr from 4 to 15 c l min increases the flux of positively charged fe2 at least 4 fold while simultaneously increasing the anodic ip fig 1d the combination of a higher flux of positively charged fe2 and higher positive charge of the anode increases cation diffusion and electrostatic repulsive forces between the anode and cations which facilitates the migration of the fe2 to the bulk solution rather than accumulation at the anode surface furthermore the increased flux of fe ii at high cdr would also lead to strong chemical gradients near the anode surface especially with respect to dissolved oxygen do for example experiments at cdr 15 c l min consumed the dissolved oxygen concentration to 0 1 mg l which resulted in the formation of mixed valent fe oxides green rust in sgw magnetite in nacl see figs s4 and s5 this dissolved oxygen behavior contrasts that of the low cdr experiments where dissolved oxygen remained near 3 0 mg l and purely fe iii oxyhydr oxides formed an increase in fe ii flux at high cdr can deplete dissolved oxygen levels near the anode rapidly which would prevent fe ii oxidation and the formation of fe iii bearing solids that can deposit on the electrode as a sl finally the different macroscopic properties of the mixed valent fe oxides that formed in high cdr experiments fig s4 which consisted of much larger flocs than the low cdr solids could also facilitate lower sl growth and sustained fe to elucidate the contribution of dissolved oxygen depletion to the increase in fe with increasing cdr we performed a series of experiments at cdr 54 c l min in sgw while bubbling air continuously during operation o2 54 in these experiments the dissolved oxygen never decreased below 3 0 mg l and fe iii precipitates formed fig s4 but the fe still remained 0 8 for the entire duration 15 cycles therefore we expect the role of dissolved oxygen on the fe to be a second order effect relative to the cdr 4 2 2 electrolyte composition the most significant effect of electrolyte composition on the fe was observed in the presence of oxyanions while changes in ph can impact many processes during fe ec treatment our results indicate that ph was a secondary effect relative to the presence of oxyanions in our experiments table 2 summarizes the ph behavior for each experiment as shown in fig 4a the fe in experiments with electrolyte solutions rich in phosphate p silicate si and carbonate i e sgw and soft sgw decreased over repeated operating cycles for experiments at cdr 4 c l min by contrast the fe in electrolyte solutions free of p si and carbonate oxyanion free nacl remained high throughout the experiment and sl growth was minimal regardless of ph the impact of oxyanions on the fe and sl properties can be attributed to two processes first oxyanions such as p and si are well known to passivate fe 0 metal in natural corrosion systems bojinov et al 1999 because of their high sorption affinity for fe precipitates roberts et al 2004 si and p can bind to oxidized fe at the anode surface leading to an oxyanion rich sl that modifies anodic properties including decreased electrical conductance indeed the presence of p in single solute electrolytes was shown to decrease dramatically the fe of fe ec systems over single operating cycles which was explained by the formation of passifying p rich sls that increased the ip and promoted the anodic h2o oxidation to form o2 rather than anodic fe 0 oxidation van genuchten et al 2017 second the presence of high concentrations of p and si during the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides inhibits fe iii polymerization and leads to poorly ordered nanoscale particles that do not aggregate flocculate and settle on practical time scales van genuchten et al 2014 the x ray diffractograms fig 3 and fe k edge exafs spectra fig s3 of sls in oxyanion rich experiments confirmed the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates with structures consistent with oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide doelsch et al 2000 it was also observed visually that the fe iii precipitates produced in experiments with oxyanion rich solutions remained suspended throughout electrolysis whereas large coagulated flocs formed readily in oxyanion free solutions even during rapid mixing fig s5 compares the visible flocs in the nacl 04 experiment with the more colloidally stable lab 04 suspension since the nanoscale less aggregated fe iii precipitates formed in oxyanion rich solutions remain in suspension longer these solids are more likely to contact deposit and be trapped on the fe 0 anode which would decrease the fe although the presence or absence of bivalent cations did not play a major role in altering the behavior of the fe ca and mg were found to impact electrode sl properties in many experiments the x ray diffractograms of cathodic sls were dominated by caco3 when bivalent cations co occurred with carbonate this result can be explained by the combination of the negative electrode potential at the cathode which would attract positively charged ca and mg cations and the cathodic reduction of h2o to form h2 g which is the dominant cathodic reaction in fe ec treatment lakshmanan et al 2009 the cathodic formation of h2 g consumes h ions leading to a region of high ph near the cathode which favors the formation of carbonate minerals e g caco3 mgco3 although we found that reactions at the anode were not affected by cathodic caco3 formation in fixed polarity experiments the polarity 1 and polarity 5 experiments displayed a lower fe and greater sl mass relative to the lab 04 and field 04 experiments the poorer fe in the polarity reversal experiments can be explained by the large and porous caco3 bearing sls acting as sink for ec generated fe ii when the cathode becomes the anode thus inhibiting transport of aqueous fe to the bulk solution and decreasing the fe the x ray diffractograms of sl samples from the polarity reversal experiments are dominated by caco3 but fe k edge exafs spectroscopy fig s3 confirmed that the polarity 1 sls contain poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with structures similar to those in the lab 04 anodic sls 4 3 implications for fe ec field operation this study provides a number of useful results to inform fe ec field treatment including the selection of electrode materials and optimization of operational parameters and maintenance for example the purity of the fe 0 anode did not significantly impact the long term performance of the electrodes with the lab 04 and field 04 experiments displaying nearly identical fe behavior sl growth and mineralogy and total cell potential since the impurity content of the lab and field electrodes varied strongly lab electrodes 99 fe field electrodes 92 fe the similar decrease in the fe for these electrodes suggests that the oxidation of non ferrous steel components such as manganese or carbon is not the primary driver of reduced fe more importantly these results indicate that the electrode purity is not a critical factor in fe ec system performance which suggests that less costly and locally available electrode materials with lower purity can be implemented in fe ec field systems without sacrificing long term efficiency however we note that some steel can contain toxic metal impurities e g cr v ni sb the release of which must be avoided during fe 0 ec treatment in addition the ip and total cell voltage increased over extended operating cycles more for the field anode suggesting that higher purity steel should be used to decrease power consumption if available at similar costs as impure steel with respect to maintaining a stable and high fe over extended operation which is critical for efficient and reliable fe ec field treatment our study suggests that increasing the cdr and avoiding the presence of oxyanions can help to sustain the fe modifying the electrolyte composition of the untreated raw water to eliminate oxyanions prior to treatment is impractical at large scales but could be done by employing a separate fe 0 electrolysis dosing chamber with controlled solution composition that feeds into the contaminated water influent a much more appropriate option to sustain fe over extended operation is to simply increase the cdr this strategy requires only increasing the operating current which can be performed easily at existing fe ec plants without new infrastructure although increasing the cdr decreases the total electrolysis time which can be advantageous in areas with intermittent power supply increasing the cdr also increases power consumption 0 26 kwh m3 at 4 c l min 1 17 kwh m3 at 54 c l min table s2 because of the larger cell voltage and total electric work required to pass the same amount of charge therefore our results suggest an optimum cdr exists that sustains the fe and minimizes power consumption which can be identified precisely with local water using 15 c l min as a recommended starting value another consequence of increasing the cdr can be the formation of particles with different properties i e mixed valent fe oxides rather than fe iii precipitates the impact of generating precipitates that contain structural fe ii e g magnetite green rust on contaminant removal by fe ec could be positive or negative but if negative this process can be counteracted by incorporating an air cathode into treatment design the h2o2 generated by an air cathode system would oxidize fe ii rapidly and prevent the accumulation of fe ii needed for mixed valent fe oxide formation si et al 2017 preventing the formation and growth of electrode sls is another viable option to enhance the performance of fe ec field treatment in this study we investigated two low cost methods of inhibiting sl formation that can be applied easily in existing fe ec treatment plants to minimize sl growth arising from fe 0 oxidation by atmospheric o2 during overnight air storage we stored the electrodes in the sgw solution between operating cycles this strategy was not effective resulting in greater sl growth compared to overnight air drying and one of the poorest fe we also examined different cycles of polarity reversal during treatment which is often proposed as an electrochemical method of cleaning the electrodes by cathodic reduction of fe iii bearing sls timmes et al 2010 this strategy also proved unsuccessful at decreasing sl growth and maintaining high fe the ineffectiveness of reversing the electrode polarity can be explained by the formation of caco3 on the cathode which can trap electrochemically generated fe ii when the cathode becomes the anode since both unobtrusive methods of electrode cleaning were ineffective physical or chemical cleaning of the electrodes can be pursued the simplicity and reliability of sl removal by mechanical brushing fits the constraints of decentralized fe ec treatment and is currently practiced in some existing systems amrose et al 2014 but this technique requires a large workforce chemical removal of sls by strong mineral acids is effective but requires skilled labor and proper disposal of strong acid waste therefore the use of citric acid or other non hazardous organic acids which is often applied in potable water treatment to remove inorganic layers from filter membranes could be a more practical option for chemical sl removal strugholtz et al 2005 5 conclusions the contaminant removal efficiency of fe ec systems hinges on the efficient anodic production of aqueous fe ii and transport to the bulk solution we found a continuous decrease in fe to roughly 0 6 which was accompanied by electrode sl growth over repeated operating cycles 2 months in experiments that mimicked fe ec field treatment this result helps explain reported differences in contaminant removal efficiency for lab and field fe ec treatment and should be considered for accurate predictions of fe ec treatment efficiency over extended periods the decrease in fe was not related to the purity of the 99 and 92 fe electrodes used in this work rather the behavior of the fe and the formation and growth of electrode sls depended more on the electrolyte composition i e presence of oxyanions and the cdr because adjusting the cdr in existing fe ec plants is simple low cost and requires no new infrastructure we propose that increasing the cdr is the most ideal method of sustaining the fe over extended operation however prior to adjusting the cdr preliminary experiments should be performed at existing fe ec facilities to verify that undesirable changes to fe oxide particle formation do not occur previously proposed strategies to remove sls formed in cases of poor fe were unsuccessful polarity reversal water saturated electrode storage suggesting that mechanical or chemical methods could be pursued for periodic sl removal the results of this work help inform the design of new fe ec

18956,iron electrocoagulation is a promising contaminant e g arsenic removal technology that is based on electrochemical fe ii production from steel electrodes and subsequent transport of fe ii to the bulk solution where contaminant removal occurs although fe electrocoagulation systems have been shown to effectively remove contaminants in extended field trials the efficiency of field systems can be lower than in laboratory studies one hypothesis for this disparity is that the faradaic efficiency of short term laboratory experiments is higher than field systems operated over extended periods the faradaic efficiency is a pivotal performance indicator that we define as the measured fe dosage normalized by the theoretical fe dosage calculated by faraday s law in this work we investigated the faradaic efficiency in laboratory experiments for up to 35 operating cycles 2 months with varied fe 0 anode purity charge dosage rate and electrolyte composition our results showed that the faradaic efficiency decreased continuously during repeated operation under typical field conditions charge dosage rate 4 c l min synthetic groundwater regardless of the fe 0 anode purity leading to a faradaic efficiency 0 6 after 2 months by contrast increasing the charge dosage rate to 15 c l min produced a faradaic efficiency 0 85 over the entire experiment for both fe 0 anode purities electrolyte solutions free of oxyanions also resulted in sustained faradaic efficiency 0 85 regardless of the charge dosage rate our results confirm a previously proposed relationship between low faradaic efficiency and the formation of macroscopic electrode surface layers which consist of fe oxyhydr oxides on the anode and a mixture of fe oxyhydr oxides and calcite on the cathode based on these results we discuss potential strategies to maintain a high faradaic efficiency during fe electrocoagulation field treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron electrocoagulation faradaic

on applying an electric current to a sacrificial fe 0 metal anode to produce fe ii in solution lakshmanan et al 2009 fe0 fe2 2e equation 1 contaminant removal in fe ec relies on the migration of electrochemically generated fe ii from the electrode to the bulk solution where it can directly reduce contaminants e g cr vi pan et al 2016 or be oxidized by dissolved oxygen do to produce fe coagulants that bind co occurring solutes fe ec has been shown to effectively remove a range of contaminants such as heavy metals and metalloids akbal and camcı 2011 oil chen et al 2000 and escherichia coli delaire et al 2015 from different source waters although fe ec can be implemented in conventional water treatment plants this technology has found particular application in decentralized communities e g arsenic affected regions in south asia because fe ec systems can be manufactured operated and maintained using only locally available materials amrose et al 2013 kumar et al 2004 for example extended fe ec field trials in west bengal india showed consistent removal of arsenic from local groundwater to below 5 μg l for several months amrose et al 2014 however despite these encouraging field results the arsenic removal efficiency of field systems operated over extended periods has been reported to be up to five times lower than laboratory systems which are typically only operated over a limited number of cycles amrose et al 2014 van genuchten et al 2016 one explanation for the reported disparity in treatment efficiency relates to a decrease in the faradaic efficiency fe of field fe ec systems over repeated cycles of operation i e cycles of fe ec cell operation and overnight electrode air drying in fe ec the applied current is directly related to the concentration of fe ii produced by faraday s law equation 2 fe faraday i t n f v where i represents the current c s applied for an electrolysis time t s n represents the number of transferred electrons 2 for fe ii production f represents faraday s constant 96485 c mol and v represents the electrolyte volume l following previous work van genuchten et al 2017 we define the faradaic efficiency fe as the total fe concentration measured in the bulk suspension normalized by the fe concentration predicted by faraday s law assuming n 2 in equation 2 we note that our definition encompasses two independent processes one related to the electrochemical production of aqueous fe and one related to the migration of electrochemically generated fe from the electrode surface to the bulk solution based on this definition an ideal fe of 1 0 indicates that all charge passed through the anode goes to fe ii production and transport to the bulk suspension a fe 1 indicates poor fe ii production and or transport to the bulk electrolyte resulting in a lower fe dose per coulomb of charge passed since contaminant removal in fe ec relies on effective fe ii production and transport to the bulk electrolyte delaire et al 2016 kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 a decrease in fe over time would decrease fe ec treatment performance low fe in fe ec systems can originate from two principal processes dubrawski et al 2015 schultze and lohrengel 2000 timmes et al 2010 i the applied current oxidizes fe 0 to produce fe ii but the transport of fe ii from the electrode to the bulk is inhibited or ii the applied current is diverted to competing electrochemical side reactions rather than fe 0 oxidation in the first case a low fe would occur if fe ii is the primary product of electrochemical fe 0 oxidation but the generated fe ii deposits on the fe 0 electrodes to form a macroscopic electrode surface layer sl timmes et al 2010 once formed this sl of oxidized fe can subsequently trap more ec generated fe ii leading to sl growth over time at the expense of the fe this process has been proposed previously to explain the reduced efficiency of field fe ec systems based on observations of extensive electrode sl formation but has not been tested systematically in controlled experiments timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 in this scheme solution conditions i e ph ionic composition and fe ec operating parameters that favor sl growth would decrease the fe over extended operation which would impair contaminant removal performance one key operating parameter hypothesized to impact sl formation is the charge dosage rate cdr which is proportional to the operating current table s1 by increasing the cdr the rate of fe ii addition increases and strong chemical gradients and electric fields near the anode are produced that can alter the transport or local accumulation of fe ii poor fe can also occur when the applied current oxidizes redox active solutes or water instead of the fe 0 anode van genuchten et al 2017 in this case the anodic interface potential ip is a key factor with high ip favoring competing oxidation reactions by the butler volmer equation table s1 the anodic ip is directly proportional to the applied current density bard and faulkner 2001 therefore as shown in previous work the ip during fe ec treatment can easily increase above 3 4 v vs ag agcl at high current densities i 10 ma cm2 which can lead to the oxidation of h2o to form o2 dubrawski et al 2015 van genuchten et al 2017 the ip can also be impacted by other factors including the composition of the electrolyte solution van genuchten et al 2017 and the presence of poorly conducting electrode sls cornell and schwertmann 2003 schultze and lohrengel 2000 taken together both causes of reduced fe i e sl formation or competing oxidation reactions reveal the potential importance of several factors on the long term fe and thus sustained fe ec system performance however the concomitant influence of these factors on the fe behavior over extended periods is unknown in this study we track the fe and anodic ip of fe ec systems over repeated cycles of operation for up to 2 months 35 runs as a function of the fe 0 electrode purity solution composition and ec operating parameters we focus on the release of aqueous fe from the fe 0 electrode rather than the removal efficiency of any particular contaminant since fe ii production is the fundamental process that underpins contaminant removal during fe ec treatment delaire et al 2016 kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 experiments were designed partly to replicate the operation of field fe ec systems that currently treat arsenic contaminated groundwater in west bengal india i e identical fe dosage variables electrode storage and polarity reversal amrose et al 2014 to identify the parameters that govern the fe over extended operation we examined a range of applied currents which correspond to charge dosage rates cdr from 4 to 54 c l min and varied systematically the electrolyte composition the growth of electrode sls was measured in each experiment and the sl mineralogy was characterized by x ray diffraction and fe k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy our results show that a specific range of electro chemical conditions can sustain efficient fe for month timescales which is necessary for the upscaling and widespread adoption of fe ec in both high and low income countries based on these results we propose options that can be implemented by operators of fe ec systems in the field to ensure reliable treatment over time 2 methods 2 1 electrolytes synthetic groundwater sgw composition summarized in table 1 was prepared in 10 l batches following previous approaches with the composition selected to best represent arsenic contaminated groundwater in south asia which is often targeted for treatment by fe ec bgs and dphe 2001 roberts et al 2004 van genuchten et al 2014 each 10 l batch of sgw was prepared by adding defined volumes of stock solutions of 0 8 m nahco3 0 3 m cacl2 and 0 2 m mgcl2 6h2o to ultrapure deionized di water following the addition of these components solution ph was set to 7 by conveying co2 g through the solution until the ph was reached under vigorous stirring silicate was added from a freshly prepared 0 02 m stock solution na2sio3 9h2o finally phosphate was added from a 0 1 m stock solution na2hpo4 7h2o due to its trace concentration arsenic was not added to the sgw recipe after adding all components the dissolved oxygen do was decreased to 2 8 3 7 mg l by bubbling n2 g and if needed co2 g to ensure the ph was 7 the sgw batches were stored in air tight containers with a small head space the do and ph of the sgw solutions were measured with hach ldo101 and phc101 probes before and after each operating cycle table 2 the solution conductivity was measured with a hach cdc401 probe before each experimenal series two types of modified sgw were prepared in 2 l batches by excluding ca and mg soft sgw to prevent the formation of ca mg bearing minerals during the experiments or by excluding carbonate silicate and phosphate oxyanion free which have high affinities to co precipitate with fe oxides we also prepared an electrolyte solution containing only 10 mm nacl to ensure equal chloride concentrations in all sgw variations table 1 nacl was added to soft sgw sodium concentrations were not equal 2 2 electrocoagulation experiments 2 2 1 ec cell operation the ec cell typically consisted of two steel electrodes spaced 1 cm apart with a submerged anodic surface area of 18 cm2 fig s1 prior to the first operating cycle the electrodes were cleaned with concentrated hydrochloric acid rinsed with di water and polished with fine grained sandpaper no electrode cleaning occurred after the initial operating cycle experiments were performed in 200 ml solutions open to the atmosphere at 20 c the solution was stirred with a magnetic stir bar at speeds representative of the typical mixing of fe ec field systems amrose et al 2014 experiments were initiated by applying a constant current to the submerged electrodes using a bench top power supply tenma 72 10500 that was equipped with a voltmeter to measure the total cell potential the total cell potential is an important parameter that determines the power required to pass charge during fe ec treatment and includes the anodic and cathodic ip and resistance across the aqueous solution standard experiments were performed using a current of roughly 14 5 ma applied for 105 min in sgw to yield 2 3 mm total fe ii with a current density of 0 8 ma cm2 and a cdr of 4 3 c l min these operational parameters were selected to reproduce fe ec operating parameters used in the field and are referred to as reference experiments amrose et al 2014 the ip was measured after 40 and 85 min of electrolysis with an ag agcl reference electrode double junction 3 m kcl the fe 0 electrodes were removed after electrolysis and stored on a rack open to the atmosphere thus ending one cycle of fe ec cell operation a wide mouth pipette was used to obtain aliquots of the final suspension for measurements of total fe following a modified smww protocol apha 2005 these general procedures were followed for all experiments with systematic changes in operating and chemical parameters described below 2 2 2 experimental conditions the influence of fe 0 electrode purity was evaluated by using anodes of 99 fe by mass lab anodes and anodes obtained directly from an existing fe ec field system installed in west bengal india field anodes 92 fe composition reported previously van genuchten et al 2016 a smaller electrolyte volume was used in field anode experiments to account for their smaller size and maintain a constant surface area to volume ratio a v 90 cm2 l the impact of the cdr was investigated by systematically varying this parameter in individual experiments from 4 to 54 c l min for brevity we identify experiments with the higher and lower purity electrodes as lab and field respectively with the cdr indicated in the suffix i e field 54 corresponds to field anode experiments operated at 54 c l min in sgw all additional experiments described below were conducted with lab electrodes only which is not explicitly stated in the code to evaluate the impact of electrolyte composition we performed experiments in each of the solutions described in the previous section sgw soft sgw oxyanion free nacl for these experiments the cdr was 4 c l min unless otherwise noted in the suffix in the last series of experiments we investigated a number of previously proposed strategies to increase the long term fe including alternating the electrode polarity and varying the electrode storage conditions timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 xie et al 2017 alternating the polarity of the electrodes which is common practice in fe ec field system operation amrose et al 2014 was performed in sgw once polarity 1 and 5 times polarity 5 every 21 min per experiment we examined the effect of drying the electrodes overnight by submerging the electrodes in sgw immediately after electrolysis sgw storage instead of air drying an overview of the various experimental conditions and corresponding codes is given in table 2 2 3 characterization of electrode surface layers the mass of sls formed on the anodes and cathodes was quantified by mechanically removing the sls with a brass brush the sl mass was measured gravimetrically and normalized by the electrode surface area this method of sl removal was favorable compared to other techniques e g abrasion with sand paper chemical extraction because it minimized systematic error due to removing or extracting fe 0 from the electrode the sls were then ground with a mortar and pestle and characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray absorption spectroscopy xas powder xrd measurements cu k α radiation were performed with a bruker d 8 diffractometer using a rotating sample stage diffraction patterns were collected from 15 to 75 2θ 0 01 step sizes with a total data collection time of approximately 4 h per sample fe k edge x ray absorption spectra were collected for a subset of samples at the dutch belgium beam line dubble bm 26a of the european synchrotron radiation facility borsboom et al 1998 nikitenko et al 2008 procedures for xas sample preparation data collection and data analysis are given in the supplementary information in addition an extraction method was used to measure the fe content of the sls by treating a solid sample aliquot in 69 nitric acid for 12 h the fe concentration in the extracts was measured colourimetrically apha 2005 3 results 3 1 temporal evolution of lab and field anode reference experiments 3 1 1 faradaic efficiency fig 1 a compares the fe of the lab and field anode experiments at cdr 4 c l min in sgw reference conditions for up to 35 repeated operating cycles i e cycles of ec cell operation and overnight air drying the fe of the lab 04 experiment began at 0 85 and decreased continuously to 0 66 over 20 runs with strong reproducibility between replicate experiments increasing the number of operating cycles from n 20 to n 35 over 2 months of operation which is the longest continuous experiment in this study decreased the fe of the lab 04 experiment to 0 6 only the final data point is shown in fig 1 the behavior of the fe for the field 04 experiment was similar to that of the lab 04 experiment showing an initial fe near 0 85 and a continuous decrease to 0 62 over 20 operating cycles the match between the fe of the lab 04 and field 04 experiments indicates that the fe 0 anode purity does not play a critical role in determining the fe at cdr 4 c l min 3 1 2 anode interface potential the behavior of the ip over extended operation for the lab 04 and field 04 experiments is shown in fig 1b the ip of the lab 04 experiment increased from approximately 0 v vs ag agcl in the first run to 0 2 v vs ag agcl after 10 runs despite a continuous decrease in fe from operating cycle 10 to 35 the ip of the lab 04 experiment remained stable at 0 2 v vs ag agcl although the lab 04 and field 04 experiments showed nearly identical fe over time slight differences in the ip of these experiments was observed the field 04 experiment had a lower initial ip 0 4 v vs ag agcl than the lab anode but the ip of the field 04 experiment increased almost linearly over 20 runs resulting in a slightly higher final ip 0 3 v vs ag agcl than in the lab 04 experiment the total cell voltage of the field 04 experiment also increased slightly over time from 1 4 v to 2 4 v whereas the lab 04 experiment was stable at 2 3 v 3 1 3 surface layer formation fig 2 shows visually the macroscopic electrode sls formed after 35 operating cycles in the reference experiments fig s2 presents a detailed time series the onset of a sl occurred on the lab 04 anode after the first run and by operating cycle 8 the sl completely covered the fe 0 surface over 35 runs the texture of this sl became rough and the colour changed from yellow to dark orange macroscopic anodic sls were also observed in field 04 experiments fig 2 slightly more sl was produced in the lab anode 1 8 mg cm2 experiment relative to the field anode 0 6 mg cm2 table 2 x ray diffraction revealed that the anodic sls for both lab 04 and field 04 experiments consisted of ferrihydrite like poorly ordered fe iii precipitates based on the broad peak near 35 2θ fig 3 the line shape and positions of major oscillations in the fe k edge exafs spectrum fig s3 of the lab 04 anodic sls are consistent with oxyanion rich disordered fe iii precipitates with less fefe polymerization than 2 line ferrihydrite no features in the x ray diffractograms of the anodic sls of the lab 04 and field 04 experiments were consistent with goethite lepidocrocite or other fe ii iii minerals common in corrosion layers cook 2005 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates in the sls is likely due to the composition of the sgw electrolyte which contains high concentrations of surface poisoning silicate and phosphate senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2013 the formation and growth of cathodic sls were also observed in the lab 04 and field 04 experiments but the properties of these sls were different than the anodic sls for both cathodes orange sls formed after 3 7 runs and after 20 35 runs the cathodic sls became darker and more heterogeneous with clear white spots fig 2 in contrast to the anodic sls the cathodic sls were brittle cracked and did not adhere strongly to the electrode nearly identical sl quantities formed on the lab 04 6 6 mg cm2 and field 04 6 8 mg cm2 cathodes which is consistent with their similar colour and texture table 2 in contrast to the x ray diffractograms of the anodic sls diffraction peaks from caco3 were the dominant features of the x ray diffractograms of the cathodic sls fig 3 while no evidence for crystalline fe mineral phases appeared in the x ray diffractograms of the cathodic sls the brownish sl colour and the detection of fe in hno3 digested samples by wet chemical methods suggests that the sls contained fe iii precipitates the fe k edge xanes and exafs spectrum of the lab 04 cathodic sl fig s3 confirmed the presence of disordered fe iii precipitates which were also present in the lab 04 anodic sl the presence of a greater fraction of caco3 in the cathodic sls is consistent with the larger masses of these sls relative to the anodic sls and suggests that different processes contribute to anodic and cathodic sl formation 3 2 impact of charge dosage rate 3 2 1 faradaic efficiency fig 1c shows the fe for lab and field anode experiments performed at different cdr values over 15 to 20 operating cycles in sgw the fe was highly dependent on the cdr using lab anodes with increasing cdr favoring increased and sustained fe at cdr 15 c l min the fe for the lab anodes on the first run was between 0 9 and 1 0 which is higher than the 0 85 fe of the first cycle of the reference experiments at cdr of 4 c l min the first run of the experiment using the field anode at increased cdr 54 c l min also showed a high fe above 0 95 fig 1 remarkably the fe at cdr 15 c l min remained above 0 85 throughout the entire 15 to 20 runs in both lab and field anode experiments which contrasts the continuous fe decrease in experiments at low cdr experiments performed at cdr of 15 32 and 54 c l min all yielded similarly high and sustained fe which suggests a threshold cdr exists between 4 and 15 c l min that sustains high fe 3 2 2 anode interface potential the effect of cdr on the ip is shown in fig 1d the ip of the initial runs for both lab and field anodes increased with increasing cdr which is consistent with the butler volmer relationship bard and faulkner 2001 in contrast to the stable ip of the low cdr experiments the ip of experiments at elevated cdr increased with the number of operating cycles this trend in ip was most pronounced for the field 54 experiment which was below 0 5 v vs ag agcl initially but exceeded 2 v vs ag agcl after 15 runs despite ip values above 2 v vs ag agcl a fe 0 85 was maintained in these experiments indicating the production of fe ii was the dominant reaction on the anode consistent with the ip measurements the total cell voltage of all experiments increased over repeated operation with the largest increase from 7 to 11 v observed in the field 54 experiment after 16 runs 3 2 3 surface layer formation the macroscopic properties of the electrode sls depended strongly on the cdr fig 2 fig s4 for experiments at cdr 15 c l min only small quantities of anodic sls were produced 0 2 mg cm2 and these were darker compared to experiments at low cdr on the cathodes a very bright sl developed orange at the electrode center white near the edge and none of the macroscopic cracks found in the cathodic sls for low cdr experiments were observed in addition the quantity of cathodic sls at cdr 15 c l min 0 7 1 5 mg cm2 table 2 was substantially smaller than the low cdr experiments 6 mg cm2 3 3 electrolyte composition effects 3 3 1 faradaic efficiency the composition of the electrolyte played a critical role in the behavior of the fe over extended operating cycles fig 4 a regardless of the low cdr a stable fe 0 9 was observed for all runs in electrolytes containing no oxyanions such as the oxyanion free sgw electrolyte oxyanion free and the nacl electrolyte when oxyanions p si and inorganic carbon were present the decrease in fe over extended operating cycles was similar in the presence and absence of ca and mg for example the fe in the soft sgw electrolyte over 15 operating cycles closely resembled the reference experiments in sgw beginning near 0 85 and decreasing to below 0 7 the observations of sustained fe over repeated operating cycles in sgw at high cdr and in oxyanion free sgw at low cdr indicates that maintaining high fe depends on both the electrolyte composition and the cdr because the fe was already above 0 9 for the nacl 04 experiment increasing the cdr in this electrolyte did not further increase the fe 3 3 2 anode interface potential a considerably lower ip was observed in the absence of oxyanions fig 4b with the oxyanion free and nacl experiments remaining near 0 4 to 0 3 v vs ag agcl over the entire experimental duration consistent with the behavior of the fe in the soft sgw experiment the presence or absence of bivalent cations ca and mg did not impact the ip in agreement with the high cdr experiments in sgw increasing cdr from 4 to 54 c l min also increased the initial ip in the nacl electrolyte from 0 4 to 0 7 v vs ag agcl however the same continued increase in ip over 20 runs observed in sgw was not observed in the nacl electrolyte 3 3 3 surface layer formation the composition of the electrolyte altered the formation and growth of sls on both anodes and cathodes in the oxyanion free experiments where a high fe was sustained only 0 3 mg cm2 of dark reddish sl was produced on the anode during the experiment fig s5 table 2 by contrast 1 8 mg cm2 was removed from the anode used in the soft sgw experiments which was the same anodic sl amount in the analogous sgw experiment the anodic sls for the soft sgw experiment consisted of primarily poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates which was also observed in the reference experiments fig 3 approximately 1 2 and 0 2 mg cm2 were removed from the anodes in the nacl 04 and nacl 54 experiments and lepidocrocite was the major phase detected by xrd in these sls fig 3 the amount of cathodic sls that formed in the oxyanion free experiment 6 2 mg cm2 matched that of the analogous sgw experiment 6 6 mg cm2 in the soft sgw electrolyte which contained no bivalent cations and prevented caco3 formation bare metal was still observed on the cathode after the entire experimental duration 15 operating cycles and only 0 7 mg cm2 was removed table 2 the cathodic sls generated in the soft sgw electrolyte were found to consist of primarily poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates based on xrd fig 3 black sls displaying magnetite peaks in xrd formed on the cathodes in nacl 04 and nacl 54 experiments with greater sl mass formed in the nacl 04 experiment 1 6 mg cm2 relative to nacl 54 0 8 mg cm2 3 4 polarization alteration and electrode storage 3 4 1 faradaic efficiency fig 4c shows that single polarity reversal polarity 1 between every operating cycle decreased the fe similar to the experiments without polarity reversal the lab 04 reference experiments until run number 10 after run 10 the fe of polarity 1 experiments was consistently lower than experiments without polarity reversal reversing the polarity 5 times during each operating cycle resulted in a more rapid decrease in fe to below 0 5 after only 10 runs overnight electrode storage in sgw was also unsuccessful at sustaining fe over extended operating cycles fig 4c shows that the fe of sgw storage experiments decreased more rapidly than for dry storage conditions reaching 0 5 after 20 runs 3 4 2 anode interface potential although the polarity alteration experiments did not sustain the fe these experiments did produce a lower ip over extended operation fig 4d with a final ip for the polarity 1 and polarity 5 experiments near 0 3 v vs ag agcl the total cell voltages of these experiments were also the lowest in our study and decreased with increasing operating cycles table s2 the ip of the sgw storage experiments was slightly lower than dry storage conditions and ended at 0 2 v vs ag agcl after 20 runs 3 4 3 surface layer formation reversing the electrode polarity strongly impacted properties of the electrode sls the polarity 1 and polarity 5 electrodes displayed a brittle orange layer that chipped away from the electrode easily which is similar to the cathodic sls formed in other experiments these results are consistent with both electrodes serving as anode and cathode large sl quantities formed on these electrodes 7 2 mg cm2 for polarity 1 and 10 mg cm2 for polarity 5 table 2 the x ray diffractograms of the polartiy 1 and polarity 5 sls indicated the presence of caco3 fig 3 while the fe k edge exafs spectrum of the polarity 1 sls indicated the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates with similar structure to the solids contained in the reference lab 04 anodic sl fig s3 the sgw storage electrodes produced the largest quantity of anodic sls 20 mg cm2 and both anodic and cathodic sls consisted of a mixture of caco3 and poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates 4 discussion 4 1 repeated operation decreases fe in conditions representative of fe ec field treatment the results for fe ec experiments with operating parameters and solution composition representative of fe ec field treatment support the hypothesis that operating fe ec under field conditions can lead to a decrease in fe which adversely effects fe ec performance the lab 04 field 04 and polarity 1 experiments replicate closely the raw water composition and operating conditions i e cdr electrolysis time current density a v ratio dry storage used in existing fe ec plants that treat arsenic contaminated groundwater van genuchten et al 2016 our results showed a systematic decrease in the fe with repeated operation in each of these experiments for example the fe continuously decreased over the two month long duration of the lab 04 experiment leading to a 40 lower fe dose to solution than expected by faraday s law this decrease in fe would impair contaminant removal efficiency by decreasing the amount of fe available to sorb or reduce the target species for a given coulomb of charge passed a decrease in fe over extended operation was also observed in the field 04 and polarity 1 experiments which replicate even closer fe ec field treatment field 04 uses a lower purity anode taken from an existing fe ec plant in india polarity 1 applies the same cycle of polarity reversal therefore our results confirm a previous hypothesis that a decrease in fe contributes to the poorer contaminant removal efficiency observed for fe ec electrodes with a large sl build up relative to newly cleaned and well maintained fe ec electrodes van genuchten et al 2016 this conclusion is consistent with the similar growth of fe bearing anodic sls in the lab 04 field 04 and polarity 1 experiments and the sls documented in fe ec field systems operated for many months 4 2 electrochemical and solution chemical variables that sustain high fe although the experiments designed to mimic existing fe ec plant operation showed a decreased fe over time our results revealed at least two electro chemical variables that could be manipulated to sustain high fe for 1 2 months i the charge dosage rate cdr and ii the electrolyte composition furthermore we observed that a sustained fe in these experiments correlated with low anodic sl growth in the following sections we discuss and provide explanations for the impact of cdr and electrolyte composition on the fe and electrode sls 4 2 1 charge dosage rate as shown in fig 1c experiments at cdr 15 c l min produced a larger initial fe 0 9 compared to cdr 4 c l min 0 85 and more importantly sustained this high fe over repeated operating cycles simultaneously experiments at high cdr showed a decrease in anodic sl mass the beneficial effect of increasing cdr on the fe can be explained by processes related to the accumulation of fe oxides at the electrode surface in ec systems the cdr is directly proportional to the addition rate of fe ii speciated as the free fe2 ion at circumneutral ph therefore an increase in cdr from 4 to 15 c l min increases the flux of positively charged fe2 at least 4 fold while simultaneously increasing the anodic ip fig 1d the combination of a higher flux of positively charged fe2 and higher positive charge of the anode increases cation diffusion and electrostatic repulsive forces between the anode and cations which facilitates the migration of the fe2 to the bulk solution rather than accumulation at the anode surface furthermore the increased flux of fe ii at high cdr would also lead to strong chemical gradients near the anode surface especially with respect to dissolved oxygen do for example experiments at cdr 15 c l min consumed the dissolved oxygen concentration to 0 1 mg l which resulted in the formation of mixed valent fe oxides green rust in sgw magnetite in nacl see figs s4 and s5 this dissolved oxygen behavior contrasts that of the low cdr experiments where dissolved oxygen remained near 3 0 mg l and purely fe iii oxyhydr oxides formed an increase in fe ii flux at high cdr can deplete dissolved oxygen levels near the anode rapidly which would prevent fe ii oxidation and the formation of fe iii bearing solids that can deposit on the electrode as a sl finally the different macroscopic properties of the mixed valent fe oxides that formed in high cdr experiments fig s4 which consisted of much larger flocs than the low cdr solids could also facilitate lower sl growth and sustained fe to elucidate the contribution of dissolved oxygen depletion to the increase in fe with increasing cdr we performed a series of experiments at cdr 54 c l min in sgw while bubbling air continuously during operation o2 54 in these experiments the dissolved oxygen never decreased below 3 0 mg l and fe iii precipitates formed fig s4 but the fe still remained 0 8 for the entire duration 15 cycles therefore we expect the role of dissolved oxygen on the fe to be a second order effect relative to the cdr 4 2 2 electrolyte composition the most significant effect of electrolyte composition on the fe was observed in the presence of oxyanions while changes in ph can impact many processes during fe ec treatment our results indicate that ph was a secondary effect relative to the presence of oxyanions in our experiments table 2 summarizes the ph behavior for each experiment as shown in fig 4a the fe in experiments with electrolyte solutions rich in phosphate p silicate si and carbonate i e sgw and soft sgw decreased over repeated operating cycles for experiments at cdr 4 c l min by contrast the fe in electrolyte solutions free of p si and carbonate oxyanion free nacl remained high throughout the experiment and sl growth was minimal regardless of ph the impact of oxyanions on the fe and sl properties can be attributed to two processes first oxyanions such as p and si are well known to passivate fe 0 metal in natural corrosion systems bojinov et al 1999 because of their high sorption affinity for fe precipitates roberts et al 2004 si and p can bind to oxidized fe at the anode surface leading to an oxyanion rich sl that modifies anodic properties including decreased electrical conductance indeed the presence of p in single solute electrolytes was shown to decrease dramatically the fe of fe ec systems over single operating cycles which was explained by the formation of passifying p rich sls that increased the ip and promoted the anodic h2o oxidation to form o2 rather than anodic fe 0 oxidation van genuchten et al 2017 second the presence of high concentrations of p and si during the formation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides inhibits fe iii polymerization and leads to poorly ordered nanoscale particles that do not aggregate flocculate and settle on practical time scales van genuchten et al 2014 the x ray diffractograms fig 3 and fe k edge exafs spectra fig s3 of sls in oxyanion rich experiments confirmed the presence of poorly crystalline fe iii precipitates with structures consistent with oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide doelsch et al 2000 it was also observed visually that the fe iii precipitates produced in experiments with oxyanion rich solutions remained suspended throughout electrolysis whereas large coagulated flocs formed readily in oxyanion free solutions even during rapid mixing fig s5 compares the visible flocs in the nacl 04 experiment with the more colloidally stable lab 04 suspension since the nanoscale less aggregated fe iii precipitates formed in oxyanion rich solutions remain in suspension longer these solids are more likely to contact deposit and be trapped on the fe 0 anode which would decrease the fe although the presence or absence of bivalent cations did not play a major role in altering the behavior of the fe ca and mg were found to impact electrode sl properties in many experiments the x ray diffractograms of cathodic sls were dominated by caco3 when bivalent cations co occurred with carbonate this result can be explained by the combination of the negative electrode potential at the cathode which would attract positively charged ca and mg cations and the cathodic reduction of h2o to form h2 g which is the dominant cathodic reaction in fe ec treatment lakshmanan et al 2009 the cathodic formation of h2 g consumes h ions leading to a region of high ph near the cathode which favors the formation of carbonate minerals e g caco3 mgco3 although we found that reactions at the anode were not affected by cathodic caco3 formation in fixed polarity experiments the polarity 1 and polarity 5 experiments displayed a lower fe and greater sl mass relative to the lab 04 and field 04 experiments the poorer fe in the polarity reversal experiments can be explained by the large and porous caco3 bearing sls acting as sink for ec generated fe ii when the cathode becomes the anode thus inhibiting transport of aqueous fe to the bulk solution and decreasing the fe the x ray diffractograms of sl samples from the polarity reversal experiments are dominated by caco3 but fe k edge exafs spectroscopy fig s3 confirmed that the polarity 1 sls contain poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with structures similar to those in the lab 04 anodic sls 4 3 implications for fe ec field operation this study provides a number of useful results to inform fe ec field treatment including the selection of electrode materials and optimization of operational parameters and maintenance for example the purity of the fe 0 anode did not significantly impact the long term performance of the electrodes with the lab 04 and field 04 experiments displaying nearly identical fe behavior sl growth and mineralogy and total cell potential since the impurity content of the lab and field electrodes varied strongly lab electrodes 99 fe field electrodes 92 fe the similar decrease in the fe for these electrodes suggests that the oxidation of non ferrous steel components such as manganese or carbon is not the primary driver of reduced fe more importantly these results indicate that the electrode purity is not a critical factor in fe ec system performance which suggests that less costly and locally available electrode materials with lower purity can be implemented in fe ec field systems without sacrificing long term efficiency however we note that some steel can contain toxic metal impurities e g cr v ni sb the release of which must be avoided during fe 0 ec treatment in addition the ip and total cell voltage increased over extended operating cycles more for the field anode suggesting that higher purity steel should be used to decrease power consumption if available at similar costs as impure steel with respect to maintaining a stable and high fe over extended operation which is critical for efficient and reliable fe ec field treatment our study suggests that increasing the cdr and avoiding the presence of oxyanions can help to sustain the fe modifying the electrolyte composition of the untreated raw water to eliminate oxyanions prior to treatment is impractical at large scales but could be done by employing a separate fe 0 electrolysis dosing chamber with controlled solution composition that feeds into the contaminated water influent a much more appropriate option to sustain fe over extended operation is to simply increase the cdr this strategy requires only increasing the operating current which can be performed easily at existing fe ec plants without new infrastructure although increasing the cdr decreases the total electrolysis time which can be advantageous in areas with intermittent power supply increasing the cdr also increases power consumption 0 26 kwh m3 at 4 c l min 1 17 kwh m3 at 54 c l min table s2 because of the larger cell voltage and total electric work required to pass the same amount of charge therefore our results suggest an optimum cdr exists that sustains the fe and minimizes power consumption which can be identified precisely with local water using 15 c l min as a recommended starting value another consequence of increasing the cdr can be the formation of particles with different properties i e mixed valent fe oxides rather than fe iii precipitates the impact of generating precipitates that contain structural fe ii e g magnetite green rust on contaminant removal by fe ec could be positive or negative but if negative this process can be counteracted by incorporating an air cathode into treatment design the h2o2 generated by an air cathode system would oxidize fe ii rapidly and prevent the accumulation of fe ii needed for mixed valent fe oxide formation si et al 2017 preventing the formation and growth of electrode sls is another viable option to enhance the performance of fe ec field treatment in this study we investigated two low cost methods of inhibiting sl formation that can be applied easily in existing fe ec treatment plants to minimize sl growth arising from fe 0 oxidation by atmospheric o2 during overnight air storage we stored the electrodes in the sgw solution between operating cycles this strategy was not effective resulting in greater sl growth compared to overnight air drying and one of the poorest fe we also examined different cycles of polarity reversal during treatment which is often proposed as an electrochemical method of cleaning the electrodes by cathodic reduction of fe iii bearing sls timmes et al 2010 this strategy also proved unsuccessful at decreasing sl growth and maintaining high fe the ineffectiveness of reversing the electrode polarity can be explained by the formation of caco3 on the cathode which can trap electrochemically generated fe ii when the cathode becomes the anode since both unobtrusive methods of electrode cleaning were ineffective physical or chemical cleaning of the electrodes can be pursued the simplicity and reliability of sl removal by mechanical brushing fits the constraints of decentralized fe ec treatment and is currently practiced in some existing systems amrose et al 2014 but this technique requires a large workforce chemical removal of sls by strong mineral acids is effective but requires skilled labor and proper disposal of strong acid waste therefore the use of citric acid or other non hazardous organic acids which is often applied in potable water treatment to remove inorganic layers from filter membranes could be a more practical option for chemical sl removal strugholtz et al 2005 5 conclusions the contaminant removal efficiency of fe ec systems hinges on the efficient anodic production of aqueous fe ii and transport to the bulk solution we found a continuous decrease in fe to roughly 0 6 which was accompanied by electrode sl growth over repeated operating cycles 2 months in experiments that mimicked fe ec field treatment this result helps explain reported differences in contaminant removal efficiency for lab and field fe ec treatment and should be considered for accurate predictions of fe ec treatment efficiency over extended periods the decrease in fe was not related to the purity of the 99 and 92 fe electrodes used in this work rather the behavior of the fe and the formation and growth of electrode sls depended more on the electrolyte composition i e presence of oxyanions and the cdr because adjusting the cdr in existing fe ec plants is simple low cost and requires no new infrastructure we propose that increasing the cdr is the most ideal method of sustaining the fe over extended operation however prior to adjusting the cdr preliminary experiments should be performed at existing fe ec facilities to verify that undesirable changes to fe oxide particle formation do not occur previously proposed strategies to remove sls formed in cases of poor fe were unsuccessful polarity reversal water saturated electrode storage suggesting that mechanical or chemical methods could be pursued for periodic sl removal the results of this work help inform the design of new fe ec

pretreatment to remove particulate and colloidal matter as well as dissolved organic and inorganic components which could potentially foul the membrane henthorne and boysen 2015 conventional pretreatment by coagulation flocculation and filtration sometimes including dissolved air flotation still predominates in the industry and is often inadequate for achieving low fouling ro feedwater prihasto et al 2009 ultrafiltration uf or microfiltration mf considered state of the art in ro pretreatment are very efficient for the reduction of particulate and colloidal matter but not capable of removing dissolved organics control of the dissolved components may require different technologies depending on how they impact ro membranes foulants such as humic compounds that exert their fouling action by adsorption on the membrane need to be removed by adsorption to hydrophobic carriers such as powdered activated carbon or granular activated carbon naidu et al 2013 soluble microbial growth substrates such as oligosaccharides or peptides by themselves often non fouling chemicals are important fouling inducers because of their role as substrates for the growth of biofilms on the membrane surfaces these compounds represent the assimilable organic carbon aoc pool of biodegradable organics present in the water their removal from feedwater requires biological reactors since they are not effectively captured in flocs in conventional pretreatment schneider et al 2005 and are only marginally rejected in mf or uf derlon et al 2014 biological reactors for water treatment include biological activated carbon reactors bac biological rapid sand filters biorsf and ssf bac reactors contain highly porous activated carbon media with a dual purpose of providing a large surface area for organics absorption and a substrate for attachment and growth of microbial biofilms korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 hu et al 2005 pramanik et al 2015 when new bac operated with empty bed

dead cells clogs the water channels the permeability of which is restored by backwashing after about 5 6 years of operation doc removal in granular activated carbon gac filters drops to 25 of the applied load and filters need to be regenerated benstoem et al 2017 biorsf differ from rapid sand filters in the need for establishment of a functional aoc degrading microbial biofilm on the media surfaces during a maturation period of about 3 months bar zeev et al 2012 in the case of seawater 6 months were needed for steady state biological activity in both gac and dual media biofilters zhang et al 2017 the primary role of biorsf however remains particle removal which requires frequent backwashes to restore hydraulic performance beachwells or riverbank infiltration systems which rely on microbiota established on engineered surfaces or native subsurface porous aquifer media are another biofiltration option for ro feedwater pretreatment missimer et al 2013 hydraulic loading rates are high in biorsf and bac but much smaller in ssf beachwells or riverbank infiltration systems lautenschlager et al 2014 a constructed seabed infiltration gallery has been in operation at the fukuoka

hijnen et al 2004 rejected particles accumulate at the filter surface forming an organic rich layer the schmutzdecke where intensive biological activity develops microbiological mediated contaminant removal in ssf occurs by predation scavenging adsorption and bio oxidation haig et al 2011 apart from bacteria protozoa weber shirk and dick 1999 and higher organisms midget larvae for example wotton and hirabayashi 1999 contribute significantly to the turnover of particulate organic matter the microbial community usually requires several weeks to acclimate for contaminant removal campos et al 2002 biodegradation by microbial biofilms predominates in the schmutzdecke and in the sand layers immediately below it whilst deeper sections contribute to further adsorptive removal of colloidal and dissolved matter studies on the use of ssf for pretreatment of ro feedwater are rare not one was cited in a recent review by prihasto et al 2009 amsterdam water supply reported that trains consisting of ozonation bac followed by ssf or ssf alone treating rhine river water produced ro feedwater of excellent quality with respect to membrane fouling index doc aoc and biofilm formation rate permitting stable operation of the ro units van der hoek et al 2000 the ozonation train was considered the better process configuration because of the potentially more efficient removal of trace organics ssf of colorado river water and of yuma desalting plant brackish source water reduced both turbidity and sdi by approximately 90 moody et al 2007 in a comparative study of direct application of central arizona project canal water to ssf and mf for pretreatment corral et al 2014 demonstrated that both technologies produced feedwater of adequate quality for ro at comparable life cycle costs excellent swro membrane system performance was achieved in a pilot study of ssf for seawater ro pretreatment meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 manes et al 2011 reported that mf and ssf in infiltration gallery configuration were more effective than conventional pretreatment for removal of bacteria in seawater pretreatment for swro in their recent slow sand filtration study conducted under conditions relevant for beachwell intakes dehwah and missimer 2017 concluded that the entire 1 m length of the column was active in the removal of feedwater organics and that slow sand filters operated with seawater do not develop a biologically active schmutzdecke the major advantage of ssf is the capability of chemicals free turbidity and aoc removal none of the direct competing technologies provide truly chemicals free pretreatment mf or uf operation depends on periodic chemical assisted backwashes and chemical cleaning of membranes ssf is much simpler to operate than mf or uf and does not carry major component replacement costs membranes during its lifetime operational simplicity of ssf is an important advantage in regions or countries without ready availability of the skilled staff life cycle costs of ssf in seawater pretreatment are lower than those of conventional or membrane plants because no chemicals are used and of lower energy and materials expenditure the major disadvantage of ssf is the larger land area required to treat a particular volume of water a consequence of the engineering of ssf units for ro pretreatment by the standards applicable for drinking water ssf further optimization of this technology for ro pretreatment depends on a better understanding of removal mechanisms in the filtration layer in their seawater ssf study conducted under conditions relevant for seabed filtration intake design dehwah and missimer 2017 did not evaluate the removal of assimilable organic carbon proteins and carbohydrates all of which are of critical importance to the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces this study was conducted with ssf simulating conventional surface seawater pretreatment to investigate the hypothesis that only a small vertical section of the filtration medium would suffice to achieve optimum ssf performance for the control of turbidity aoc and of proteins and carbohydrates for seawater ro feeds 2 materials and methods 2 1

pretreatment unit was installed at the premises of the marine biology center of the university of são paulo cebimar located at the southern entrance of the 25 km long são sebastião channel at the north coast of são paulo state fig 1 the seawater intake was a ¾ hose placed about 5 m from the rocky shore at a water depth of 2 m and about 1 m above the sea bottom the water was pumped through about 100 m of polyvinylchloride pvc pipes to an arkal 100 μm disk filter cartridge amiad water systems israel and stored in a 300 l water reservoir on a 4 m high tower from where it was distributed by gravity to the ssfs fig 2 a 2000l polypropylene tanks with a filtration surface area of 1 69 m2 were filled with a 5 cm bottom layer of granite rocks 20 60 mm followed by 5 cm of fine gravel 2 8 mm and 60 cm of filter sand effective grain size d10 of 0 1 mm and a uniformity coefficient of 2 3 the sand was sourced from quarry santa isabel ltda to ensure it was clean and not contaminated with organics as would be inevitable for sand sourced from beaches or from river sediments the sand was washed in batches of 150 kg in a 300 l water tank fitted with aerators to suspend the sand and to dislodge attached particles fines and dirt were washed out by an upward flow of clean freshwater a 60 cm water column on top of the sand provided the driving force for filtration the water level was kept constant by a mechanical float valve the effluent discharge pipe was configured as a siphon with the top bend located about 20 cm above the schmutzdecke to prevent drying out of the filter surface in case of interruption of feed flow feedwater was sampled directly from the inlet port fig 2b further sampling points were installed on the side walls of the filtration tank at the level of the schmutzdecke and 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm below it fig 2b the pvc sampling tubes were laterally inserted about 30 cm into the sand layer ½ diameter 15 cm long the perforated tubes were fitted with an endcap and their surface was covered with a layer of fine gravel held together by polyethylene mesh to prevent ingress of filter sand into the sampling tube two filters were operated in parallel one used in a previous experiment oldssf where the original schmutzdecke had been removed and replaced by clean sand for this new run and a second newly built one newssf filtration rate was 0 1mh 1 corresponding to the minimum rate recommended in the literature huisman and wood 1974 visscher 1990 ellis and aydin 1995 the filtration rate was measured daily in the morning between 9 and 10am and adjusted to the target rate if required by opening or closing the filtrate valve 2 3 microbial growth potential microbial growth potential mgp was determined by a microbial growth assay similar to the one for quantification of aoc originally developed for analysis of tap water by van der kooij et al 1982 since the strains recommended in the aoc standard method are not marine organisms an organism was isolated for the growth assays by spread plating fresh seawater from the site on marine agar bd difco the isolate that grew best in autoclaved site seawater adopted for the assays was identified by 16s rdna sequencing as pseudoalteromonas spongiae for determination of mgp sample collection and preparation of vials followed the procedures described by weinrich et al 2009 samples were filtered 0 22 μm and pasteurized in a 70 c water bath for 30 min for preparation of inocula pseudolateromonas cells transferred from marine agar to filtered 0 22 μm and autoclaved 120 c 15 min natural seawater

of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membrane surfaces laminar fluid flow chambers made of acrylic fitted with clean sections of re2540 sr swro membrane csm seoul korea area 36 cm2 were connected to the six sampling points along the filters to monitor biofilm formation the chambers were wrapped in aluminum foil for protection from sunlight flow through the chambers was constant at 30lh 1 a first batch of membranes was tested during the first 60 days of operation a second batch for another 60 days from day 88 onward biofouling was analyzed by assessing protein bradford 1976 and carbohydrates dubois et al 1956 content in the fouling layers 2 5 filtration media analysis at the end of the experiment the filters were drained and pvc tubes of 5 cm diameter and about 1 5 m length were driven

were not affected by passage through the filters raw water turbidity ranged from 0 7 to 15 ntu fig 3 a whilst filtrate turbidity in both ssf remained consistently below 0 3 ntu fig 3b and c effluent turbidities of the two ssf were similar the high suspended solids content prevented sdi analysis of raw water filtrate sdi values were measured on day 4 3 9 oldssf and 4 2 newssf day 60 3 8 oldssf and 3 6 newssf and day 174 2 5 oldssf and 2 8 newssf hydraulic load of the filters was adjusted daily in the morning to the target value and remained steady during the day the loads measured immediately before adjustment fig 4 a frequently showed a small head loss during the night fig 4a in both filters the averaged hydraulic filter load declined steadily during the 6 months operational period with a slightly faster decline for oldssf the actual fits to the regression lines were rather poor the lines have been included only for illustration of the hydraulic load tendency over time head loss was rather small in the first month fig 4b but then it jumped abruptly to a daily average value around 0 01 m h for newssf and 0 02 m h for oldssf interestingly the water temperature dropped a few degrees at the time of head loss increase and began to show small variations thereafter fig 4c 3 2 microbial growth potential variation of feedwater mgp during the experiment was not statistically significant mgp in filtrates of oldssf and newssf were mostly similar and began to drop significantly below the values of raw water between 60 and 79 days of operation oldssf and 79 94 days newssf when product water aoc supported the growth of about 1 log less pseudoalteromonas cells than the feedwater aoc fig 5 vertical mgp profiling in the filters demonstrated that most mgp reduction occurred in the schmutzdecke and in the first 30 cm of filter sand below the schmutzdecke fig 6 no further mgp reduction was recorded in the deeper filter sections 3 3 bacterial colonization of sand media sem analysis demonstrated intense colonization by microorganisms of the schmutzdecke but sand particles from deeper layers were only lightly colonized or appeared clean fig 7 protein and carbohydrate content in bed samples showed similar trends for both filters and dropped sharply between the schmutzdecke to a depth of approximately 10 cm and remained steady in the deeper sections of the filters fig 8 interestingly the degree of reduction of mgp in the filter did not correlate directly with the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on the media surfaces fig 8 3 4 proteins and carbohydrates on membrane surfaces slow sand filtration without biological acclimation drastically diminished the accumulation of proteins oldssf 60 new ssf 66 and carbohydrates oldssf 75 and newssf 70 on membrane surfaces fig 9 the reductions of proteins oldssf 81 and new ssf 76 and carbohydrates oldssf 88 and newssf 88 were even greater after filter maturation fouling layers on sand filter media contained more carbohydrates than proteins fig 8 but the opposite occurred on the layers deposited on the membranes fig 9 4 discussion this is the first study about the capacity of seawater ssf to contribute to the control of 3 parameters critical for membrane biofouling microbial growth potential proteins and carbohydrates the microbial growth potential of the water was reduced by 90 after a filter maturation period of between 2 and 3 months filtration alone reduced the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membranes operated in crossflow mode in a laminar fluid flow cell by 70 shortly after filter startup this reduction rose to 85 after 2 3 months when the biological activity was fully established carbohydrates predominated in filter biofilms whereas proteins were more common on membrane surface deposits turbidity and sdi of ssf product water were consistently of acceptable quality for ro membrane feed vertical profiling demonstrated that practically all beneficial effects of the filters were restricted to the top 30 cm section with deeper layers not contributing significantly to improvement of product water quality filter runs of approximately 6 months were achieved with both oldssf and newssf 4 1 ssf filtrate water quality and performance ssf operated in this study produced seawater filtrate acceptable for ro feed without the need of coagulant chemicals or control of backwash cycles turbidity was consistently below 0 3ntu a performance similar to that reported by shrestha et al 2014 for biofiltration of seawater with anthracite gac and sand all 0 16 to 0 40 ntu at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 12 m h biofiltration of seawater with gac or anthracite at higher hlr of 5 10 m h chinu et al 2009 naidu et al 2013 or with expanded clay biofilters at an hlr of 6 m h yielded product water with similar turbidities simon et al 2013 as did direct uf or mf of seawater jezowska et al 2009 significantly lower turbidities of less than 0 1ntu required more sophisticated seawater pretreatment trains comprising coagulation dissolved air flotation and as final filtrations stages uf or dual media filtration guastalli et al 2013 the sdi of 2 5 for oldssf and 2 8 for newssf after 174 days were adequate for ro feed and in the range of those reported by jeong et al 2016 for filtrates from dual media filtration operated in biological filtration mode hollow fiber membrane seawater permeates sdi reported in the literature varied from 0 7 to 3 teng et al 2003 guastalli et al 2013 reported sdi of 2 and 1 for their more complex pretreatment schemes mentioned before comparative seawater pretreatment pilot testing comprising a conventional ssf a conventional treatment train coagulation flocculation sedimentation rapid sand filtration and mf or uf showed average turbidities of ssf to be similar to those of a conventional treatment train while mf or uf permeate turbidity were significantly lower meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 these authors also reported sdi values of ssf product water comparable to those of mf or uf permeates and smaller than those of conventional treatment normalized specific flux and differential pressure of the ro during the 4500 h test run with ssf and uf mf pretreated water were similar and better than those achieved with conventionally produced water ssf pretreatment was more robust than mf uf for high turbidity or algal bloom disturbances 4 2 factors contributing to sdi in ssf filtrate filter ripening led to a reduction of the breakthrough or release of particulate and colloidal materials as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of sdi during the 174 days of operation only feedwater particles or colloids with low affinity to the mainly organic constitution of the schmutzdecke and the inorganic hydrophilic surfaces of the sand will eventually break through into product water the other three potential sources of sdi material in filtrate are produced and or released from the inside of the filter matrix filter media fines left in the media after construction will be washed out until their reservoir in the sand column is depleted the steadily diminishing contribution of this particle stream to the particle load in the product water over time probably contributed to the progressive reduction of sdi ssf surfaces are covered by microbial biofilms when reaching a steady state microbial biofilms release fragments into the surrounding medium by sloughing or by the detachment of individual cells through erosion xavier et al 2005 very little information is available in the literature about the contribution of desorbed colloidal organics and inorganics to filtrate sdi most organic carbon of the doc fraction of seawater is of low molecular weight below 1000da xu and guo 2017 shrestha et al 2014 reported that sand filters removed 94 of the hydrophobic organics of seawater 62 9 of hydrophilic neutrals 45 7 of biopolymers and 32 8 of hydrophilic molecules whilst humic substances and their hydrolysates passed practically unchanged through the filters humic substances building blocks low molecular weight neutrals and low molecular weight acids were only marginally removed in the experiments reported by dehwah and missimer 2017 4 3 aoc reduction in ssf pseudoalteromonas spongiae used in the bioassay to quantify the reduction of biodegradable organic matter was first isolated from the surfaces of marine sponges by lau et al 2005 members of this genus are known biofilm formers mai prochnow et al 2006 frequently isolated from marine sediment samples where they are involved in the cycling of organic matter mi et al 2015 and have also been recovered from seawater reverse osmosis membrane biofilms nagaraj et al 2018 after maturation ssf biofilms reduced the amount of mgp to the extent of supporting the growth of 1 order of magnitude less cells of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in product water this performance was similar to the 80 and 90 reductions reported by simon et al 2013 for packed bed biofilters and by naidu et al 2013 for gac biofilters respectively dual media filters whilst not designed primarily for biofiltration may be operated as aoc biodegradation reactors albeit with a much lower removal efficiency of 40 50 jeong et al 2016 only the labile mostly small molecular weight fraction of seawater organic carbon is easily degraded in biofiltration eighmy et al 1992 the semi recalcitrant fraction may be perhaps reduced somewhat in the schmutzdecke where the dense layer of organics allows extracellular hydrolases to act more efficiently whilst the recalcitrant fraction will either pass unchanged or be adsorbed in the filter carlson and ducklow 1996 reduction of the aoc was restricted to the first 30 cm of the media column with no further improvement in deeper layers attempts at further reducing aoc in a second identical ssf operated in series with product water from the first ssf as feed were not successful not shown eighmy et al 1992 reported a rapid decline of microbial populations in the top 10 cm of full scale ssf treating freshwater managed conventionally by periodical removal of the schmutzdecke in filters where the schmutzdecke was managed by deep harrowing the population remained high up to the maximum harrowing depth of 30 cm and dropped steeply below it most biomass in expanded clay biofilters was concentrated in the first half of the 1 m deep filter columns simon et al 2013 hijnen and van der kooij 1992 demonstrated that all spiked acetate in the concentration range of 0 01 0 25 mgcl 1 was removed in 20 cm sand columns at hydraulic loads between 0 2 and 5 m h and that microbial counts dropped sharply in the first few cm of the columns mgp reduction in the oldssf started about 2 3 weeks before it became detectable in newssf a reflection of the presence of an inoculum already adapted to degradation of the feedwater aoc from a previous ssf filtration run the top 10 cm of sand had been removed along with the schmutzdecke from the oldssf prior to the start of the experiment the elimination of aoc was not complete in the filters because the filtrate still contained sufficient aoc to support a 10 100 fold increase of the population of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in the assay from a very low starting inoculum of 102 cells ml organics released by killed planktonic or biofilm cells after pasteurization most certainly increased the aoc of the samples this additional aoc would not have been available in the original sample where physiologically active cells and biofilm fragments would have acted as additional sinks for dissolved aoc in the filters limitation of nutrients other than carbon could have contributed to the cessation of aoc reduction in filter sections below 30 cm where microbial colonization was small however the 10 100 fold increase of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in the mgp assays with final product water demonstrated that nutrients other than organic carbon were present in sufficient quantity to support heterotrophic growth of this organism 4 4 increase of filtration resistance head loss in the filters was caused by events occurring in the top 5 10 cm of the sand column because oldssf permeability loss from a previous run over a similar amount of time had been fully restored by removing the top 10 cm of sand and replacing it with new clean sand in addition no head loss was observed in a slow sand filter of identical design operated in series with filtrate from the first ssf as feed not shown the driving force for filtration in ssf was produced by the water column above the schmutzdecke in conjunction with restriction of flow in the filtrate valve the water column in this work was about half to one third of that recommended in ssf design manuals 60 cm vs 1 1 5 m huisman and wood 1974 due to constraint of the height of the tanks available for the filtration experiment the smaller water column allowed a more sensitive detection of variations of filtration resistance which is strongly affected by the development of the schmutzdecke jabur et al 2005 considered head loss in ssf to be caused by the combined action of the resistance of the clean filtration media due primarily to the sand column and a variable component due to the contribution of the schmutzdecke and interstitial deposits and biofilms the authors assumed that sand column resistance remained constant in the filtration run the sharp rise in head loss after about 1 5 months indicates that the hydraulic impact of the development of the scmutzdecke became detectable before it reached its full biological activity potential after about 2 3months of operation another potential cause for such a sharp rise in head loss are negative pressures inside the filter jabur et al 2005 huisman and wood 1974 which cause the release of gases from the solution and formation of air pockets that could partially clogg the filters the occurrence of such negative pressures was prevented by the syphon placed about 20 cm above the filter sand surface in the filtrate line head loss was measured daily and it progressed on average at 0 01m day newssf and 0 02m day newssf which indicates that the factors that contributed to head loss became more severe as the filtration run progressed the faster head loss of the oldssf suggests that material from a previous filtration run contributed to the hydraulic resistance in the actual run the cumulative headlosses over a 30day period in this work of between 0 3 m newssf and 0 6 m oldssf were smaller than the cumulative head losses of 1 2 m 2 8 m reported by jabur et al 2005 head loss spikes show that factors beyond the physical accumulation of material in the schmutzdecke influenced filtration resistance interestingly the step increase in filtration resistance was detected about at the same time as variations of the water temperature increased due to onset of winter with relatively warm days and cooler nights gas solubility in water is affected by temperature and outgassing would have occurred when the filters heated up since gases are less soluble at higher water temperatures the temperature range of water in this study between 15 c and 24 c would have translated into a variation of oxygen solubility between 6 7 and 8 1 mg l leroy creswell 1993 co2 dissolution in water is a complex chemical equilibrium process which involves ph dependent acid base reactions but the solubility of this gas is very high of the order of 1 3 g l at 20 c zhao et al 2013 weiss 1974 it is unlikely that outgassing due to the much smaller daily variations of water temperature would have represented a key factor in increased filtration resistance changes of dissolved gases such as oxygen or carbon dioxide by biological activity could have potentially contributed to rapid and unpredictable increases of filtration resistance oxygen produced during daylight hours by photosynthetic organisms may reach supersaturating concentrations bissett et al 2008 whilst at the same time reducing carbon dioxide in the night increased heterotrophic activity leads to consumption of oxygen and accumulation of co2 filtration resistance increase by both pure oxygen or pure carbon dioxide bubbles in the biologically active layer of the ssf should therefore be reversible since oxygen would be consumed in heterotrophic activity primarily at nighttime and co2 by photosynthesis during the day the irreversible nature of the resistance increase and the fact that it occurred at night suggests it was probably caused by biological activity induced precipitation of salts such as carbonates rather than by accumulation of biologically produced gases 4 5 proteins and carbohydrates in ssf the mass balance of carbohydrates and of proteins in ssf is the net result of a combination of processes that include accretion from the external environment with feedwater de novo synthesis turnover or biodegradation inside the different compartments of the ssf and loss from the system in the filtrate carbohydrates are the main components of particulate and dissolved surface seawater organic carbon aluwihare et al 1997 pakulski and benner 1994 photrophic marine organisms make up a considerable fraction of the microbial population in surface layers of the oceans and contain between 60 and 70 carbohydrates based on dry weight romankevich 1984 transparent exopolymeric particles are another important source of carbohydrates in seawater bar zeev et al 2012 the tortuous flowpaths inside the schmutzdecke and the porous media in conjunction with the very large available surface areas would have most certainly ensured efficient interaction of feedwater proteins and polysaccharides with ssf surfaces and microorganisms such that few of them would have made it into the filtrate primary production by photosynthetic organisms the only mechanism that produces a net increase of biological organic materials in ssf is a significant endogenous source of carbohydrates and proteins in the schmutzdecke the tanks were not covered and the schmutzdecke received sufficient light during the day to sustain algal growth campos et al 2002 huisman and wood 1974 campos et al 2002 reported about 10x more biomass in top layers of uncovered ssf than in covered ssf indicating that primary production may contribute significantly to the establishment of the schmutzdecke carbohydrates were dominant in the filter media biofilms but proteins prevailed on membrane surface fouling layers heterotrophic organisms synthesizing proteins and polysaccharides from organic precursors are present throughout the ssf mainly in microbial biofilms which cover the media surfaces proteins and polysaccharides in these microecological niches are produced as part of the cell structure but more importantly are major constituents of the extracellular matrix which encases the cells and maintains them attached to the media surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 the predominance of proteins on membrane surfaces exposed to ssf filtrates indicates that desorbed cells or cell fragments which usually contain more proteins than carbohydrates were the predominant fraction in the deposits carbohydrates are better growth substrates than proteins and can be expected to be removed with higher efficiency in the filters the only small variation of carbohydrates and proteins on filter media below 10 cm and their recovery from membrane surfaces exposed to ssf product water show that ssf sand was not an effective means for absorbing these biomolecules from feedwater 4 6 accumulation of proteins and of carbohydrates on membranes post ssf the buildup of proteins and of carbohydrates on membranes was drastically diminished by ssf filtration alone but a significant additional reduction was achieved after filter maturation assays performed in the laminar fluid flow cells under non permeating conditions reflected surface biofilm accretion as it would occur in flow channels and pipes since material transport to the membrane interface was not augmented by the crossflow typical of permeating membranes in real conditions ro membrane fouling may be more severe than reported here at a permeate flow range typical of swro of between 12 and 19lm 2d 1 a higher amount of dissolved nutrients colloidal and particulate matter will be transported to the membrane surface and into the membrane biofilm than under the crossflow conditions employed in this study deposits removal mechanisms including chemical cleaning and higher turbulence on the membrane surfaces associated with feed spacers were not feasible in the flow cells in this study the benefits of ssf removal of foulants was demonstrated in the seawater desalination pilot study of meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 who reported that swro downstream of ssf did not require cleaning had the lowest flux decline and accumulated the lowest amount of foulants on the membrane surface compared to conventionally and uf mf pretreated seawater biofilm growth on the membranes post ssf would have to rely on the metabolism of substrates not biodegraded in the ssf which include soluble proteins recalcitrant organic carbon and cells and cell debris there will be fierce competition for monomeric biodegradable organic carbon between all viable organisms in the fouling layer irrespective of whether they are capable or not of producing biofilms intact cells or cell fragments will only become a food source for attached bacteria if the cells die and lyse inside the fouling layer these biological growth substrates are biopolymeric in nature cryptic growth of cells on such materials requires the production of extracellular hydrolases that break down the polymers producing oligomers or monomers that cells can take up and metabolize romero et al 2013 the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes was most certainly less impaired on the surfaces in this study than on those of permeating membranes where salts rejected by the membrane become concentrated in the concentration polarization layer and may inhibit microbial metabolism 4 7 effective filtration depth and technical implications only few reports about slow sand filtration of seawater are available in the literature dehwah missimer 2017 who measured vertical profiles of algal and cell counts as well as of a range of organics toc biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight neutrals low molecular weight acids particulate transparent exopolymeric particles and colloidal exopolymeric particles in 1 m slow sand filtration columns under conditions relevant for beachwell intakes concluded that the entire filter length contributed significantly to filtrate water quality however detailed inspection of the column profiles indicates that the significant reductions of algal 95 or bacterial counts 72 and of biopolymer concentrations 60 occurred mostly in the first 10 cm of the columns with further improvements below 25 cm marginal at best and probably not statistically relevant figs 4 5 and 7 as well as table 1 dehwah and missimer 2017 particular and colloidal transparent exopolymeric particles were reduced by about 59 and 32 after column passage figs 12 and 13 dehwah and missimer 2017 but since no depth profiling data was given for these parameters the location of their removal in the column is not known it is however likely that these easily biodegradable components were removed in the top sections as observed for the other parameters for which depth profiling was given toc profiles in the column were erratic during the first year but stabilized after this period when the small reduction of toc 15 happened in the top sections of the columns fig 6 dehwah and missimer 2017 we conclude therefore that both our study and that of dehwah and missimer 2017 who analyzed a complementary set of water quality parameters demonstrate that the important water quality improvement events in slow sand filters treating seawater occur in the first 30 cm of the filter media the contribution of the deeper sections of the media to product water quality are marginal and perhaps not statistical relevant in engineering terms therefore the media section in these filters could be limited to about 30 cm which would yield lighter and more compact and perhaps vertically stackable filtration basins with potentially considerable reduction in capex conventionally designed ssf require large surface areas which increases plant capex corral et al 2014 however reported equivalent total costs for ssf and the more compact mf in the ro pretreatment of water from the central arizona project canal many swro facilities particularly those located on australian shores operate intermittently freshwater ssf do suffer a reduction in their effectiveness when operated with interruptions young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 but the parameters analyzed in this study were not those of relevance to membrane operations the application of seawater ssfs to pretreatment of feedwater for intermittently operated swro requires further investigations to evaluate potential impacts on treatment efficiency and of ways to minimize performance impairments whilst a schmutzdecke was established in our study dehwah and missimer 2017 found no such formation in their experiments and concluded that a schmutzdecke does not form in slow sand filtration of seawater dehwah and missimer 2017 aimed at understanding slow sand filtration performance from the perspective of subsurface seawater intakes and made great efforts to exclude light and thus algal growth from their systems the filters in our study were a conventional setup open to the atmosphere where schmutzdecke are known to develop a result confirmed by the seawater ssf pilot plant work at santa cruz in california where ssf required periodic cleaning to remove excessive amounts of schmutzdecke based on the reports from these three studies one may hypothesize that algal growth may be of relevance to the formation of a schmutzdecke in seawater ssf but dehwah and missimer 2017 demonstrated that the production of a visible conventional schmutzdecke on the top of the media column is not essential for the performance of the ssf in seawater pretreatment for ro 5 conclusion the availability of biodegradable organics determines the rate of biofouling on membrane surfaces and the growth of microbes on the membrane leads to an increase of proteins and carbohydrates at the interface this study evaluated for the first time the potential of seawater ssf to reduce bioavailable organics and the accumulation of proteins and carbohydrates on membranes as surrogate measures for biofouling the microbial growth potential of the seawater was reduced by 90 after a filter maturation period of between 2 and 3 months filtration alone reduced the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membranes operated in crossflow mode in a laminar fluid flow cell by 60 and 75 respectively shortly after filter startup this reduction rose to 80 for proteins and 88 for carbohydrates once the biological activity was fully established after 2 3 months in the mature filter this study also revealed for the first time an important difference in the composition of deposits of biological origin on sand filter media and on the membranes exposed to ssf product water carbohydrates predominated in filter biofilms whereas proteins were more common on membrane surface deposits turbidity and sdi of ssf product water were consistently of acceptable quality for ro membrane feed filter runs of approximately 6 months were achieved with both oldssf and newssf the major advantage of ssf over conventional treatment is the lack of chemical use and simplicity of operation since it does not require the frequent backwashes essential for operation of conventional filters operated at higher hlr compared to mf uf membrane systems ssf are of lower complexity and their operation is not affected by the high cost of periodical membrane replacement one important disadvantage of ssf is the low hydraulic load of the systems which translates into a high demand of often expensive land area the finding that the beneficial effects of the filters were restricted to the top 30 cm could potentially enable a significant reduction of ssf capex in seawater ro pretreatment with the implementation of more compact and perhaps vertically stacked filtration basins conflicts of interest

pretreatment to remove particulate and colloidal matter as well as dissolved organic and inorganic components which could potentially foul the membrane henthorne and boysen 2015 conventional pretreatment by coagulation flocculation and filtration sometimes including dissolved air flotation still predominates in the industry and is often inadequate for achieving low fouling ro feedwater prihasto et al 2009 ultrafiltration uf or microfiltration mf considered state of the art in ro pretreatment are very efficient for the reduction of particulate and colloidal matter but not capable of removing dissolved organics control of the dissolved components may require different technologies depending on how they impact ro membranes foulants such as humic compounds that exert their fouling action by adsorption on the membrane need to be removed by adsorption to hydrophobic carriers such as powdered activated carbon or granular activated carbon naidu et al 2013 soluble microbial growth substrates such as oligosaccharides or peptides by themselves often non fouling chemicals are important fouling inducers because of their role as substrates for the growth of biofilms on the membrane surfaces these compounds represent the assimilable organic carbon aoc pool of biodegradable organics present in the water their removal from feedwater requires biological reactors since they are not effectively captured in flocs in conventional pretreatment schneider et al 2005 and are only marginally rejected in mf or uf derlon et al 2014 biological reactors for water treatment include biological activated carbon reactors bac biological rapid sand filters biorsf and ssf bac reactors contain highly porous activated carbon media with a dual purpose of providing a large surface area for organics absorption and a substrate for attachment and growth of microbial biofilms korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 hu et al 2005 pramanik et al 2015 when new bac operated with empty bed contact times between 11 and 75 min act mainly as adsorption reactors and remove approximately 70 of dissolved organic carbon doc benstoem et al 2017 as the media ages and the adsorption sites in the medium become saturated the organic matter removal and biodegradation function is transferred entirely to the microbial biofilm that grows on the media surfaces growth and accumulation of debris and dead cells clogs the water channels the permeability of which is restored by backwashing after about 5 6 years of operation doc removal in granular activated carbon gac filters drops to 25 of the applied load and filters need to be regenerated benstoem et al 2017 biorsf differ from rapid sand filters in the need for establishment of a functional aoc degrading microbial biofilm on the media surfaces during a maturation period of about 3 months bar zeev et al 2012 in the case of seawater 6 months were needed for steady state biological activity in both gac and dual media biofilters zhang et al 2017 the primary role of biorsf however remains particle removal which requires frequent backwashes to restore hydraulic performance beachwells or riverbank infiltration systems which rely on microbiota established on engineered surfaces or native subsurface porous aquifer media are another biofiltration option for ro feedwater pretreatment missimer et al 2013 hydraulic loading rates are high in biorsf and bac but much smaller in ssf beachwells or riverbank infiltration systems lautenschlager et al 2014 a constructed seabed infiltration gallery has been in operation at the fukuoka

between 0 1 mm and 0 35 mm ensures excellent turbidity removal without the addition of coagulant chemicals huisman and wood 1974 particles as small as viruses are retained effectively in these filters hijnen et al 2004 rejected particles accumulate at the filter surface forming an organic rich layer the schmutzdecke where intensive biological activity develops microbiological mediated contaminant removal in ssf occurs by predation scavenging adsorption and bio oxidation haig et al 2011 apart from bacteria protozoa weber shirk and dick 1999 and higher organisms midget larvae for example wotton and hirabayashi 1999 contribute significantly to the turnover of particulate organic matter the microbial community usually requires several weeks to acclimate for contaminant removal campos et al 2002 biodegradation by microbial biofilms predominates in the schmutzdecke and in the sand layers immediately below it whilst deeper sections contribute to further adsorptive removal of colloidal and dissolved matter studies on the use of ssf for pretreatment of ro feedwater are rare not one was cited in a recent review by prihasto et al 2009 amsterdam water supply reported that trains consisting of ozonation bac followed by ssf or ssf alone treating rhine river water produced ro feedwater of excellent quality with respect to membrane fouling index doc aoc and biofilm formation rate permitting stable operation of the ro units van der hoek et al 2000 the ozonation train was considered the better process configuration because of the potentially more efficient removal of trace organics ssf of colorado river water and of yuma desalting plant brackish source water reduced both turbidity and sdi by approximately 90 moody et al 2007 in a comparative study of direct application of central arizona project canal water to ssf and mf for pretreatment corral et al 2014 demonstrated that both technologies produced feedwater of adequate quality for ro at comparable life cycle costs excellent swro membrane system performance was achieved in a pilot study of ssf for seawater ro pretreatment meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 manes et al 2011 reported that mf and ssf in infiltration gallery configuration were more effective than conventional pretreatment for removal of bacteria in seawater pretreatment for swro in their recent slow sand filtration study conducted under conditions relevant for beachwell intakes dehwah and missimer 2017 concluded that the entire 1 m length of the column was active in the removal of feedwater organics and that slow sand filters operated with seawater do not develop a biologically active schmutzdecke the major advantage of ssf is the capability of chemicals free turbidity and aoc removal none of the direct competing technologies provide truly chemicals free pretreatment mf or uf operation depends on periodic chemical assisted backwashes and chemical cleaning of membranes ssf is much simpler to operate than mf or uf and does not carry major component replacement costs membranes during its lifetime operational simplicity of ssf is an important advantage in regions or countries without ready availability of the skilled staff life cycle costs of ssf in seawater pretreatment are lower than those of conventional or membrane plants because no chemicals are used and of lower energy and materials expenditure the major disadvantage of ssf is the larger land area required to treat a particular volume of water a consequence of the engineering of ssf units for ro pretreatment by the standards applicable for drinking water ssf further optimization of this technology for ro pretreatment depends on a better understanding of removal mechanisms in the filtration layer in their seawater ssf study conducted under conditions relevant for seabed filtration intake design dehwah and missimer 2017 did not evaluate the removal of assimilable organic carbon proteins and carbohydrates all of which are of critical importance to the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces this study was conducted with ssf simulating conventional surface seawater pretreatment to investigate the hypothesis that only a small vertical section of the filtration medium would suffice to achieve optimum ssf performance for the control of turbidity aoc and of proteins and carbohydrates for seawater ro feeds 2 materials and methods 2 1

pretreatment unit was installed at the premises of the marine biology center of the university of são paulo cebimar located at the southern entrance of the 25 km long são sebastião channel at the north coast of são paulo state fig 1 the seawater intake was a ¾ hose placed about 5 m from the rocky shore at a water depth of 2 m and about 1 m above the sea bottom the water was pumped through about 100 m of polyvinylchloride pvc pipes to an arkal 100 μm disk filter cartridge amiad water systems israel and stored in a 300 l water reservoir on a 4 m high tower from where it was distributed by gravity to the ssfs fig 2 a 2000l polypropylene tanks with a filtration surface area of 1 69 m2 were filled with a 5 cm bottom layer of granite rocks 20 60 mm followed by 5 cm of fine gravel 2 8 mm and 60 cm of filter sand effective grain size d10 of 0 1 mm and a uniformity coefficient of 2 3 the sand was sourced from quarry santa isabel ltda to ensure it was clean and not contaminated with organics as would be inevitable for sand sourced from beaches or from river sediments the sand was washed in batches of 150 kg in a 300 l water tank fitted with aerators to suspend the sand and to dislodge attached particles fines and dirt were washed out by an upward flow of clean freshwater a 60 cm water column on top of the sand provided the driving force for filtration the water level was kept constant by a mechanical float valve the effluent discharge pipe was configured as a siphon with the top bend located about 20 cm above the schmutzdecke to prevent drying out of the filter surface in case of interruption of feed flow feedwater was sampled directly from the inlet port fig 2b further sampling points were installed on the side walls of the filtration tank at the level of the schmutzdecke and 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm below it fig 2b the pvc sampling tubes were laterally inserted about 30 cm into the sand layer ½ diameter 15 cm long the perforated tubes were fitted with an endcap and their surface was covered with a layer of fine gravel held together by polyethylene mesh to prevent ingress of filter sand into the sampling tube two filters were operated in parallel one used in a previous experiment oldssf where the original schmutzdecke had been removed and replaced by clean sand for this new run and a second newly built one newssf filtration rate was 0 1mh 1 corresponding to the minimum rate recommended in the literature huisman and wood 1974 visscher 1990 ellis and aydin 1995 the filtration rate was measured daily in the morning between 9 and 10am and adjusted to the target rate if required by opening or closing the filtrate valve 2 3 microbial growth potential microbial growth potential mgp was determined by a microbial growth assay similar to the one for quantification of aoc originally developed for analysis of tap water by van der kooij et al 1982 since the strains recommended in the aoc standard method are not marine organisms an organism was isolated for the growth assays by spread plating fresh seawater from the site on marine agar bd difco the isolate that grew best in autoclaved site seawater adopted for the assays was identified by 16s rdna sequencing as pseudoalteromonas spongiae for determination of mgp sample collection and preparation of vials followed the procedures described by weinrich et al 2009 samples were filtered 0 22 μm and pasteurized in a 70 c water bath for 30 min for preparation of inocula pseudolateromonas cells transferred from marine agar to filtered 0 22 μm and autoclaved 120 c 15 min natural seawater were acclimated for 7 days the cells were then harvested by centrifugation 5000 rpm 5 min washed twice with a sterile artificial seawater minimal medium free of residual carbon schneider and marshall 1994 and resuspended in the same medium samples were inoculated with 102 cells ml growth was monitored every 24 h by plating on marine agar until colony numbers stabilized mgp results were expressed as colony forming units cfu ml in the remaining sections of this article aoc will be used exclusively to refer to the microbial growth substrates present in the samples 2 4 monitoring the accumulation of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membrane surfaces laminar fluid flow chambers made of acrylic fitted with clean sections of re2540 sr swro membrane csm seoul korea area 36 cm2 were connected to the six sampling points along the filters to monitor biofilm formation the chambers were wrapped in aluminum foil for protection from sunlight flow through the chambers was constant at 30lh 1 a first batch of membranes was tested during the first 60 days of operation a second batch for another 60 days from day 88 onward biofouling was analyzed by assessing protein bradford 1976 and carbohydrates dubois et al 1956 content in the fouling layers 2 5 filtration media analysis at the end of the experiment the filters were drained and pvc tubes of 5 cm diameter and about 1 5 m length were driven

carbohydrates and of proteins for analysis of the grain surfaces by scanning electron microscopy sem filter media particles were spread in a clean petri dish collected on double sided carbon tape

were not affected by passage through the filters raw water turbidity ranged from 0 7 to 15 ntu fig 3 a whilst filtrate turbidity in both ssf remained consistently below 0 3 ntu fig 3b and c effluent turbidities of the two ssf were similar the high suspended solids content prevented sdi analysis of raw water filtrate sdi values were measured on day 4 3 9 oldssf and 4 2 newssf day 60 3 8 oldssf and 3 6 newssf and day 174 2 5 oldssf and 2 8 newssf hydraulic load of the filters was adjusted daily in the morning to the target value and remained steady during the day the loads measured immediately before adjustment fig 4 a frequently showed a small head loss during the night fig 4a in both filters the averaged hydraulic filter load declined steadily during the 6 months operational period with a slightly faster decline for oldssf the actual fits to the regression lines were rather poor the lines have been included only for illustration of the hydraulic load tendency over time head loss was rather small in the first month fig 4b but then it jumped abruptly to a daily average value around 0 01 m h for newssf and 0 02 m h for oldssf interestingly the water temperature dropped a few degrees at the time of head loss increase and began to show small variations thereafter fig 4c 3 2 microbial growth potential variation of feedwater mgp during the experiment was not statistically significant mgp in filtrates of oldssf and newssf were mostly similar and began to drop significantly below the values of raw water between 60 and 79 days of operation oldssf and 79 94 days newssf when product water aoc supported the growth of about 1 log less pseudoalteromonas cells than the feedwater aoc fig 5 vertical mgp profiling in the filters demonstrated that most mgp reduction occurred in the schmutzdecke and in the first 30 cm of filter sand below the schmutzdecke fig 6 no further mgp reduction was recorded in the deeper filter sections 3 3 bacterial colonization of sand media sem analysis demonstrated intense colonization by microorganisms of the schmutzdecke but sand particles from deeper layers were only lightly colonized or appeared clean fig 7 protein and carbohydrate content in bed samples showed similar trends for both filters and dropped sharply between the schmutzdecke to a depth of approximately 10 cm and remained steady in the deeper sections of the filters fig 8 interestingly the degree of reduction of mgp in the filter did not correlate directly with the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on the media surfaces fig 8 3 4 proteins and carbohydrates on membrane surfaces slow sand filtration without biological acclimation drastically diminished the accumulation of proteins oldssf 60 new ssf 66 and carbohydrates oldssf 75 and newssf 70 on membrane surfaces fig 9 the reductions of proteins oldssf 81 and new ssf 76 and carbohydrates oldssf 88 and newssf 88 were even greater after filter maturation fouling layers on sand filter media contained more carbohydrates than proteins fig 8 but the opposite occurred on the layers deposited on the membranes fig 9 4 discussion this is the first study about the capacity of seawater ssf to contribute to the control of 3 parameters critical for membrane biofouling microbial growth potential proteins and carbohydrates the microbial growth potential of the water was reduced by 90 after a filter maturation period of between 2 and 3 months filtration alone reduced the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membranes operated in crossflow mode in a laminar fluid flow cell by 70 shortly after filter startup this reduction rose to 85 after 2 3 months when the biological activity was fully established carbohydrates predominated in filter biofilms whereas proteins were more common on membrane surface deposits turbidity and sdi of ssf product water were consistently of acceptable quality for ro membrane feed vertical profiling demonstrated that practically all beneficial effects of the filters were restricted to the top 30 cm section with deeper layers not contributing significantly to improvement of product water quality filter runs of approximately 6 months were achieved with both oldssf and newssf 4 1 ssf filtrate water quality and performance ssf operated in this study produced seawater filtrate acceptable for ro feed without the need of coagulant chemicals or control of backwash cycles turbidity was consistently below 0 3ntu a performance similar to that reported by shrestha et al 2014 for biofiltration of seawater with anthracite gac and sand all 0 16 to 0 40 ntu at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 12 m h biofiltration of seawater with gac or anthracite at higher hlr of 5 10 m h chinu et al 2009 naidu et al 2013 or with expanded clay biofilters at an hlr of 6 m h yielded product water with similar turbidities simon et al 2013 as did direct uf or mf of seawater jezowska et al 2009 significantly lower turbidities of less than 0 1ntu required more sophisticated seawater pretreatment trains comprising coagulation dissolved air flotation and as final filtrations stages uf or dual media filtration guastalli et al 2013 the sdi of 2 5 for oldssf and 2 8 for newssf after 174 days were adequate for ro feed and in the range of those reported by jeong et al 2016 for filtrates from dual media filtration operated in biological filtration mode hollow fiber membrane seawater permeates sdi reported in the literature varied from 0 7 to 3 teng et al 2003 guastalli et al 2013 reported sdi of 2 and 1 for their more complex pretreatment schemes mentioned before comparative seawater pretreatment pilot testing comprising a conventional ssf a conventional treatment train coagulation flocculation sedimentation rapid sand filtration and mf or uf showed average turbidities of ssf to be similar to those of a conventional treatment train while mf or uf permeate turbidity were significantly lower meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 these authors also reported sdi values of ssf product water comparable to those of mf or uf permeates and smaller than those of conventional treatment normalized specific flux and differential pressure of the ro during the 4500 h test run with ssf and uf mf pretreated water were similar and better than those achieved with conventionally produced water ssf pretreatment was more robust than mf uf for high turbidity or algal bloom disturbances 4 2 factors contributing to sdi in ssf filtrate filter ripening led to a reduction of the breakthrough or release of particulate and colloidal materials as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of sdi during the 174 days of operation only feedwater particles or colloids with low affinity to the mainly organic constitution of the schmutzdecke and the inorganic hydrophilic surfaces of the sand will eventually break through into product water the other three potential sources of sdi material in filtrate are produced and or released from the inside of the filter matrix filter media fines left in the media after construction will be washed out until their reservoir in the sand column is depleted the steadily diminishing contribution of this particle stream to the particle load in the product water over time probably contributed to the progressive reduction of sdi ssf surfaces are covered by microbial biofilms when reaching a steady state microbial biofilms release fragments into the surrounding medium by sloughing or by the detachment of individual cells through erosion xavier et al 2005 very little information is available in the literature about the contribution of desorbed colloidal organics and inorganics to filtrate sdi most organic carbon of the doc fraction of seawater is of low molecular weight below 1000da xu and guo 2017 shrestha et al 2014 reported that sand filters removed 94 of the hydrophobic organics of seawater 62 9 of hydrophilic neutrals 45 7 of biopolymers and 32 8 of hydrophilic molecules whilst humic substances and their hydrolysates passed practically unchanged through the filters humic substances building blocks low molecular weight neutrals and low molecular weight acids were only marginally removed in the experiments reported by dehwah and missimer 2017 4 3 aoc reduction in ssf pseudoalteromonas spongiae used in the bioassay to quantify the reduction of biodegradable organic matter was first isolated from the surfaces of marine sponges by lau et al 2005 members of this genus are known biofilm formers mai prochnow et al 2006 frequently isolated from marine sediment samples where they are involved in the cycling of organic matter mi et al 2015 and have also been recovered from seawater reverse osmosis membrane biofilms nagaraj et al 2018 after maturation ssf biofilms reduced the amount of mgp to the extent of supporting the growth of 1 order of magnitude less cells of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in product water this performance was similar to the 80 and 90 reductions reported by simon et al 2013 for packed bed biofilters and by naidu et al 2013 for gac biofilters respectively dual media filters whilst not designed primarily for biofiltration may be operated as aoc biodegradation reactors albeit with a much lower removal efficiency of 40 50 jeong et al 2016 only the labile mostly small molecular weight fraction of seawater organic carbon is easily degraded in biofiltration eighmy et al 1992 the semi recalcitrant fraction may be perhaps reduced somewhat in the schmutzdecke where the dense layer of organics allows extracellular hydrolases to act more efficiently whilst the recalcitrant fraction will either pass unchanged or be adsorbed in the filter carlson and ducklow 1996 reduction of the aoc was restricted to the first 30 cm of the media column with no further improvement in deeper layers attempts at further reducing aoc in a second identical ssf operated in series with product water from the first ssf as feed were not successful not shown eighmy et al 1992 reported a rapid decline of microbial populations in the top 10 cm of full scale ssf treating freshwater managed conventionally by periodical removal of the schmutzdecke in filters where the schmutzdecke was managed by deep harrowing the population remained high up to the maximum harrowing depth of 30 cm and dropped steeply below it most biomass in expanded clay biofilters was concentrated in the first half of the 1 m deep filter columns simon et al 2013 hijnen and van der kooij 1992 demonstrated that all spiked acetate in the concentration range of 0 01 0 25 mgcl 1 was removed in 20 cm sand columns at hydraulic loads between 0 2 and 5 m h and that microbial counts dropped sharply in the first few cm of the columns mgp reduction in the oldssf started about 2 3 weeks before it became detectable in newssf a reflection of the presence of an inoculum already adapted to degradation of the feedwater aoc from a previous ssf filtration run the top 10 cm of sand had been removed along with the schmutzdecke from the oldssf prior to the start of the experiment the elimination of aoc was not complete in the filters because the filtrate still contained sufficient aoc to support a 10 100 fold increase of the population of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in the assay from a very low starting inoculum of 102 cells ml organics released by killed planktonic or biofilm cells after pasteurization most certainly increased the aoc of the samples this additional aoc would not have been available in the original sample where physiologically active cells and biofilm fragments would have acted as additional sinks for dissolved aoc in the filters limitation of nutrients other than carbon could have contributed to the cessation of aoc reduction in filter sections below 30 cm where microbial colonization was small however the 10 100 fold increase of pseudoalteromonas spongiae in the mgp assays with final product water demonstrated that nutrients other than organic carbon were present in sufficient quantity to support heterotrophic growth of this organism 4 4 increase of filtration resistance head loss in the filters was caused by events occurring in the top 5 10 cm of the sand column because oldssf permeability loss from a previous run over a similar amount of time had been fully restored by removing the top 10 cm of sand and replacing it with new clean sand in addition no head loss was observed in a slow sand filter of identical design operated in series with filtrate from the first ssf as feed not shown the driving force for filtration in ssf was produced by the water column above the schmutzdecke in conjunction with restriction of flow in the filtrate valve the water column in this work was about half to one third of that recommended in ssf design manuals 60 cm vs 1 1 5 m huisman and wood 1974 due to constraint of the height of the tanks available for the filtration experiment the smaller water column allowed a more sensitive detection of variations of filtration resistance which is strongly affected by the development of the schmutzdecke jabur et al 2005 considered head loss in ssf to be caused by the combined action of the resistance of the clean filtration media due primarily to the sand column and a variable component due to the contribution of the schmutzdecke and interstitial deposits and biofilms the authors assumed that sand column resistance remained constant in the filtration run the sharp rise in head loss after about 1 5 months indicates that the hydraulic impact of the development of the scmutzdecke became detectable before it reached its full biological activity potential after about 2 3months of operation another potential cause for such a sharp rise in head loss are negative pressures inside the filter jabur et al 2005 huisman and wood 1974 which cause the release of gases from the solution and formation of air pockets that could partially clogg the filters the occurrence of such negative pressures was prevented by the syphon placed about 20 cm above the filter sand surface in the filtrate line head loss was measured daily and it progressed on average at 0 01m day newssf and 0 02m day newssf which indicates that the factors that contributed to head loss became more severe as the filtration run progressed the faster head loss of the oldssf suggests that material from a previous filtration run contributed to the hydraulic resistance in the actual run the cumulative headlosses over a 30day period in this work of between 0 3 m newssf and 0 6 m oldssf were smaller than the cumulative head losses of 1 2 m 2 8 m reported by jabur et al 2005 head loss spikes show that factors beyond the physical accumulation of material in the schmutzdecke influenced filtration resistance interestingly the step increase in filtration resistance was detected about at the same time as variations of the water temperature increased due to onset of winter with relatively warm days and cooler nights gas solubility in water is affected by temperature and outgassing would have occurred when the filters heated up since gases are less soluble at higher water temperatures the temperature range of water in this study between 15 c and 24 c would have translated into a variation of oxygen solubility between 6 7 and 8 1 mg l leroy creswell 1993 co2 dissolution in water is a complex chemical equilibrium process which involves ph dependent acid base reactions but the solubility of this gas is very high of the order of 1 3 g l at 20 c zhao et al 2013 weiss 1974 it is unlikely that outgassing due to the much smaller daily variations of water temperature would have represented a key factor in increased filtration resistance changes of dissolved gases such as oxygen or carbon dioxide by biological activity could have potentially contributed to rapid and unpredictable increases of filtration resistance oxygen produced during daylight hours by photosynthetic organisms may reach supersaturating concentrations bissett et al 2008 whilst at the same time reducing carbon dioxide in the night increased heterotrophic activity leads to consumption of oxygen and accumulation of co2 filtration resistance increase by both pure oxygen or pure carbon dioxide bubbles in the biologically active layer of the ssf should therefore be reversible since oxygen would be consumed in heterotrophic activity primarily at nighttime and co2 by photosynthesis during the day the irreversible nature of the resistance increase and the fact that it occurred at night suggests it was probably caused by biological activity induced precipitation of salts such as carbonates rather than by accumulation of biologically produced gases 4 5 proteins and carbohydrates in ssf the mass balance of carbohydrates and of proteins in ssf is the net result of a combination of processes that include accretion from the external environment with feedwater de novo synthesis turnover or biodegradation inside the different compartments of the ssf and loss from the system in the filtrate carbohydrates are the main components of particulate and dissolved surface seawater organic carbon aluwihare et al 1997 pakulski and benner 1994 photrophic marine organisms make up a considerable fraction of the microbial population in surface layers of the oceans and contain between 60 and 70 carbohydrates based on dry weight romankevich 1984 transparent exopolymeric particles are another important source of carbohydrates in seawater bar zeev et al 2012 the tortuous flowpaths inside the schmutzdecke and the porous media in conjunction with the very large available surface areas would have most certainly ensured efficient interaction of feedwater proteins and polysaccharides with ssf surfaces and microorganisms such that few of them would have made it into the filtrate primary production by photosynthetic organisms the only mechanism that produces a net increase of biological organic materials in ssf is a significant endogenous source of carbohydrates and proteins in the schmutzdecke the tanks were not covered and the schmutzdecke received sufficient light during the day to sustain algal growth campos et al 2002 huisman and wood 1974 campos et al 2002 reported about 10x more biomass in top layers of uncovered ssf than in covered ssf indicating that primary production may contribute significantly to the establishment of the schmutzdecke carbohydrates were dominant in the filter media biofilms but proteins prevailed on membrane surface fouling layers heterotrophic organisms synthesizing proteins and polysaccharides from organic precursors are present throughout the ssf mainly in microbial biofilms which cover the media surfaces proteins and polysaccharides in these microecological niches are produced as part of the cell structure but more importantly are major constituents of the extracellular matrix which encases the cells and maintains them attached to the media surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 the predominance of proteins on membrane surfaces exposed to ssf filtrates indicates that desorbed cells or cell fragments which usually contain more proteins than carbohydrates were the predominant fraction in the deposits carbohydrates are better growth substrates than proteins and can be expected to be removed with higher efficiency in the filters the only small variation of carbohydrates and proteins on filter media below 10 cm and their recovery from membrane surfaces exposed to ssf product water show that ssf sand was not an effective means for absorbing these biomolecules from feedwater 4 6 accumulation of proteins and of carbohydrates on membranes post ssf the buildup of proteins and of carbohydrates on membranes was drastically diminished by ssf filtration alone but a significant additional reduction was achieved after filter maturation assays performed in the laminar fluid flow cells under non permeating conditions reflected surface biofilm accretion as it would occur in flow channels and pipes since material transport to the membrane interface was not augmented by the crossflow typical of permeating membranes in real conditions ro membrane fouling may be more severe than reported here at a permeate flow range typical of swro of between 12 and 19lm 2d 1 a higher amount of dissolved nutrients colloidal and particulate matter will be transported to the membrane surface and into the membrane biofilm than under the crossflow conditions employed in this study deposits removal mechanisms including chemical cleaning and higher turbulence on the membrane surfaces associated with feed spacers were not feasible in the flow cells in this study the benefits of ssf removal of foulants was demonstrated in the seawater desalination pilot study of meyerhofer and desormeux 2010 who reported that swro downstream of ssf did not require cleaning had the lowest flux decline and accumulated the lowest amount of foulants on the membrane surface compared to conventionally and uf mf pretreated seawater biofilm growth on the membranes post ssf would have to rely on the metabolism of substrates not biodegraded in the ssf which include soluble proteins recalcitrant organic carbon and cells and cell debris there will be fierce competition for monomeric biodegradable organic carbon between all viable organisms in the fouling layer irrespective of whether they are capable or not of producing biofilms intact cells or cell fragments will only become a food source for attached bacteria if the cells die and lyse inside the fouling layer these biological growth substrates are biopolymeric in nature cryptic growth of cells on such materials requires the production of extracellular hydrolases that break down the polymers producing oligomers or monomers that cells can take up and metabolize romero et al 2013 the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes was most certainly less impaired on the surfaces in this study than on those of permeating membranes where salts rejected by the membrane become concentrated in the concentration polarization layer and may inhibit microbial metabolism 4 7 effective filtration depth and technical implications only few reports about slow sand filtration of seawater are available in the literature dehwah missimer 2017 who measured vertical profiles of algal and cell counts as well as of a range of organics toc biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight neutrals low molecular weight acids particulate transparent exopolymeric particles and colloidal exopolymeric particles in 1 m slow sand filtration columns under conditions relevant for beachwell intakes concluded that the entire filter length contributed significantly to filtrate water quality however detailed inspection of the column profiles indicates that the significant reductions of algal 95 or bacterial counts 72 and of biopolymer concentrations 60 occurred mostly in the first 10 cm of the columns with further improvements below 25 cm marginal at best and probably not statistically relevant figs 4 5 and 7 as well as table 1 dehwah and missimer 2017 particular and colloidal transparent exopolymeric particles were reduced by about 59 and 32 after column passage figs 12 and 13 dehwah and missimer 2017 but since no depth profiling data was given for these parameters the location of their removal in the column is not known it is however likely that these easily biodegradable components were removed in the top sections as observed for the other parameters for which depth profiling was given toc profiles in the column were erratic during the first year but stabilized after this period when the small reduction of toc 15 happened in the top sections of the columns fig 6 dehwah and missimer 2017 we conclude therefore that both our study and that of dehwah and missimer 2017 who analyzed a complementary set of water quality parameters demonstrate that the important water quality improvement events in slow sand filters treating seawater occur in the first 30 cm of the filter media the contribution of the deeper sections of the media to product water quality are marginal and perhaps not statistical relevant in engineering terms therefore the media section in these filters could be limited to about 30 cm which would yield lighter and more compact and perhaps vertically stackable filtration basins with potentially considerable reduction in capex conventionally designed ssf require large surface areas which increases plant capex corral et al 2014 however reported equivalent total costs for ssf and the more compact mf in the ro pretreatment of water from the central arizona project canal many swro facilities particularly those located on australian shores operate intermittently freshwater ssf do suffer a reduction in their effectiveness when operated with interruptions young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 but the parameters analyzed in this study were not those of relevance to membrane operations the application of seawater ssfs to pretreatment of feedwater for intermittently operated swro requires further investigations to evaluate potential impacts on treatment efficiency and of ways to minimize performance impairments whilst a schmutzdecke was established in our study dehwah and missimer 2017 found no such formation in their experiments and concluded that a schmutzdecke does not form in slow sand filtration of seawater dehwah and missimer 2017 aimed at understanding slow sand filtration performance from the perspective of subsurface seawater intakes and made great efforts to exclude light and thus algal growth from their systems the filters in our study were a conventional setup open to the atmosphere where schmutzdecke are known to develop a result confirmed by the seawater ssf pilot plant work at santa cruz in california where ssf required periodic cleaning to remove excessive amounts of schmutzdecke based on the reports from these three studies one may hypothesize that algal growth may be of relevance to the formation of a schmutzdecke in seawater ssf but dehwah and missimer 2017 demonstrated that the production of a visible conventional schmutzdecke on the top of the media column is not essential for the performance of the ssf in seawater pretreatment for ro 5 conclusion the availability of biodegradable organics determines the rate of biofouling on membrane surfaces and the growth of microbes on the membrane leads to an increase of proteins and carbohydrates at the interface this study evaluated for the first time the potential of seawater ssf to reduce bioavailable organics and the accumulation of proteins and carbohydrates on membranes as surrogate measures for biofouling the microbial growth potential of the seawater was reduced by 90 after a filter maturation period of between 2 and 3 months filtration alone reduced the amount of proteins and carbohydrates on ro membranes operated in crossflow mode in a laminar fluid flow cell by 60 and 75 respectively shortly after filter startup this reduction rose to 80 for proteins and 88 for carbohydrates once the biological activity was fully established after 2 3 months in the mature filter this study also revealed for the first time an important difference in the composition of deposits of biological origin on sand filter media and on the membranes exposed to ssf product water carbohydrates predominated in filter biofilms whereas proteins were more common on membrane surface deposits turbidity and sdi of ssf product water were consistently of acceptable quality for ro membrane feed filter runs of approximately 6 months were achieved with both oldssf and newssf the major advantage of ssf over conventional treatment is the lack of chemical use and simplicity of operation since it does not require the frequent backwashes essential for operation of conventional filters operated at higher hlr compared to mf uf membrane systems ssf are of lower complexity and their operation is not affected by the high cost of periodical membrane replacement one important disadvantage of ssf is the low hydraulic load of the systems which translates into a high demand of often expensive land area the finding that the beneficial effects of the filters were restricted to the top 30 cm could potentially enable a significant reduction of ssf capex in seawater ro pretreatment with the implementation of more compact and perhaps vertically stacked filtration basins conflicts of interest

18958,stormwater is increasingly being valued as a freshwater resource in arid regions and can provide opportunities for beneficial reuse via aquifer recharge if adequate pollutant removal can be achieved we envision a multi unit operation approach to capture treat and recharge ctr stormwater using low energy cost effective technologies appropriate for larger magnitude less frequent events

field conditions with exposure to real stormwater replicate columns with woodchips and biochar 33 by weight woodchips and straw or woodchips only were operated with continuous saturated flow for eight

while the other systems achieved about 20 removal no breakthrough of the trace organic compounds was observed in any biochar containing columns woodchip columns without biochar removed approximately 99 of influent atrazine and 90 of influent fipronil but exhibited relatively rapid breakthrough of tcep 2 4 d 1h benzotriazole and diuron the addition of straw to the woodchip columns provided no significant benefit compared to woodchips alone due to the lack of breakthrough of trace organics in the biochar woodchip columns we estimated column breakthrough with a diffusion limited sorption model results of the model indicate breakthrough for the trace organics would occur between 10 000 and 32 000 pore volumes under ideal conditions this could be equivalent to decades of service assuming failure by other processes e g clogging biofouling does not occur these results indicate that multiple contaminants can be removed in woodchip biochar reactors employed in stormwater

innovate management of water in all its forms to achieve more resilient water supplies luthy and sedlak 2015 one approach to a diversified water portfolio is urban stormwater capture and recharge urban runoff can reduce excessive groundwater extraction and lessen dependence on imported water hering et al 2013 while providing amenities like habitat green space and parks urban stormwater however often contains a suite of contaminants that can compromise drinking water quality epa 2007 for instance excess nutrients in runoff from impervious surfaces represent one of the largest challenges associated with nutrient pollution e g davis et al 2006 phosphorus and nitrogen in stormwater runoff originate from lawn fertilizers atmospheric deposition automobile exhaust agriculture soil erosion pet and yard waste and detergents davis et al 2006 stormwater runoff also contains other chemicals of concern for drinking water such as hydrocarbons metals and trace organic compounds grebel et al 2013 lefevre et al 2015 thus recharge with urban runoff needs to be managed in ways that do not compromise groundwater quality nas 2016 distributed low impact design lid technologies currently employed for stormwater treatment such as raingardens and bioswales are designed to treat the water quality volume i e the 90 frequency rainfall depth davis and mccuen 2005 and remove many non polar

nevertheless polar trace organic contaminants e g 2 4 d benzotriazole and atrazine and dissolved nutrients are more challenging to treat for example vegetated bioretention systems still remove less than half of soluble trace organic constituents and 60 80 of nitrate from stormwater zhang et al 2014 davis et al 2006 lefevre et al 2015 however vegetated biofiltration systems have been shown to remove over 95 of metals cu pb zn blecken et al 2009 small distributed lid practices offer minimal flood control mitigation infiltration and cannot store larger intensity lower frequency rains that occur in arid regions furthermore stormwater is increasingly being valued as a freshwater resource in arid regions and can provide opportunities for beneficial reuse via aquifer recharge bradshaw and luthy 2017 bischel et al 2012 an example of a large stormwater capture and infiltration site is the rory m shaw wetlands park in los angeles ca la stormwater 2018 there is critical need to develop more effective passive stormwater treatment technologies that are able to transform stormwater from a waste to a valuable freshwater resource in arid regions using low energy cost efficient approaches to pollutant removal to protect underlying groundwater we propose a stormwater capture treatment recharge ctr system with integrated storage and flow equalization control and unit process pollutant removal processes to meet the needs of stormwater management in arid regions fig 1 first stormwater is routed and pre treated e g removal of trash large particles to a storage unit for capture during a storm event that provides continuous flow with particle settling the stormwater is then routed through a series of low energy unit operations for the removal of nutrients metals and trace organic contaminants prior to groundwater recharge saturated flow conditions could be maintained as desired in specific unit operations by introducing a small amount of head with a weir and aerated aerobic conditions could be introduced by trickling through unsaturated media thus ctr provides an opportunity to capture larger volume storm events and achieves multiple benefits through controlled release to prevent flooding pollutant removal and improved aquifer recharge the proposed stormwater ctr system integrates multiple pollutant removal unit processes in a new comprehensive manner to meet the needs of stormwater recharge while removing pollutants for example upflow denitrifying woodchip bioreactors treat nitrate in stormwater and agricultural drainage chen et al 2013 hua et al 2016 warneke et al 2011 many papers examine woodchip bioreactors and thus we will not fully detail their operation here e g schipper et al 2010 addy et al 2016 in brief woodchips remove nitrate by acting as a source of biodegradable organic carbon and electron donor for microbes under anaerobic conditions woodchips are specifically chosen to maintain an extended bedlife schipper et al 2010 halaburka et al 2017 the potential of woodchips to remove metals or trace organic contaminants from urban stormwater has not been evaluated indeed the altered redox environment of the woodchip bioreactors halaburka et al 2017 could change metal speciation or induce reductive transformation of organic contaminants e g chlorinated herbicides batch and column studies suggest potential for biochar to remove metals

microorganisms abundance and promote nitrate reduction bock et al 2016 previous assessments of the ability of biochar to remove contaminants from stormwater have been limited in duration and were conducted with fresh not aged materials reddy et al 2014a shimabuku et al 2016 in this study biochar amended woodchip reactors were aged using real stormwater from a watershed north of san francisco and then the aged reactors were challenged in the laboratory with nutrients organic contaminants and metals in order to replicate the final treatment unit operation of a ctr system rmc 2011 scwa 2011 we applied a sorption model to predict the breakthrough of representative contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors our novel contribution was to simulate a pilot scale stormwater capture treatment recharge system using challenge tests following extensive aging with real stormwater to assess the removal of contaminants after long term operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and water source urban runoff was collected bi weekly from fryer creek in sonoma county ca latitude 38 17 15 n longitude 122 27 60 w from march to november 2016 the water source consisted of a combination of stormwater runoff and urban irrigation drainage the site was chosen as a representative urbanized stream in a watershed dominated by mixed residential and commercial land use creek water nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 8 to 13 7 mg n l 1 table s1 stormwater was collected every two weeks in a 2000 l polyethylene tank and moved to the pilot test study site at the sonoma county water agency where it was stored outdoors in a shaded location the water was initially passed through a nylon mesh 300 μm filter bag followed by a 50 μm filter before entering the tank mcmaster carr atlanta ga the filtration step prevented clogging during eight months of conditioning with urban runoff prior to challenge tests with synthetic stormwater spiked with trace levels of metals and organic compounds 2 2 column studies column experiments were employed to simulate a stormwater treatment system fig 2 stormwater was pumped from the 2000 l polyethylene storage tank through pvc tubing and into a 38 l iron containing down flow sand filter minnesota filter designed to remove dissolved phosphorus erickson et al 2012 the minnesota filter consisted of astm c33 sand and 5 iron filings by weight for a design hydraulic conductivity of 0 015 cm s 1 the 10 cm diameter filter was housed in a 41 cm long pvc column this design has been shown to remove approximately 90 of dissolved phosphorus for up to 200 meters of treatment depth without decreases in hydraulic conductivity erickson et al 2012 because this technology had been previously tested successfully in both laboratory and field conditions this study integrated it as a unit process for phosphorus removal within the experiments but the minnesota filter was not a subject of research other than to test its performance under field conditions after the minnesota filter the water was stored in a 38 l polyethylene reservoir prior to pumping into nine 10 cm diameter 50 cm long pvc woodchip bioreactors table s2 in up flow mode to maintain saturated conditions although saturated conditions are less common in distributed stormwater practices davis and mccuen 2005 we envision that saturated conditions would be maintained in a stormwater ctr system to maintain woodchip bedlife schipper et al 2010 treatments i e woodchips woodchips amended with 33 biochar by weight and woodchips amended with 33 straw by weight were conducted in triplicate fig 2 2 3 filter material woodchips were obtained from an arborist s woodchip waste pile in portola valley ca the woodchips were composed of a mix of species including california redwood sequoia sempervirens oak quercus sp and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii as described previously in halaburka et al 2017 the woodchips were dried at 50 c for 48 h in a drying oven then sieved to a diameter between 2 and 10 mm previous studies have shown that woodchip type and particle size in woodchip bioreactors have no significant effect on nitrate removal rates cameron and schipper 2010 the woodchip bioreactors were packed with 1000 g woodchips whereas the biochar woodchip columns consisted of 500 g woodchips and 250 g biochar 33 by weight and 40 v v the straw woodchip columns were packed with 500 g woodchips and 250 g straw mulch the straw was produced on site at the sonoma wastewater treatment plant from an open field we had hypothesized that differing organic carbon types e g straw and the presence of biochar could impact denitrification efficiency schipper et al 2010 cayuela et al 2013 the biochar used in this experiment was obtained from mountain crest gardens etna ca mcg biochar it had a bet surface area of 318 m2 g 1 as determined by n2 adsorption at 77 k intertek allentown pa ulrich et al 2015 the dry mass elemental composition of the biochar was 78 2 c 0 4 h 0 2 n 5 4 o 0 1 s and 15 7 ash ulrich et al 2015 previous laboratory studies demonstrated that this mcg biochar is amongst the most effective at trace organic contaminant removal compared to several other commercially available biochars ulrich et al 2015 mcg biochar was received as small char chips that were dry sieved through a 30 mesh 0 6 mm to remove fine particles 2 4 field aging of reactors

weight biochar decreased the hydraulic conductivity to 0 53 0 27 cm s 1 fig s6 although addition of porous geomedia like biochar could lower ksat values of these infiltration systems decreasing water velocity could have a positive effect on bioreactor treatment performance i e nitrogen and trace organic removal hoover et al 2015 ulrich et al 2015 the woodchip columns amended with straw showed only

hydraulic residence time hrt of the columns bromide tracer tests were performed with nabr 500 mg l 1 sigma aldrich measured with a hanna instruments hi14102 bromide combination electrode the bromide solution was fed into the columns at 2 ml min 1 for 10 min samples were collected at the effluent until full breakthrough took place the curves were adjusted for a 25 min lag time before the spiked solution reached the columns the calculated hrt values from the tracer tests are 11 1 11 2 and 13 1 h for woodchip straw woodchip and biochar woodchip respectively figs s7 s9 2 5 contaminant challenge tests challenge tests were conducted following an initial eight month period of column conditioning under saturated flow conditions during the challenge tests 0 6 mg p l 1 and 1 mg n l 1 as well as 50 μg l 1 each of a mixture of trace organic contaminants and metals commonly found in stormwater were added to a synthetic stormwater matrix and pumped continuously into the columns at 2 ml min 1 table s3 fig s10 organic contaminants for the experiments were selected based on contaminant physicochemical properties e g k ow values spanning 4 orders of magnitude and reactivity towards the studied geomedia table 1 information on sources of the nutrients and trace organic contaminants is included in tables s3 and s4 chemicals were used as received the stock solutions of trace organic contaminants were prepared in methanol after dilution the concentration of methanol as doc measured in the synthetic stormwater influent was approximately 100 mg l 1 the percentage of the methanol added to the system is similar to other studies on trace organic removal ulrich et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 although the addition of methanol increased influent doc concentrations table s5

breakthrough time for trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors a transport model was adapted from ulrich et al 2015 the transport model predicts trace organic breakthrough times dependent on kinetic sorption effects on the biochar woodchip media this model assumes intraparticle diffusion limited sorption kinetics eq s3 further description about the transport model and its parameters is outlined in previous studies ulrich et al 2015 werner et al 2006 data from batch experiments described below were fitted to the freundlich eq s1 and langmuir eq s2 isotherm models fig s12 using the freundlich isotherms a transport model estimated the approximate breakthrough time for the trace organics parameters used to predict breakthrough curves in biochar amended woodchip bioreactors are shown in table s2 and equation s3 sorption parameters for the transport model were determined in laboratory batch experiments with i biochar and ii woodchips all batch experiments were conducted in 250 ml glass flasks containing a predefined amount of geomedia synthetic stormwater ph 7 5 and 100 mg l 1 of sodium azide as a biocide owing to the distinctly different sorption capacities of biochar and woodchips the ratios of geomedia to synthetic stormwater differed as follows 6 mg of biochar was added to 180 ml of synthetic stormwater and 50 g of woodchips was added to 200 ml of synthetic stormwater the geomedia was pre equilibrated with synthetic stormwater and azide for 24 h prior to addition of different concentrations of a trace organic contaminant mixture containing diuron atrazine 1h benzotriazole fipronil 2 4 d and tcep for isotherm experiments with biochar 30 300 μg l 1 of the contaminant mixture was added for isotherm experiments with woodchips a larger concentration range of 20 500 μg l 1 was chosen due to the lower sorption capacity of woodchips vessels were kept on a horizontal shaker until sorption equilibrium was reached i e 24 h for woodchips and 7 days for biochar subsequently 1 ml sample aliquots were withdrawn from each batch filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber syringe filter tisch scientific and analyzed via lc ms ms the difference between the aqueous concentrations in the control which contained no geomedia and in the geomedia containing batches at equilibrium condition was used to estimate the mass of the organic compound sorbed per kg of the dry mass of woodchips or biochar 2 8 case study to assess conditions typically encountered in stormwater treatment systems the santa rosa creek sub basin was used as a case study the transport model was used to estimate the lifetime of the woodchip biochar system the santa rosa creek sub basin is a 210 square kilometer area within sonoma county that receives approximately 76 cm of rain per year scwa 2014 land use in the sub basin is defined as 38 rural 35 urban 18 agricultural and 8 park recreation areas which has an estimated overall composite stormwater runoff coefficient of 0 48 swrcb 2011 the case study calculations were based on a stormwater treatment area of 0 5 which indicates the proportion of santa rosa that contains the impervious catchment the runoff collection efficiencies were set to 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 to represent a range of stormwater volumes that could be potentially captured independent of the runoff coefficient the values were entered in the simple method equation for runoff volume eq s4 schueler 1987 the transport model estimated the time to reach 50 breakthrough of the most weakly retained compound 2 4 d under assumed annual rainfall volumes captured the simulation assumed a 50 cm treatment depth of woodchips amended with either 6 15 or 33 by weight biochar with a controlled continuous flow of 2 ml min 1 3 4 cm h 1 pore water velocity and contaminant load of 50 μg l 1 the case study assumes an appropriately sized catch basin for controlled release to the woodchip biochar filter 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal during both the aging with urban stormwater and the challenge test the woodchip bioreactor effectively removed nitrate from stormwater the concentrations of nitrate in all these treatments straw woodchips or woodchips plus biochar dropped by over 99 to concentrations below detection limit i e 0 05 mg n l 1 after the first month of system start up fig s1 table s8 differences in nitrate concentration removal between treatments demonstrated no statistical significance between stormwater treatment columns p 0 31 and p 0 53 results from the nitrate removal in the woodchip columns are in accordance with previous studies halaburka et al 2017 ghane et al 2015 warneke et al 2011 additionally our prediction that biochar could impact denitrification as has been shown in soil systems cayuela et al 2013 possibly due to electron shuttling appeared null phosphate was removed by the minnesota filter during the first 110 pore volumes of system operation fig s3 after approximately 190 pore volumes the iron filings were unable to adsorb phosphate and a large fraction of the previously adsorbed phosphate was remobilized due to iron reduction after this phosphate release the effluent phosphate concentration was within the measurement error of the influent value this possibly could have been prevented with lower flow rates and an intermittent flow system the failure of the minnesota filter may have been attributable to the use of continuous flow conditions which did not allow the system to undergo drying and oxidation of fe ii and organic particles during the antecedent dry periods erickson et al 2012 further research is needed to improve the performance of the minnesota filter under continuous flow conditions 3 2 metal removal all three treatments exhibited similar performances with respect to metal removal p 0 2 in woodchip bioreactors during the challenge tests fig 3 removal of cd cu ni and pb exceeded 80 after the initial start up period the addition of biochar demonstrated no significant difference in metal removal results from the biochar amended columns for removal of cadmium copper nickel and lead are consistent with previous studies mohan et al 2011 reddy et al 2014b zinc removal was variable for all three treatments with an average removal of 54 min 33 max 84 of the metal over the duration of the experiment table s10 however the variability was not statistically significant p 0 20 studies on metal removal from stormwater indicate that zinc is more difficult to remove than other metals due to its mobility mosley and peake 2001 hatt et al 2011 for example the relatively low removal efficiency might be due to the competition among different metals for binding sites on the surface of the biochar as reported for copper and zinc chen et al 2011 complexation capacity of natural organic matter nom was likely exceeded due to high concentrations of metals added in the system frimmel 1998 lower concentrations of metals observed in the field should be tested in order to observe the potential of these treatment systems under realistic conditions sulfate reduction in the bioreactor fig s5 likely contributed to metal removal through the formation of metal sulfides metals removal by the woodchip only containing columns suggests formation of metal sulfide precipitates sulfate removal was about 90 fig s5 corresponding to an average of 0 3 mm which as sulfide would form metal sulfide precipitates kiran et al 2017 on a molar basis the amount of sulfide formed exceeds cu cd ni pb which is about 0 2 μm metal sulfide precipitation was predicted using visual minteq and the synthetic stormwater ionic matrix with computed saturation indices exceeding unity for covellite cu galena pb nickel sulfide and sphalerite zn like other studies observing transition metal cation removal in passive flow systems using sulfate reducing bacteria low solubility metals such as cadmium copper lead and zinc are removed under anaerobic conditions white and gadd 2000 jong and parry 2003 3 3 trace organic contaminant removal the biochar amended bioreactors fully removed all of the species of trace organic contaminants added during the challenge tests while the performance of the other two treatment systems varied with the contaminant the woodchip columns amended with 33 by weight biochar exhibited 100 contaminant mass removal continuously through 250 pore volumes of practical significance is that these tests occurred after eight months of preconditioning with runoff to allow for aging and other factors that may affect performance the woodchips and woodchips in combination with straw removed an average of 90 of the fipronil and 98 9 or 84 4 of the atrazine respectively fig 4 a and b significantly higher removal of atrazine and 2 4 d occurred in the woodchip treatment than the straw woodchip columns p 0 001 respectively based on the literature we expect that some target contaminants were biotransformed in the aged geomedia columns e g 2 4 d benzotriazole fipronil atrazine under given conditions wolfand et al 2016 ulrich et al 2015 crawford et al 1998 gunasekara et al 2007 for example biotransformation is considered to be the major route in the decrease of 2 4 d in soil walters 1999 tcep and diuron however do not readily biodegrade in the environment under anoxic conditions visakh and arao 2015 shareef et al 2014 diuron exhibits classic breakthrough for the woodchip and woodchip straw tests indicative of sorption and 2 4 d shows evidence of partial degradation the identification of transformation products was beyond the scope of this study but is important for assessment of any harmful metabolites prior literature has shown that under anoxic soil conditions fipronil is slowly reduced to fipronil sulfide gunasekara et al 2007 and crawford et al 1998 showed that under denitrifying conditions atrazine is biodegraded to hydroxyatrazine that some compounds at times exhibit c c0 1 e g benzotriazole is attributed to remobilization of contaminants previously absorbed in the system the addition of straw as a more readily degradable source of carbon substrate provided no benefit compared to woodchips alone or woodchips plus biochar with respect to the removal of trace organics this is similar to other studies that have shown no difference in trace organic removal with the amendment of straw ulrich et al 2017 we had originally hypothesized that the significant aging we conducted to the reactors using real stormwater collected in the field may alter the degrading microbial communities indeed past work has demonstrated differences in stormwater bioretention systems in field and laboratory conditions following aging lefevre et al 2012a 2012b a transport model was applied to predict breakthrough of the six trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors adsorption isotherms for the contaminants onto the woodchips and biochar were used to estimate parameters needed for the model linear k d values at 50 μg l 1 for the biochar and woodchips are presented in the si table s13 the linear k d values l kg 1 ranged from 105 to 106 for biochar k d values for woodchips were on the order of 10 20 l kg 1 indicating in comparison to biochar that the woodchips had much lower effect on sorption retarded transport in the presence of woodchips the retardation factor is on the order of 7 13 in this case breakthrough would occur after about 10 pore volumes which appears to be the case for tcep and benzotriazole attenuation of atrazine and fipronil by the woodchip columns in the absence of biochar is attributed to biotransformation figs s12 13 the freundlich model which fit the data better for sorption to biochar than the langmuir model table s14 was used in the transport model using the freundlich isotherms the transport model eq s3 was used to estimate approximate breakthrough times for the trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended biofilter fig 5 the competitive sorption of the contaminants to the biochar was approximated by the sorption coefficients for the contaminants having been measured simultaneously at comparable doses of 50 μg l 1 under conditions typically observed in the tests the first contaminant predicted to breakthrough is 2 4 d 15 yrs followed by tcep 26 yrs fipronil 30 yrs atrazine 32 yrs 1h benzotriazole 34 yrs and diuron 48 yrs negatively charged 2 4 d had the largest freundlich exponent 0 55 indicating the lower adsorption capacity compared to the other contaminants at the ph of the synthetic stormwater 7 6 2 4 d is anionic and removal via sorption can be difficult walters 1999 the model does not take into consideration biotransformation which is a major route in the decrease of 2 4 d walters 1999 the results of the breakthrough curves are therefore conservative fipronil and tcep as well as 1h benzotriazole and atrazine exhibit similar transport as may be expected from the similarity in their sorption characteristics consistent with our results other studies have reported high sorption capacities for diuron using biochar ulrich et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 3 4 environmental implications to investigate the application of woodchip biochar systems for stormwater runoff treatment a scoping level analysis was performed using results from the contaminant transport model and conditions representative of santa rosa california biochar is a cost effective alternative to activated carbon because biochar costs approximately 250 per ton whereas activated carbon costs on average 3000 per ton kearns et al 2014 these systems would likely provide more than adequate capacity for trace organic contaminant removal with lower amounts of biochar therefore we estimated the time to reach 50 breakthrough for 2 4 d also using 6 and 15 by weight biochar as alternative scenarios this analysis assumes that the stormwater runoff can be captured and stored between storms to give a controlled flow to the treatment systems at a percolation rate i e pore water velocity of 82 cm d 1 we envision that the woodchip bioreactors in the stormwater ctr could maintain saturated conditions which is in contrast to most stormwater infiltration green infrastructure e g bioretention if episodic wetting drying conditions occurred doc export from the woodchips from the changing redox conditions would likely occur and lower the woodchip bedlife schipper et al 2010 the media replacement frequency requirements of the biochar woodchip stormwater treatment system depend on the stormwater treatment system area the volume of annual rainfall captured pollutant sources within the catchment and the sorption behavior in this analysis the lifetime of the system is defined as the time before 50 breakthrough occurs for 2 4 d which is the weakest sorbed contaminant and thus the first to experience breakthrough the model estimates how long the treatment system would last assuming various conditions of rainfall volume captured in the watershed and stormwater treatment plan area as a percentage of catchment area which was assumed to be 0 5 about 1 km2 we present results for different percentages of catchment area in table s15 even with the small treatment area of 0 5 and lowest amount of biochar the system can remove all of the trace organic contaminants at least for ten years table 2 practical considerations e g clogging plant growth burrowing animals and scheduled maintenance and the need to replace woodchips would likely limit the lifespan of the treatment system christianson et al 2016 clogging was not an issue during the thirteen month study this could be because woodchips do not clog as readily as sand meaning such high concentrations of biochar would likely result in clogging for sand filters murnane et al 2016 studies suggest that woodchip reactors should be replaced every 15 20 years to maintain nitrate removal christianson and helmers 2011 and biochar should be replaced regularly to maintain system performance grebel et al 2013 the urban runoff was filtered during the eight month conditioning period which removed particles greater than 50 microns in practice particle removal is essential to the longevity of any stormwater filtration system for example coarse sand filtration or a hydrodynamic separator wilson et al 2009 that combines swirl concentration and flow control prior to woodchip biochar treatment would be needed to assure the long term performance indicated in table 2 4 conclusions the removal of nitrate metals and trace organic contaminants from biochar amended woodchip bioreactors was evaluated in a pilot scale study in which the bioreactors were pre conditioned using urban runoff in the field then challenged in the laboratory conditioning with actual stormwater is an essential experimental protocol for the evaluation of treatment performance because materials change following exposure to stormwater and microbes woodchip bioreactors were capable of removing nitrate and four of the five metals tested i e cd cu ni and pb but not zn addition of biochar at 33 dry weight did not affect the ability of the system to remove nitrate and metals but did substantially improve the removal of trace organic contaminants under saturated flow conditions in multi unit stormwater treatment systems breakthrough of the weakest sorbed trace organic contaminants i e 2 4 d would require 26 years under the most conservative conditions prior to that time it is likely that the woodchips in the bioreactor would be replaced thus much less biochar might be needed to achieve pollutant removal these results indicate the potential for biochar and woodchips in engineered stormwater infiltration basins to provide a cost effective means to improve water quality and recharge of drinking water aquifers with urban stormwater larger scale field demonstration tests and long term operational monitoring are required to provide assurance that system performance and water quality standards are being continuously met as well as to identify maintenance requirements to maintain the longevity of

18958,stormwater is increasingly being valued as a freshwater resource in arid regions and can provide opportunities for beneficial reuse via aquifer recharge if adequate pollutant removal can be achieved we envision a multi unit operation approach to capture treat and recharge ctr stormwater using low energy cost effective technologies appropriate for larger magnitude less frequent events herein we tested nutrient metal and trace organic contaminant removal of a pilot scale ctr system in the laboratory using biochar amended woodchip bioreactors following eight months of aging under field conditions with exposure to real stormwater replicate columns with woodchips and biochar 33 by weight woodchips and straw or woodchips only were operated with continuous saturated flow for eight months using water from a watershed that drained an urban area consisting of residential housing and parks in sonoma california after aging columns were challenged for five months by continuous exposure to synthetic stormwater amended with 50 μg l 1 of six trace organic contaminants i e fipronil diuron 1h benzotriazole atrazine 2 4 d and tcep and five metals cd cu ni pb zn frequently detected in stormwater in order to replicate the treatment unit operation of a ctr system throughout the eight month aging and five month challenge experiment nitrate concentrations were below the detection limit after treatment i e 0 05 mg n l 1 the removal efficiencies for metals in all treatments were 80 for ni cu cd and pb for zn about 50 removal occurred in the woodchip biochar systems while the other systems achieved about 20 removal no breakthrough of the trace organic compounds was observed in any biochar containing columns woodchip columns without biochar removed approximately 99 of influent atrazine and 90 of influent fipronil but exhibited relatively rapid breakthrough of tcep 2 4 d 1h benzotriazole and diuron the addition of straw to the woodchip columns provided no significant benefit compared to woodchips alone due to the lack of breakthrough of trace organics in the biochar woodchip columns we estimated column breakthrough with a diffusion limited sorption model results of the model indicate breakthrough for the trace organics would occur between 10 000 and 32 000 pore volumes under ideal conditions this could be equivalent to decades of service assuming failure by other processes e g clogging biofouling does not occur these results indicate that multiple contaminants can be removed in woodchip biochar reactors employed in stormwater treatment systems with suitable flow control and that the removal of trace organic contaminants is enhanced significantly by addition of biochar graphical abstract image 1 keywords stormwater treatment woodchip bioreactor biochar nitrate trace organic contaminants metals 1 introduction rapid population growth urban development and climate change are forcing water stressed cities to innovate management of water in all its forms to achieve more resilient water supplies luthy and sedlak 2015 one approach to a diversified water portfolio is urban stormwater capture and recharge urban runoff can reduce excessive groundwater extraction and lessen dependence on imported water hering et al 2013 while providing amenities like habitat green space and parks urban stormwater however often contains a suite of contaminants that can compromise drinking water quality epa 2007 for instance excess nutrients in runoff from impervious surfaces represent one of the largest challenges associated with nutrient pollution e g davis et al 2006 phosphorus and nitrogen in stormwater runoff originate from lawn fertilizers atmospheric deposition automobile exhaust agriculture soil erosion pet and yard waste and detergents davis et al 2006 stormwater runoff also contains other chemicals of concern for drinking water such as hydrocarbons metals and trace organic compounds grebel et al 2013 lefevre et al 2015 thus recharge with urban runoff needs to be managed in ways that do not compromise groundwater quality nas 2016 distributed low impact design lid technologies currently employed for stormwater treatment such as raingardens and bioswales are designed to treat the water quality volume i e the 90 frequency rainfall depth davis and mccuen 2005 and remove many non polar contaminants and metals davis et al 2006 hatt et al 2007 lefevre et al 2012a for example stormwater sand filters typically remove 8 58 of heavy metals cd cu pb ni cr and zn reddy et al 2014a nevertheless polar trace organic contaminants e g 2 4 d benzotriazole and atrazine and dissolved nutrients are more challenging to treat for example vegetated bioretention systems still remove less than half of soluble trace organic constituents and 60 80 of nitrate from stormwater zhang et al 2014 davis et al 2006 lefevre et al 2015 however vegetated biofiltration systems have been shown to remove over 95 of metals cu pb zn blecken et al 2009 small distributed lid practices offer minimal flood control mitigation infiltration and cannot store larger intensity lower frequency rains that occur in arid regions furthermore stormwater is increasingly being valued as a freshwater resource in arid regions and can provide opportunities for beneficial reuse via aquifer recharge bradshaw and luthy 2017 bischel et al 2012 an example of a large stormwater capture and infiltration site is the rory m shaw wetlands park in los angeles ca la stormwater 2018 there is critical need to develop more effective passive stormwater treatment technologies that are able to transform stormwater from a waste to a valuable freshwater resource in arid regions using low energy cost efficient approaches to pollutant removal to protect underlying groundwater we propose a stormwater capture treatment recharge ctr system with integrated storage and flow equalization control and unit process pollutant removal processes to meet the needs of stormwater management in arid regions fig 1 first stormwater is routed and pre treated e g removal of trash large particles to a storage unit for capture during a storm event that provides continuous flow with particle settling the stormwater is then routed through a series of low energy unit operations for the removal of nutrients metals and trace organic contaminants prior to groundwater recharge saturated flow conditions could be maintained as desired in specific unit operations by introducing a small amount of head with a weir and aerated aerobic conditions could be introduced by trickling through unsaturated media thus ctr provides an opportunity to capture larger volume storm events and achieves multiple benefits through controlled release to prevent flooding pollutant removal and improved aquifer recharge the proposed stormwater ctr system integrates multiple pollutant removal unit processes in a new comprehensive manner to meet the needs of stormwater recharge while removing pollutants for example upflow denitrifying woodchip bioreactors treat nitrate in stormwater and agricultural drainage chen et al 2013 hua et al 2016 warneke et al 2011 many papers examine woodchip bioreactors and thus we will not fully detail their operation here e g schipper et al 2010 addy et al 2016 in brief woodchips remove nitrate by acting as a source of biodegradable organic carbon and electron donor for microbes under anaerobic conditions woodchips are specifically chosen to maintain an extended bedlife schipper et al 2010 halaburka et al 2017 the potential of woodchips to remove metals or trace organic contaminants from urban stormwater has not been evaluated indeed the altered redox environment of the woodchip bioreactors halaburka et al 2017 could change metal speciation or induce reductive transformation of organic contaminants e g chlorinated herbicides batch and column studies suggest potential for biochar to remove metals and trace organic contaminants beck et al 2011 teixido et al 2011 ulrich et al 2015 iron containing sand used in some stormwater treatment systems erickson et al 2012 could be integrated into specific unit operations for dissolved phosphorus removal biochar is a low cost and effective amendment capable of removing metals trace organic contaminants and pathogens from stormwater lehmann and joseph 2009 mohanty et al 2018 biochar has a high sorption capacity for trace organic contaminants cornelissen et al 2005 shimabuku et al 2016 kearns et al 2014 mainly through hydrophobic interactions beck et al 2011 teixido et al 2011 trace metals are also removed by biochar through ion exchange and surface complexation piscitelli et al 2018 inyang et al 2015 biochar can increase denitrifying microorganisms abundance and promote nitrate reduction bock et al 2016 previous assessments of the ability of biochar to remove contaminants from stormwater have been limited in duration and were conducted with fresh not aged materials reddy et al 2014a shimabuku et al 2016 in this study biochar amended woodchip reactors were aged using real stormwater from a watershed north of san francisco and then the aged reactors were challenged in the laboratory with nutrients organic contaminants and metals in order to replicate the final treatment unit operation of a ctr system rmc 2011 scwa 2011 we applied a sorption model to predict the breakthrough of representative contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors our novel contribution was to simulate a pilot scale stormwater capture treatment recharge system using challenge tests following extensive aging with real stormwater to assess the removal of contaminants after long term operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and water source urban runoff was collected bi weekly from fryer creek in sonoma county ca latitude 38 17 15 n longitude 122 27 60 w from march to november 2016 the water source consisted of a combination of stormwater runoff and urban irrigation drainage the site was chosen as a representative urbanized stream in a watershed dominated by mixed residential and commercial land use creek water nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 8 to 13 7 mg n l 1 table s1 stormwater was collected every two weeks in a 2000 l polyethylene tank and moved to the pilot test study site at the sonoma county water agency where it was stored outdoors in a shaded location the water was initially passed through a nylon mesh 300 μm filter bag followed by a 50 μm filter before entering the tank mcmaster carr atlanta ga the filtration step prevented clogging during eight months of conditioning with urban runoff prior to challenge tests with synthetic stormwater spiked with trace levels of metals and organic compounds 2 2 column studies column experiments were employed to simulate a stormwater treatment system fig 2 stormwater was pumped from the 2000 l polyethylene storage tank through pvc tubing and into a 38 l iron containing down flow sand filter minnesota filter designed to remove dissolved phosphorus erickson et al 2012 the minnesota filter consisted of astm c33 sand and 5 iron filings by weight for a design hydraulic conductivity of 0 015 cm s 1 the 10 cm diameter filter was housed in a 41 cm long pvc column this design has been shown to remove approximately 90 of dissolved phosphorus for up to 200 meters of treatment depth without decreases in hydraulic conductivity erickson et al 2012 because this technology had been previously tested successfully in both laboratory and field conditions this study integrated it as a unit process for phosphorus removal within the experiments but the minnesota filter was not a subject of research other than to test its performance under field conditions after the minnesota filter the water was stored in a 38 l polyethylene reservoir prior to pumping into nine 10 cm diameter 50 cm long pvc woodchip bioreactors table s2 in up flow mode to maintain saturated conditions although saturated conditions are less common in distributed stormwater practices davis and mccuen 2005 we envision that saturated conditions would be maintained in a stormwater ctr system to maintain woodchip bedlife schipper et al 2010 treatments i e woodchips woodchips amended with 33 biochar by weight and woodchips amended with 33 straw by weight were conducted in triplicate fig 2 2 3 filter material woodchips were obtained from an arborist s woodchip waste pile in portola valley ca the woodchips were composed of a mix of species including california redwood sequoia sempervirens oak quercus sp and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii as described previously in halaburka et al 2017 the woodchips were dried at 50 c for 48 h in a drying oven then sieved to a diameter between 2 and 10 mm previous studies have shown that woodchip type and particle size in woodchip bioreactors have no significant effect on nitrate removal rates cameron and schipper 2010 the woodchip bioreactors were packed with 1000 g woodchips whereas the biochar woodchip columns consisted of 500 g woodchips and 250 g biochar 33 by weight and 40 v v the straw woodchip columns were packed with 500 g woodchips and 250 g straw mulch the straw was produced on site at the sonoma wastewater treatment plant from an open field we had hypothesized that differing organic carbon types e g straw and the presence of biochar could impact denitrification efficiency schipper et al 2010 cayuela et al 2013 the biochar used in this experiment was obtained from mountain crest gardens etna ca mcg biochar it had a bet surface area of 318 m2 g 1 as determined by n2 adsorption at 77 k intertek allentown pa ulrich et al 2015 the dry mass elemental composition of the biochar was 78 2 c 0 4 h 0

other commercially available biochars ulrich et al 2015 mcg biochar was received as small char chips that were dry sieved through a 30 mesh 0 6 mm to remove fine particles 2 4 field aging of reactors

weight biochar decreased the hydraulic conductivity to 0 53 0 27 cm s 1 fig s6 although addition of porous geomedia like biochar could lower ksat values of these infiltration systems decreasing water velocity could have a positive effect on bioreactor treatment performance i e nitrogen and trace organic removal hoover et al 2015 ulrich et al 2015 the woodchip columns amended with straw showed only a slight decrease in hydraulic conductivity relative to the woodchip columns ksat 1 86 0 06 cm s 1 column porosity was calculated gravimetrically after saturation with deionized water to determine the hydraulic residence time hrt of the columns bromide tracer tests were performed with nabr 500 mg l 1 sigma aldrich measured with a hanna instruments hi14102 bromide combination electrode the bromide solution was fed into the columns at 2 ml min 1 for 10 min samples were collected at the effluent until full breakthrough took place the curves were adjusted for a 25 min lag time before the spiked solution reached the columns the calculated hrt values from the tracer tests are 11 1 11 2 and 13 1 h for woodchip straw woodchip and biochar woodchip respectively figs s7 s9 2 5 contaminant challenge tests challenge tests were conducted following an initial eight month period of column conditioning under saturated flow conditions during the challenge tests 0 6 mg p l 1 and 1 mg n l 1 as well as 50 μg l 1 each of a mixture of trace organic contaminants and metals commonly found in stormwater were added to a synthetic stormwater matrix and pumped continuously into the columns at 2 ml min 1 table s3 fig s10 organic contaminants for the experiments were selected based on contaminant physicochemical properties e g k ow values spanning 4 orders of magnitude and reactivity towards the studied geomedia table 1 information on sources of the nutrients and trace organic contaminants is included in tables s3 and s4 chemicals were used as received the stock solutions of trace organic contaminants were prepared in methanol after dilution the concentration of methanol as doc measured in the synthetic stormwater influent was approximately 100 mg l 1 the percentage of the methanol added to the system is similar to other studies on trace organic removal ulrich et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 although the addition of methanol increased influent doc concentrations table s5

breakthrough time for trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors a transport model was adapted from ulrich et al 2015 the transport model predicts trace organic breakthrough times dependent on kinetic sorption effects on the biochar woodchip media this model assumes intraparticle diffusion limited sorption kinetics eq s3 further description about the transport model and its parameters is outlined in previous studies ulrich et al 2015 werner et al 2006 data from batch experiments described below were fitted to the freundlich eq s1 and langmuir eq s2 isotherm models fig s12 using the freundlich isotherms a transport model estimated the approximate breakthrough time for the trace organics parameters used to predict breakthrough curves in biochar amended woodchip bioreactors are shown in table s2 and equation s3 sorption parameters for the transport model were determined in laboratory batch experiments with i biochar and ii woodchips all batch experiments were conducted in 250 ml glass flasks containing a predefined amount of geomedia synthetic stormwater ph 7 5 and 100 mg l 1 of sodium azide as a biocide owing to the distinctly different sorption capacities of biochar and woodchips the ratios of geomedia to synthetic stormwater differed as follows 6 mg of biochar was added to 180 ml of synthetic stormwater and 50 g of woodchips was added to 200 ml of synthetic stormwater the geomedia was pre equilibrated with synthetic stormwater and azide for 24 h prior to addition of different concentrations of a trace organic contaminant mixture containing diuron atrazine 1h benzotriazole fipronil 2 4 d and tcep for isotherm experiments with biochar 30 300 μg l 1 of the contaminant mixture was added for isotherm experiments with woodchips a larger concentration range of 20 500 μg l 1 was chosen due to the lower sorption capacity of woodchips vessels were kept on a horizontal shaker until sorption equilibrium was reached i e 24 h for woodchips and 7 days for biochar subsequently 1 ml sample aliquots were withdrawn from each batch filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber syringe filter tisch scientific and analyzed via lc ms ms the difference between the aqueous concentrations in the control which contained no geomedia and in the geomedia containing batches at equilibrium condition was used to estimate the mass of the organic compound sorbed per kg of the dry mass of woodchips or biochar 2 8 case study to assess conditions typically encountered in stormwater treatment systems the santa rosa creek sub basin was used as a case study the transport model was used to estimate the lifetime of the woodchip biochar system the santa rosa creek sub basin is a 210 square kilometer area within sonoma county that receives approximately 76 cm of rain per year scwa 2014 land use in the sub basin is defined as 38 rural 35 urban 18 agricultural and 8 park recreation areas which has an estimated overall composite stormwater runoff coefficient of 0 48 swrcb 2011 the case study calculations were based on a stormwater treatment area of 0 5 which indicates the proportion of santa rosa that contains the impervious catchment the runoff collection efficiencies were set to 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 to represent a range of stormwater volumes that could be potentially captured independent of the runoff coefficient the values were entered in the simple method equation for runoff volume eq s4 schueler 1987 the transport model estimated the time to reach 50 breakthrough of the most weakly retained compound 2 4 d under assumed annual rainfall volumes captured the simulation assumed a 50 cm treatment depth of woodchips amended with either 6 15 or 33 by weight biochar with a controlled continuous flow of 2 ml min 1 3 4 cm h 1 pore water velocity and contaminant load of 50 μg l 1 the case study assumes an appropriately sized catch basin for controlled release to the woodchip biochar filter 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal during both the aging with urban stormwater and the challenge test the woodchip bioreactor effectively removed nitrate from stormwater the concentrations of nitrate in all these treatments straw woodchips or woodchips plus biochar dropped by over 99 to concentrations below detection limit i e 0 05 mg n l 1 after the first month of system start up fig s1 table s8 differences in nitrate concentration removal between treatments demonstrated no statistical significance between stormwater treatment columns p 0 31 and p 0 53 results from the nitrate removal in the woodchip columns are in accordance with previous studies halaburka et al 2017 ghane et al 2015 warneke et al 2011 additionally our prediction that biochar could impact denitrification as has been shown in soil systems cayuela et al 2013 possibly due to electron shuttling appeared null phosphate was removed by the minnesota filter during the first 110 pore volumes of system operation fig s3 after approximately 190 pore volumes the iron filings were unable to adsorb phosphate and a large fraction of the previously adsorbed phosphate was remobilized due to iron reduction after this phosphate release the effluent phosphate concentration was within the measurement error of the influent value this possibly could have been prevented with lower flow rates and an intermittent flow system the failure of the minnesota filter may have been attributable to the use of continuous flow conditions which did not allow the system to undergo drying and oxidation of fe ii and organic particles during the antecedent dry periods erickson et al 2012 further research is needed to improve the performance of the minnesota filter under continuous flow conditions 3 2 metal removal all three treatments exhibited similar performances with respect to metal removal p 0 2 in woodchip bioreactors during the challenge tests fig 3 removal of cd cu ni and pb exceeded 80 after the initial start up period the addition of biochar demonstrated no significant difference in metal removal results from the biochar amended columns for removal of cadmium copper nickel and lead are consistent with previous studies mohan et al 2011 reddy et al 2014b zinc removal was variable for all three treatments with an average removal of 54 min 33 max 84 of the metal over the duration of the experiment table s10 however the variability was not statistically significant p 0 20 studies on metal removal from stormwater indicate that zinc is more difficult to remove than other metals due to its mobility mosley and peake 2001 hatt et al 2011 for example the relatively low removal efficiency might be due to the competition among different metals for binding sites on the surface of the biochar as reported for copper and zinc chen et al 2011 complexation capacity of natural organic matter nom was likely exceeded due to high concentrations of metals added in the system frimmel 1998 lower concentrations of metals observed in the field should be tested in order to observe the potential of these treatment systems under realistic conditions sulfate reduction in the bioreactor fig s5 likely contributed to metal removal through the formation of metal sulfides metals removal by the woodchip only containing columns suggests formation of metal sulfide precipitates sulfate removal was about 90 fig s5 corresponding to an average of 0 3 mm which as sulfide would form metal sulfide precipitates kiran et al 2017 on a molar basis the amount of sulfide formed exceeds cu cd ni pb which is about 0 2 μm metal sulfide precipitation was predicted using visual minteq and the synthetic stormwater ionic matrix with computed saturation indices exceeding unity for covellite cu galena pb nickel sulfide and sphalerite zn like other studies observing transition metal cation removal in passive flow systems using sulfate reducing bacteria low solubility metals such as cadmium copper lead and zinc are removed under anaerobic conditions white and gadd 2000 jong and parry 2003 3 3 trace organic contaminant removal the biochar amended bioreactors fully removed all of the species of trace organic contaminants added during the challenge tests while the performance of the other two treatment systems varied with the contaminant the woodchip columns amended with 33 by weight biochar exhibited 100 contaminant mass removal continuously through 250 pore volumes of practical significance is that these tests occurred after eight months of preconditioning with runoff to allow for aging and other factors that may affect performance the woodchips and woodchips in combination with straw removed an average of 90 of the fipronil and 98 9 or 84 4 of the atrazine respectively fig 4 a and b significantly higher removal of atrazine and 2 4 d occurred in the woodchip treatment than the straw woodchip columns p 0 001 respectively based on the literature we expect that some target contaminants were biotransformed in the aged geomedia columns e g 2 4 d benzotriazole fipronil atrazine under given conditions wolfand et al 2016 ulrich et al 2015 crawford et al 1998 gunasekara et al 2007 for example biotransformation is considered to be the major route in the decrease of 2 4 d in soil walters 1999 tcep and diuron however do not readily biodegrade in the environment under anoxic conditions visakh and arao 2015 shareef et al 2014 diuron exhibits classic breakthrough for the woodchip and woodchip straw tests indicative of sorption and 2 4 d shows evidence of partial degradation the identification of transformation products was beyond the scope of this study but is important for assessment of any harmful metabolites prior literature has shown that under anoxic soil conditions fipronil is slowly reduced to fipronil sulfide gunasekara et al 2007 and crawford et al 1998 showed that under denitrifying conditions atrazine is biodegraded to hydroxyatrazine that some compounds at times exhibit c c0 1 e g benzotriazole is attributed to remobilization of contaminants previously absorbed in the system the addition of straw as a more readily degradable source of carbon substrate provided no benefit compared to woodchips alone or woodchips plus biochar with respect to the removal of trace organics this is similar to other studies that have shown no difference in trace organic removal with the amendment of straw ulrich et al 2017 we had originally hypothesized that the significant aging we conducted to the reactors using real stormwater collected in the field may alter the degrading microbial communities indeed past work has demonstrated differences in stormwater bioretention systems in field and laboratory conditions following aging lefevre et al 2012a 2012b a transport model was applied to predict breakthrough of the six trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended woodchip bioreactors adsorption isotherms for the contaminants onto the woodchips and biochar were used to estimate parameters needed for the model linear k d values at 50 μg l 1 for the biochar and woodchips are presented in the si table s13 the linear k d values l kg 1 ranged from 105 to 106 for biochar k d values for woodchips were on the order of 10 20 l kg 1 indicating in comparison to biochar that the woodchips had much lower effect on sorption retarded transport in the presence of woodchips the retardation factor is on the order of 7 13 in this case breakthrough would occur after about 10 pore volumes which appears to be the case for tcep and benzotriazole attenuation of atrazine and fipronil by the woodchip columns in the absence of biochar is attributed to biotransformation figs s12 13 the freundlich model which fit the data better for sorption to biochar than the langmuir model table s14 was used in the transport model using the freundlich isotherms the transport model eq s3 was used to estimate approximate breakthrough times for the trace organic contaminants in the biochar amended biofilter fig 5 the competitive sorption of the contaminants to the biochar was approximated by the sorption coefficients for the contaminants having been measured simultaneously at comparable doses of 50 μg l 1 under conditions typically observed in the tests the first contaminant predicted to breakthrough is 2 4 d 15 yrs followed by tcep 26 yrs fipronil 30 yrs atrazine 32 yrs 1h benzotriazole 34 yrs and diuron 48 yrs negatively charged 2 4 d had the largest freundlich exponent 0 55 indicating the lower adsorption capacity compared to the other contaminants at the ph of the synthetic stormwater 7 6 2 4 d is anionic and removal via sorption can be difficult walters 1999 the model does not take into consideration biotransformation which is a major route in the decrease of 2 4 d walters 1999 the results of the breakthrough curves are therefore conservative fipronil and tcep as well as 1h benzotriazole and atrazine exhibit similar transport as may be expected from the similarity in their sorption characteristics consistent with our results other studies have reported high sorption capacities for diuron using biochar ulrich et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 3 4 environmental implications to investigate the application of woodchip biochar systems for stormwater runoff treatment a scoping level analysis was performed using results from the contaminant transport model and conditions representative of santa rosa california biochar is a cost effective alternative to activated carbon because biochar costs approximately 250 per ton whereas activated carbon costs on average 3000 per ton kearns et al 2014 these systems would likely provide more than adequate capacity for trace organic contaminant removal with lower amounts of biochar therefore we estimated the time to reach 50 breakthrough for 2 4 d also using 6 and 15 by weight biochar as alternative scenarios this analysis assumes that the stormwater runoff can be captured and stored between storms to give a controlled flow to the treatment systems at a percolation rate i e pore water velocity of 82 cm d 1 we envision that the woodchip bioreactors in the stormwater ctr could maintain saturated conditions which is in contrast to most stormwater infiltration green infrastructure e g bioretention if episodic wetting drying conditions occurred doc export from the woodchips from the changing redox conditions would likely occur and lower the woodchip bedlife schipper et al 2010 the media replacement frequency requirements of the biochar woodchip stormwater treatment system depend on the stormwater treatment system area the volume of annual rainfall captured pollutant sources within the catchment and the sorption behavior in this analysis the lifetime of the system is defined as the time before 50 breakthrough occurs for 2 4 d which is the weakest sorbed contaminant and thus the first to experience breakthrough the model estimates how long the treatment system would last assuming various conditions of rainfall volume captured in the watershed and stormwater treatment plan area as a percentage of catchment area which was assumed to be 0 5 about 1 km2 we present results for different percentages of catchment area in table s15 even with the small treatment area of 0 5 and lowest amount of biochar the system can remove all of the trace organic contaminants at least for ten years table 2 practical considerations e g clogging plant growth burrowing animals and scheduled maintenance and the need to replace woodchips would likely limit the lifespan of the treatment system christianson et al 2016 clogging was not an issue during the thirteen month study this could be because woodchips do not clog as readily as sand meaning such high concentrations of biochar would likely result in clogging for sand filters murnane et al 2016 studies suggest that woodchip reactors should be replaced every 15 20 years to maintain nitrate removal christianson and helmers 2011 and biochar should be replaced regularly to maintain system performance grebel et al 2013 the urban runoff was filtered during the eight month conditioning period which removed particles greater than 50 microns in practice particle removal is essential to the longevity of any stormwater filtration system for example coarse sand filtration or a hydrodynamic separator wilson et al 2009 that combines swirl concentration and flow control prior to woodchip biochar treatment would be needed to assure the long term performance indicated in table 2 4 conclusions the removal of nitrate metals and trace organic contaminants from biochar amended woodchip bioreactors was evaluated in a pilot scale study in which the bioreactors were pre conditioned using urban runoff in the field then challenged in the laboratory conditioning with actual stormwater is an essential experimental protocol for the evaluation of treatment performance because materials change following exposure to stormwater and microbes woodchip bioreactors were capable of removing nitrate and four of the five metals tested i e cd cu ni and pb but not zn addition of biochar at 33 dry weight did not affect the ability of the system to remove nitrate and metals but did substantially improve the removal of trace organic contaminants under saturated flow conditions in multi unit stormwater treatment systems breakthrough of the weakest sorbed trace organic contaminants i e 2 4 d would require 26 years under the most conservative conditions prior to that time it is likely that the woodchips in the bioreactor would be replaced thus much less biochar might be needed to achieve pollutant removal these results indicate the potential for biochar and woodchips in engineered stormwater infiltration basins to provide a cost effective means to improve water quality and recharge of drinking water aquifers with urban stormwater larger scale field demonstration tests and long term operational monitoring are required to provide assurance that system performance and water quality standards are being continuously met as well as to identify maintenance requirements to maintain the longevity of

18959,sulfide production and oilfield produced water are considered as environmental challenges in the oil industry iron crosslinked sodium alginate sa fe was used to address these problems simultaneously a pair of columns containing one coarse sand column and one fine sand column was designed to simulate heterogeneous rock layers and evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe generation of fes precipitates led to decreases of sulfide in the gas phase by 45 3 2 and in the aqueous solution by 75 4 7 the generated fes nanoparticles and sulfate reducing bacteria attached on the surface of the sand in the coarse sand column to plug the pores that caused the water flow to switch from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column analysis of fes distribution indicated that the column inlet was effectively plugged by fes the theoretical amount of fes 1 19 mmol that was determined based on sulfur balance was nearly equal to the actual amount of fes precipitation 1 11 mmol additionally water viscosity increased from 0 9 mpa s to 342 mpa s induced by the collapse of sa fe gels which reduced the difference in viscosity between oil and water to avoid viscous fingering as a consequence the oil recovery improved from 46 2 6 to 85 3 0 in the sand column oil saturated recovery experiment which contributed to the decrease of oil normalized produced water from 70 1 4 0 to 37 5 1 3 ml water ml oil therefore this study shows that sa fe exhibits potential for application in controlling sulfide as well as reducing produced water graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron crosslinked sodium alginate sulfide control oilfield produced water reduction fes volume sweep efficiency biopluging 1 introduction oil is likely to continue being the dominant source of energy worldwide through 2030 abas et al 2015 sulfide production in oil exploitation is a serious concern because it causes detrimental problems such as malodors health hazards and corrosion washio et al 2005 beauchamp et al 1984 ren et al 2005 hessel et al 1997 which inevitably lead to environmental issues and high costs sulfide is mediated by the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb present primarily in the reservoir nemati et al 2001 different approaches to controlling sulfide production have been proposed srb activity is typically inhibited by treatment of injection water with biocides e g glutaraldehyde and cocodiamines and nitrate nitrite greene et al 2006 xue and voordouw 2015 the introduction of these chemicals may lead to groundwater contamination and entail high costs for the oil industry nas and berktay 2006 lin et al 2008 okafor and ogbonna 2003 in the wastewater treatment industry the detriment from sulfide production also presents a problem carrera et al 2016 considerable amount of researches were conducted on sulfide control gutierrez et al 2008 ganigue et al 2011 addition of metallic salts has been reported to achieve sulfide precipitation by forming highly insoluble metallic sulfide precipitates thereby decreasing the amount of sulfide available for release to the atmosphere zhang et al 2008 2009 these studies involved iron salts e g fe iii and fe ii which can effectively reduce dissolved sulfide from wastewater to form fes precipitates zhang et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 therefore this method provides a basis for the treatment of injection water with iron salts for oil production to control sulfide however the directionless penetration of injection iron solution is wasteful and results in unwanted plugging of the reservoir therefore a more cost effective and targeted method should be highly beneficial for iron addition for some mature oilfields secondary recovery is the main stage that uses water flushing to enhance oil recovery thus vast quantities of process water has been consumed and consequently vast amounts of wastewater has been generated produced water a mixture of different organic and inorganic compounds is the largest waste stream generated in oil industries and effect of discharging produced water on the environment has lately become a significant issue of environmental concern sheikhyousefi et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 produced water is conventionally treated through different chemical xu et al 2008 physical murray gulde et al 2003 and biological methods campos et al 2002 for example weschenfelder et al 2015 reported that microfiltration process enabled the treatment and reuse of produced water using ceramic membranes lu et al 2009 conducted on a hydrolysis acidification bio contact oxidation system to treat oilfield produced water with high salinity all aforementioned methods focused on the treatment of produced water it may be an alternative method to reduce the production of produced water from the origin which is to use less water to recover more oil therefore how to enhance oil recovery is the key of reducing oilfield produced water in the secondary oil recovery long term water flooding generally causes poor sweep efficiency because of preferential flow paths wu et al 2017a these factors necessitate tertiary or enhanced oil recovery eor including chemically and microbially assisted methods polymer flooding is a well established technique for addressing the aforementioned problem enhancing oil recovery with the application for more than 40 years abidin et al 2012 however the high cost and poor shear resistance involved in this technique have yet to be addressed microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances epss e g bioclogging as effective methods to reduce permeability have been demonstrated in previous mathematical models and experiments ezeuko et al 2011 surasani et al 2013 thullner 2010 stewart and fogler 2001 which require necessary nutrients leading to high costs meanwhile bioclogging is not secure because of the complexity of the underground environment therefore various biominerals such as caco3 and fe oh 3 have been proposed to reduce the permeability and thus redirect the displacement fluid into previously bypassed portions of the reservoir our previous study that relied on caco3 to achieve eor was conducted wu et al 2017a zhu et al 2013 used anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation to form fe oh 3 biominerals to plug the large flow channel for promoting oil recovery in our previous study the polysaccharide sodium alginate sa was used to achieve microbial self healing for eor wu et al 2017b sa a biodegradable and biocompatible polysaccharide exhibits a significantly high affinity to divalent metal ions e g ca2 fe2 haug et al 1967 rees and welsh 1977 it is composed of a 1 4 linked block polymer of polyglucuronate polymannuronic acids contact between an alginate solution and divalent cations causes gelation liu et al 2012 the crosslinked divalent cation is dispersed homogeneously in the gel and wrapped by organic matrix once the crosslinked divalent cation is lost the gel collapses and again forms a viscous sa solution given its aforementioned nature sa can be used potentially as iron crosslinked sa sa fe for the oil industry thus this study was aimed at using sa fe to control sulfide production and reduce oilfield produced water simultaneously three column sets were established to measure sulfide production in these column experiments and evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe according to the direction of the water flow sulfide production and water viscosity were also recorded the column was subjected to destructive sampling to study the distribution of fes precipitation in the coarse sand column in addition a sand column oil saturated recovery experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of sa fe on oil recovery and then calculate the oil normalized produced water this study presents a potential application of sa fe in reducing the pollution of sulfide and produced water in oil exploitation 2 material and methods 2 1 microorganisms and cultivation desulfovibrio vulgaris nbrc 104121 a sulfate reducing bacterium was purchased from the national institute of technology and evaluation of japan it was first anaerobically cultivated in a serum bottle up to the stationary phase at 37 c with nbrc medium 1021 which consisted of the following 0 5 g l k2hpo4 1 g l nh4cl 1 g l na2so4 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 2 g l sodium lactate 1 g l yeast extract 1 mg l resazurin and 10 g l thioglycolate solution 0 1 g sodium thioglycolate and 0 1 g ascorbic acid were dissolved to 10 ml distilled water sterilized by filtration the ph of medium was 7 5 all chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china without further purification 2 2 preparation of sa fe up to 10 0 mmol fecl2 was dissolved into 50 ml purged distilled water that was purged with n2 99 for 20 min 0 1 g of sa was dissolved with 5 ml purged distilled water to obtain a 2 sa viscous solution the resulting solution was magnetically stirred until complete dissolution in an anaerobic glove box containing 5 hydrogen and 95 nitrogen subsequently a syringe with a needle of a diameter of 1 mm was used to collect the sa viscous solution and 5 ml of the sa solution was added into the fecl2 solution when the two solutions are in contact pellets immediately formed which is referred to as sa fe in this study after crosslinking for 12 h the sa fe was taken out and rinsed three times with purged distilled water to remove the adsorbed fecl2 the amount of crosslinked fe ii in sa fe was measured by adding 50 ml of 1 mol l hcl solution to the sa fe followed by ultrasonic oscillation for 10 min the solution was removed to evaluate the concentration of fe ii after 12 h of immersion thus the amount of crosslinked fe ii in sa fe was calculated 2 3 column experiments the oil reservoir is commonly consisted of high permeability and low permeability rock layer youssef et al 2009 thus the pair columns were constructed where the course sand column and the fine sand olumn were used to simulate the high permeability and low permeability rock layer respectively to demonstrate the performance of sa fe in sulfide control and volume sweep efficiency three pairs of columns with each pair referred to as a set were established each column set contained a fine sand column and a coarse sand column which were operated in parallel fig 1 each column was a 50 ml glass column 2 84 cm in internal diameter and 8 00 cm in length with a rubber plug fig 1 filled with sand and other materials as described below commonly different sizes of sand with the range from 0 01 to 3 mm were employed in the column experiments zhu et al 2013 eryuruk et al 2015 nemati and voordouw 2003 in the first set of columns column set 1 the fine sand glass column contained pure fine sand with a size of 0 5 mm in contrast the coarse sand column was first loaded with 10 ml sa fe pellet with a 2 mm diameter which was topped up with 40 ml coarse sand 2 mm the size distributions of fine sand and coarse sand are presented in fig s1 this latter configuration was used to simulate the introduction of sa fe into the high permeability reservoir the sand hefei cheng ming environmental protection technology co ltd china had been immersed in 3 mol l hcl for 12 h and then rinsed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached before the sand was loaded into the column gauze 32s 32s 40 40 was placed on both ends of the column to prevent the sand from leaking out the columns were tightly packed by regularly tapping the column to increase particle sedimentation and exclude gas bubbles the basic column parameters are presented in table s1 the porosity and permeability of coarse sand were 39 5 and 12 9 darcy respectively which were apparently higher than the counterpart of fine sand i e 36 1 and 1 3 darcy the columns were sterilized 121 c 20 min and were supplied with 20 ml of srb suspension od600 0 8 followed by cultivation for 12 h without medium flow to facilitate cell attachment zhu et al 2013 the srb suspension completely flowed through the coarse sand column when pumped through the set because of the difference in permeability between the fine sand and coarse sand table s1 subsequently the growth medium was continuously fed into the columns at 3 75 ml h with a bt100 1l peristaltic pump longer pump china a collecting bottle was used to monitor the daily volume of effluent from each column the concentrations of sulfate and sulfide in the influent and effluent were measured daily using methods to be further described to calculate the amount of fes precipitation and the rate of reduction gaseous hydrogen sulfide was collected daily using a 500 ml aluminum foil gas collecting bag and its concentration was measured by methylene blue spectrophotometry fogo and popowsky 1949 as controls column set 2 and column set 3 were set up operated and monitored similarly with the following differences from column set 1 the coarse sand column in column set 2 was filled with coarse sands only i e without sa fe but was fed with the medium containing fecl2 in order to obtain the comparable performance in sulfide control and plugging of coarse sand a high concentration of fecl2 2 5 g l was used in column set 2 column set 3 was configured as column set 2 but fed with the pure medium without fecl2 more detailed description of column set 1 set 2 and set 3 can be found in table s2 unless otherwise stated all of the above column experiments were carried out under 1atm and 25 c the coarse sand column in the experimental group i e column set 1 was subjected to destructive sampling for characterization and analysis at the end of the aforementioned experiment the sand samples were cut with a saw into six segments each 1 cm long and labeled 1 6 from the inlet to the outlet a small sand sample from segment 1 was analyzed with fe sem each of the six segments of the sand sample was immersed in 50 ml 10 v v hcl for 12 h in a glove box 5 hydrogen and 95 nitrogen prior to determining the concentration of fe ii the mass of fe ii in each column was then calculated 2 4 oil recovery experiment the oil recovery experiment was performed in column set 4 fig 1 the coarse sand column contained 40 ml of coarse sand and 10 ml of sa fe and the fine sand column contained 50 ml of fine sand table s2 the columns were operated and monitored as described for column set 1 and in our previous studies wu et al 2017a 2017b specifically 20 ml of machine oil shell helix ultra 5w 40 netherlands was mixed with coarse sand and the mixture of oil and coarse sand was introduced to the coarse sand column similarly another 20 ml of machine oil was mixed with fine sand and the mixture of oil and fine sand was introduced to the fine sand column subsequently waterflooding was used to flush the oil saturated columns at 3 75 ml h until no oil was detected in the effluent the volume of oil recovered from each column was measured this process simulated the secondary oil recovery that used water to flush oil out after the waterflooding 20 ml of srb suspension od600 0 8 was introduced to the column set after cultivation for 12 h to facilitate cell attachment the column set was flooded with a sterile growth medium by using a peristaltic pump till the end of oil recovery experiment the volume of oil recovered from each column was measured daily in the measuring cylinder by adding nacl to separate the oil water mixture unless otherwise stated all of the above column experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 5 chemical analysis and instrumental characterization fe ii concentration was detected by spectrophotometry using o phenanthroline that has been reported in previous researches leupin et al 2005 wu et al 2017c specifically fe ii was sampled and mixed with 1 ml of acetate buffer and 0 4 ml of o phenanthroline then quantified by uv vis spectrophotometry aoe uv 1900 aoe instruments china at 510 nm after 10 min sulfide ion was detected by spectrophotometry using 4 amino dimethylaniline and detailed description can be found in a previous study wang et al 2009 hydrogen sulfide was trapped by 1 mol l zinc acetate solution then the white zinc sulfide precipitate was measured according to the above described method thereby determining the concentration of hydrogen sulfide fogo and popowsky 1949 the concentration of sulfate was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 usa equipped with an as19 column and an electrical conductivity detector unless otherwise stated the influent and effluent were taken triplicate and each sample was measured twice to avoid the mis estimation due to the sampling or solution dilution field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and energy dispersive x ray edx analysis were conducted on a jeol jsm 6700f microscope jeol japan a thin film of gold was used to increase the conductivity of the samples for sem a rotational rheometer ar g2 ta instruments usa and a cone and plate test section were used for the viscosity measurements over a wide range of shear rate from 0 5 to 1000 1 s particle size distribution was analyzed with khkq 100 granulometer nanjing kehuan co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfide production a previous study demonstrated that the concentrations of thiosulfate and sulfite in all reactors were not significant 0 5 mg s l and that all of the sulfate reduced was converted to sulfide zhang et al 2009 accordingly only sulfide as the reductive product of sulfate was measured sulfide production in the column experiments was recorded the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the gas phase is shown in fig 2 a when fe ii was not added to the medium i e column set 3 the concentration of h2s gas quickly increased to 2184 ppmv on day 4 however it increased to only about 674 ppmv during the first 3 day and then increased slowly until day 6 in column set 1 in which sa fe was used subsequently the concentration of h2s abruptly increased to 1299 ppmv it may be assumed that the crosslinked fe ii was exhausted at this time resulting in the rapid increase in hydrogen sulfide concentration therefore sa fe induced a decrease in the production of h2s by 45 3 2 relative to that in column set 3 in column set 2 i e the medium containing fecl2 the concentration of h2s increased slowly until it reached a final concentration of 519 ppmv which was lower than that in column set 1 sulfide in the solution increased quickly to about 48 mg l without fe ii addition in column set 3 fig 2b in comparison sulfide increased slowly to 6 86 mg l in column set 1 until fe ii was exhausted before day 6 and then increased to 12 1 mg l fig 2b thus the sulfide in the solution decreased by 85 3 0 as a result of the sa fe treatment compared with that in column set 1 the concentration of sulfide in column set 2 showed minor difference the different ratios between gas and liquid phases could be related to different transfer rates previous studies have reported that iron salts are good candidates to control sulfide particularly in sewers pikaar et al 2014 lin et al 2017 used electrochemical oxidation of iron and generation of alkalinity to achieve an average sulfide removal efficiency of 95 4 4 4 which indicated that the addition of iron salt addition was an alternate method in the oil industry in column set 1 only 1 12 mmol fe ii was crosslinked in sa fe according to the measurement and it means that at most 1 12 mmol fe ii was injected to the column in comparison 619 ml of solution containing 2 5 g l fecl2 flowed through the coarse sand column in column set 2 fig 3 which means that at least 27 6 mmol of fe ii was injected to the column however the short hydraulic residence time 5 h resulted that most of the fe ii was flushed out from the column before its precipitation as the form of fes table s3 the amount of fe ii used in column set 2 was much higher than in column set 1 which resulted in the comparable sulfide control performance this means that some of the fe ii was wasted in column set 2 in column set 1 the fe ii was crosslinked into the sa thus the sa fe can be injected directionally to the highly permeable regions that prevents wasting of fe ii 3 2 effluent profile and viscosity change the effluent profile in column set 1 was determined to evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe fig 3a in the first 8 days water flowed completely through the coarse sand column and nearly no water flowed through the fine sand column because of the higher porosity and permeability of the coarse sand table s1 the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column increased continuously to about 800 ml before a variation in the flow direction was observed the flow direction switched from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column on day 8 until it ultimately switched completely to the fine sand column water subsequently began to flow through the fine sand column and the volume of effluent from the fine sand column increased to about 220 ml until the end of the experiment the experiment was terminated due to steady water flowing through the fine sand column in column set 2 water flow direction began to change from coarse sand column to fine sand column on day 6 5 1 5 days earlier than that in column set 1 suggesting that column set 2 had a faster rate of plugging than column set 1 fig 3b however as analyzed above the fecl2 solution used in column set 2 was 27 times higher than that used in column set 1 accordingly the slightly faster rate of plugging in column set 2 than column set 1 would not offset the huge cost of fe ii in column set 3 water flowed completely through the coarse sand column and no any effluent was recoded from the fine sand column which indicated that the coarse sand column was not plugged due to the absence of fe ii fig 3c in column set 1 and column set 2 the water flow direction all changed this finding suggests that the fes precipitates plugged the coarse sand column preventing water from passing though the coarse sand column the viscosity of the effluent from the coarse sand column in column set 1 was evaluated the viscosity of the effluent markedly increased from 0 9 mpa s to 342 mpa s in the first 4 days and then decreased sharply arising from the depletion of sa fe fig 4 a fig 4b shows the viscosity of the effluent as a function of shear rate at different times at a low shear rate exceptionally high viscosity values were obtained as the shear rate increased the effluents appeared as shear thinning liquids that accorded with the sa solution jo and banerjee 2014 yang et al 2009 this result showed that the sa fe gel collapsed to turn into a viscous sa solution because the crosslinked fe ii reacted with sulfide in the secondary recovery stage viscous fingering is also an inevitable problem that leads to poor sweep efficiency in waterflooding the propagation and early breakthrough of injected water occur because of the viscous difference between water and oil that reduces sweep efficiency and the oil recovery homsy 1987 tan and homsy 1992 water soluble polymers are commonly used to reduce the mobility of injecting fluid during waterflooding which has been studied extensively in the laboratory and tested widely in the field chang 1978 needham and doe 1987 therefore the increase of viscosity induced from sa solution could address the viscous fingering simultaneously 3 3 plugging rate and effect of sa fe the concentrations of sulfate in the influent and effluent as well as the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column were recorded daily with results summarized in table 1 the data were recorded only until day 9 because of the complete switch of water from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column fig 3 the concentration of sulfate in the influent was higher than that in the effluent which was attributed to the reduction by srb before the water flow switched directions the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column was about 90 ml d 1 and then decreased from day 8 according to the difference in concentration between sulfates the rate of sulfate reduction could be calculated table 1 shows that the rate increased from 2 24 mg s h 1 to 2 76 mg s l 1 h 1 during the first 3 days and then remained relatively stable until day 8 which was approximately 38 lower than that in column set 2 i e no iron salt addition data not shown zhang et al 2009 also showed a similar decrease of sulfate reduction rate with iron addition indicating that the addition of iron salt could directly reduce not only sulfide by forming insoluble precipitate but the sulfate reduction rates as well the reason is that metallic ions including iron have been widely reported to inhibit on pure strains and mixed cultures of srb utgikar et al 2002 after the column experiment the coarse sand columns were subjected to destructive sampling and characterized by sem the pure sand showed a smooth surface with no attachment before treatment fig 5 a however the sand from the coarse sand column showed many precipitates attached on the surface fig 5b after magnifying the red circle marked in fig 5b numerous nanoparticles with a diameter of about 200 nm were found fig 5c edx analysis of the red rectangle in fig 5c indicated that s and fe were the main elements fig 5e which is consistent with the composition of fes the enlargement of the precipitates of the blue circle marked in fig 5b exhibited the aggregation of microorganisms e g srb as indicated by the blue arrow fig 5d the srb were surrounded by organic matter it was assumed that the organic matter was sa or eps secreted by srb the attachment was composed of fes nanoparticles srb and sa or eps which caused plugging in the coarse sand column 3 4 fes distribution and sulfur balance the distribution of fe ii in the coarse sand column and fine sand column was determined after destructive sampling the amount of fe ii as a function of the distance from the inlet is shown in fig s2 the amount of fe ii at the first 3 cm was 0 90 mmol in the coarse sand column comprising approximately 81 of the total amount of fe ii 1 11 mmol precipitated in the column and it decreased gradually with the increase in distance from the inlet precipitation occurred near the column inlet which was consistent with earlier studies that employed calcium carbonate to plug a column in the fine sand column a small amount of fe ii was detected which was attributed to the residual fecl2 in the medium in the absence of a black fes precipitation to determine the location of sulfur its balance was calculated in column set 1 and listed in table 2 the amount of sulfate that remained in the coarse sand column was recorded daily based on the difference between the influent and the effluent the total amount of sulfate that remained was 1 53 mmol this finding suggested that the sulfate was completely reduced to sulfide clearly the sulfide did not transform completely to fes precipitation and existed in three states dissolved sulfide in solution gaseous sulfide in h2s and precipitated sulfide in fes precipitate the concentrations of sulfide in solution and gas phases were calculated daily according to the volume of the effluent table 1 and h2s collecting bag 500 ml consequently the theoretical amount of sulfide in fes was calculated by deducting the amount of sulfide in solution and gas phases from the consumed sulfate species the calculated total sulfide in fes was 1 19 mmol indicating that sulfide mainly existed in the form of fes precipitation in the fe distribution experiment the amount of fe ii was determined the total amount of fes was equal to the amount of fe ii 1 11 mmol fig s2 interestingly the theoretical amount of fes 1 19 mmol on the basis of the sulfur balance was nearly equal to the actual fes precipitation on the basis of the fe ii measurement 1 11 mmol this finding implied that all reduced sulfate was transformed to fes precipitation and controlled sulfide effectively 3 5 oil recovery and produced water a sand column oil saturated recovery experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of sa fe on oil recovery owing to the water flooding through the coarse sand column the oil volume from the coarse sand column increased gradually in the first four days prior to plugging finally about 18 2 0 6 ml oil 20 ml in total in the coarse sand column was recovered and the percentage of oil recovery was only 46 3 2 of the total oil in the two columns 40 ml fig 6 as the fes was generated the coarse sand column was plugged continuously that brought the water flow diversion from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column therefore the volume of oil recovered from the fine sand column increased to 15 6 0 9 ml oil on day 8 and was flushed out from the fine sand column on day 15 the final percentage of oil recovery rose from 46 3 2 to 85 3 0 fig 6 which apparently benefited from sa fe for enhancing oil recovery as a consequence oil normalized produced water can be calculated basing the volume of oil and produced water figs 3 and 6 that decreased from 70 1 4 0 to 37 5 1 3 ml water ml oil due to the application of sa fe the fes precipitation generated in situ could effectively plug preferential flow paths allowing water to pass through low permeability zones to improve sweep efficiency and carried oil with it the generated fes is a kind of biomineral with a rather low solubility ksp 6 3 10 18 and thus is highly stable and unaffected under extreme environment except for extreme acid conditions several previous studies have focused on this biomineral for eor such as fe oh 3 and caco3 wu et al 2017a zhu et al 2013 compared with these biominerals fes can be easily formed because of the ubiquity of srb in reservoirs microorganisms were used to enhance oil recovery in previous studies on the basis of biomass plugging and metabolites e g biosurfactant acid and gas secreted by microorganisms surasani et al 2013 brown 2010 however conventionally the microorganisms were introduced to the oil reservoir ex situ which inevitably affected the ecosystem of reservoirs meanwhile the nutrients were injected into the reservoir to activate indigenous microorganisms this technique was expected to involve a large amount of waste in addition to environmental pollution and thus was not cost effective in the present study the srb are indigenous and nutrients do not need to be injected fes precipitation also existed in the form of nanoparticles which was attributed to the stabilized effect of sa to prevent aggregation of fes wu et al 2017c research on the application of nanoparticles used for eor has also been widely reported in recent years ehtesabi et al 2015 moghaddam et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the nanoparticles could reduce the surface tension and improve the degree of wettability between oil and rocks owing to the high specific surface area and interfacial energy of nanoparticles which eased flushing out the oil 3 6 implication sulfide production and oilfield produced water present challenges to the oil industry to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to achieve sulfide control and reduction of produced water simultaneously by using sa fe in oil exploitation high concentration iron is crosslinked into sa which can effectively prevent wasting iron particularly on a large scale moreover sa fe can be injected in the direction of the targeted high permeability reservoir to reduce unwanted plugging the size of sa fe can be adjusted to the specific reservoir so that the sa fe can be accessible to the different pores the crosslinked iron reacted with sulfide to form fes precipitates in the reservoir that can reduce the amount of sulfide and plug the high permeability paths this sa fe can be potentially used in co2 sequestration and storage which can effectively control the greenhouse effect rao and rubin 2002 subsurface fractures may provide leakage pathways for geologically sequestered co2 phillips et al 2013 sa fe can react with sequestrated co2 to form feco3 precipitates sa fe can also prevent the oxidation of crosslinked fe ii wu and zeng 2018 on the one hand feco3 can lead to co2 gas mineralization on the other hand the formed feco3 precipitates can achieve fracture sealing to prevent co2 leakage phillips et al 2016 therefore sa fe can be potentially used in fracture sealing and gas mineralization however it should be noted that our study only reported a short term phenomenon that the formation of fes precipitates decreased sulfide production and plugged the coarse sand column to enhance oil recovery generally the long term column experiment should be performed to observe the performance of microbial fes however fes precipitates are commonly stable except for under extreme acidic conditions ph 3 that do not occur frequently in oil reservoirs in this study the ph of effulent was slightly alkaline ph 7 5 table 1 accordingly the microbial fes precipitates could plug the coarse sand column consistently in addition as a biodegradable substrate sa can be decomposed to small molecular organics which may be more favorable for srb than petroleum hydrocarbon to enhance sulfide formation by srb therefore the long term column experiment that simulates the real oil reservoir environment should be performed to observe the effect of sa decomposition on the sulfide formation by srb 4 conclusions in this study sa fe was used to control sulfide and reduce produced water that are considered as environmental challenges in the oil industry the main outcomes were generation of fes precipitates led to decreases of sulfide in the gas phase by 45 3 2 and in the aqueous solution by 75 4 7 the generated fes nanoparticles and sulfate reducing bacteria attached on the surface of the sand in the coarse sand column to plug the pores that caused the water flow to switch from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column an improvement in oil recovery from 46 2 6 to 85 3 0 was observed in the sand column oil saturated recovery experiment produced water

18959,sulfide production and oilfield produced water are considered as environmental challenges in the oil industry iron crosslinked sodium alginate sa fe was used to address these problems simultaneously a pair of columns containing one coarse sand column and one fine sand column was designed to simulate heterogeneous rock layers and evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe generation of fes precipitates led to decreases of sulfide in the gas phase by 45 3 2 and in the aqueous solution by 75 4 7 the generated fes nanoparticles and sulfate reducing bacteria attached on the surface of the sand in the coarse sand column to plug the pores that caused the water flow to switch from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column analysis of fes distribution indicated that the column inlet was effectively plugged by fes the theoretical amount of fes 1 19 mmol that was determined based on sulfur balance was nearly equal to the actual amount of fes precipitation 1 11 mmol additionally water viscosity increased from 0 9 mpa s to 342 mpa s induced by the collapse of sa fe gels which reduced the difference in viscosity between oil and water to avoid viscous fingering as a consequence the oil recovery improved from 46 2 6 to 85 3 0 in the sand column oil saturated recovery experiment which contributed to the decrease of oil normalized produced water from 70 1 4 0 to 37 5 1 3 ml water ml oil therefore this study shows that sa fe exhibits potential for application in controlling sulfide as well as reducing produced water graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron crosslinked sodium alginate sulfide control oilfield produced water reduction fes volume sweep efficiency biopluging 1 introduction oil is likely to continue being the dominant source of energy worldwide through 2030 abas et al 2015 sulfide production in oil exploitation is a serious concern because it causes detrimental problems such as malodors health hazards and corrosion washio et al 2005 beauchamp et al 1984 ren et al 2005 hessel et al 1997 which inevitably lead to environmental issues and high costs sulfide is mediated by the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb present primarily in the reservoir nemati et al 2001 different approaches to controlling sulfide production have been proposed srb activity is typically inhibited by treatment of injection water with biocides e g glutaraldehyde and cocodiamines and nitrate nitrite greene et al 2006 xue and voordouw 2015 the introduction of these chemicals may lead to groundwater contamination and entail high costs for the oil industry nas and berktay 2006 lin et al 2008 okafor and ogbonna 2003 in the wastewater treatment industry the detriment from sulfide production also presents a problem carrera et al 2016 considerable amount of researches were conducted on sulfide control gutierrez et al 2008 ganigue et al 2011 addition of metallic salts has been reported to achieve sulfide precipitation by forming highly insoluble metallic sulfide precipitates thereby decreasing the amount of sulfide available for release to the atmosphere zhang et al 2008 2009 these studies involved iron salts e g fe iii and fe ii which can effectively reduce dissolved sulfide from wastewater to form fes precipitates zhang et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 therefore this method provides a basis for the treatment of injection water with iron salts for oil production to control sulfide however the directionless penetration of injection iron solution is wasteful and results in unwanted plugging of the reservoir therefore a more cost effective and targeted method should be highly beneficial for iron addition for some mature oilfields secondary recovery is the main stage that uses water flushing to enhance oil recovery thus vast quantities of process water has been consumed and consequently vast amounts of wastewater has been generated produced water a mixture of different organic and inorganic compounds is the largest waste stream generated in oil industries and effect of discharging produced water on the environment has lately become a significant issue of environmental concern sheikhyousefi et al 2017 ahmadun et al 2009 produced water is conventionally treated through different chemical xu et al 2008 physical murray gulde et al 2003 and biological methods campos et al 2002 for example weschenfelder et al 2015 reported that microfiltration process enabled the treatment and reuse of produced water using ceramic membranes lu et al 2009 conducted on a hydrolysis acidification bio contact oxidation system to treat oilfield produced water with high salinity all aforementioned methods focused on the treatment of produced water it may be an alternative method to reduce the production of produced water from the origin which is to use less water to recover more oil therefore how to enhance oil recovery is the key of reducing oilfield produced water in the secondary oil recovery long term water flooding generally causes poor sweep efficiency because of preferential flow paths wu et al 2017a these factors necessitate tertiary or enhanced oil recovery eor including chemically and microbially assisted methods polymer flooding is a well established technique for addressing the aforementioned problem enhancing oil recovery with the application for more than 40 years abidin et al 2012 however the high cost and poor shear resistance involved in this technique have yet to be addressed microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances epss e g bioclogging as effective methods to reduce permeability have been demonstrated in previous mathematical models and experiments ezeuko et al 2011 surasani et al 2013 thullner 2010 stewart and fogler 2001 which require necessary nutrients leading to high costs meanwhile bioclogging is not secure because of the complexity of the underground environment therefore various biominerals such as caco3 and fe oh 3 have been proposed to reduce the permeability and thus redirect the displacement fluid into previously bypassed portions of the reservoir our previous study that relied on caco3 to achieve eor was conducted wu et al 2017a zhu et al 2013 used anaerobic nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation to form fe oh 3 biominerals to plug the large flow channel for promoting oil recovery in our previous study the polysaccharide sodium alginate

et al 1967 rees and welsh 1977 it is composed of a 1 4 linked block polymer of polyglucuronate polymannuronic acids contact between an alginate solution and divalent cations causes gelation liu et al 2012 the crosslinked divalent cation is dispersed homogeneously in the gel and wrapped by organic matrix once the crosslinked divalent cation is lost the gel collapses and again forms a viscous sa solution given its aforementioned nature sa can be used potentially as iron crosslinked sa sa fe for the oil industry thus this study was aimed at using sa fe to control sulfide production and reduce oilfield produced water simultaneously three column sets were established to measure sulfide production in these column experiments and evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe according to the direction of the water flow sulfide production and water viscosity were also recorded the column was subjected to destructive sampling to study the distribution of fes precipitation in the coarse sand column in addition a sand column oil saturated recovery experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of sa fe on oil recovery and then calculate the oil normalized produced water this study presents a potential application of sa fe in reducing the pollution of sulfide and produced water in oil exploitation 2 material and methods 2 1 microorganisms and cultivation desulfovibrio vulgaris nbrc 104121 a sulfate reducing bacterium was purchased from the national institute of technology and evaluation of japan it was first anaerobically cultivated in a serum bottle up to the stationary phase at 37 c with nbrc medium 1021 which consisted of the following 0 5 g l k2hpo4 1 g l nh4cl 1 g l na2so4 0 1 g l cacl2 2h2o 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 2 g l sodium lactate 1 g l yeast extract 1 mg l resazurin and 10 g l thioglycolate solution 0 1 g sodium thioglycolate and 0 1 g ascorbic acid were dissolved to 10 ml distilled water sterilized by filtration the ph of medium was 7 5 all chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china without further purification 2 2 preparation of sa fe up to 10 0 mmol fecl2 was dissolved into 50 ml purged distilled water that was purged with n2 99 for 20 min 0 1 g of sa was dissolved with 5 ml purged distilled water to obtain a 2 sa viscous solution the resulting solution was magnetically stirred until complete dissolution in an anaerobic glove box containing 5 hydrogen and 95 nitrogen subsequently a syringe with a needle of a diameter of 1 mm was used to collect the sa viscous solution and 5 ml of the sa solution was added into the fecl2 solution when the two solutions are in contact pellets immediately formed which is referred to as sa fe in this study after crosslinking for 12 h the sa fe was taken out and rinsed three times with purged distilled water to remove the adsorbed fecl2 the amount of crosslinked fe ii in sa fe was measured by adding 50 ml of 1 mol l hcl solution to the sa fe followed by ultrasonic oscillation for 10 min the solution was removed to evaluate the concentration of fe ii after 12 h of immersion thus the amount of crosslinked fe ii in sa fe was calculated 2 3 column experiments the oil reservoir is commonly consisted of high permeability and low permeability rock layer youssef et al 2009 thus the pair columns were constructed where the course sand column and the fine sand olumn were used to simulate the high permeability and low permeability rock layer respectively to demonstrate the performance of sa fe in sulfide control and volume sweep efficiency three pairs of columns with each pair referred to as a set were established each column set contained a fine sand column and a coarse sand column which were operated in parallel fig 1 each column was a 50 ml glass column 2 84 cm in internal diameter and 8 00 cm in length with a rubber plug fig 1 filled with sand and other materials as described below commonly different sizes of sand with the range from 0 01 to 3 mm were employed in the column experiments zhu et al 2013 eryuruk et al 2015 nemati and voordouw 2003 in the first set of columns column set 1 the fine sand glass column contained pure fine sand with a size of 0 5 mm in contrast the coarse sand column was first loaded with 10 ml sa fe pellet with a 2 mm diameter which was topped up with 40 ml coarse sand 2 mm the size distributions of fine sand and coarse sand are presented in fig s1 this latter configuration was used to simulate the introduction of sa fe into the high permeability reservoir the sand hefei cheng ming environmental protection technology co ltd china had been immersed in 3 mol l hcl for 12 h and then rinsed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached before the sand was loaded into the column gauze 32s 32s 40 40 was placed on both ends of the column to prevent the sand from leaking out the columns were tightly packed by regularly tapping the column to increase particle sedimentation and exclude gas bubbles the basic column parameters are presented in table s1 the porosity and permeability of coarse sand were 39 5 and 12 9 darcy respectively which were apparently higher than the counterpart of fine sand i e 36 1 and 1 3 darcy the columns were sterilized 121 c 20 min and were supplied with 20 ml of srb suspension od600 0 8 followed by cultivation for 12 h without medium flow to facilitate cell attachment zhu et al 2013 the srb suspension completely flowed through the coarse sand column when pumped through the set because of the difference in permeability between the fine sand and coarse sand table s1 subsequently the growth medium was continuously fed into the columns at 3 75 ml h with a bt100 1l peristaltic pump longer pump china a collecting bottle was used to monitor the daily volume of effluent from each column the concentrations of sulfate and sulfide in the influent and effluent were measured daily using methods to be further described to calculate the amount of fes precipitation and the rate of reduction gaseous hydrogen sulfide was collected daily using a 500 ml aluminum foil gas collecting bag and its concentration was measured by methylene blue spectrophotometry fogo and popowsky 1949 as controls column set 2 and column set 3 were set up operated and monitored similarly with the following differences from column set 1 the coarse sand column in column set 2 was filled with coarse sands only i e without sa fe but was fed with the medium containing fecl2 in order to obtain the comparable performance in sulfide control and plugging of coarse sand a high concentration of fecl2 2 5 g l was used in column set 2 column set 3 was configured as column set 2 but fed with the pure medium without fecl2 more detailed description of column set 1 set 2 and set 3 can be found in table s2 unless otherwise stated all of the above column experiments were carried out under 1atm and 25 c the coarse sand column in the experimental group i e column set 1 was subjected to destructive sampling for characterization and analysis at the end of the aforementioned experiment the sand samples were cut with a saw into six segments each 1 cm long and labeled 1 6 from the inlet to the outlet a small sand sample from segment 1 was analyzed with fe sem each of the six segments of the sand sample was immersed in 50 ml 10 v v hcl for 12 h in a glove box 5 hydrogen and 95 nitrogen prior to determining the concentration of fe ii the mass of fe ii in each column was then calculated 2 4 oil recovery experiment the oil recovery experiment was performed in column set 4 fig 1 the coarse sand column contained 40 ml of coarse sand and 10 ml of sa fe and the fine sand column contained 50 ml of fine sand table s2 the columns were operated and monitored as described for column set 1 and in our previous studies wu et al 2017a 2017b specifically 20 ml of machine oil shell helix ultra 5w 40 netherlands was mixed with coarse sand and the mixture of oil and coarse sand was introduced to the coarse sand column similarly another 20 ml of machine oil was mixed with fine sand and the mixture of oil and fine sand was introduced to the fine sand column subsequently waterflooding was used to flush the oil saturated columns at 3 75 ml h until no oil was detected in the effluent the volume of oil recovered from each column was measured this process simulated the secondary oil recovery that used water to flush oil out after the waterflooding 20 ml of srb suspension od600 0 8 was introduced to the column set after cultivation for 12 h to facilitate cell attachment the column set was flooded with a sterile growth medium by using a peristaltic pump till the end of oil recovery experiment the volume of oil recovered from each column was measured daily in the measuring cylinder by adding nacl to separate the oil water mixture unless otherwise stated all of the above column experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 5 chemical analysis and instrumental characterization fe ii concentration was detected by spectrophotometry using o phenanthroline that has been reported in previous researches leupin et al 2005 wu et al 2017c specifically fe ii was sampled and mixed with 1 ml of acetate buffer and 0 4 ml of o phenanthroline then quantified by uv vis spectrophotometry aoe uv 1900 aoe instruments china at 510 nm after 10 min sulfide ion was detected by spectrophotometry using 4 amino dimethylaniline and detailed description can be found in a previous study wang et al 2009 hydrogen sulfide was trapped by 1 mol l zinc acetate solution then the white zinc sulfide precipitate was measured according to the above described method thereby determining the concentration of hydrogen sulfide fogo and popowsky 1949 the concentration of sulfate was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 usa equipped with an as19 column and an electrical conductivity detector unless otherwise stated the influent and effluent were taken triplicate and each sample was measured twice to avoid the mis estimation due to the sampling or solution dilution field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and energy dispersive x ray edx analysis were conducted on a jeol jsm 6700f microscope jeol japan a thin film of gold was used to increase the conductivity of the samples for sem a rotational rheometer ar g2 ta instruments usa and a cone and plate test section were used for the viscosity measurements over a wide range of shear rate from 0 5 to 1000 1 s particle size distribution was analyzed with khkq 100 granulometer nanjing kehuan co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfide production a previous study demonstrated that the concentrations of thiosulfate and sulfite in all reactors were not significant 0 5 mg s l and that all of the sulfate reduced was converted to sulfide zhang et al 2009 accordingly only sulfide as the reductive product of sulfate was measured sulfide production in the column experiments was recorded the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the gas phase is shown in fig 2 a when fe ii was not added to the medium i e column set 3 the concentration of h2s gas quickly increased to 2184 ppmv on day 4 however it increased to only about 674 ppmv during the first 3 day and then increased slowly until day 6 in column set 1 in which sa fe was used subsequently the concentration of h2s abruptly increased to 1299 ppmv it may be assumed that the crosslinked fe ii was exhausted at this time resulting in the rapid increase in hydrogen sulfide concentration therefore sa fe induced a decrease in the production of h2s by 45 3 2 relative to that in column set 3 in column set 2 i e the medium containing fecl2 the concentration of h2s increased slowly until it reached a final concentration of 519 ppmv which was lower than that in column set 1 sulfide in the solution increased quickly to about 48 mg l without fe ii addition in column set 3 fig 2b in comparison sulfide increased slowly to 6 86 mg l in column set 1 until fe ii was exhausted before day 6 and then increased to 12 1 mg l fig 2b thus the sulfide in the solution decreased by 85 3 0 as a result of the sa fe treatment compared with that in column set 1 the concentration of sulfide in column set 2 showed minor difference the different ratios between gas and liquid phases could be related to different transfer rates previous studies have reported that iron salts are good candidates to control sulfide particularly in sewers pikaar et al 2014 lin et al 2017 used electrochemical oxidation of iron and generation of alkalinity to achieve an average sulfide removal efficiency of 95 4 4 4 which indicated that the addition of iron salt addition was an alternate method in the oil industry in column set 1 only 1 12 mmol fe ii was crosslinked in sa fe according to the measurement and it means that at most 1 12 mmol fe ii was injected to the column in comparison 619 ml of solution containing 2 5 g l fecl2 flowed through the coarse sand column in column set 2 fig 3 which means that at least 27 6 mmol of fe ii was injected to the column however the short hydraulic residence time 5 h resulted that most of the fe ii was flushed out from the column before its precipitation as the form of fes table s3 the amount of fe ii used in column set 2 was much higher than in column set 1 which resulted in the comparable sulfide control performance this means that some of the fe ii was wasted in column set 2 in column set 1 the fe ii was crosslinked into the sa thus the sa fe can be injected directionally to the highly permeable regions that prevents wasting of fe ii 3 2 effluent profile and viscosity change the effluent profile in column set 1 was determined to evaluate the plugging effect of sa fe fig 3a in the first 8 days water flowed completely through the coarse sand column and nearly no water flowed through the fine sand column because of the higher porosity and permeability of the coarse sand table s1 the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column increased continuously to about 800 ml before a variation in the flow direction was observed the flow direction switched from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column on day 8 until it ultimately switched completely to the fine sand column water subsequently began to flow through the fine sand column and the volume of effluent from the fine sand column increased to about 220 ml until the end of the experiment the experiment was terminated due to steady water flowing through the fine sand column in column set 2 water flow direction began to change from coarse sand column to fine sand column on day 6 5 1 5 days earlier than that in column set 1 suggesting that column set 2 had a faster rate of plugging than column set 1 fig 3b however as analyzed above the fecl2 solution used in column set 2 was 27 times higher than that used in column set 1 accordingly the slightly faster rate of plugging in column set 2 than column set 1 would not offset the huge cost of fe ii in column set 3 water flowed completely through the coarse sand column and no any effluent was recoded from the fine sand column which indicated that the coarse sand column was not plugged due to the absence of fe ii fig 3c in column set 1 and column set 2 the water flow direction all changed this finding suggests that the fes precipitates plugged the coarse sand column preventing water from passing though the coarse sand column the viscosity of the effluent from the coarse sand column in column set 1 was evaluated the viscosity of the effluent markedly increased from 0 9 mpa s to 342 mpa s in the first 4 days and then decreased sharply arising from the depletion of sa fe fig 4 a fig 4b shows the viscosity of the effluent as a function of shear rate at different times at a low shear rate exceptionally high viscosity values were obtained as the shear rate increased the effluents appeared as shear thinning liquids that accorded with the sa solution jo and banerjee 2014 yang et al 2009 this result showed that the sa fe gel collapsed to turn into a viscous sa solution because the crosslinked fe ii reacted with sulfide in the secondary recovery stage viscous fingering is also an inevitable problem that leads to poor sweep efficiency in waterflooding the propagation and early breakthrough of injected water occur because of the viscous difference between water and oil that reduces sweep efficiency and the oil recovery homsy 1987 tan and homsy 1992 water soluble polymers are commonly used to reduce the mobility of injecting fluid during waterflooding which has been studied extensively in the laboratory and tested widely in the field chang 1978 needham and doe 1987 therefore the increase of viscosity induced from sa solution could address the viscous fingering simultaneously 3 3 plugging rate and effect of sa fe the concentrations of sulfate in the influent and effluent as well as the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column were recorded daily with results summarized in table 1 the data were recorded only until day 9 because of the complete switch of water from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column fig 3 the concentration of sulfate in the influent was higher than that in the effluent which was attributed to the reduction by srb before the water flow switched directions the volume of effluent from the coarse sand column was about 90 ml d 1 and then decreased from day 8 according to the difference in concentration between sulfates the rate of sulfate reduction could be calculated table 1 shows that the rate increased from 2 24 mg s h 1 to 2 76 mg s l 1 h 1 during the first 3 days and then remained relatively stable until day 8 which was approximately 38 lower than that in column set 2 i e no iron salt addition data not shown zhang et al 2009 also showed a similar decrease of sulfate reduction rate with iron addition indicating that the addition of iron salt could directly reduce not only sulfide by forming insoluble precipitate but the sulfate reduction rates as well the reason is that metallic ions including iron have been widely reported to inhibit on pure strains and mixed cultures of srb utgikar et al 2002 after the column experiment the coarse sand columns were subjected to destructive sampling and characterized by sem the pure sand showed a smooth surface with no attachment before treatment fig 5 a however the sand from the coarse sand column showed many precipitates attached on the surface fig 5b after magnifying the red circle marked in fig 5b numerous nanoparticles with a diameter of about 200 nm were found fig 5c edx analysis of the red rectangle in fig 5c indicated that s and fe were the main elements fig 5e which is consistent with the composition of fes the enlargement of the precipitates of the blue circle marked in fig 5b exhibited the aggregation of microorganisms e g srb as indicated by the blue arrow fig 5d the srb were surrounded by organic matter it was assumed that the organic matter was sa or eps secreted by srb the attachment was composed of fes nanoparticles srb and sa or eps which caused plugging in the coarse sand column 3 4 fes distribution and sulfur balance the distribution of fe ii in the coarse sand column and fine sand column was determined after destructive sampling the amount of fe ii as a function of the distance from the inlet is shown in fig s2 the amount of fe ii at the first 3 cm was 0 90 mmol in the coarse sand column comprising approximately 81 of the total amount of fe ii 1 11 mmol precipitated in the column and it decreased gradually with the increase in distance from the inlet precipitation occurred near the column inlet which was consistent with earlier studies that employed calcium carbonate to plug a column in the fine sand column a small amount of fe ii was detected which was attributed to the residual fecl2 in the medium in the absence of a black fes precipitation to determine the location of sulfur its balance was calculated in column set 1 and listed in table 2 the amount of sulfate that remained in the coarse sand column was recorded daily based on the difference between the influent and the effluent the total amount of sulfate that remained was 1 53 mmol this finding suggested that the sulfate was completely reduced to sulfide clearly the sulfide did not transform completely to fes precipitation and existed in three states dissolved sulfide in solution gaseous sulfide in h2s and precipitated sulfide in fes precipitate the concentrations of sulfide in solution and gas phases were calculated daily according to the volume of the effluent table 1 and h2s collecting bag 500 ml consequently the theoretical amount of sulfide in fes was calculated by deducting the amount of sulfide in solution and gas phases from the consumed sulfate species the calculated total sulfide in fes was 1 19 mmol indicating that sulfide mainly existed in the form of fes precipitation in the fe distribution experiment the amount of fe ii was determined the total amount of fes was equal to the amount of fe ii 1 11 mmol fig s2 interestingly the theoretical amount of fes 1 19 mmol on the basis of the sulfur balance was nearly equal to the actual fes precipitation on the basis of the fe ii measurement 1 11 mmol this finding implied that all reduced sulfate was transformed to fes precipitation and controlled sulfide effectively 3 5 oil recovery and produced water a sand column oil saturated recovery experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of sa fe on oil recovery owing to the water flooding through the coarse sand column the oil volume from the coarse sand column increased gradually in the first four days prior to plugging finally about 18 2 0 6 ml oil 20 ml in total in the coarse sand column was recovered and the percentage of oil recovery was only 46 3 2 of the total oil in the two columns 40 ml fig 6 as the fes was generated the coarse sand column was plugged continuously that brought the water flow diversion from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column therefore the volume of oil recovered from the fine sand column increased to 15 6 0 9 ml oil on day 8 and was flushed out from the fine sand column on day 15 the final percentage of oil recovery rose from 46 3 2 to 85 3 0 fig 6 which apparently benefited from sa fe for enhancing oil recovery as a consequence oil normalized produced water can be calculated basing the volume of oil and produced water figs 3 and 6 that decreased from 70 1 4 0 to 37 5 1 3 ml water ml oil due to the application of sa fe the fes precipitation generated in situ could effectively plug preferential flow paths allowing water to pass through low permeability zones to improve sweep efficiency and carried oil with it the generated fes is a kind of biomineral with a rather low solubility ksp 6 3 10 18 and thus is highly stable and unaffected under extreme environment except for extreme acid conditions several previous studies have focused on this biomineral for eor such as fe oh 3 and caco3 wu et al 2017a zhu et al 2013 compared with these biominerals fes can be easily formed because of the ubiquity of srb in reservoirs microorganisms were used to enhance oil recovery in previous studies on the basis of biomass plugging and metabolites e g biosurfactant acid and gas secreted by microorganisms surasani et al 2013 brown 2010 however conventionally the microorganisms were introduced to the oil reservoir ex situ which inevitably affected the ecosystem of reservoirs meanwhile the nutrients were injected into the reservoir to activate indigenous microorganisms this technique was expected to involve a large amount of waste in addition to environmental pollution and thus was not cost effective in the present study the srb are indigenous and nutrients do not need to be injected fes precipitation also existed in the form of nanoparticles which was attributed to the stabilized effect of sa to prevent aggregation of fes wu et al 2017c research on the application of nanoparticles used for eor has also been widely reported in recent years ehtesabi et al 2015 moghaddam et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the nanoparticles could reduce the surface tension and improve the degree of wettability between oil and rocks owing to the high specific surface area and interfacial energy of nanoparticles which eased flushing out the oil 3 6 implication sulfide production and oilfield produced water present challenges to the oil industry to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to achieve sulfide control and reduction of produced water simultaneously by using sa fe in oil exploitation high concentration iron is crosslinked into sa which can effectively prevent wasting iron particularly on a large scale moreover sa fe can be injected in the direction of the targeted high permeability reservoir to reduce unwanted plugging the size of sa fe can be adjusted to the specific reservoir so that the sa fe can be accessible to the different pores the crosslinked iron reacted with sulfide to form fes precipitates in the reservoir that can reduce the amount of sulfide and plug the high permeability paths this sa fe can be potentially used in co2 sequestration and storage which can effectively control the greenhouse effect rao and rubin 2002 subsurface fractures may provide leakage pathways for geologically sequestered co2 phillips et al 2013 sa fe can react with sequestrated co2 to form feco3 precipitates sa fe can also prevent the oxidation of crosslinked fe ii wu and zeng 2018 on the one hand feco3 can lead to co2 gas mineralization on the other hand the formed feco3 precipitates can achieve fracture sealing to prevent co2 leakage phillips et al 2016 therefore sa fe can be potentially used in fracture sealing and gas mineralization however it should be noted that our study only reported a short term phenomenon that the formation of fes precipitates decreased sulfide production and plugged the coarse sand column to enhance oil recovery generally the long term column experiment should be performed to observe the performance of microbial fes however fes precipitates are commonly stable except for under extreme acidic conditions ph 3 that do not occur frequently in oil reservoirs in this study the ph of effulent was slightly alkaline ph 7 5 table 1 accordingly the microbial fes precipitates could plug the coarse sand column consistently in addition as a biodegradable substrate sa can be decomposed to small molecular organics which may be more favorable for srb than petroleum hydrocarbon to enhance sulfide formation by srb therefore the long term column experiment that simulates the real oil reservoir environment should be performed to observe the effect of sa decomposition on the sulfide formation by srb 4 conclusions in this study sa fe was used to control sulfide and reduce produced water that are considered as environmental challenges in the oil industry the main outcomes were generation of fes precipitates led to decreases of sulfide in the gas phase by 45 3 2 and in the aqueous solution by 75 4 7 the generated fes nanoparticles and sulfate reducing bacteria attached on the surface of the sand in the coarse sand column to plug the pores that caused the water flow to switch from the coarse sand column to the fine sand column an improvement in oil recovery from 46 2 6 to 85 3 0 was observed in the sand column oil saturated recovery experiment produced water
