8720,many countries use a single water meter for multiple units within a building this creates a cost externality where the cost of water consumed is spread over all units using administrative data from tehran water and wastewater co for 2013 and 2014 we find an increase in the number of units on a communal meter on average increases per unit use by 0 4 estimation at different levels of units reveals that almost all communal meters have higher per unit water use the results suggest that removing this externality could save 2 7 water consumption in our sample keywords communal metering cost externality residential water jel classification l9 q25 q50 q58 1 introduction many countries use a single water meter for multiple apartments within a building boston new york paris and berlin traditionally had a single meter per building 2 under communal metering the cost of water consumed by a unit is borne by all units served by the same meter this cost externality creates an incentive for multi unit subscribers to increase their consumption in response to this problem in some australian states sub metering of individual apartments has been made compulsory to allow landlords charge tenants based on consumption 3 given the high cost of residential water supply and potential water savings from installing individual meters it is important to quantify the magnitude of the cost externality arising from multi unit metering there is however little empirical evidence on this issue to the best of our knowledge the only study that tries to estimate the impact of moving to individual metering is 4 this paper studies seville metropolitan area using aggregate data and finds that installation of individual metering is responsible for 1 5 reduction in water consumption our paper is the first empirical study that uses billing data to measure this cost externality in iran almost all residential water consumption is metered however multi unit meters are quite common and only recently some new developments started to install individual meters in tehran multi story buildings containing several apartments are common quite often the water consumption of a whole building is measured via a single mechanical meter in our data we observe all bills issued to water subscribers in two districts of tehran over a period of two years a subscriber is equivalent to a meter that is installed on the water pipe that enters the property the water bill registers the number of separate apartments units served through a meter our results show that an increase in registered number of units results in 0 4 increase in monthly per unit water use this effect is significant at 1 level and is quite robust to several specification tests once we allow for a flexible specification we observe that moving from a single unit meter to a two unit meter increases per unit water consumption by 1 similarly per unit water use for seven unit subscribers is on average 4 higher than single unit users adding up the extra consumption due to the cost externality we observe that 4 1 million cubic meters of water could be saved over a month by a move to individual metering this constitutes 2 7 of total monthly water use in our sample the remaining of the paper is structured as follows in next section we provide a brief review of the literature section 3 formulates a simple model to better explain the cost externality from multi unit metering in section 4 we explain the data section 5 discusses the research method and regression results section 6 concludes 2 literature review this paper is influenced by the extensive research that studies water resources from the perspective of a common good 8 coined the term tragedy of commons to highlight the race to use shared and unregulated resources which leads to overuse and depletion there are however abundant examples where communities voluntarily cooperate to organize and regulate common resources to avoid depletion 11 common pool resources cprs are defined as assets where exclusion of others is costly and exploitation by one user reduces available resources to others a group can own and manage cprs while excluding others from the resources 1 1 several papers study the crps and focus on the governing institutional frameworks for example 12 in water supply 10 in coal industry 1 in forest management the externality we identify in this paper is somewhat similar to the tragedy of commons except that households residing in adjacent units might have long run relationships and hence better incentives to share costs our paper also speaks to the literature on the impact of non price variables on water demand for example 13 study residential water demand in california and examine the impact of non price demand side management policies across eight urban water agencies they attempt to capture the endogeneity of marginal price and virtual income by estimating two reduced form price equations 9 discuss that the simple ols cannot address the price endogeneity and propose a structural estimation approach information on household consumption and other characteristics including wealth income family size age and numbers of bedrooms allow them to estimate deep parameters and to conduct several counterfactual scenarios the final branch of the literature that our paper relates to is the set of papers that try to come up with optimal metering strategies in urban areas these studies are primarily motivated by new initiatives to introduce full water metering in england and wales 2 2 two third of homes in england and wales are unmetered by 2011 2 5 studies the optimal number of meters and pricing schemes under various systems including rateable value universal metering optimal metering and decentralized metering his main finding is that in all types of metering bar rateable metering the optimal price has to equal marginal cost and the optimal number of meters would be determined endogenously similarly 6 analyzes the provision of free meters in england and wales he finds that the social benefit of meters is higher the higher the elasticity of demand furthermore he concludes that metering should be compulsory when the regulator has limited information on household characteristics and when large households are reluctant to install meters an empirical example that tests these theories is 7 they compare the distributional impact of eleven hypothetical water tariff options for high and low income households our paper sheds new light on the externality that might arise if households do not face the price of what they consume 3 conceptual model we define the total volume of water consumed by all users served by a meter as a common pool where none of the users can be excluded from 3 3 exclusion of a unit from water use requires court order and joint action by all other residents therefore in our context exclusion is too costly and rarely takes place in contrast to the literature that exploitation by a user reduces available resources to others in our case the consumption of a unit increases the cost of other units and there is no limitation on total resources notwithstanding we do not need to take into account the dynamic nature of the water reserve because consumption of a resident is unlikely to exploit total water resources in a city in our model there are n units households 4 4 we have no information on the number of households individuals served by a meter but most often a single household lives in a unit apartment house we use the term household and unit interchangeably served by a single water subscription i e use the same meter take u q i x i to be the utility function of household i where q i is water use and x i is consumption of other goods we assume a differentiable increasing concave utility function i e u q u x 0 u q q u x x the subscripts show derivates with respect to the subscripts we further assume that the cross derivative is positive u q x 0 the household maximizes utility subject to her budget constraint 1 max q i x i u q i x i s t p q q i n 1 q i n x i y i where q i is average water consumption of other households excluding i under the same subscription and y i is household income price of other goods is normalized to one and p q is the relative price of water which is a function of average water consumption q q i n 1 q i n and is differentiable 5 5 we have an increasing block pricing for water in iran while price is a step function in expectation we can think of expected price as a differentiable function of quantity household i treats consumption of others as given in this optimization but takes into account the impact of a change in her water quantity on prices the first order condition of optimization is therefore 2 n u q q i y p q q u x q i y p q q p q q p q 0 the solution to 2 characterizes the best response function of household i as a function of other households use condition 2 states that households put n times more weight on marginal utility of water compared to other goods this is because a marginal increase in water consumption costs one n th compared to a marginal increase in expenditure on other goods because households are assumed to be identical we look at the symmetric equilibrium with q i q therefore the first order condition transforms to 3 n u q q y p q q u x q y p q q p q q p q 0 the impact of number of units on equilibrium average water consumption q could be found by implicit differentiation with respect to n 4 d q d n u q n u q q n 1 u q x p p q

assumptions regarding the change in water cost p q q as a result of a change in average quantity if we assume that the water cost increases at an increasing rate as average quantity increases 2 p q q 2 p q q 0 6 6 if we regress average price on per unit water use and its square while controlling for district and monthly date dummies both water quantity and its square have positive significant coefficients then the denominator of 4 becomes negative therefore we derive an increasing relationship between number of units and per unit use the condition for the social optimum is u q q y q u x q y q 0 which results in d q d n s o c i a l p l a n n e r 0 in other words the cost externality in our model leads to a deviation from the socially optimal level of water consumption 4 data we use administrative billing data for all residential water subscribers in districts 1 and 3 of tehran city the data is obtained from tehran province water and wastewater co and contains 2 731 853 observations bills for 195 679 subscribers over 26 consecutive months mainly during 2013 and 2014 a subscription is a water connection with a single meter that could serve multiple units apartments the data also records the number of units for each subscriber after dropping subscribers with a discontinuous billing periods 43 600 subscribers b billing periods shorter than 30 days or longer than 85 days 22800 subscribers c a change in number of units 700 subscribers d number of units greater than 25 1300 subscribers e less than 1 cubic meters or more than 40 cubic meters of per unit use 10 700 subscribers we arrive at a clean sample of 1 748 088 observations for 116 234 subscribers 7 7 we run regressions on the original data file and the results are even stronger for example for the specification in column 5 of table 3 we get 1 3 increase in per unit water use as number of units increases table 1 shows summary statistics for the main variables in our data the average number of units served by a meter is 5 02 with a standard deviation of 4 18 interestingly on average 5 units in berlin and 13 units in paris are served under a subscription 2 per unit use over 30 days is on average 16 81 cubic meters and the average number of billing days is about 44 58 days given low residential water prices in iran the average bill amount is 456 3 thousands rials per unit bill amount over 30 days is 60 5 thousand rials which is about 0 2 of average monthly household expenditure in tehran province during 2014 table 2 shows summary statistics for subscribers with 1 5 and 6 units 16 5 of observations and 18 5 of subscribers record water consumption of single unit meters these subscribers however consume 3 1 of total water used in our sample 62 6 of total water is consumed through meters serving 6 or more up to 25 in our sample units this implies that the economic impact of the externality on water use could be large and meaningful as a first look at the magnitude of the unit externality in the last two columns of table 2 we look at mean and median of per unit water consumption over unit categories both mean and median of per unit water use increase with the number of units for meters serving 1 5 units for meters serving 6 or more units there is a slight incremental decline in per unit use given small standard errors in this table the changes in per unit use are significant but we would need to control for potential confounders before arriving at a firm conclusion 5 method and regression results to test for the hypothesis that per unit water use increases with number of units we estimate the following specification 5 ln q i t α 0 β n i d i n d i d δ t ε i where q i t is the per unit water consumption of subscriber i at time t n i is the number of units and d i n d i d δ t are respectively dummies for unit categories district and monthly date table 3 reports coefficient estimates and standard errors of units variable from regressions that estimate eqn 5 column 1 is the simplest specification and shows that an increase in units is on average associated with 0 88 increase in per unit water use the coefficient is significant at 1 in column 2 we control for district and monthly date dummies and the coefficient of interest barely changes since the number of units served by a meter is constant over time we cannot include subscriber fixed effects in our specifications instead we rely on two other measures to control for potential confounding factors that might be correlated with units and water use first we construct four unit category dummies that are switched on when the number of units falls in 1 5 6 10 11 19 20 25 intervals column 3 shows a larger impact of units when we add unit category dummies this specification essentially looks at the average increase in per unit use in response to an increase in units within intervals constructed by unit categories changing the way unit categories constructed does not affect our results in column 4 we control for bins of three units 8 8 the bins in this example are 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 12 13 15 16 18 19 21 22 24 25 27 with little impact on the coefficient of interest second we divide consumers to quintiles five groups based on average per unit water use during the sample period these fixed effects remove the mean of consumption within each use category and control for price effects 9 9 9 show that marginal prices cannot be used in the estimation of water demand because the existence of block pricing generates a virtual income to households the solution is to estimate a structural framework that carefully models the kinked budget constraints virtual income having data of household income however our dataset lacks the required information to do so the best we can do to solve this problem is to put a dummy for each category of prices this could controls for both marginal prices and virtual income column 5 controls for quintiles of average water use and unit categories here an increase in number of units is associated with 0 4 increase in per unit water use as an alternative we split the sample based on quintiles of average water use and run separate regressions in each sub sample the coefficient estimate for units is always significant and varies between 0 2 and 1 1 with the lowest consumption quintile showing the greatest effect results are not shown in table 3 although it is better to include levels of discrete variables e g units we experiment with a log log specification in column 6 to compare results with column 3 we notice that a one unit change in units is comparable to a 20 increase based on column 6 this change is associated with 1 6 rise in water use which is in the same ball park as 2 2 reported in column 3 the fixed effects included so far control for time invariant differences between subscribers for example subscribers with a larger number of units might have smaller units and hence fewer number of individuals living in those units alternatively subscribers with a larger number of units might be concentrated in poorer neighborhoods to further control for time varying confounders like differential trends in water use for different subscribers we include unit category by month fixed effects in column 7 adding these extra controls has little effect on the estimated effect finally column 8 reports coefficient estimates from a random effects model and finds little change in the estimates the robust coefficient estimates in table 3 suggest there is a causal link between the number of units and per unit water use next we investigate the heterogeneity of responses by estimating a semi saturated regression with a set of dummies for subscribers with 2 9 and 10 and above units fig 1 shows coefficient estimates and 95 confidence intervals for these dummies the regression also includes district dummies and average use quintiles by month dummies average per unit water consumption is significantly higher for multi unit subscribers compared to single unit ones the economic impact is strikingly large a unit on an eight unit meter on average consumes 4 more than a unit on a single unit meter to take the estimated coefficients seriously we can calculate the extra amount of water used due to the cost externality taking the coefficients of 9 unit dummies from the regression shown in fig 1 we calculate that an extra 4 1 million cubic meters of water is used in our sample 2 7 of all water consumption due to the cost externality whether it is economically viable to separate multi unit meters depends on the installation maintenance and reading costs of meters which is beyond the scope of this paper 6 conclusions when several units are served with a single water meter the cost of each unit s water consumption is borne by everyone this results in a cost externality which translates into a positive relationship between number of units and per unit use tehran water billing data shows this cost externality is large and amounts to about 2 7 of water used during our sample period leakage in the distribution network is about 20 of water supplied while the cost externality seems small relative to leakage the cost of dealing with this externality might be much smaller low cost measurement technologies exist that could be installed on the pipes entering each unit this provides a rationale for incentivizing separation of meters

8721,do better performing water user associations improve on farm water management using data from pakistan we find that better water user association performance in a community is associated with higher water use efficiency of member farmers mean on farm water use efficiency is higher for farmers belonging to communities that more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their representatives in upper tier management participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution while these results provide a sanguine view of the outcome of devolution

reminds us that the social aspects of irrigation e g compliance with rules to share water equitably or collective efforts to maintain canals are just as if not more important for on farm water management than the technical aspects of irrigation in this paper we examine this link statistically we explore the link between performance of farmer groups in managing their local irrigation related public goods and the water use efficiency achieved by member farmers the social organization of irrigation is changing farmer groups have been asked to manage their irrigation systems as national and subnational governments have decentralized irrigation systems and given greater responsibility to farmers in its management 6 31 34 under the reforms known variously as irrigation management transfer imt participatory irrigation management pim or farmer managed irrigation systems fmis responsibility is transferred from governments to famers or groups of farmers within water user associations to actively manage local irrigation related resources collect water charges to finance system maintenance and coordinate water use with higher structures in the irrigation system this social and institutional reorganization of irrigation gives us a framework to assess the collective action of farmer groups typically organized in water user associations in managing their local irrigation systems imt is taking place in a context where agricultural productivity gains from the green revolution have petered out 32 particularly for pakistan our case study here there is concern that pakistan will not be able to meet the demands of its growing population because of its low agricultural productivity and overall poor water management a key reason cited for low agricultural productivity is the deterioration of irrigation management 36 there are also concerns that current problems will only be exacerbated as non agricultural water uses grow and compete for already short supplies for agriculture and the melting of the western himalayan glaciers reduce the long term availability of water 18 in fact a strong need for improvement in irrigation management was one of the arguments for imt 36 but have those desired gains in water management materialized there is evidence that communities under differing circumstances and conditions are sometimes able to cooperate to successfully manage the commons 1 29 31 evaluation of farmers performance in their newly appointed irrigation management tasks as well as the factors that contribute to better performance has received some attention for example higher degree of cooperation was found in smaller communities because transactions costs in terms of communication and enforcing agreements were lower 3 5 24 the degree of water scarcity faced by the community members i e salience of the resource was found to be very important very high or very low relative water scarcity lowered community participation 3 24 also a persistent feature of communities performing better in managing local irrigation related public goods was that they had good leaders 13 21 26 nagrah et al 29 studying the pakistani context found a similar pattern presence of educated leadership better state of irrigation infrastructure and higher water scarcity improved community participation these studies compare community collective action outcomes for a variety of resource user characteristics resource characteristics and governance structures and have helped identify several important determinants of successful collective action in irrigation systems but the issue of whether and how water user association performance translates into improved on farm outcomes for farmers has received little attention so far this is the main focus of our paper our first objective is to examine whether the performance of local water user associations has provided on farm water use efficiency gains we use purpose collected primary data from eastern punjab in pakistan these data were also used in nagrah et al 29 in this paper we use a subsample of water user associations studied by nagrah et al 29 and append data collected by additional survey instruments like nagrah et al 29 we measure collective action of farmers in managing their irrigation systems along five domains each of which relates directly to the responsibilities awarded to farmers and their appointed water user association since imt these include maintenance of watercourse channel dispute resolution within the watercourse community collecting seasonal water charges holding internal meetings and electing farmer representatives one of our main results is that we find a positive association between irrigation management by the water user associations and mean water use efficiency in wheat production in the community it is difficult to measure the impact of collective action on farmer outcomes because it is very difficult to find an instrument for community s collective action that is not correlated with farmer s on farm performance both are inextricably linked moreover the timing and location of imt was not randomly selected but based on political and administrative feasibility an ex post study of the impact is plagued with selection bias keeping this difficulty in mind and while understanding the need to evaluate the imt through an on farm water management lens we take the next step our second objective is to explore the mechanism behind the observed positive association between water use efficiency and collective action we find that farmers water use efficiency in a community is strongly and positively correlated i e farmers achieve water management success like their peers in the watercourse community this finding ties directly to the literature on peer effects discussed in section 3 2 which helps us understand the various mechanisms that could generate this result could it be that farmers are learning from and imitating each other in how they manage water on their private farms endogenous peer effects or is it that the community s shared context e g a shared watercourse contextual effects that drives both collective action and water use efficiency due to data limitations we cannot separate the effects of endogenous peer effects and contextual effects on water use efficiency our results suggest that both mechanisms are likely and therefore a causal interpretation of the role of community collective action in individual outcomes should be treated with caution this paper contributes to a relatively thin literature on the effects of community collective action on on farm outcomes we combine ideas from separate strands of litreature on production efficiency peer effects and natural resource governance the focus on water use efficiency is highly relevant for a broader and important policy reason freshwater is highly scarce in this part of the world and it is important to consider whether and how reorganization of irrigation management has played a role in achieving better water management the next section presents a brief outline of the studies that have examined similar questions section 3 outlines a conceptual model section 4 describes the relevant details of the irrigation management system in pakistan and data collection section 5 presents the econometric specification and the results are given in section 6 section 7 concludes with a brief recap of the shortcomings of this study 2 does community collective action in irrigation management bring on farm benefits as the quote from bromley et al 9 at the beginning of the article reminds us on farm water management success can be affected by inter farmer relations this is especially true when water distribution among farmers and management and maintenance of local water infrastructure is the responsibility of the community and its appointed representatives yet the literature on exploring the effect of community s performance action on individual s outcome remains relatively thin and the results are mixed 1 1 effects of change in governance regimes on household production is important in other resource systems most notably in forestry here we focus on studies related to effects of irrigation management on on farm outcomes bandyopadhyay et al 4 compare average rice yield frequency of maintenance activities and irrigation fee collection across 68 irrigation associations in philippines of which 43 underwent imt while 25 did not having access to only post imt data they find that the presence of imt is associated with an increase in maintenance activities and rice yields but no difference is observed in the collection of irrigation fees across the two groups pre existing differences across the two groups which could lead to self selection of an irrigation association into imt or non imt group as well as differences in institutional or infrastructural environment due to the imt are major concerns in interpretation of differences in yields as impacts of imt in order to minimize the effect of selection bias in this comparison bandyopadhyay et al 4 utilize propensity score matching to compare irrigation associations with similar features but cannot rule out that the observed improvement could be confounded by pre existing differences between the two groups wang et al 35 examine farm production income and water savings in northern china finding that water user associations have not been universally successful in either saving water or improving farm incomes and link the performance of water management systems to the incentives that these new institutions provide to water managers closer to our study area although covering a larger geographic extent mekonnen et al 25 examine a sample of 458 farmers from across the pakistani punjab province and found some evidence that seasonal value of per acre crop yield was slightly higher in watercourses where a water user association existed the geographic extent of the data covers regions and canal commands where imt was in different stages and therefore existence of water user association is treated as an endogenous variable the geographic extent of our study area is smaller water user associations exist in all watercourses and we interview multiple farmers per watercourse which allows us to examine the mean and variance of farmer outcomes within a water user association in an earlier study based on data from the mountainous northern pakistan khwaja 21 observed community participation in infrastructure maintenance activities and found that the performance of a community varied in different tasks he raised an interesting possibility that rather than interpreting a community s potential to act collectively as a fixed characteristic of the community as proposed by the concept of social capital features of the project itself are also important in determining whether and how a community can act collectively for example projects that are less technical or complex or those that yield more equitable distribution of returns can be performed well by communities like khwaja 21 we observe the performance of each sample community for five different yet all irrigation related tasks rather than exploring the variation of community performance across tasks the goal for us here is whether and how that performance translates into water use efficiency gains of member farmers 3 conceptual model our goal is to understand the role of collective action in water management in improving farmers on farm water management the choice of a metric for evaluating farmer s on farm water management performance is important we first discuss the measurement relevance and potential shortcomings of our choice of the metric of on farm water management success 3 1 water use efficiency farmers on farm performance is measured in various ways in the literature ranging from physical productivity to more complicated estimates of efficiency bandyopadhyay et al 4 use yield and wang et al 33 use income and farm production and mekonnen et al 25 use revenue per acre as the farm level outcome by productivity we mean a ratio of outputs to inputs such as yield and by efficiency we have in mind a comparison between the observed and some notion of optimal value of outputs and inputs agricultural productivity is defined in several ways throughout the literature including as general output per unit of input e g crop per drop farm yield by crop or total output per hectare and output per worker such physical measures of productivity have a serious deficiency a productivity measure such as tons per hectare only considers the land input and ignores all other inputs such as labor machinery fuel fertilizer pesticide etc the use of this measure in the formulation of management and policy advice is likely to result in excessive use of those inputs that are not included in the efficiency measure 10 11 2 2 productivity is the same as efficiency if using only one factor of production but when multiple inputs are used the issue of i which inputs to consider ii how to aggregate and weight multiple inputs and iii how to determine the optimal production becomes relevant 11 we focus on farm water management success measured by water use efficiency wue water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of minimum feasible to observed use of irrigation water w conditional on the production technology a and other inputs x 20 33 this can be expressed as 1 w u e i m i n λ f x i λ w i z i a y i 0 1 where z i are farmer and farm characteristics such as education and age of the farmer and location of the plot in the irrigation system it provides a precise measure of water management success on the farm by comparing across farmers in the sample wue provides information on how much water use could be decreased by the farmer without altering the output produced and the quantities of other inputs used following convention in the stochastic production frontier literature we calculate wue for each farmer in the sample after estimating a stochastic production frontier 2 7 22 the frontier function represents a best practice technology against which the efficiency of each farmer within the sample can be measured we propose that this approach will provide a better measures of on farm performance than partial measures such as output per unit of labor or land also unlike its counterparts like technical efficiency which is an output oriented measure of inefficiency wue can be used as a left hand side variable in a regression two possible concerns may arise regarding the use of wue first this metric has been developed for contexts where volumetric information on water applied is available in our study area as in many parts of the world precise volume of water applied on the farm is not measured we use number of irrigation turns applied by the farmer alongwith information on depth of irrigation water applied we also account for location of the plot in the irrigation system which helps control for the variation in the water volume received in each irrigation turn to the extent our measure of irrigation water applied has measurement error this remains a shortcoming of our study a second concern may be that while farmers have a strong incentive to increase yields or profits they may not have a strong incentive to maximize water use efficiency especially when there is no marginal price for water we think this concern can be partly or wholly assuaged by the fact that our study area is a highly water scarce region in pakistan it has a hot dry desert climate with precipitation mainly falling in summers not at the time wheat is being grown average annual rain is about 200 mm per year meeting only about 12 of wheat crop requirement which means that growing wheat requires irrigation 30 irrigation water itself is scarce rationed to each plot along the watercourse via a time based water turn rotation 3 3 farmers receive water from a watercourse in proportion to the size of their landholding each farmer has a turn in a weekly or 10 day rotation to draw from the watercourse and turns are fixed specifying the day time and duration of water supply to each irrigator this system to ration the watercourse water supplies amongst the watercourse community is referred to as warabandi and groundwater is saline with some small pockets of useable water in the head or middle reaches of the canals due to canal water seepage for these reasons we believe that farmers in our study area have a strong incentive to achieve high water use efficiency 3 2 role of community collective action in this section we present a framework for understanding the role of community collective action on water use efficiency suppose that a sample of i farmers were distributed randomly across k watercourse communities it would be natural to presume that performance of farmer i in her water management could be affected by not only some pre determined community characteristics such as the distance of the watercourse from the main canal but also the performance of her community in providing and maintaining local irrigated related public goods such as maintaining the watercourse expressing this hypothesis in a linear regression equation 2 w u e ˆ i c γ 0 z i c γ 1 a c γ 2 z c γ 3 e i c where i 1 2 i and c 1 2 k in equation 2 a c is a measure of performance of community c in providing local irrigation related public goods z c are community characteristics such as spatial location in the irrigation system size of the community and z ic are individual characteristics referred to as z i earlier in 1 we add a hat to w u e ˆ i c to indicate that it is an estimate of farmer s wue the coefficient γ 2 is the effect of community performance on farmer performance and our central hypothesis of interest is that γ 2 0 i e successful collective action in community c would be associated with higher wue a difficulty lies in assigning a causal interpretation to γ 2 as the impact of community collective action on farmer s wue as moffitt 27 describes the estimated coefficient of the community level variables γ 2 may be biased due to endogeneity resulting from three reasons i shared context or contextual effects ii endogenous group membership and iii endogenous peer effects for economists the inferential problems in detecting the existence of these contextual and peer effects estimating their magnitude and identification of the channels through which they operate have all been the subject of considerable and long standing discussion 8 14 23 27 one basic assumption made in peer effect frameworks is that individuals interact in groups 27 this means that the population is partitioned in groups and individuals only interact with members of the reference group and with none outside it the reference group in this paper is the watercourse community denoted by c defined by all individuals farming in the geographical boundary of the area irrigated by the watercourse members of the watercourse community live in one or two neighboring villages interactions are thus structured through the sharing of the water in the watercourse maintaining it as well as via myriad other social interactions in the village community ties are reciprocated although in this study we do not observe the frequency or intensity of contact amongst members of the watercourse community contextual effects refer to the fact that farmers in a community c share the same social economic and infrastructure context e g same watercourse water delivery received in the watercourse village schools roads or broadly defined social capital for example a community with higher social capital characterized by trust and cooperation within its members would achieve better a c and may also have higher mean wue in this case γ 2 would capture the benefit of being in community c and not necessarily the benefit of community collective action in that sense both a c and z c are contextual effects for member farmers that are exogenous in the sense that they are pre determined from the farmer s viewpoint but their coefficients capture the benefits of being in community c due to some other underlying and potentially unidentified reasons but not community collective action as such to the extent that we can observe and control contextual variables as additional right hand side variables they do not pose a problem in creating a bias in the estimated γ 2 but it may be impossible to measure everything what is it in the shared context that affects members a special case could be what moffit 27 has called the correlated unobservables and their effect can be seen by examining the error term in 2 if e i c μ c η i c where μ c denotes common effects that are not known or observable or measurable by the researcher this means for two farmers i and j in community c e e i c e j c 0 thereby creating a bias in our estimates of 2 we return to the issue of correlated unobservables the second issue arises if individuals are self selecting into communities that are similar to them then membership in the reference group itself is endogenous this is referred to as endogenous group formation and may result in the researcher observing correlated unobservables or common factors within a community but not due to exogenous but endogenous reasons endogenous community membership i e farmers could self select into communities that are similar to themselves is not a concern for us here because what constitutes for us as a peer group is determined by farmers sharing the use of a watercourse in our study area land markets are thin and community membership is stable because farmers are farming their land for decades endogenous community membership may be a concern if farmers were mobile across watercourse communities the third issue is more challenging endogenous peer effects are related to what manski 23 has referred to as the reflection problem the problem of not being able to disentangle whether or not the average outcome in a group is actually influencing that same outcome at the individual level this could arise because individual member of the community contributes to the expected group outcome due to information spillovers imitation or conformism among members of a group farmers could be learning from each other about how to manage water on the farm a common way to detect endogenous peer effects proposed for this problem is to add a group mean term on the right hand side of 2 23 the group mean captures the social interaction or learning effect of the average outcome in the reference community on an individual s own outcome this modifies equation 2 to 3 w u e ˆ i c α 0 z i c α 1 a c α 2 z c α 3 α 4 j 1 j i n c w u e ˆ j c n c 1 ε i c where j 1 j i n c w u e ˆ j c n c 1 is the average farmer performance in community c excluding farmer i and n c is the size of the watercourse community c the key idea here is that if farmers in community c are benefiting from community collective action α 2 would be positive after controlling for the social interaction effect equations 2 and 3 are our main regression equations of interest in this paper we note here that the problem of correlated unobservables still may plague the identification of peer effects if z c does not fully capture all the relevant contextual effects especially if farmers i and j in community share the context μ c that has not been controlled for in z c as moffitt 27 and bramoullé et al 8 have shown there is no simple methodological answer to these three challenges especially in non experimental cross section data settings we have in this study therefore given our data limitations our objective here is not a separation of contextual and peer effects on water use efficiency but simply to give a framework for the interpretation of a positive α 2 4 study area and data collection 4 1 new institutional forms in the indus basin irrigation system in pakistan in 1997 pakistan s provincial assemblies passed irrigation and drainage acts that transformed the centralized government run irrigation departments into autonomous units and transferred the management responsibility to farmer organizations the stated goals of the decentralization and devolution were to a achieve equity in distribution of water supply b improve cost recovery and c reduce system losses and increasing irrigation efficiency 34 4 4 this section is adapted from nagrah et al 29 the irrigation system in pakistan is a run of the river system where water is diverted from rivers and spread over a very large area about 19 million hectares thus making it the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world the irrigation system itself is like branches of a tree water flows from branch canals into distributaries and then into watercourses the watercourses are the most tertiary part of the system and deliver water to agricultural plots where farmers are bound by scheduled irrigation turns to withdraw water from the watercourse on to their plots although water volume received at each plot is not measured it is well established that location of the agricultural plot in the hierarchical system can affect the volume of water received 9 28 in principle the tail reaches were protected from such built in lower riparian disadvantage by various institutional protections but decrepit infrastructure and water theft in the upstream reaches have increased the inequality in received surface water 26 in our study area formation of all irrigation associations were prompted by the pida act of 1997 by which provincial irrigation departments were transformed into financially autonomous entities referred to as provincial irrigation and drainage authorities in punjab the provincial government structured the authority into area water boards each of which consisted of several farmer organizations fos an fo was to take over the management responsibilities of the secondary canals distributary and consisted of directly elected farmer representatives from each tertiary canal watercourse each of these directly elected members headed their respective watercourse level khal panchayat kp 15 17 see fig 1 for a comparison of the old and the new system a watercourse community consists of all farmers that share a watercourse and resides in one or more neighboring villages the watercourse carries water from the secondary outlet to the farmers fields each watercourse community is governed by a khal panchayat referred to as kp from here onwards khal means watercourse and panchayat refers to the five member governing body and the 1997 pida lays out its responsibilities as 1 maintenance of the watercourse 2 dispute resolution 3 collection of water charges from irrigating farmers on the watercourse 4 hold monthly meetings and 5 participation in distributary level farmer organizations 16 each kp responsibility is a particular form of collective action problem 29 watercourse maintenance refers to removing sediment and weeds from the watercourse channel 5 5 sediment drawn along with the water from the distributary and main canals is deposited on the bed and along the sides of the watercourse resulting in distortion of the cross section and therewith a reduction of its carrying capacity of the watercourse the embankments of the watercourse especially of unlined and earthen watercourses need strengthening to avoid breaches and excessive seepage losses furthermore vegetation in the watercourse hampers the flow of water leading to an inadequate discharge capacity 29 periodic watercourse maintenance a local public good is important for unimpeded water flow to all farmers especially those appropriating water in the tail reaches resolving disputes especially when they are over sharing of water flowing in the watercourse can avoid disruption of the flow of service kp meetings can aid in exchange of information and developing trust as noted by frohlich and oppenheimer 12 individuals do not have complete information in most settings but we can assume that individuals learn more accurate information about the structure of the situation they are in and behavior of others involved when they communicate in repeated situations finally electing upper tier members of the farmer organization can be a direct formal route to voice local concerns at higher level we examine the performance of kp in fulfilling its five responsibilities as a reflection of the degree of collective action within the watercourse community this is our key assumption which enables us to interpret kp performance as the respective community s capacity for self organization and collective action 6 6 we also assume that the stock or the level of local public good matters to the ith farmer s on farm water management success water use efficiency not his private contribution to the public good for example the state of the watercourse matters for him not how much time or money he personally spent in watercourse maintenance in the case of other kp responsibilities such as voting in farmer organizations or collection of water charges it is only the kp chairman who is directly involved in these and not the other farmers in the community therefore we believe this is a reasonable assumption in this context this allows us to ignore the individual farmer s financial or material outlays in meeting kp s responsibilities in the empirical analysis we thank an anonymous referee for pointing this out 4 2 sample selection and data collection our study area is bahawalnagar canal circle bcc in eastern punjab pakistan which is one of the largest canal systems in pakistan with a gross command area of approximately 690 000 ha about 1 7 million acres located in the southeastern part of the punjab it has high water scarcity farmers often rank water shortage as one of the most serious problems facing agricultural production this area is part of a single agro climatic zone so altitude rainfall and temperatures are fairly uniform across farms within this area this study uses a subsample of data used in nagrah 29 with additional data from a farmer level survey instrument 7 7 nagrah et al 29 used a sample of 1845 watercourses across 44 distributaries to collect kp performance data a subsample of 120 watercourses within 35 distributaries was generated to collect detailed production information from sample of farmers within each watercourse the survey sample was calculated using a systematic random sampling method of the total 70 distributaries in bcc 35 distributaries were randomly selected and within each of these 120 watercourses were randomly selected and within each selected watercourse a random sample of farmers was selected 8 8 detailed watercourse farmer lists were used from which a random sample of farmers was chosen in cases where such lists were not readily available approximate lists were prepared by utilizing information available from the patwari s of the watercourse in question on each of the 120 selected watercourses 6 interviews were conducted over the period of 15 july 15 august 2012 5 farmer interviews and 1 kp chairperson interview kp chairperson interview collected information on the kp activities in particular on the duties of kp farmer interviews collected information on production in the two most recent growing seasons rabi winter 2011 12 and kharif summer 2011 both interviews assessed the activities of the kp and physical and socioeconomic environment of the watercourse community to verify the accounts of the kp chairperson 9 9 kps typically do not keep written records the best way to measure their performance is via interviews of the chairperson and the member famers one concern was that kp chairperson could strategically misreport kp performance therefore in a random subsample of watercourses additional farmers were also interviewed for the kp performance the results of the farmers reporting were not significantly different from the kp chairperson response and field team felt confident there was no systematic misreporting of kp activities by the kp chairperson the sample watercourses lie across 3 different canal divisions which vary in their size and state of infrastructure our sample watercourses from head middle and tail reaches of the distributary as well as from the head middle and tail reaches of each watercourse after data cleaning and processing and dropping small watercourses that had most land under one extended family ownership we have a sample of 629 farmers located across 115 watercourses number of farmers in the sample from each watercourse varies 60 of the watercourses 69 watercourses have 6 farmers in the sample 29 of the watercourses 34 watercourses have 5 farmers 9 10 watercourses have 4 farmers in the sample and less than 1 2 watercourses have 3 farmers in the sample table 1 for summary statistics of 629 farmer level variables including farmer characteristics wheat yield and inputs and table 2 for summary statistics of watercourses level variables in our study area water delivered to the plot or even at the head of the watercourse is not metered so data on volume of applied irrigation water is not available we approximate the volume of water used on each farm by recording the number of irrigation turns received by the farmer at the farm gate as well as noting the location of the farm in the head middle tail reach of each primary secondary or tertiary irrigation channel 10 10 in some cases we also recorded the depth of irrigation water applied all farmers are using flood irrigation techniques so the depth of water applied multiplied by irrigated area multiplied by number of irrigation turns gives a measurement for volume of water applied our results do not change significantly by using this measure we therefore report the results with irrigation turns 5 econometric specification 5 1 water use efficiency wue we follow reinhard et al 33 and karigiannis et al 20 in that we first estimate a stochastic production frontier and then use the estimated coefficients to calculate wue of each farmer we estimate the stochastic production frontier for wheat using the translogrithmic production function following battese and broca 7 who found that a translogrithmic production function is a good fit for wheat production in pakistan 4 l n y i β 0 j 1 j β j l n x j i 1 2 j 1 j k 1 j β j k l n x j i l n x k i β w l n w i 1 2 β w w l n w 2 j 1 j β j w l n x j i l n w i υ i u i where the dependent variable y i is the natural log of per acre wheat production of the ith farmer i 1 2 i x i is the natural log of inputs used which include seed chemicals pesticide weedicide and fertilizers labor and water β is a k x 1 vector of unknown parameters to be estimated the error term η i u i v i is a composite error term which is composed of two parts v i is the idiosyncratic disturbance term which measures specification and measurement error and u i is a one sided disturbance term which measures technical inefficiency we assume that v i has a standard normal distribution v i n 0 σ v 2 and u i is distributed as half normal u i n 0 σ u 2 in the basic versions of the stochastic frontier model as proposed by kumbhakar and lovell 22 the two components of the error term u i and v i are assumed to be i i d i e distributed independent of each other and identically across observations we relax this restriction and allow u i and v i to be heteroskedastic due to several farmer and farm characteristics including size of total land owned household size education groundwater well ownership and distance of the plot from the head of the watercourse distributary road and the market in order to estimate the stochastic frontier model given in 5 we use the information for wheat production data from 629 farmers the dependent variable is wheat yield measured in kilograms per acre the inputs considered in the analysis include labor hours seeds and chemicals fertilizers pesticides and weedicides all expressed in per acre units and number of irrigation water turns applied per farm all variables are expressed in natural logs farm specific estimate

measurement of kp performance 5 domains of collective action we examine kp performance on each of its five legal responsibilities under the pida rules 5 2 1 watercourse maintenance we use the percentage of farmers in the watercourse community who contributed labor for watercourse maintenance works organized by the kp watercourse maintenance is a labor intensive process and farmers volunteering their time to accomplish this task table 2 shows that on average 73 of the farmers contributed labor towards watercourse maintenance 5 2 2 attendance in kp meetings we calculated percentage of community attending kp meetings table 2 shows that about 68 of the community participated in the kp meetings 5 2 3 voting in farmer organization elections farmer organization is the governing body for the secondary canal or distributary which is the parent channel of the watercourse we constructed a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the kp voted in the election and 0 otherwise table 1 shows that an overwhelming majority of the kp chairpersons 84 had voted in the most recent farmer organization election 11 11 membership of distributary level farmer organization fo consists of directly elected farmer representatives from each watercourse fo is the forum where complaints and issues can be voiced and water charges are deposited it is formed at the secondary distributary canal level and will be composed of farmers elected from member kps a minimal kp participation in farmer organization was measured by examining whether the kp chairperson voted in elections for their farmer organization representatives a onetime election at the beginning of the fo tenure see fig 1 for the detail of the role and composition of the fo 5 2 4 collection of water charges we defined a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if kp was involved in water charge collection and 0 if it was not table 1 shows that only about 33 of kps reported that they were successfully taking over collection water charge collection dummy variable indicates success in the kp taking over this new responsibility 12 12 for example if the kp chairperson stated that farmers deposited water charges directly to the irrigation department which was the norm prior to the decentralization then the variable water charges would be 0 only if some farmers submitted dues through the kp is the score 1 5 2 5 dispute resolution degree of involvement of kp in local dispute resolution was measured by asking the chairperson of each kp if he agreed with the statement the response was recorded along a likert scale with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 for strongly agree disputes around irrigation water arise for a whole host of reasons such as water sharing schedule or unauthorized use of watercourse channel but these disputes are seldom officially reported as a police case farmers generally do not admit to having disputes to outsiders but our indirect question of whether the kp are accepted as an arbiter in case of disputes yields a more honest and easy response the average response is 3 8 only 10 of the farmers disagree with that while more than 60 agree table 3 shows that the pairwise correlation amongst kp performance measures is high and mostly positive for example communities that had high participation in canal maintenance efforts also declared an acceptance of kp s role in dispute resolution and kps that voted in farmer organization elections also participated in their internal meetings 5 3 other variables other variables included in equations 2 and 3 are farmer or plot controls z i which include education of the head of the household distance to market road and to the head of the watercourse from the plot and community or watercourse controls z ic which include dummy variables for canal flow type perennial or seasonal dummy variables indicating the head middle or tail location of the watercourse in the irrigation system see tables 1 and 2 show the summary statistics of these variables 6 results mean estimated water use efficiency is 87 which implies that the observed quantity of wheat yield can be maintained by using the observed values of other inputs but using 13 less irrigations the average number of irrigations for a farmer in our sample is about 4 per season and this amounts to a saving of less than 1 irrigation per season fig 2 shows that the distribution of wue is skewed left while most of the farmers cluster close to the mean wue at least a quarter of the farmers have very low wue next we use equation 2 to explore whether better kp performance is associated with a higher wue of member farmers due to the high correlation among kp performance measures as shown in table 3 we do not use them together in equation 3 but add them one at a time table 4 presents the ols results of equation 2 columns 1 to 5 report results for each a c added on the right hand side one by one we also add farmer and watercourse controls described in section 5 3 but do not report the results here all kp roles except participation in meetings have statistically significant and positive coefficients indicating a positive association between success in kp performance and wue of member farmers the coefficients of these kp performance measures show wue of farmers is higher for watercourses whose community more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their farmer organization representatives participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution participation in kp meetings has no statistically significant relationship with wue of sample farmers this may indicate that exchange of information within the watercourse community is already taking place through other pre existing informal channels and the platform provided by the relatively new kp yields little or no marginal benefits in that regard table 5 shows the results of equation 3 with watercourse mean wue leaving out i added as an explanatory variable results show that the coefficient of mean wue is highly significant and positive but now the effect of each kp performance on water use efficiency of member farmers is statistically indistinguishable from zero farmers in watercourse communities with higher mean water use efficiency are also achieving high water use efficiency strongly indicating presence of contextual or endogenous peer effects also the magnitude of the effect is much larger without controlling for group mean the improvement in kp performance measure is associated with no more than a 2 increase in wue which is about 20 of one standard deviation of wue but the watercourse group mean is not only statistically significant but the magnitude of increase is about 5 times the standard deviation in wue in other words watercourse group mean wue is more important in explaining a farmer s wue than the performance of his community in various irrigation management tasks this is an important result for understanding the role of collective action in improving water use efficiency this result gives us strong reason to suspect a causal interpretation of the positive association of kp performance and member wue given the discussion in section 3 2 particularly the presence of correlated unobservables we have two possibilities given the small number of farmers sampled within each watercourse and the cross section nature of the data we cannot implement a community fixed effects model we have controlled for spatial location of each farmer in the system by including head middle and tail dummy variables for the main canal secondary canal and watercourse so to the extent contextual effects are perfectly controlled by spatial location dummy variables we do not have any correlated unobservables in that case the first possibility is what we are observing is the result of endogenous peer effects i e farmers are learning from their watercourse neighbors and hence are achieving similar wues this learning may be happening independent of kp performance but if correlated unobservables are a problem i e spatial location does not fully control for contextual factors perhaps a more likely scenario we cannot rule out the existence of contextual effects all farmers in the watercourse have the same context so they all achieve similar wues in this possibility watercourse mean wue and kp performance are being driven by the same contextual effects 6 1 further exploration and robustness checks in this section we investigate the above result further by i reducing the five kp performance indicators to its principle components ii changing the measure of peer effects from mean to standard deviation of wue iii changing the delineation of the reference group and finally iv replaying wue by crop yield as the measure of on farm outcome 6 1 1 reducing kp responsibilities into principle components as mentioned earlier the 5 kp responsibilities are highly correlated with each other and adding them as all together as explanatory variables in 2 or 3 would result in high multicollinearity we use principle component analysis pca to reduce the dimension of kp matrix while still retaining the maximum possible information or variation from the original variables 19 13 13 we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion since each kp performance is measured in different units we first standardize the data examining the factor loadings matrix we note that the first component is a highly correlated with voting and dispute resolution the second component is highly correlated with attendance in meetings and the third component is highly correlated with contribution to maintenance works together these three components 69 of the variation in the original data 14 14 since pca is a data reduction method there is a need to retain an appropriate number of factors based on the trade off between simplicity retaining as few as possible factors and completeness explaining most of the variation in the data the kaiser s rule recommends retaining only factors with eigenvalues exceeding unity the first 3 factors that we have included in the regression have eigenvalues of 1 4 1 1 and 0 93 respectively intuitively this rule means that any retained factor should account for at least as much variation as any of the original kp variables the kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure of sampling adequacy gives a value of 0 53 so the variables have enough in common to warrant pca we add these three components as a c in equations 2 and 3 and the results are given in tables 6 and 7 we note only the first component is highly significant in explaining the variation in wue but when watercourse group mean wue is added it is still statistically significant at 10 this provides some evidence that after controlling for endogenous peer effects kp performance contributes positively to wue 6 1 2 second moment of wue so far we have examined the effect of the first moment of wue on farmer s wue it is possible that the effect of kp performance in the sample is heterogeneous due to the inequality or dispersion of wue amongst the watercourse community one of the goals of the original design of the indus basin irrigation system was to deliver more or less equal per acre allocation of water to all acres 28 we find that higher mean water use efficiency in a watercourse community is associated with lower standard deviation in wue amongst the community members see fig 3 for a scatter plot in other words communities achieving higher mean wue are also achieving more equal wue among farmers we replace the group mean wue in equation 3 with the group standard deviation of wue and report the resulting output in table 7 as expected farmers located in communities with higher dispersion in wue have significantly lower wue but controlling for standard deviation of community wue better kp performance significantly improves farmer wue particularly if the kp performs better in water charge collection and dispute resolution if peer effects can be measured not by the first but by the second moment it helps us see the role of kp in a different light equity in water delivery to all acres in the system was a system design goal but the observed negative correlation of mean and dispersion of wue amongst members of the watercourse community suggests another possible mechanism for kp s effects on water use efficiency kps can help overcome the negative effects of unequal wue amongst member farmers 6 1 3 a larger peer group we explore whether our results are sensitive to a different delineation of the reference group climbing up a level of hierarchy in the irrigation system from watercourse to the distributary we group farmers in their reference distributary group and calculate the distributary group mean excluding i like before recall that a distributary is a parent channel of the watercourse and many watercourses emanate from a distributary in our sample we have 35 distributaries compared to 115 watercourses we would expect distributary mean wue to have a smaller effect on farmer s wue compared to watercourse mean wue because the reference community is larger and there may be a greater variation in contextual and endogenous peer effects table 8 shows the results of this regression we find that while wue is positively associated with explained by the distributary group mean wue i e farmers wue is still like their distributary peer group s average wue but interestingly now kp performance is statistically significant in explaining farmers wue peer effects are weaker at the distributary level and kp performance helps improve wue within distributary peers or in other words within a distributary variation in kp performance matters in explaining variation in wue but within a watercourse kp performance does not explain variation wue 6 1 4 replacing wue with crop yield finally we replace wue with yield the more commonly used metric of on farm performance tables 9 and 10 show the results the qualitative results do not change even though this measure has shortcomings as outlined in section 3 1 7 summary and conclusions we started with the premise that the social organization of irrigation is just as if not more important for water use efficiency than the technical aspects of irrigation we used the post decentralization institutional forms of irrigation management in pakistan to frame the measurement of community performance in irrigation management at the local level our first important result is that improved collective action in irrigation management in a community is associated with higher average on farm water use efficiency mean on farm water use efficiency is higher for farmers belonging to communities that more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their representatives in upper tier management participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution this finding has important implications for the role of community collective action on water management success achieved by the farmers studies on factors that explain the variation in resource use efficiency across farmers typically focus on input quality e g farmer s education or seed varieties extension services or regional and geographic factors 33 our results suggest that improved irrigation governance at the local level may also be an important consideration for improvement in on farm water use efficiency more broadly it strikes an optimistic note for the outcomes of devolution of irrigation management where local communities are increasingly being involved in a range of irrigation management activities that were previously the responsibility of governments it is heartening to note that there is a concurrence in community performance and private water management outcomes which suggests that farmers private incentives to achieve higher water use efficiency on their own farms are aligned with those for community participation this may be important in initiating and sustaining farmers participation in irrigation governance our second objective in this paper was to explore whether community performance itself can be considered to have a causal impact on on farm water use efficiency in the community although we cannot rule out this possibility our results strongly suggest caution in using this interpretation we found that farmers are achieving water use efficiency on their farms like their watercourse peers we used the peer effects framework to interpret this finding farmers shared context may be driving both community performance and water use efficiency which could mean that we are observing heterogeneous communities better communities are achieving higher group and individual outcomes and worse communities are achieving worse individual and group outcomes in other words the observed differences in water use efficiency cannot necessarily be attributed to community performance in irrigation management but likely are jointly determined by other fundamental variables another possibility is that learning and information spillovers broadly categorized as endogenous peer effects could be at work given our data limitations and the possibility of correlated unobservables we cannot separate these effects but hope that future studies can build on our methods to identify these effects our approach here highlights the importance of considering community peer effects in farmer level input use efficiency studies especially in contexts where communities play a large role in management of irrigation and related public goods in conclusion we mention some caveats regarding our results first our measure of water use efficiency relies on number of irrigation turns rather than volumetric data on water applied as mentioned earlier volumetric information is not collected in this study area even though we have used spatial controls in the estimate as well as in the estimation of equations 2 and 3 to the extent we have measurement error in the measurement of water applied this is a shortcoming of the study second one can never be sure that we have controlled for all relevant contextual variables in equation 3 our results were based on a cross sectional data repeated observations on the communities and farmers would be extremely useful to control for community and farmer fixed effects and may allow for identification of mechanisms of the peer effects finally changes in formal institutions of centuries old irrigation system may take time to show in water management practices and mutual expectations perhaps it is too early to tell and lest we conclude that kps are ineffective we should also keep in mind that this method cannot assess if farmers are doing a better job than the government system that they replaced see fig 1 it is entirely possible that we are witnessing a continuity of institutional forms and performance 
8721,do better performing water user associations improve on farm water management using data from pakistan we find that better water user association performance in a community is associated with higher water use efficiency of member farmers mean on farm water use efficiency is higher for farmers belonging to communities that more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their representatives in upper tier management participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution while these results provide a sanguine view of the outcome of devolution of irrigation management for water management success we argue that this may not be interpreted as impacts of water user association performance results suggest that underlying community characteristics and or social interactions may be driving both the performance of water user associations and on farm water use efficiency keywords peer effects irrigation management transfer devolution indus basin irrigation system khal panchayat pakistan 1 introduction good water management is less of a farm plot concept than it is an among farm concept bromley et al 9 the above quote reminds us that the social aspects of irrigation e g compliance with rules to share water equitably or collective efforts to maintain canals are just as if not more important for on farm water management than the technical aspects of irrigation in this paper we examine this link statistically we explore the link between performance of farmer groups in managing their local irrigation related public goods and the water use efficiency achieved by member farmers the social organization of irrigation is changing farmer groups have been asked to manage their irrigation systems as national and subnational governments have decentralized irrigation systems and given greater responsibility to farmers in its management 6 31 34 under the reforms known variously as irrigation management transfer imt participatory irrigation management pim or farmer managed irrigation systems fmis responsibility is transferred from governments to famers or groups of farmers within water user associations to actively manage local irrigation related resources collect water charges to finance system maintenance and coordinate water use with higher structures in the irrigation system this social and institutional reorganization of irrigation gives us a framework to assess the collective action of farmer groups typically organized in water user associations in managing their local irrigation systems imt is taking place in a context where agricultural productivity gains from the green revolution have petered out 32 particularly for pakistan our case study here there is concern that pakistan will not be able to meet the demands of its growing population because of its low agricultural productivity and overall poor water management a key reason cited for low agricultural productivity is the deterioration of irrigation management 36 there are also concerns that current problems will only be exacerbated as non agricultural water uses grow and compete for already short supplies for agriculture and the melting of the western himalayan glaciers reduce the long term availability of water 18 in fact a strong need for improvement in irrigation management was one of the arguments for imt 36 but have those desired gains in water management materialized there is evidence that communities under differing circumstances and conditions are sometimes able to cooperate to successfully manage the commons 1 29 31 evaluation of farmers performance in their newly appointed irrigation management tasks as well as the factors that contribute to better performance has received some attention for example higher degree of cooperation was found in smaller communities because transactions costs in terms of communication and enforcing agreements were lower 3 5 24 the degree of water scarcity faced by the community members i e salience of the resource was found to be very important very high or very low relative water scarcity lowered community participation 3 24 also a persistent feature of communities performing better in managing local irrigation related public goods was that they had good leaders 13 21 26 nagrah et al 29 studying the pakistani context found a similar pattern presence of educated leadership better state of irrigation infrastructure and higher water scarcity improved community participation these studies compare community collective action outcomes for a variety of resource user characteristics resource characteristics and governance structures and have helped identify several important determinants of successful collective action in irrigation systems but the issue of whether and how water user association performance translates into improved on farm outcomes for farmers has received little attention so far this is the main focus of our paper our first objective is to examine whether the performance of local water user associations has provided on farm water use efficiency gains we use purpose collected primary data from eastern punjab in pakistan these data were also used in nagrah et al 29 in this paper we use a subsample of water user associations studied by nagrah et al 29 and append data collected by additional survey instruments like nagrah et al 29 we measure collective action of farmers in managing their irrigation systems along five domains each of which relates directly to the responsibilities awarded to farmers and their appointed water user association since imt these include maintenance of watercourse channel dispute resolution within the watercourse community collecting seasonal water charges holding internal meetings and electing farmer representatives one of our main results is that we find a positive association between irrigation management by the water user associations and mean water use efficiency in wheat production in the community it is difficult to measure the impact of collective action on farmer outcomes because it is very difficult to find an instrument for community s collective action that is not correlated with farmer s on farm performance both are inextricably linked moreover the timing and location of imt was not randomly selected but based on political and administrative feasibility an ex post study of the impact is plagued with selection bias keeping this difficulty in mind and while understanding the need to evaluate the imt through an on farm water management lens we take the next step our second objective is to explore the mechanism behind the observed positive association between water use efficiency and collective action we find that farmers water use efficiency in a community is strongly and positively correlated i e farmers achieve water management success like their peers in the watercourse community this finding ties directly to the literature on peer effects discussed in section 3 2 which helps us understand the various mechanisms that could generate this result could it be that farmers are learning from and imitating each other in how they manage water on their private farms endogenous peer effects or is it that the community s shared context e g a shared watercourse contextual effects that drives both collective action and water use efficiency due to data limitations we cannot separate the effects of endogenous peer effects and contextual effects on water use efficiency our results suggest that both mechanisms are likely and therefore a causal interpretation of the role of community collective action in individual outcomes should be treated with caution this paper contributes to a relatively thin literature on the effects of community collective action on on farm outcomes we combine ideas from separate strands of litreature on production efficiency peer effects and natural resource governance the focus on water use efficiency is highly relevant for a broader and important policy reason freshwater is highly scarce in this part of the world and it is important to consider whether and how reorganization of irrigation management has played a role in achieving better water management the next section presents a brief outline of the studies that have examined similar questions section 3 outlines a conceptual model section 4 describes the relevant details of the irrigation management system in pakistan and data collection section 5 presents the econometric specification and the results are given in section 6 section 7 concludes with a brief recap of the shortcomings of this study 2 does community collective action in irrigation management bring on farm benefits as the quote from bromley et al 9 at the beginning of the article reminds us on farm water management success can be affected by inter farmer relations this is especially true when water distribution among farmers and management and maintenance of local water infrastructure is the responsibility of the community and its appointed representatives yet the literature on exploring the effect of community s performance action on individual s outcome remains relatively thin and the results are mixed 1 1 effects of change in governance regimes on household production is important in other resource systems most notably in forestry here we focus on studies related to effects of irrigation management on on farm outcomes bandyopadhyay et al 4 compare average rice yield frequency of maintenance activities and irrigation fee collection across 68 irrigation associations in philippines of which 43 underwent imt while 25 did not having access to only post imt data they find that the presence of imt is associated with an increase in maintenance activities and rice yields but no difference is observed in the collection of irrigation fees across the two groups pre existing differences across the two groups which could lead to self selection of an irrigation association into imt or non imt group as well as differences in institutional or infrastructural environment due to the imt are major concerns in interpretation of differences in yields as impacts of imt in order to minimize the effect of selection bias in this comparison bandyopadhyay et al 4 utilize propensity score matching to compare irrigation associations with similar features but cannot rule out that the observed improvement could be confounded by pre existing differences between the two groups wang et al 35 examine farm production income and water savings in northern china finding that water user associations have not been universally successful in either saving water or improving farm incomes and link the performance of water management systems to the incentives that these new institutions provide to water managers closer to our study area although covering a larger geographic extent mekonnen et al 25 examine a sample of 458 farmers from across the pakistani punjab province and found some evidence that seasonal value of per acre crop yield was slightly higher in watercourses where a water user association existed the geographic extent of the data covers regions and canal commands where imt was in different stages and therefore existence of water user association is treated as an endogenous variable the geographic extent of our study area is smaller water user associations exist in all watercourses and we interview multiple farmers per watercourse which allows us to examine the mean and variance of farmer outcomes within a water user association in an earlier study based on data from the mountainous northern pakistan khwaja 21 observed community participation in infrastructure maintenance activities and found that the performance of a community varied in different tasks he raised an interesting possibility that rather than interpreting a community s potential to act collectively as a fixed characteristic of the community as proposed by the concept of social capital features of the project itself are also important in determining whether and how a community can act collectively for example projects that are less technical or complex or those that yield more equitable distribution of returns can be performed well by communities like khwaja 21 we observe the performance of each sample community for five different yet all irrigation related tasks rather than exploring the variation of community performance across tasks the goal for us here is whether and how that performance translates into water use efficiency gains of member farmers 3 conceptual model our goal is to understand the role of collective action in water management in improving farmers on farm water management the choice of a metric for evaluating farmer s on farm water management performance is important we first discuss the measurement relevance and potential shortcomings of our choice of the metric of on farm water management success 3 1 water use efficiency farmers on farm performance is measured in various ways in the literature ranging from physical productivity to more complicated estimates of efficiency bandyopadhyay et al 4 use yield and wang et al 33 use income and farm production and mekonnen et al 25 use revenue per acre as the farm level outcome by productivity we mean a ratio of outputs to inputs such as yield and by efficiency we have in mind a comparison between the observed and some notion of optimal value of outputs and inputs agricultural productivity is defined in several ways throughout the literature including as general output per unit of input e g crop per drop farm yield by crop or total output per hectare and output per worker such physical measures of productivity have a serious deficiency a productivity measure such as tons per hectare only considers the land input and ignores all other inputs such as labor machinery fuel fertilizer pesticide etc the use of this measure in the formulation of management and policy advice is likely to result in excessive use of those inputs that are not included in the efficiency measure 10 11 2 2 productivity is the same as efficiency if using only one factor of production but when multiple inputs are used the issue of i which inputs to consider ii how to aggregate and weight multiple inputs and iii how to determine the optimal production becomes relevant 11 we focus on farm water management success measured by water use efficiency wue water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of minimum feasible to observed use of irrigation water w conditional on the production technology a and other inputs x 20 33 this can be expressed as 1 w u e i m i n λ f x i λ w i z i a y i 0 1 where z i are farmer and farm characteristics such as education and age of the farmer and location of the plot in the irrigation system it provides a precise measure of water management success on the farm by comparing across farmers in the sample wue provides information on how much water use could be decreased by the farmer without altering the output produced and the quantities of other inputs used following convention in the stochastic production frontier literature we calculate wue for each farmer in the sample after estimating a stochastic production frontier 2 7 22 the frontier function represents a best practice technology against which the efficiency of each farmer within the sample can be measured we propose that this approach will provide a better measures of on farm performance than partial measures such as output per unit of labor or land also unlike its counterparts like technical efficiency which is an output oriented measure of inefficiency wue can be used as a left hand side variable in a regression two possible concerns may arise regarding the use of wue first this metric has been developed for contexts where volumetric information on water applied is available in our study area as in many parts of the world precise volume of water applied on the farm is not measured we use number of irrigation turns applied by the farmer alongwith information on depth of irrigation water applied we also account for location of the plot in the irrigation system which helps control for the variation in the water volume received in each irrigation turn to the extent our measure of irrigation water applied has measurement error this remains a shortcoming of our study a second concern may be that while farmers have a strong incentive to increase yields or profits they may not have a strong incentive to maximize water use efficiency especially when there is no marginal price for water we think this concern can be partly or wholly assuaged by the fact that our study area is a highly water scarce region in pakistan it has a hot dry desert climate with precipitation mainly falling in summers not at the time wheat is being grown average annual rain is about 200 mm per year meeting only about 12 of wheat crop requirement which means that growing wheat requires irrigation 30 irrigation water itself is scarce rationed to each plot along the watercourse via a time based water turn rotation 3 3 farmers receive water from a watercourse in proportion to the size of their landholding each farmer has a turn in a weekly or 10 day rotation to draw from the watercourse and turns are fixed specifying the day time and duration of water supply to each irrigator this system to ration the watercourse water supplies amongst the watercourse community is referred to as warabandi and groundwater is saline with some small pockets of useable water in the head or middle reaches of the canals due to canal water seepage for these reasons we believe that farmers in our study area have a strong incentive to achieve high water use efficiency 3 2 role of community collective action in this section we present a framework for understanding the role of community collective action on water use efficiency suppose that a sample of i farmers were distributed randomly across k watercourse communities it would be natural to presume that performance of farmer i in her water management could be affected by not only some pre determined community characteristics such as the distance of the watercourse from the main canal but also the performance of her community in providing and maintaining local irrigated related public goods such as maintaining the watercourse expressing this hypothesis in a linear regression equation 2 w u e ˆ i c γ 0 z i c γ 1 a c γ 2 z c γ 3 e i c where i 1 2 i and c 1 2 k in equation 2 a c is a measure of performance of community c in providing local irrigation related public goods z c are community characteristics such as spatial location in the irrigation system size of the community and z ic are individual characteristics referred to as z i earlier in 1 we add a hat to w u e ˆ i c to indicate that it is an estimate of farmer s wue the coefficient γ 2 is the effect of community performance on farmer performance and our central hypothesis of interest is that γ 2 0 i e successful collective action in community c would be associated with higher wue a difficulty lies in assigning a causal interpretation to γ 2 as the impact of community collective action on farmer s wue as moffitt 27 describes the estimated coefficient of the community level variables γ 2 may be biased due to endogeneity resulting from three reasons i shared context or contextual effects ii endogenous group membership and iii endogenous peer effects for economists the inferential problems in detecting the existence of these contextual and peer effects estimating their magnitude and identification of the channels through which they operate have all been the subject of considerable and long standing discussion 8 14 23 27 one basic assumption made in peer effect frameworks is that individuals interact in groups 27 this means that the population is partitioned in groups and individuals only interact with members of the reference group and with none outside it the reference group in this paper is the watercourse community denoted by c defined by all individuals farming in the geographical boundary of the area irrigated by the watercourse members of the watercourse community live in one or two neighboring villages interactions are thus structured through the sharing of the water in the watercourse maintaining it as well as via myriad other social interactions in the village community ties are reciprocated although in this study we do not observe the frequency or intensity of contact amongst members of the watercourse community contextual effects refer to the fact that farmers in a community c share the same social economic and infrastructure context e g same watercourse water delivery received in the watercourse village schools roads or broadly defined social capital for example a community with higher social capital characterized by trust and cooperation within its members would achieve better a c and may also have higher mean wue in this case γ 2 would capture the benefit of being in community c and not necessarily the benefit of community collective action in that sense both a c and z c are contextual effects for member farmers that are exogenous in the sense that they are pre determined from the farmer s viewpoint but their coefficients capture the benefits of being in community c due to some other underlying and potentially unidentified reasons but not community collective action as such to the extent that we can observe and control contextual variables as additional right hand side variables they do not pose a problem in creating a bias in the estimated γ 2 but it may be impossible to measure everything what is it in the shared context that affects members a special case could be what moffit 27 has called the correlated unobservables and their effect can be seen by examining the error term in 2 if e i c μ c η i c where μ c denotes common effects that are not known or observable or measurable by the researcher this means for two farmers i and j in community c e e i c e j c 0 thereby creating a bias in our estimates of 2 we return to the issue of correlated unobservables the second issue arises if individuals are self selecting into communities that are similar to them then membership in the reference group itself is endogenous this is referred to as endogenous group formation and may result in the researcher observing correlated unobservables or common factors within a community but not due to exogenous but endogenous reasons endogenous community membership i e farmers could self select into communities that are similar to themselves is not a concern for us here because what constitutes for us as a peer group is determined by farmers sharing the use of a watercourse in our study area land markets are thin and community membership is stable because farmers are farming their land for decades endogenous community membership may be a concern if farmers were mobile across watercourse communities the third issue is more challenging endogenous peer effects are related to what manski 23 has referred to as the reflection problem the problem of not being able to disentangle whether or not the average outcome in a group is actually influencing that same outcome at the individual level this could arise because individual member of the community contributes to the expected group outcome due to information spillovers imitation or conformism among members of a group farmers could be learning from each other about how to manage water on the farm a common way to detect endogenous peer effects proposed for this problem is to add a group mean term on the right hand side of 2 23 the group mean captures the social interaction or learning effect of the average outcome in the reference community on an individual s own outcome this modifies equation 2 to 3 w u e ˆ i c α 0 z i c α 1 a c α 2 z c α 3 α 4 j 1 j i n c w u e ˆ j c n c 1 ε i c where j 1 j i n c w u e ˆ j c n c 1 is the average farmer performance in community c excluding farmer i and n c is the size of the watercourse community c the key idea here is that if farmers in community c are benefiting from community collective action α 2 would be positive after controlling for the social interaction effect equations 2 and 3 are our main regression equations of interest in this paper we note here that the problem of correlated unobservables still may plague the identification of peer effects if z c does not fully capture all the relevant contextual effects especially if farmers i and j in community share the context μ c that has not been controlled for in z c as moffitt 27 and bramoullé et al 8 have shown there is no simple methodological answer to these three challenges especially in non experimental cross section data settings we have in this study therefore given our data limitations our objective here is not a separation of contextual and peer effects on water use efficiency but simply to give a framework for the interpretation of a positive α 2 4 study area and data collection 4 1 new institutional forms in the indus basin irrigation system in pakistan in 1997 pakistan s provincial assemblies passed irrigation and drainage acts that transformed the centralized government run irrigation departments into autonomous units and transferred the management responsibility to farmer organizations the stated goals of the decentralization and devolution were to a achieve equity in distribution of water supply b improve cost recovery and c reduce system losses and increasing irrigation efficiency 34 4 4 this section is adapted from nagrah et al 29 the irrigation system in pakistan is a run of the river system where water is diverted from rivers and spread over a very large area about 19 million hectares thus making it the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world the irrigation system itself is like branches of a tree water flows from branch canals into distributaries and then into watercourses the watercourses are the most tertiary part of the system and deliver water to agricultural plots where farmers are bound by scheduled irrigation turns to withdraw water from the watercourse on to their plots although water volume received at each plot is not measured it is well established that location of the agricultural plot in the hierarchical system can affect the volume of water received 9 28 in principle the tail reaches were protected from such built in lower riparian disadvantage by various institutional protections but decrepit infrastructure and water theft in the upstream reaches have increased the inequality in received surface water 26 in our study area formation of all irrigation associations were prompted by the pida act of 1997 by which provincial irrigation departments were transformed into financially autonomous entities referred to as provincial irrigation and drainage authorities in punjab the provincial government structured the authority into area water boards each of which consisted of several farmer organizations fos an fo was to take over the management responsibilities of the secondary canals distributary and consisted of directly elected farmer representatives from each tertiary canal watercourse each of these directly elected members headed their respective watercourse level khal panchayat kp 15 17 see fig 1 for a comparison of the old and the new system a watercourse community consists of all farmers that share a watercourse and resides in one or more neighboring villages the watercourse carries water from the secondary outlet to the farmers fields each watercourse community is governed by a khal panchayat referred to as kp from here onwards khal means watercourse and panchayat refers to the five member governing body and the 1997 pida lays out its responsibilities as 1 maintenance of the watercourse 2 dispute resolution 3 collection of water charges from irrigating farmers on the watercourse 4 hold monthly meetings and 5 participation in distributary level farmer organizations 16 each kp responsibility is a particular form of collective action problem 29 watercourse maintenance refers to removing sediment and weeds from the watercourse channel 5 5 sediment drawn along with the water from the distributary and main canals is deposited on the bed and along the sides of the watercourse resulting in distortion of the cross section and therewith a reduction of its carrying capacity of the watercourse the embankments of the watercourse especially of unlined and earthen watercourses need strengthening to avoid breaches and excessive seepage losses furthermore vegetation in the watercourse hampers the flow of water leading to an inadequate discharge capacity 29 periodic watercourse maintenance a local public good is important for unimpeded water flow to all farmers especially those appropriating water in the tail reaches resolving disputes especially when they are over sharing of water flowing in the watercourse can avoid disruption of the flow of service kp meetings can aid in exchange of information and developing trust as noted by frohlich and oppenheimer 12 individuals do not have complete information in most settings but we can assume that individuals learn more accurate information about the structure of the situation they are in and behavior of others involved when they communicate in repeated situations finally electing upper tier members of the farmer organization can be a direct formal route to voice local concerns at higher level we examine the performance of kp in fulfilling its five responsibilities as a reflection of the degree of collective action within the watercourse community this is our key assumption which enables us to interpret kp performance as the respective community s capacity for self organization and collective action 6 6 we also assume that the stock or the level of local public good matters to the ith farmer s on farm water management success water use efficiency not his private contribution to the public good for example the state of the watercourse matters for him not how much time or money he personally spent in watercourse maintenance in the case of other kp responsibilities such as voting in farmer organizations or collection of water charges it is only the kp chairman who is directly involved in these and not the other farmers in the community therefore we believe this is a reasonable assumption in this context this allows us to ignore the individual farmer s financial or material outlays in meeting kp s responsibilities in the empirical analysis we thank an anonymous referee for pointing this out 4 2 sample selection and data collection our study area is bahawalnagar canal circle bcc in eastern punjab pakistan which is one of the largest canal systems in pakistan with a gross command area of approximately 690 000 ha about 1 7 million acres located in the southeastern part of the punjab it has high water scarcity farmers often rank water shortage as one of the most serious problems facing agricultural production this area is part of a single agro climatic zone so altitude rainfall and temperatures are fairly uniform across farms within this area this study uses a subsample of data used in nagrah 29 with additional data from a farmer level survey instrument 7 7 nagrah et al 29 used a sample of 1845 watercourses across 44 distributaries to collect kp performance data a subsample of 120 watercourses within 35 distributaries was generated to collect detailed production information from sample of farmers within each watercourse the survey sample was calculated using a systematic random sampling method of the total 70 distributaries in bcc 35 distributaries were randomly selected and within each of these 120 watercourses were randomly selected and within each selected watercourse a random sample of farmers was selected 8 8 detailed watercourse farmer lists were used from which a random sample of farmers was chosen in cases where such lists were not readily available approximate lists were prepared by utilizing information available from the patwari s of the watercourse in question on each of the 120 selected watercourses 6 interviews were conducted over the period of 15 july 15 august 2012 5 farmer interviews and 1 kp chairperson interview kp chairperson interview collected information on the kp activities in particular on the duties of kp farmer interviews collected information on production in the two most recent growing seasons rabi winter 2011 12 and kharif summer 2011 both interviews assessed the activities of the kp and physical and socioeconomic environment of the watercourse community to verify the accounts of the kp chairperson 9 9 kps typically do not keep written records the best way to measure their performance is via interviews of the chairperson and the member famers one concern was that kp chairperson could strategically misreport kp performance therefore in a random subsample of watercourses additional farmers were also interviewed for the kp performance the results of the farmers reporting were not significantly different from the kp chairperson response and field team felt confident there was no systematic misreporting of kp activities by the kp chairperson the sample watercourses lie across 3 different canal divisions which vary in their size and state of infrastructure our sample watercourses from head middle and tail reaches of the distributary as well as from the head middle and tail reaches of each watercourse after data cleaning and processing and dropping small watercourses that had most land under one extended family ownership we have a sample of 629 farmers located across 115 watercourses number of farmers in the sample from each watercourse varies 60 of the watercourses 69 watercourses have 6 farmers in the sample 29 of the watercourses 34 watercourses have 5 farmers 9 10 watercourses have 4 farmers in the sample and less than 1 2 watercourses have 3 farmers in the sample table 1 for summary statistics of 629 farmer level variables including farmer characteristics wheat yield and inputs and table 2 for summary statistics of watercourses level variables in our study area water delivered to the plot or even at the head of the watercourse is not metered so data on volume of applied irrigation water is not available we approximate the volume of water used on each farm by recording the number of irrigation turns received by the farmer at the farm gate as well as noting the location of the farm in the head middle tail reach of each primary secondary or tertiary irrigation channel 10 10 in some cases we also recorded the depth of irrigation water applied all farmers are using flood irrigation techniques so the depth of water applied multiplied by irrigated area multiplied by number of irrigation turns gives a measurement for volume of water applied our results do not change significantly by using this measure we therefore report the results with irrigation turns 5 econometric specification 5 1 water use efficiency wue we follow reinhard et al 33 and karigiannis et al 20 in that we first estimate a stochastic production frontier and then use the estimated coefficients to calculate wue of each farmer we estimate the stochastic production frontier for wheat using the translogrithmic production function following battese and broca 7 who found that a translogrithmic production function is a good fit for wheat production in pakistan 4 l n y i β 0 j 1 j β j l n x j i

error term η i u i v i is a composite error term which is composed of two parts v i is the idiosyncratic disturbance term which measures specification and measurement error and u i is a one sided disturbance term which measures technical inefficiency we assume that v i has a standard normal distribution v i n 0 σ v 2 and u i is distributed as half normal u i n 0 σ u 2 in the basic versions of the stochastic frontier model as proposed by kumbhakar and lovell 22 the two components of the error term u i and v i are assumed to be i i d i e distributed independent of each other and identically across observations we relax this restriction and allow u i and v i to be heteroskedastic due to several farmer and farm characteristics including size of total land owned household size education groundwater well ownership and distance of the plot from the head of the watercourse distributary road and the market in order to estimate the stochastic frontier model given in 5 we use the information for wheat production data from 629 farmers the dependent variable is wheat yield measured in kilograms per acre the inputs considered in the analysis include labor hours seeds and chemicals fertilizers pesticides and weedicides all expressed in per acre units and number of irrigation water turns applied per farm all variables are expressed in natural logs farm specific estimate

measurement of kp performance 5 domains of collective action we examine kp performance on each of its five legal responsibilities under the pida rules 5 2 1 watercourse maintenance we use the percentage of farmers in the watercourse community who contributed labor for watercourse maintenance works organized by the kp watercourse maintenance is a labor intensive process and farmers volunteering their time to accomplish this task table 2 shows that on average 73 of the farmers contributed labor towards watercourse maintenance 5 2 2 attendance in kp meetings we calculated percentage of community attending kp meetings table 2 shows that about 68 of the community participated in the kp meetings 5 2 3 voting in farmer organization elections farmer organization is the governing body for the secondary canal or distributary which is the parent channel of the watercourse we constructed a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the kp voted in the election and 0 otherwise table 1 shows that an overwhelming majority of the kp chairpersons 84 had voted in the most recent farmer organization election 11 11 membership of distributary level farmer organization fo consists of directly elected farmer representatives from each watercourse fo is the forum where complaints and issues can be voiced and water charges are deposited it is formed at the secondary distributary canal level and will be composed of farmers elected from member kps a minimal kp participation in farmer organization was measured by examining whether the kp chairperson voted in elections for their farmer organization representatives a onetime election at the beginning of the fo tenure see fig 1 for the detail of the role and composition of the fo 5 2 4 collection of water charges we defined a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if kp was involved in water charge collection and 0 if it was not table 1 shows that only about 33 of kps reported that they were successfully taking over collection water charge collection dummy variable indicates success in the kp taking over this new responsibility 12 12 for example if the kp chairperson stated that farmers deposited water charges directly to the irrigation department which was the norm prior to the decentralization then the variable water charges would be 0 only if some farmers submitted dues through the kp is the score 1 5 2 5 dispute resolution degree of involvement of kp in local dispute resolution was measured by asking the chairperson of each kp if he agreed with the statement the response was recorded along a likert scale with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 for strongly agree disputes around irrigation water arise for a whole host of reasons such as water sharing schedule or unauthorized use of watercourse channel but these disputes are seldom officially reported as a police case farmers generally do not admit to having disputes to outsiders but our indirect question of whether the kp are accepted as an arbiter in case of disputes yields a more honest and easy response the average response is 3 8 only 10 of the farmers disagree with that while more than 60 agree table 3 shows that the pairwise correlation amongst kp performance measures is high and mostly positive for example communities that had high participation in canal maintenance efforts also declared an acceptance of kp s role in dispute resolution and kps that voted in farmer organization elections also participated in their internal meetings 5 3 other variables other variables included in equations 2 and 3 are farmer or plot controls z i which include education of the head of the household distance to market road and to the head of the watercourse from the plot and community or watercourse controls z ic which include dummy variables for canal flow type perennial or seasonal dummy variables indicating the head middle or tail location of the watercourse in the irrigation system see tables 1 and 2 show the summary statistics of these variables 6 results mean estimated water use efficiency is 87 which implies that the observed quantity of wheat yield can be maintained by using the observed values of other inputs but using 13 less irrigations the average number of irrigations for a farmer in our sample is about 4 per season and this amounts to a saving of less than 1 irrigation per season fig 2 shows that the distribution of wue is skewed left while most of the farmers cluster close to the mean wue at least a quarter of the farmers have very low wue next we use equation 2 to explore whether better kp performance is associated with a higher wue of member farmers due to the high correlation among kp performance measures as shown in table 3 we do not use them together in equation 3 but add them one at a time table 4 presents the ols results of equation 2 columns 1 to 5 report results for each a c added on the right hand side one by one we also add farmer and watercourse controls described in section 5 3 but do not report the results here all kp roles except participation in meetings have statistically significant and positive coefficients indicating a positive association between success in kp performance and wue of member farmers the coefficients of these kp performance measures show wue of farmers is higher for watercourses whose community more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their farmer organization representatives participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution participation in kp meetings has no statistically significant relationship with wue of sample farmers this may indicate that exchange of information within the watercourse community is already taking place through other pre existing informal channels and the platform provided by the relatively new kp yields little or no marginal benefits in that regard table 5 shows the results of equation 3 with watercourse mean wue leaving out i added as an explanatory variable results show that the coefficient of mean wue is highly significant and positive but now the effect of each kp performance on water use efficiency of member farmers is statistically indistinguishable from zero farmers in watercourse communities with higher mean water use efficiency are also achieving high water use efficiency strongly indicating presence of contextual or endogenous peer effects also the magnitude of the effect is much larger without controlling for group mean the improvement in kp performance measure is associated with no more than a 2 increase in wue which is about 20 of one standard deviation of wue but the watercourse group mean is not only statistically significant but the magnitude of increase is about 5 times the standard deviation in wue in other words watercourse group mean wue is more important in explaining a farmer s wue than the performance of his community in various irrigation management tasks this is an important result for understanding the role of collective action in improving water use efficiency this result gives us strong reason to suspect a causal interpretation of the positive association of kp performance and member wue given the discussion in section 3 2 particularly the presence of correlated unobservables we have two possibilities given the small number of farmers sampled within each watercourse and the cross section nature of the data we cannot implement a community fixed effects model we have controlled for spatial location of each farmer in the system by including head middle and tail dummy variables for the main canal secondary canal and watercourse so to the extent contextual effects are perfectly controlled by spatial location dummy variables we do not have any correlated unobservables in that case the first possibility is what we are observing is the result of endogenous peer effects i e farmers are learning from their watercourse neighbors and hence are achieving similar wues this learning may be happening independent of kp performance but if correlated unobservables are a problem i e spatial location does not fully control for contextual factors perhaps a more likely scenario we cannot rule out the existence of contextual effects all farmers in the watercourse have the same context so they all achieve similar wues in this possibility watercourse mean wue and kp performance are being driven by the same contextual effects 6 1 further exploration and robustness checks in this section we investigate the above result further by i reducing the five kp performance indicators to its principle components ii changing the measure of peer effects from mean to standard deviation of wue iii changing the delineation of the reference group and finally iv replaying wue by crop yield as the measure of on farm outcome 6 1 1 reducing kp responsibilities into principle components as mentioned earlier the 5 kp responsibilities are highly correlated with each other and adding them as all together as explanatory variables in 2 or 3 would result in high multicollinearity we use principle component analysis pca to reduce the dimension of kp matrix while still retaining the maximum possible information or variation from the original variables 19 13 13 we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion since each kp performance is measured in different units we first standardize the data examining the factor loadings matrix we note that the first component is a highly correlated with voting and dispute resolution the second component is highly correlated with attendance in meetings and the third component is highly correlated with contribution to maintenance works together these three components 69 of the variation in the original data 14 14 since pca is a data reduction method there is a need to retain an appropriate number of factors based on the trade off between simplicity retaining as few as possible factors and completeness explaining most of the variation in the data the kaiser s rule recommends retaining only factors with eigenvalues exceeding unity the first 3 factors that we have included in the regression have eigenvalues of 1 4 1 1 and 0 93 respectively intuitively this rule means that any retained factor should account for at least as much variation as any of the original kp variables the kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure of sampling adequacy gives a value of 0 53 so the variables have enough in common to warrant pca we add these three components as a c in equations 2 and 3 and the results are given in tables 6 and 7 we note only the first component is highly significant in explaining the variation in wue but when watercourse group mean wue is added it is still statistically significant at 10 this provides some evidence that after controlling for endogenous peer effects kp performance contributes positively to wue 6 1 2 second moment of wue so far we have examined the effect of the first moment of wue on farmer s wue it is possible that the effect of kp performance in the sample is heterogeneous due to the inequality or dispersion of wue amongst the watercourse community one of the goals of the original design of the indus basin irrigation system was to deliver more or less equal per acre allocation of water to all acres 28 we find that higher mean water use efficiency in a watercourse community is associated with lower standard deviation in wue amongst the community members see fig 3 for a scatter plot in other words communities achieving higher mean wue are also achieving more equal wue among farmers we replace the group mean wue in equation 3 with the group standard deviation of wue and report the resulting output in table 7 as expected farmers located in communities with higher dispersion in wue have significantly lower wue but controlling for standard deviation of community wue better kp performance significantly improves farmer wue particularly if the kp performs better in water charge collection and dispute resolution if peer effects can be measured not by the first but by the second moment it helps us see the role of kp in a different light equity in water delivery to all acres in the system was a system design goal but the observed negative correlation of mean and dispersion of wue amongst members of the watercourse community suggests another possible mechanism for kp s effects on water use efficiency kps can help overcome the negative effects of unequal wue amongst member farmers 6 1 3 a larger peer group we explore whether our results are sensitive to a different delineation of the reference group climbing up a level of hierarchy in the irrigation system from watercourse to the distributary we group farmers in their reference distributary group and calculate the distributary group mean excluding i like before recall that a distributary is a parent channel of the watercourse and many watercourses emanate from a distributary in our sample we have 35 distributaries compared to 115 watercourses we would expect distributary mean wue to have a smaller effect on farmer s wue compared to watercourse mean wue because the reference community is larger and there may be a greater variation in contextual and endogenous peer effects table 8 shows the results of this regression we find that while wue is positively associated with explained by the distributary group mean wue i e farmers wue is still like their distributary peer group s average wue but interestingly now kp performance is statistically significant in explaining farmers wue peer effects are weaker at the distributary level and kp performance helps improve wue within distributary peers or in other words within a distributary variation in kp performance matters in explaining variation in wue but within a watercourse kp performance does not explain variation wue 6 1 4 replacing wue with crop yield finally we replace wue with yield the more commonly used metric of on farm performance tables 9 and 10 show the results the qualitative results do not change even though this measure has shortcomings as outlined in section 3 1 7 summary and conclusions we started with the premise that the social organization of irrigation is just as if not more important for water use efficiency than the technical aspects of irrigation we used the post decentralization institutional forms of irrigation management in pakistan to frame the measurement of community performance in irrigation management at the local level our first important result is that improved collective action in irrigation management in a community is associated with higher average on farm water use efficiency mean on farm water use efficiency is higher for farmers belonging to communities that more broadly participated in watercourse maintenance voted to elect their representatives in upper tier management participated in water charge collection and were involved in dispute resolution this finding has important implications for the role of community collective action on water management success achieved by the farmers studies on factors that explain the variation in resource use efficiency across farmers typically focus on input quality e g farmer s education or seed varieties extension services or regional and geographic factors 33 our results suggest that improved irrigation governance at the local level may also be an important consideration for improvement in on farm water use efficiency more broadly it strikes an optimistic note for the outcomes of devolution of irrigation management where local communities are increasingly being involved in a range of irrigation management activities that were previously the responsibility of governments it is heartening to note that there is a concurrence in community performance and private water management outcomes which suggests that farmers private incentives to achieve higher water use efficiency on their own farms are aligned with those for community participation this may be important in initiating and sustaining farmers participation in irrigation governance our second objective in this paper was to explore whether community performance itself can be considered to have a causal impact on on farm water use efficiency in the community although we cannot rule out this possibility our results strongly suggest caution in using this interpretation we found that farmers are achieving water use efficiency on their farms like their watercourse peers we used the peer effects framework to interpret this finding farmers shared context may be driving both community performance and water use efficiency which could mean that we are observing heterogeneous communities better communities are achieving higher group and individual outcomes and worse communities are achieving worse individual and group outcomes in other words the observed differences in water use efficiency cannot necessarily be attributed to community performance in irrigation management but likely are jointly determined by other fundamental variables another possibility is that learning and information spillovers broadly categorized as endogenous peer effects could be at work given our data limitations and the possibility of correlated unobservables we cannot separate these effects but hope that future studies can build on our methods to identify these effects our approach here highlights the importance of considering community peer effects in farmer level input use efficiency studies especially in contexts where communities play a large role in management of irrigation and related public goods in conclusion we mention some caveats regarding our results first our measure of water use efficiency relies on number of irrigation turns rather than volumetric data on water applied as mentioned earlier volumetric information is not collected in this study area even though we have used spatial controls in the estimate as well as in the estimation of equations 2 and 3 to the extent we have measurement error in the measurement of water applied this is a shortcoming of the study second one can never be sure that we have controlled for all relevant contextual variables in equation 3 our results were based on a cross sectional data repeated observations on the communities and farmers would be extremely useful to control for community and farmer fixed effects and may allow for identification of mechanisms of the peer effects finally changes in formal institutions of centuries old irrigation system may take time to show in water management practices and mutual expectations perhaps it is too early to tell and lest we conclude that kps are ineffective we should also keep in mind that this method cannot assess if farmers are doing a better job than the government system that they replaced see fig 1 it is entirely possible that we are witnessing a continuity of institutional forms and performance 
8722,water rationing is the ultimate demand management strategy which must be used when all other strategies have failed to keep demand below the available supply most household water consumption is used for the production of services e g bathing laundry and irrigation of landscaping typically using capital goods e g showers appliances and irrigation systems to combine time water and sometimes energy the likelihood households will face rationing depends at least in part on the success of the other demand management strategies such as pricing the household choice of time allocation planned water use and water and time augmenting conservation capital investment is modeled as a household production problem in an environment with a risk of water use restrictions a utility manages the levels at which restrictions are imposed and equilibria are identified where these restriction trigger levels are consistent with household planned water use when conservation capital is water augmenting demand for capital is decreasing in the price of water and in the likelihood of restrictions being applied if water demand is decreasing in water price then increasing water prices reduces the likelihood of restrictions being applied and can reverse the relationship between water price and the demand for conservation capital empirical investigations into household investment in conservation capital should account for the likelihood that households face water use restrictions and practitioners should be aware that the effectiveness of campaigns to encourage greater investment in conservation capital may depend on both how water is priced and how it is rationed keywords water demand drought restrictions household production conservation capital water conservation 1 introduction the average human nutritional need for water is less than four liters per day 45 daily per capita water use in most parts of the world is far above this often by at least an order of magnitude 50 this water is used to provide services ranging from basic hygiene and sanitation to irrigating landscaping and filling swimming pools with by far the largest share of household water use being for service production the demand for water is perhaps best understood as a derived demand derived from the demand for the services of water households use assets they own to combine water and time and in some cases energy to produce these services the services produced and the required mix of water and time depends on the assets owned some assets such as dual flush toilets save water but may require a bit more cognitive effort in selecting the appropriate button and time for more frequent cleaning similarly low flow shower heads may require more time to remove soap on the yard using rain barrels saves water but requires time for distributing water and cleaning the barrels other assets may save time and water irrigation system timers save time if set to water at night they can save water and if coupled with a moisture probe save even more water planting drought resistant landscaping can save water if less water is applied being drought tolerant it will also be less impacted by supply interruptions however care is more specialized than for lawn requiring time to learn effective management and possibly more time to undertake that management a landscaping company can be hired to save this time but then the effective cost of drought tolerant plantings is larger price has long been advocated as an effective tool for water demand management 39 35 however in many jurisdictions price is only one among a range of tools that water managers use among non price policies mandatory measures are found to be effective at reducing water demand while the results for voluntary measures are mixed 43 33 34 20 most of the work examining price and non price policies has examined the relative effectiveness of these approaches rather than considered interactions between them a gap we attempt to address the ubiquity of non price policies may at least in part reflect the nature of the problem that water managers face water managers are managing the distribution of water to users through a system with a fixed maximum capacity and a risk that natural inflows will not fill the system to capacity they are managing drought risk price and non price demand management policies do not create new water and if they are not effective at bringing demand in line with available supply during a drought then water managers must implement mandatory measures to ration what water there is between users in many jurisdictions drought risk is managed with a set of drought stages and trigger levels based on reservoir levels water table levels stream flows etc that are used to activate different drought stages 22 46 at the initial drought stages voluntary reductions in water use are encouraged at higher drought stages an increasing set of mandatory reductions are implemented in the highest drought stage all but essential water uses are prohibited drought plans and the conditions which trigger the different drought stages are public information considerable effort is generally put into informing water users about what the current drought stage is and how close the system is to the next higher stage water users can therefore be expected to account for this uncertainty in their planned water use in this paper a household production function approach is used to examine how a drought response strategy involving progressively tighter restrictions on water use impacts on planned water use and the investment in water conservation this work provides a theoretical perspective on a thinly studied area of water use residential water conservation investment it is one of a few papers that use the household production function approach to examine water conservation investment e g 28 17 it extends this earlier literature by examining the intersection between water use restrictions and water prices using the household production function approach the results demonstrate that the econometric relationship between water prices and investment in conservation capital can depend on the likelihood that households face water use restrictions and consequently that the success of efforts to encourage household investment in conservation capital may depend on both the price charged for water and the role of water use restrictions the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in the next section empirical results that motivated this investigation are briefly described namely finding no relationship between the price for water and the adoption of water conserving technologies in a community with multiple water providers this is followed by a literature review highlighting that little work has looked at the interaction between water prices and water use restrictions subsequently a theoretical model is developed and then it is parameterized in a way that serves to illustrate the key results the paper then returns briefly to data collected in kelowna british columbia to present a very preliminary examination of one of the model predictions following this limitations and extensions are discussed prior to a brief conclusion 2 empirical context kelowna british columbia canada is a unique community having five major water providers table 1 their existence is a historical accident a consequence of the need for irrigation on the valley floor and the most cost effective way of delivery being gravity from small upland watersheds each of these providers has their own water source and delivery infrastructure and applies its own rate structure two of these bill by volume the remaining three charge a flat rate independent of the amount of water used for the city water is one of many services that are provided the other four utilities are a level of local government enabled by the same legislation under which cities and towns exist 25 these other utilities each have an elected board of trustees that oversees the operations of the utility and approves bylaws that specify the rules and conditions related to the services provided to those served including sanctions for violation of these bylaws these sanctions run from notices through fines and shutting off the water supply to criminal charges and jail time bylaw enforcement officers are responsible for detecting violations and beginning the process of imposing sanctions however since bylaw enforcement rarely enters homes except if there is reason to suspect there is tampering with meters where there are meters or otherwise illegally modifying utility works most enforcement relates to violations of outdoor watering regulations the analytical model explored below was motivated by results from a 2009 survey of household engagement with water conservation undertaken in kelowna among other things the survey asked residents to indicate which activities and or investments they undertook inside and outside the home that could contribute to conserving water fig 1 shows the distribution of the number of conservation choices made in three categories the individual conservation options are below in table 3 the naive expectation was that in those parts of the city where people paid by unit volume the two bottom providers in the figure engagement with water conservation would be greater however results did not bear this out either based on simple comparisons of means or on more sophisticated regression models given how robust this result was perhaps there is something else about the kelowna water supply situation that may induce similar uptake of water conservation among those served across the different providers table 1 provides some summary statistics for the five water providers in kelowna the city of kelowna city rutland waterworks district rww south east kelowna irrigation district sekid black mountain irrigation district bmid and the glenmore ellison irrigation district geid the city and rww utilities primarily serve residential water users with other including industry and institutions the next most prominent category of users the remaining three have agriculture as their largest category of water users with almost four fifths of the water supplied by sekid going to agriculture the high share of agricultural users many of whom are irrigators that use no water during the winter results in the minimum monthly deliveries being a much smaller share of maximum monthly water deliveries for the city and rww utilities water supplies basic human needs some industrial requirements and then discretionary aesthetic and recreational uses landscaping irrigation water conservation particularly in the summer can reduce peak demands and delay expensive infrastructure expansion irrigation demands by contrast are driven by weather and technology and in the short run by weather alone irrigators must provide enough water for their crop to survive and yield meaning that demand can surge in response to weather in a way that cannot be restricted as for landscaping irrigation the ids draw at least a portion of their water from upland reservoirs making them more vulnerable to variations in precipitations than the other two which rely on groundwater and water from a large lake therefore the ids are more likely to impose water use restrictions than the city and rww utilities these facts about the kelowna context suggest that households served by the ids and therefore face a greater risk of experiencing water use restrictions may be induced to make conservation choices similar to those were water is priced by volume the theoretical model developed below explores how the interaction between pricing and the risk of water use restrictions impacts on household adoption of water conserving technologies all the utilities have drought plans which specify progressive sets of water use restrictions and water availability triggers that select the restrictions in force fig 2 shows the trigger graph for the black mountain irrigation district which indicates the reservoir levels that trigger droughts at different times of year the graph reflects the northern climate where peak inflows occur between april and june and peak demand between june and august water use between october to march typically reflects only indoor household and industrial institutional uses which can be sustained by relatively low levels of water in storage in jurisdictions without significant seasonal variations in inflows and demands drought triggers will not vary by time of year 3 literature review charging a volumetric price has been the primary recommendation made by economists to the challenge of managing water scarcity there have been numerous investigations examining the price response of residential water users in a comprehensive review arbués et al 2 indicate that most studies find that the demand for water responds to price although that response is inelastic among other things they suggest that studying the adoption of water efficient technologies is an area in need of further research focusing on aurora colorado kenney et al 33 find that water consumption is influenced by price and water use restrictions with mandatory restrictions being effective while voluntary restrictions far less so they include participation in rebate programs for new technologies as predictors of household water use but do not model the decision to adopt new technologies explicitly they conclude that water use restrictions and pricing policies interact with more aggressive restrictions reducing the impact of pricing on water use the model described below explores the relationship between water price water demand and the probability of restrictions being applied there is a small literature examining the household decision about investment in water using technology renwick and archibald 42 recognize that households choose water conservation technology and water use jointly in a study of two california communities they use a two stage least squares approach where two indoor and two outdoor technology choices are modeled in the first stage with predicted adoption of these technologies becoming an input into the second stage water demand equation in the first stage regressions they find that the marginal price of water and income are both positively related to the adoption of water efficient technologies as are non price policies such as restrictions rationing and rebates as with much of the previous work the demand for water is found to be price inelastic some work has used more extensive data sets millock and nauges 37 and grafton et al 26 used the results of an oecd household survey to examine factors that affect the adoption of household water conservation technologies millock and nauges 37 use independent probit regressions to predict the adoption of four different water conserving technologies finding that respondents who face volumetric prices are more likely to adopt such technologies however volumetric pricing was not necessarily the dominant factor with ownership status and environmental attitudes also playing an important role grafton et al 26 restrict themselves to the subset of the oecd data where water use is also available estimating a model conceptually similar to that of renwick and archibald 42 instrumenting for the presence of water conserving technologies the demand for water is once again found to be price inelastic of the three water saving technologies considered water conserving toilets water conserving showers and rainwater tanks only water conserving toilets had a significant impact on water use only three instrumenting variables were used leaving little scope for drawing inference about the household investment decision dupont and renzetti 20 use canadian data to examine the adoption of indoor and outdoor water conservation technologies among their key findings are that water price plays an important part in predicting the presence of water conserving investments and adoption of water conserving behaviors while non price policies have no significant effect they also find that indoor water conservation activities are correlated as are outdoor water conservation activities focusing specifically on water saving landscaping fan et al 21 find that households with a greater concern about drought are more likely to adopt drought tolerant landscaping dean et al 18 find that water knowledge together with experiencing water restrictions is positively related to the adoption of water conserving technologies brent 10 finds that conversion to water saving landscaping is affected by water price but do not consider water use restrictions martínez espiñeira et al 36 find evidence that pro environmental investments including water efficient appliances is positively influenced by income however they lack information on price or on experience with restrictions so do not consider these effects pérez urdiales and garcía valiñas 40 consider the relationship between investment in water conserving technologies and the adoption of water saving behaviors they find that behaviors reinforce the technological effect for technologies that use electricity and water while behaviors offset the technological effect for technologies that only conserve water as they are using cross sectional survey data within one spanish city impacts of water use restrictions are not considered this recent work has identified attitude knowledge and income effects on conservation investments together with interactions between technologies and between technologies and behaviors however rationing policy impacts have not been considered the present research addresses this gap 4 model modeling the household water conservation technology adoption decision has received limited attention however there is a significant literature examining the household energy conservation adoption decision a key insight behind these modeling efforts was the recognition that households do not consume energy rather they consume services which are produced by combining labor capital and energy e g 30 a number of studies therefore adopt a household production function approach credited to becker 5 which explicitly models this form of the household decision problem examples include willett and naghshpour 49 flaig 23 hansen 28 oikonomou et al 38 brenčič and young 11 and halvorsen and larsen 27 many of these studies set up the model framework then assume a solution exists in order to motivate the variables that are included in a regression model these studies have typically not considered energy use restrictions as in developed countries these are comparatively rare however such restrictions are a key element of water management and the model in this paper is developed to explore the role that these restrictions play a basic becker model defines the household utility function as u z 1 z 2 τ with z 1and z 2 being household produced goods and τ a taste parameter the production functions are z i g i x i t i φ i where x i is a purchased input t i is time and φ i is a measure of production efficiency the household has a time budget constraint t t 1 t 2 h where h is hours of wage labor applying an appropriate budget constraint one can solve for derived demand functions for the purchased input x i and household production time t i extensions of this approach allow a market good to substitute for the household produced good and allow time and or other inputs to also have a direct utility impact such as when the household production activity generates some enjoyment e g gardening for our modeling purposes assume that households receive utility from two sources water related services and a composite commodity similar to 29 the water service production function is given by h h w t where w and t are the effective water and effective time that the household devotes to the production of household services while energy is an important input for some water services such as showering and laundry for a number of activities that involve substantial volumes of water toilet flushing lawn irrigation washing vehicles and driveways it isn t water use restrictions are often focused on outdoor water use and therefore we do not include energy in the model effective water is given by w vw and effective time is given by t st where w and t are the actual amounts of water and time used in the production of water services and v and s are the water and time augmentation factors factor augmenting technical change represented in this form was introduced into the macroeconomics literature by authors such as rose 44 kamien and schwartz 31 and binswanger 6 and was applied in a household production model for energy and time use by binswanger 7 for our purposes these factors themselves are the output of a production function of the form v s g k b v k b s k b where k is the capital invested in enhancing the efficiency of water service production b is the bias of that efficiency investment towards augmenting water and g is a vector valued function the function g k b is defined such that g 0 0 1 1 along with v k 0 and s k 0 the marginal effect of b however depends on the nature of the joint production function for v and s water conservation investments are generally discrete the additional cost of a water saving toilet relative to a normal toilet for example the total capital devoted to water services consists of a portfolio of capital goods toilets laundry machines outdoor landscaping and irrigation etc opportunities exist to invest in more efficient capital for most of these services a similar portfolio approach to appliance choice was used in dubin and mcfadden 19 in the current model the time or water saving bias refers to the overall bias of this portfolio rather than any single item the household has a budget constraint given by y z pw qt rk where y is total income which is divided between the composite good z with a price of one expenditures on water pw the opportunity cost of water services production time qt and the rental cost of the capital used for water

optimization problem are 8 p vu h h w u z 9 q su h h t u z 10 r u h wh w v k th t s k u z 11 0 wh w v b th t s k if we assume diminishing marginal utility in z and h and diminishing marginal productivity of the water service production function in w and t then we would find the standard results that own demands are downward sloping the modeled households are supplied water by a utility that manages uncertain water availability using a drought response plan with water use restrictions to model the impact of these water use restrictions the decision variables are divided into those that occur prior to the drought stage being revealed and those that occur after it is logical to have conservation capital and the bias of that capital chosen prior to knowing if a water use restriction is in force and water services production time after for simplicity we also put the water use decision prior to knowing whether or not water use will be restricted rather than actual water use we refer to this as planned water use the amount of water the household plans to use if its water use is not restricted this is loosely analogous to water using capacity where households are assumed to fully utilize their capacity when there are no restrictions in place with this assumption we avoid modeling capacity separately from water use and thereby avoid evaluating multiple inequality constraints in the states possible after water inflows are known this simplification means that the cost of maintaining excess capacity to increase water use during a capacity restriction is manifest as the cost of utilizing additional water when there are no restrictions the drought response plan is managed by a water utility that supplies water to a set of households let that set of households be indexed by i where i n let w i be the planned water used of household i for its water service production with w as the vector of all individual planned water uses total water use within the utility service area is then i w where i is a unit vector let the water available to be distributed between the households w range from ω to w the minimum amount of water that will be available in any season is ω while the storage capacity of the water utility w determines the upper limit on what is available to households the utility aims to maintain a safe margin m to accommodate things like environmental flows temporary system failures etc inflows into water storage are distributed with probability density f x and cumulative density f x the water available to distribute is therefore w w with probability f w and equal to w with probability 1 f w the water utility has a three stage drought response plan stage n no restrictions household planned water use is w i stage p proportional reduction relative to unrestricted households can use θ w i triggered when w i w m stage a absolute restriction households can use w triggered when w θ i w m using a proportional stage and an absolute stage is a coarse representation loosely consistent with many drought response plans as in the example above there are typically multiple stages with progressively tighter limits on what water users can do the least strict water use restrictions often limit the frequency with which water using activities can be undertaken in effect reducing the capacity to use water for the model the household is only able to use a fraction θ of the water that they would use were the restriction not in place it is assumed that these drought trigger stages are calculated based on knowledge of planned water use but prior to realizing reservoir storage with the requirement that in no drought stage will households have to use less than the amount they are entitled to during that drought stage the amount of water that a household receives is not further adjusted after the amount available has been realized the time applied to the production of water services is chosen after the realization of the water availability w the time used is conditional on the amount of water used which depends on the drought stage in all three drought stages an interior solution for t is assumed and those interior solutions are described by water service time demand functions t n q w k b t p q θ w k b and t a q w k b and realized water use can be defined as w n w w p θ w and w a w where superscripts indicate the drought stage the expected utility for an individual household is 12 u f w a u a f w p f w a u p 1 f w p u n if w p w f w a u a 1 f w a u p if w a w w p u a if w w a where f w is the cumulative density function for inflows to the reservoir w a θ w i m w p w i m and superscripts a p and n indicate that the utility is evaluated using input vectors w t a k b θ w t p k b and w t n k b respectively the three parts of the expected utility in eq 12 reflect the relationship between the storage capacity and the demands when w p w there is a probability 1 f w p that enough water will be collected in the reservoir for all households to use the amount of water they planned to use however for reservoir capacity w a w w p there is never enough water to consume the planned water use the water system is on a permanent drought stage one finally if w w a then the reservoir is so small relative to planned water use that each water user is strictly rationed to use only w units of water fig 3 illustrates the sequence of events in the model prior to the water inflow level being realized households choose conservation capital k the bias of that capital b and the amount of water that they plan to use when there are no water use restrictions while households choose their planned water use taking the trigger levels as exogenous the water utility is assumed to know the planned water use and sets the trigger level based on the planned water use the household planned water use therefore determines the number of possible states that the household can be in after inflows are determined realization of inflows into the reservoir determine which state the system is in conditional on the state and therefore the amount of water that the household can actually use the household chooses how much time to apply to the production of water services 5 illustrative example 5 1 function specification and parameterization to illustrate results we turn to a simple parameterized version of the model the parameters are chosen to highlight key results some empirical implications are examined in the following section 13 u z h 20 ln z h 14 h w t k b vw δ 2 st δ 2 1 δ 15 v k b 1

in the numeraire good the utility contribution of water services increases in the level of these services at a decreasing rate water services production eq 14 is a constant elasticity of substitution

a diminishing marginal product of capital with bias shifting the capital in favor of water augmentation b 0 or time augmentation b 0 a more general specification is described in appendix c water inflows follow a log pearson type iii distribution which is frequently used for modeling hydrologic processes 8 3 24 if a variable x is distributed following a pearson type iii distribution then the logarithm of that variable is distributed as a log pearson type iii distribution the density function for the log pearson type iii distribution is 17 f x ν κ ω κ κ ln x ω ν 1 x γ ν e κ ln x ω 18 γ ν 0 x ν 1 e z dz where ν 0 is known as the shape parameter κ as the rate parameter ω is a threshold parameter that defines the range of the distribution as ω γ ν is the gamma function when κ 0 the distribution is positively skewed shape rate and threshold values see table 2 are chosen to represent a low inflow and a high inflow case where the probability that the reservoir is filled is greater for the high inflow parameterization for the low inflow specification at p q 1 the probability of no restriction is 70 and the probability of an absolute restriction is 0 3 at the same price levels the high inflow distribution has a greater than 99 probability of no restriction and less than 1 0 10 8 probability of absolute restriction equilibria for this system were identified through an iterative process solved using the pracma library 9 in r 41 parameters for the log pearson type iii distribution were identified using functions in the fadist package 4 the iteration was initiated by choosing levels for w a and w p given these values the household problem is solved first order conditions found in appendix b this is a two stage problem first optimal values for t are identified for each state given t the expected utility is maximized by choice of w k and b with w a and w p taken as fixed feasibility of the solution is then assessed by comparing nw with w p m and θ nw with w a m values for w a and w p are then updated and the process repeated until the totals match within an acceptable tolerance this same process is used for solutions where w a w w p by iterating over values of w a 5 2 no uncertainty before examining the role of uncertainty and water use restrictions the model is solved with no restrictions absent restrictions the system is solved for the four variables simultaneously results are shown in fig 4 for all four control variables for partial substitution between water and time ρ 0 5 partial complementarity ρ 2 and neither ρ 0 water use is inversely related to price over the entire range of prices examined panel a the responsiveness to water price changes is increasing in the degree of substitutability when water is a more effective substitute for time in producing water services dropping the price of water results in a larger increase in water use the time devoted to water services production is shown in panel b when water and time are neither substitutes nor complements time used decreases as price increases as the price of water falls the utility contribution of water services increases and households spend more time on water service production activities and reduce consumption of the composite good this response is more pronounced when water and time are complements when water and time are substitutes time is increasing in the price of water as expected cheaper water leads the household to substitute water for time when conservation capital is factor augmenting equilibrium levels of conservation capital decline as the price of water increases panel c this result is inconsistent with the empirical analyses reviewed earlier if conservation capital is factor augmenting then the value of owning this capital is increasing in the amount of water used some forms of water conserving capital are certainly factor augmenting a low flow shower head and a water conserving toilet increase the efficiency with which water can deliver personal cleaning and waste disposal they do not eliminate the need for some water and there are few practical technologies that are able to do so drought resistant landscaping and the extreme case of replacing landscaping with gravel or paving is closer to a substitution of water using capital by capital that does not use water however most households retain some landscaping plants that require some supplemental water suggesting that in terms of the services provided drought resistant landscaping is not a perfect substitute for outdoor water use an alternative formulation of the model was explored using a constant elasticity of substitution between water time and conservation capital for the cobb douglas implementation δ 0 the demand for conservation capital remains downward sloping in the price of water the linear version δ 1 has only corner solutions with threshold price ranges where one of water time or capital are the only inputs into the production of water services the model can be tuned to find a degree of substitution that generates interior solutions with a demand for conservation capital that is upward sloping in the price to conserve space we do not present such results and only discuss their implications where appropriate our model explores the equilibrium demand for water excess to basic human needs as formulated the utility from water services goes to zero as water services produced goes to zero however the formulation also has an infinite marginal utility from water services at zero so as constructed water services production will never go to zero if capital is a substitute for water rather than water augmenting in the present model the investment in water conservation capital would increase as the price of water increases and water use falls a more realistic construction would have a finite marginal utility at zero water services and a choke price for water above which no water excess to basic human needs is used if water is required together with water conservation capital to produce household water services then above this choke price for water water conserving capital would also not be purchased if water is too expensive to irrigate the lawn then the home owner will not purchase a moisture probe managed irrigation timer to enhance the efficiency of lawn watering therefore for some high enough price of water the demand for water conserving capital will fall with further price increases the final panel shows the bias of the conservation capital when water and time are complements increasing the price of water shifts the bias towards water saving when water is cheap and time is a complement time is augmented to increase its contribution to water services production and when water is expensive the converse occurs when water and time are substitutes the effect is opposite when water is expensive time is augmented to offset the utility lost by using less water taken together with the results shown in the other panel fig 4 shows that the model behaves as expected when conservation capital is modeled as augmenting water or time in the household level production of a water service 5 3 drought stage trigger levels for this simplified model seasonal variation in water inflows and demand is not considered the trigger graph shown in panel a of fig 5 therefore has no temporal variation when uncertain inflows are included in the model w k and b are chosen and w p and w a are calculated before the reservoir level is known in panel a to the right of w p the total water consumed is nw between w a and w p total water consumed is θ nw where θ 0 1 below w a total water use is n w since w p and w a depend on w the trigger levels will move as w responds to changes in the price of water or other model parameters panel b of fig 5 shows the two parameterizations of the log pearson type iii distribution the values for w p and w a marked on the graph are for the low inflow distribution and correspond to those in panel a shifts in w will lead to movements of w p and w a changing the probability of being in the different drought stages fig 6 plots the drought stage trigger levels as a function of the water price for both the low and high inflow distributions as the price of water falls planned water use increases and consequently the trigger level increases in the upper portion of each plot where w p w both triggers are relevant with the low inflow distribution the probability that the reservoir is filled is low and therefore when w p grows to exceed w there is a large probability that the household will be under a drought restriction and optimizing water use in the face of this restriction plays a significant role in the selection of planned water use shifting the water price down to a level where water restrictions always apply eliminates an option that the household is not often able to act on and therefore does not have much weight in the choice of w therefore the tighter trigger level w a does not increase much at the price level where w p is no longer less than w the range where w p w and w a w is larger for the low inflow distribution than it is for the high inflow distribution this is mostly a consequence of the higher probability of realized inflows resulting in water restrictions and consequently planned water use being enlarged to reduce the impact of being in the restricted state the price at which w p increases to exceed w is higher with the low inflow distribution on the other end the low inflow distribution translates into a higher probability that inflows are below w a and therefore the utility contribution from the proportional restriction state is less and the resulting planned water use is also less taken together the price at which the unrestricted state is lost is higher for the low inflow case and the price at which the absolute restriction is always in force occurs at a lower price for the low inflow case in contrast with panel a the high inflow distribution results in panel b reflect the fact that when the price falls to the point where w p first exceeds w there is still a large probability that the reservoir will fill equilibria for a water price just below the level where w p w have a probability 1 f w a of being in the proportional restriction state a probability that is much larger than the f w p f w a probability for prices just above the transition the large increase in the weight placed on utility from the proportionally restricted state leads to a large increase in planned water use across this transition since w a θ n w m the increase in w is manifest as a large increase in w a two equilibria with slightly different water prices can have substantially different water restriction thresholds these results show that the equilibrium drought stage trigger graph is determined by the interaction of the water price the water inflow distribution and the water storage capacity household water use is chosen partly in response to the probability that the household will be subject to a water restriction given the standard assumptions of a positive marginal utility from water for all levels of planned water use it follows that the more likely a household is to be in the proportional restriction state the higher planned water use will be when a substantial portion of the inflow distribution probability mass lies below the storage capacity then the planned water use decision becomes dominated by the probability of being in the proportional restriction state while there is still a positive probability of being in the unrestricted state in contrast when the balance of the probability mass lies beyond the storage capacity the probability of being in the proportional restriction state takes a large step up when the price falls to the level where unrestricted state no longer occurs the way that the water price and planned water use interact with the utility s drought stage trigger levels jointly determines planned water use and those trigger levels in a system with a risk of drought restrictions observed equilibrium water demand is a function of both household preferences and water supply conditions 5 4 planned water use and conservation capital panel a in fig 7 shows planned water use given the implied trigger levels relative to reservoir capacity planned water use is shown for both the low and high inflow probability since the trigger levels are functions of planned water use the planned water use curves have shapes similar in form to the trigger stages at high prices planned water use is low enough that it is rare that a drought stage will be triggered as the price falls planned water use in the low inflow equilibria increases more rapidly than for the high inflow equilibria for the low inflow equilibria the higher probability of being in the proportional restriction leads to an increase in planned water use prior to the trigger level exceeding the reservoir capacity which is greater than that for the high inflow case increasing planned water use translates into using more water in the proportional restriction state since the proportional restriction state is less likely for the high inflow case this incentive does not manifest itself as strongly as the low inflow planned water use has already adjusted upwards the actual use in the proportional restriction state isn t much below that when the unrestricted state is unavailable and therefore there is what appears as a large downward step when the proportionally reduced planned water use is displayed in contrast for the high inflow case when the price falls to the point that planned use exceeds reservoir capacity there is a large increase in planned use this is visible as a much smaller leftward shift in planned water use in all cases planned water use is monotonic within a set of drought stages comparing planned water use in fig 7 with that in fig 4 one sees that planned water use is greater with the risk of drought restrictions than without the highly elastic portion of the planned water use is driven in part by the effective reduction in the cost of planned water use as the probability of being in the unrestricted state falls in effect as modeled the cost of capacity is increasing per unit of capacity the more often that capacity is used this is somewhat unrealistic unless the cost of capacity is closely tied to the rate of use however that planned water use capacity increases as the probability of being restricted increases is not unrealistic these results highlight the important role of the cost of installing excess capacity for example where irrigation systems are concerned if installing a system with larger diameter pipes and nozzles that can deliver more water per unit of time doesn t increase costs significantly then the greater the probability of having water use restricted the more likely that households will invest in greater capacity if water use capacity was chosen separately from actual water use then water use in the unrestricted state would be less than capacity and when the drought stage specifies that only a portion of the capacity be utilized the actual reduction in water use will be less than the proportional reduction in capacity use permitted assessments of mandatory drought restrictions in colorado in 2002 by kenney et al 34 are consistent with this result they find that restricting lawn watering to once every three days 66 6 reduction in capacity reduces per capita water use by an average of 22 and twice per week restrictions 71 reduction reduces water use by 33 for lafayette which imposed one day per week watering 86 reduction water use declined by 56 while these reductions are based on total water use not outdoor water use that the water savings are far less than the reduction in allowed use suggests that users are increasing the intensity of their watering when they are allowed to do so similarly kenney et al 33 found that residents of aurora colorado reduced water use by about 12 in response to a variety of outdoor watering restrictions applied over a two and a half year period aurora is primarily a community of single family residential homes and restrictions ranged from three days per week to outright bans they also demonstrated that pricing and restrictions interact with price having reduced influence when restrictions are binding survis and root 47 also find that watering restrictions are not particularly effective for two florida communities in an analysis that considers self supplied water and the fact that watering restrictions address timing and not volume used these results suggest that in many communities home owners have slack capacity which can be used when watering restrictions are implemented our model results suggest that this excess capacity is more likely to be installed if it is cheap and that the effectiveness of restrictions can be enhanced if capacity is more directly controlled introducing a risk of a water restriction substantially changes the relationship between the price of water and the investment in conservation capital when the price of water is low planned water use is high high planned water use translates into a high probability that water use will be restricted households anticipate that they are likely unable to use the amount of water they would like to and therefore do not invest as much in conservation capital increasing the price of water reduces planned water use which reduces the probability of having water use restricted which in turn increases the value of water augmenting conservation capital investment therefore increases as the price of water increases as the price is increased further the probability of being restricted falls enough that in most situations households are able to use the amount of water they planned to use investment in conservation capital then falls as the price of water further increases as in the model without inflow uncertainty see fig 4 this result is consistent with the kelowna data where providers that charge a volumetric price and almost never impose water use restrictions have the same average investment in conservation capital related to water use as providers that charge a flat rate but are more likely to impose restrictions if conservation capital substitutes for water then the demand for conservation capital will be upward sloping in the price of water this is loosely consistent with the results of millock and naug 37 and dupont and renzetti 20 who find that investment in conservation capital tends to be higher where volumetric prices are charged if one ignores the role of restrictions if water use restrictions are an important risk factor then the observed demand for conservation capital should be decreasing in the price of water lower water prices translate into a higher demand for water and a higher probability of being restricted as a substitute for water conservation capital is more important to supplying household water services when there is a greater probability that water will be restricted as the price for water is increased the probability of facing a restriction is reduced and consequently the value of conservation capital as a substitute for water falls only when the water price is high enough that there is little probability of facing a water restriction will substituting conservation capital for water to reduce the water bill become important in contrast when conservation capital is water augmenting then when water prices are low the demand for conservation capital is increasing in the price of water whether conservation capital is water augmenting or a substitute the results developed here suggest that the relationship between the demand for conservation capital and the price of water will depend on the likelihood that water use restrictions are used to manage demand where restrictions are common the equilibrium relationship between investment in conservation capital and the price of water is likely to work in the opposite direction than prevails when restrictions are rare cross sectional analyses such as those of millock and nauges 37 grafton et al 26 and dupont and renzetti 20 should recognize these differences beyond this simple impact of water use restrictions we may also expect the types of conservation investments to vary based on climate and the water system infrastructure where rainfall is reasonably common irrigation needs will be low and conservation investments will focus on indoor use in contrast where conditions are more arid conservation investments are more likely to focus on outdoor uses these investments themselves may differ in the degree to which they are water augmenting or substitute for water millock and nauges 37 do not include climate variables in their regression results and grafton et al 26 do not describe including climate variables in their instrumenting strategy beyond capturing them through a regional penetration variable they constructed dupont and renzetti 20 include rainfall and degree days as explanatory variables interacting these variables with water price would indicate if the price response changes when outdoor water scarcity is more important including a variable reflecting the prevalence of water use restrictions and interacting this variable with the price of water could reveal more information about the nature of conservation investments and how those investments respond to price and the risk of facing restrictions the results reported by kenney et al 33 reinforce the need to consider the interaction between water use restrictions and price rather than treating them independently and or ignoring the role of restrictions the motivation for the model developed here is the interaction between outdoor water use restrictions and household investment in conservation capital this is relevant in many arid communities in the developed world where there is typically more than enough capacity to supply basic human needs however it is not uncommon for water supplies in developing countries to be intermittent investments in enhancing capacity are manifest as storage tanks while water conserving toilets limited flow showers etc are investments in conservation capital to stretch out the supply in these contexts where metering and volumetric charges are often not in place the risk of supply interruption is likely the main motivator for investment in conservation capital 5 5 conservation capital and water bias fig 8 shows equilibrium conservation capital panel a and the water saving bias panel b of that capital for the low inflow case for different elasticities of substitution between water and time in household water services production when water prices are high and therefore the probability of facing restrictions is low the direction of the bias follows the same pattern for the model solved with no risk of water use restrictions fig 4 as with capital the direction of the relationship between bias and water price reverses when the price falls low enough for restrictions to be common when the risk of water use restrictions are high then households emphasize investments that best offset the impact of the restrictions if water and time are complements δ 0 and if water use is restricted then the household will invest in augmenting the services provided by water the augmented water can be combined with an unrestricted amount of time to produce more water services if water and time are substitutes δ 0 then households invest in augmenting time increasing the role of time in the production of household water services when water use is restricted the amount of investment also reflects the impact of restrictions when water and time are complements the restricted availability of water limits the effectiveness of augmenting time in producing household water services resulting in a large drop in conservation investment when water and time are substitutes investing in augmenting water increases effective water which substitutes for the more costly time input as constructed households in this model are identical these last results suggest what may be observed with heterogeneous households one important type of heterogeneity is the value of time households that have a higher opportunity cost for time devoted to the production of household water services would show a qualitatively similar effect to the difference between equilibria when water prices are lowered this bias is manifest in the choice of conservation capital that the household invests in households with a high value of time would be more likely to invest in conservation capital that also saves time or at the least does not use more time high efficiency laundry machines irrigation timing converting yards to forms that require no time gravel paved etc households with a lower value of time would be more likely to invest in conservation capital that uses more time such as rain barrels low flow shower heads etc 6 some preliminary empirical results there are several empirical predictions that follow from the model a the impact of water price on the adoption of water conserving technology should be larger were water use restrictions are more common b the own price elasticity of demand for water will depend on the likelihood of water use restrictions c the water using capacity of the household water using capital should be increasing in the likelihood of water use restrictions and d the bias towards water or time saving in the portfolio of water conserving capital will depend on the relationship between the opportunity cost of household production time and the price of water from the summer of 2009 through to the fall of 2010 a sample of kelowna residents was invited to participate in a household survey the sample was build from a list of addresses and telephone numbers harvested from the website canada411 http www canada411 com keyed on the forward sortation area identifiers in the postal code for kelowna addresses http www canadapost ca the survey instrument was designed in consultation with several local water use experts for content and tested with a small set of volunteers for comprehension it included nine distinct sections 1 household characteristics 2 water source 3 water quality 4 water conservation 5 water issue familiarity 6 views about the environment 7 views on the water conservation behavior of others 8 perceptions about okanagan water issues and 9 demographics the survey itself was built as a web form that connected with a dedicated database designed and implemented by the author the final sample included 516 mostly complete surveys with 387 representing single family homes occupied by the owner analysis of the data collection in this survey inspired to the development of the analytical model presented above and therefore was not collected to test the predictions of that analytical model table 3 shows the total number of respondents who own and occupy single family residences reporting that they undertake each of the listed conservation investments or activities the time column captures the author s subjective judgment about whether the investment saves or uses time relative to not undertaking the conservation activity using income data or proxying for income with assessed value of the home and relating that to a measure constructed from the reported conservation investments and behaviors can provide at least a preliminary indication of consistency with model predictions assessed value is used as a proxy for income to account for the fact that a number of households refuse to report their income a simple indicator of the time saving or time using bias of the conservation choices was constructed from the survey data each conservation choice was subjectively appraised as time using or time saving for each category of conservation choices a relative time saving or time using variable was created for each household by adding up the number of time saving or time using activities and normalizing by the total number of time saving or time using activities that could have been chosen explicitly y i s j s y j s s where s u is the set of water saving using activities possible y j i 1 if household i reports activity j and s u is the count of water saving using activities a binary indicator was then formed for each category saving or using set to zero if time using exceeded time saving and one if time saving exceeded time using with observations where they were equal mostly both time saving and time using choices equal to zero dropped for outdoor choices and behavior choices indoor conservation choices did not have any time saving options so the cases where no time using choices were made were set equal to one using probit regressions this indicator was regressed on assessed value of the property and the number representing the self reported income category results are shown in table 4 similar results are found when the logarithm of income is used and the logarithm of the midpoint of the income interval for assessed value households with higher assessed property value or higher reported income are more likely to have made conservation choices that tend toward saving time this pattern continues for outdoor investments and behaviors when income categories are used but the sign changes for indoor investments studies of the relationship between time saving and investment in energy conservation e g 7 11 suggest a time rebound effect that increases energy use there would seem to be scope for carefully examining these issues in water use as well for example have showers which enable more rapid and convenient bathing increased the amount of bathing and therefore not realized the water savings that they would have had absent a rebound effect see 40 7 extensions and limitations the model results are comparisons of static equilibria the dynamic process of capital accumulation is not considered some authors have suggested that this dynamic process is important e g 29 many capital goods that have a bearing on household water use are quite long lived toilets fixtures etc can often last for decades and with care many appliances can as well landscaping can last for many years and the irrigation systems that support landscaping can as well households would typically replace a capital item that is used to produce water services when it fails or when a major renovation is being undertaken it may be more appropriate to use a vintage capital model where households add to an existing and depreciating capital stock and shift an existing bias of that capital stock in the present model water using capacity is essentially costless households choose the amount of water they plan to use and only pay based on what they actually use in reality households do face capacity constraints a function of water pressure pipe diameter etc some of this capacity can be adjusted such as installing larger diameter pipes as part of an irrigation system or installing multiple shower heads in the same shower others cannot easily be adjusted such as the diameter of the pipe supplying the house and the pressure of that water these physical limits mean that households could not choose capacities as large as the model permitted the actual behavior at the transitions between drought stages would therefore be less pronounced including capacity as a choice and incorporating a set of inequality constraints would better represent reality but at the cost of greater complexity and computational challenges we have not considered the utility value generated by water conservation there is a considerable literature on factors that encourage pro environmental behavior examples include 1 12 13 15 14 16 in many communities including kelowna the financial return from investing in water conservation is generally negative for any reasonable discount rate the price of water is simply too low to make saving money on the water bill a reason to invest in water conservation investments in water conservation are driven by influences other than cost savings we have omitted non economic considerations from our model however the actual decision to invest will depend on privately held attitudes beliefs and social pressures in addition to economic incentives the present result highlights that even when focusing on the economic incentives alone the behavior may not be as simple as seeking to reduce one s water bill in the model the water utility is a passive entity that simply sets the drought trigger levels in reality the utility is a player in a game with the households choosing the drought trigger levels the number of trigger levels the set of restrictions to be implemented resources to be devoted to enforcement any subsidies for conservation investments regulations pertaining to water delivery capacity at the property boundary and of course the price charged for water where the utility is part of a government responsible for local zoning and building code requirements the managing entity also controls variables like lot size landscaping requirements etc that impact on water use an important extension of this work is to identify the optimal mix of policies that a utility can undertake of course this also means specifying an objective for the utility that objective likely differs based on the type of governance private firm independent utility or part of a town or city adding another level of complexity finally this modeling exercise was motivated by the case of water utilities however the results may have application beyond water that the relationship between the water price and water conservation investments need not be monotonic is likely worth paying attention to in all situations where the price of one good is seen as influencing the demand for another likewise the nature of the relationship between conservation investments and resource use needs to be considered carefully the price of electricity and the choice of appliances the price of motor vehicle fuel and the importance of fuel efficiency in vehicle choice etc may also have these effects in developed nations rationing restrictions are not nearly as common with other services such as electricity as they are for water large interconnected electricity grids enable electricity to be moved around quickly in response to demand changes and there is typically enough generating capacity that it is rare that generation cannot be ramped up as necessary however in developing nations where electricity supplies are less dependable and where demand surges can lead to system failure some of the same effects noted here may also be present battery systems that are charged when electricity is available to provide power when the grid is down are expensive and create waste losses in the charging and discharging processes compact fluorescent and led lighting are electricity augmenting investments while substituting propane and or kerosene for heating and lighting is more consistent with simple notions of substitution applying some of the ideas developed here to an analysis of developing nation electricity markets and electricity using capital purchasing decisions may be another fruitful area of inquiry 8 conclusion households rationally consider the risk of water rationing when planning water use and choosing investments related to household water service production we develop a model where households consume water services and a numeraire good and those services are produced with capital that combines water and time model results support the view that households will increase their capacity to use water as a means of minimizing the impact of water use restrictions it is demonstrated that when conservation investments are water augmenting investment in conservation is increasing in the price of water when those price increases translate into a reduced probability of facing water restrictions while investment is decreasing in the price of water when there is little risk of water use restrictions this result is expected to be opposite when conservation investments strongly substitute for water results also demonstrate that the degree to which time and water are substitutes in the household production of water services determines the strength of the response of investment to water price changes results also suggest that the type of conservation investment households choose to make may depend on their value of time some recent empirical work has found that the likelihood of adopting water conservation technologies by households is greater where water is priced volumetrically beyond some use of weather variables this work has typically not considered interactions between pricing and the likelihood of water use restrictions data collected in kelowna british columbia comparing water utilities that price volumetrically and typically do not impose water use restrictions with utilities that do not charge volumetrically but are more likely to impose water use restrictions shows no difference in the adoption of water conservation technologies investigations into household water conservation investments should recognize the interaction between price and water use restrictions particularly as water use restrictions are the fallback response when pricing and other measures have not been sufficient to bring demand in line with available supply practitioners should likewise keep in mind that household water use decisions and water conservation investment decisions are made in response to the entire suite of policies that utilities use and that some of these policies such as pricing and water use restrictions may interact in ways that compound or offset their individual effects acknowledgements funding for collecting the data reported in this paper was provided by the social sciences and humanities research council of canada and by the university of british columbia i am grateful to my graduate students and discussants at conferences where this work has been presented for useful comments i am also grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their suggestions which substantially improved the document remaining errors and oversights are my own appendix a sources and service areas for kelowna water utilities fig a 9 shows the service areas and water catchment areas for the five water providers that supply most of the residents of kelowna two water providers city and rww do not have upland catchment areas city draws water from okanagan lake while rww draws its water from wells near mission creek the largest stream draining the uplands east of the city these two sources are highly dependable the remaining three water providers originally supplied water primarily to irrigators collecting water from upland catchment areas east of the city over the years as the population of kelowna grew an increasing number of residents settled in the service areas supplied by these three providers the amount of water the irrigation districts have available to deliver depends on the amount and form of the precipitation that falls the role of amount is obvious the form of the precipitation is important as precipitation that comes as snow is naturally stored until it melts the uplands themselves are to a great extent a gently rolling plateau making it costly to construct large volume storage when winters are warm and precipitation is dominated by rain the irrigation and improvement districts may not have enough water in storage to supply the demands for the season and with several such winters in a row there is a high likelihood that reserves will be drawn down a hot and dry summer will then almost certainly lead to water rationing climate change promises to reduce the share of winter precipitation that falls as snow potentially increasing the risk of water shortages appendix b system first order conditions system solutions are found by simultaneously solving all three first order conditions given the inflow distribution the trigger levels and the derived demand for time used in water services production the three different first order conditions for w k and b can be written as b 1 u w f w p f w a u p w f w a u a u p 1 f w p u n w f w p u p u n if w p w 1 f w a u p w f w a u a u p otherwise 0 if w w a b 2 u k f w a u a k f w p f w a u p k 1 f w p u n k if w p w f w a u a k 1 f w a u p k otherwise u a k if w w a b 3 u b f w a u a b f w p f w

u h i superscripts on h have the same interpretation as for u while v and s are only functions of variables chosen prior to the realization of the water available there are three equilibria one for each of the three possible drought stage combinations when w p w and all three drought stages can occur the equilibrium is a vector w k b w a w p of values such that the appropriate first order conditions in eqs b 1 b 2 and b 3 are satisfied together with i w w p m and θ i w w a m when storage capacity satisfies w a w w p such that only drought stages p and a can occur the equilibrium is the vector w k b w a of values where the appropriate first order conditions are satisfied and θ i w w a m finally when w w a and water is always strictly rationed equilibrium is a vector w k b where w i w for each water user and the appropriate first order conditions for k and b are satisfied appendix c factor augmentation production function one particular challenge in creating a workable example was finding a functional form for the water and time augmentation functions we chose to define the function relating conservation investment and factor augmentation as c 1 v s 1 ρ v ke b e b μ e b σ v 1 ρ s ke b μ e b e b σ s this specification has several useful properties first if there is no investment in conservation k 0 then it follows that v 1 and s 1 bias shifts the orientation of the investment between the two factor augmentation terms when b then v 1 ρ v k σ v and s 1 the converse is true when b numerically this is convenient as it ensures that there is nowhere that the function is undefined there are five parameters in this function ρ v ρ s σ v σ s and μ the first two define the steepness of the response to k while the second two define the curvature of that response the parameter μ controls the degree of complementarity in the production of the factor augmentation this can be shown if we define the bias adjusted water saving investment as k v ke b e b μ e b and k s analogously when μ 1 then k v k s k for all values of b if μ 1 then k v k s k which implies that the time and water augmenting effects of that investment interfere with each other in contrast when 0 μ 1 then k v k s k now the time and water augmenting effects are reinforcing 
8722,water rationing is the ultimate demand management strategy which must be used when all other strategies have failed to keep demand below the available supply most household water consumption is used for the production of services e g bathing laundry and irrigation of landscaping typically using capital goods e g showers appliances and irrigation systems to combine time water and sometimes energy the likelihood households will face rationing depends at least in part on the success of the other demand management strategies such as pricing the household choice of time allocation planned water use and water and time augmenting conservation capital investment is modeled as a household production problem in an environment with a risk of water use restrictions a utility manages the levels at which restrictions are imposed and equilibria are identified where these restriction trigger levels are consistent with household planned water use when conservation capital is water augmenting demand for capital is decreasing in the price of water and in the likelihood of restrictions being applied if water demand is decreasing in water price then increasing water prices reduces the likelihood of restrictions being applied and can reverse the relationship between water price and the demand for conservation capital empirical investigations into household investment in conservation capital should account for the likelihood that households face water use restrictions and practitioners should be aware that the effectiveness of campaigns to encourage greater investment in conservation capital may depend on both how water is priced and how it is rationed keywords water demand drought restrictions household production conservation capital water conservation 1 introduction the average human nutritional need for water is less than four liters per day 45 daily per capita water use in most parts of the world is far above this often by at least an order of magnitude 50 this water is used to provide services ranging from basic hygiene and sanitation to irrigating landscaping and filling swimming pools with by far the largest share of household water use being for service production the demand for water is perhaps best understood as a derived demand derived from the demand for the services of water households use assets they own to combine water and time and in some cases energy to produce these services the services produced and the required mix of water and time depends on the assets owned some assets such as dual flush toilets save water but may require a bit more cognitive effort in selecting the appropriate button and time for more frequent cleaning similarly low flow shower heads may require more time to remove soap on the yard using rain barrels saves water but requires time for distributing water and cleaning the barrels other assets may save time and water irrigation system timers save time if set to water at night they can save water and if coupled with a moisture probe save even more water planting drought resistant landscaping can save water if less water is applied being drought tolerant it will also be less impacted by supply interruptions however care is more specialized than for lawn requiring time to learn effective management and possibly more time to undertake that management a landscaping company can be hired to save this time but then the effective cost of drought tolerant plantings is larger price has long been advocated as an effective tool for water demand management 39 35 however in many jurisdictions price is only one among a range of tools that water managers use among non price policies mandatory measures are found to be effective at reducing water demand while the results for voluntary measures are mixed 43 33 34 20 most of the work examining price and non price policies has examined the relative effectiveness of these approaches rather than considered interactions between them a gap we attempt to address the ubiquity of non price policies may at least in part reflect the nature of the problem that water managers face water managers are managing the distribution of water to users through a system with a fixed maximum capacity and a risk that natural inflows will not fill the system to capacity they are managing drought risk price and non price demand management policies do not create new water and if they are not effective at bringing demand in line with available supply during a drought then water managers must implement mandatory measures to ration what water there is between users in many jurisdictions drought risk is managed with a set of drought stages and trigger levels based on reservoir levels water table levels stream flows etc that are used to activate different drought stages 22 46 at the initial drought stages voluntary reductions in water use are encouraged at higher drought stages an increasing set of mandatory reductions are implemented in the highest drought stage all but essential water uses are prohibited drought plans and the conditions which trigger the different drought stages are public information considerable effort is generally put into informing water users about what the current drought stage is and how close the system is to the next higher stage water users can therefore be expected to account for this uncertainty in their planned water use in this paper a household production function approach is used to examine how a drought response strategy involving progressively tighter restrictions on water use impacts on planned water use and the investment in water conservation this work provides a theoretical perspective on a thinly studied area of water use residential water conservation investment it is one of a few papers that use the household production function approach to examine water conservation investment e g 28 17 it extends this earlier literature by examining the intersection between water use restrictions and water prices using the household production function approach the results demonstrate that the econometric relationship between water prices and investment in conservation capital can depend on the likelihood that households face water use restrictions and consequently that the success of efforts to encourage household investment in conservation capital may depend on both the price charged for water and the role of water use restrictions the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in the next section empirical results that motivated this investigation are briefly described namely finding no relationship between the price for water and the adoption of water conserving technologies in a community with multiple water providers this is followed by a literature review highlighting that little work has looked at the interaction between water prices and water use restrictions subsequently a theoretical model is developed and then it is parameterized in a way that serves to illustrate the key results the paper then returns briefly to data collected in kelowna british columbia to present a very preliminary examination of one of the model predictions following this limitations and extensions are discussed prior to a brief conclusion 2 empirical context kelowna british columbia canada is a unique community having five major water providers table 1 their existence is a historical accident a consequence of the need for irrigation on the valley floor and the most cost effective way of delivery being gravity from small upland watersheds each of these providers has their own water source and delivery infrastructure and applies its own rate structure two of these bill by volume the remaining three charge a flat rate independent of the amount of water used for the city water is one of many services that are provided the other four utilities are a level of local government enabled by the same legislation under which cities and towns exist 25 these other utilities each have an elected board of trustees that oversees the operations of the utility and approves bylaws that specify the rules and conditions related to the services provided to those served including sanctions for violation of these bylaws these sanctions run from notices through fines and shutting off the water supply to criminal charges and jail time bylaw enforcement officers are responsible for detecting violations and beginning the process of imposing sanctions however since bylaw enforcement rarely enters homes except if there is reason to suspect there is tampering with meters where there are meters or otherwise illegally modifying utility works most enforcement relates to violations of outdoor watering regulations the analytical model explored below was motivated by results from a 2009 survey of household engagement with water conservation undertaken in kelowna among other things the survey asked residents to indicate which activities and or investments they undertook inside and outside the home that could contribute to conserving water fig 1 shows the distribution of the number of conservation choices made in three categories the individual conservation options are below in table 3 the naive expectation was that in those parts of the city where people paid by unit volume the two bottom providers in the figure engagement with water conservation would be greater however results did not bear this out either based on simple comparisons of means or on more sophisticated regression models given how robust this result was perhaps there is something else about the kelowna water supply situation that may induce similar uptake of water conservation among those served across the different providers table 1 provides some summary statistics for the five water providers in kelowna the city of kelowna city rutland waterworks district rww south east kelowna irrigation district sekid black mountain irrigation district bmid and the glenmore ellison irrigation district geid the city and rww utilities primarily serve residential water users with other including industry and institutions the next most prominent category of users the remaining three have agriculture as their largest category of water users with almost four fifths of the water supplied by sekid going to agriculture the high share of agricultural users many of whom are irrigators that use no water during the winter results in the minimum monthly deliveries being a much smaller share of maximum monthly water deliveries for the city and rww utilities water supplies basic human needs some industrial requirements and then discretionary aesthetic and recreational uses landscaping irrigation water conservation particularly in the summer can reduce peak demands and delay expensive infrastructure expansion irrigation demands by contrast are driven by weather and technology and in the short run by weather alone irrigators must provide enough water for their crop to survive and yield meaning that demand can surge in response to weather in a way that cannot be restricted as for landscaping irrigation the ids draw at least a portion of their water from upland reservoirs making them more vulnerable to variations in precipitations than the other two which rely on groundwater and water from a large lake therefore the ids are more likely to impose water use restrictions than the city and rww utilities these facts about the kelowna context suggest that households served by the ids and therefore face a greater risk of experiencing water use restrictions may be induced to make conservation choices similar to those were water is priced by volume the theoretical model developed below explores how the interaction between pricing and the risk of water use restrictions impacts on household adoption of water conserving technologies all the utilities have drought plans which specify progressive sets of water use restrictions and water availability triggers that select the restrictions in force fig 2 shows the trigger graph for the black mountain irrigation district which indicates the reservoir levels that trigger droughts at different times of year the graph reflects the northern climate where peak inflows occur between april and june and peak demand between june and august water use between october to march typically reflects only indoor household and industrial institutional uses which can be sustained by relatively low levels of water in storage in jurisdictions without significant seasonal variations in inflows and demands drought triggers will not vary by time of year 3 literature review charging a volumetric price has been the primary recommendation made by economists to the challenge of managing water scarcity there have been numerous investigations examining the price response of residential water users in a comprehensive review arbués et al 2 indicate that most studies find that the demand for water responds to price although that response is inelastic among other things they suggest that studying the adoption of water efficient technologies is an area in need of further research focusing on aurora colorado kenney et al 33 find that water consumption is influenced by price and water use restrictions with mandatory restrictions being effective while voluntary restrictions far less so they include participation in rebate programs for new technologies as predictors of household water use but do not model the decision to adopt new technologies explicitly they conclude that water use restrictions and pricing policies interact with more aggressive restrictions reducing the impact of pricing on water use the model described below explores the relationship between water price water demand and the probability of restrictions being applied there is a small literature examining the household decision about investment in water using technology renwick and archibald 42 recognize that households choose water conservation technology and water use jointly in a study of two california communities they use a two stage least squares approach where two indoor and two outdoor technology choices are modeled in the first stage with predicted adoption of these technologies becoming an input into the second stage water demand equation in the first stage regressions they find that the marginal price of water and income are both positively related to the adoption of water efficient technologies as are non price policies such as restrictions rationing and rebates as with much of the previous work the demand for water is found to be price inelastic some work has used more extensive data sets millock and nauges 37 and grafton et al 26 used the results of an oecd household survey to examine factors that affect the adoption of household water conservation technologies millock and nauges 37 use independent probit regressions to predict the adoption of four different water conserving technologies finding that respondents who face volumetric prices are more likely to adopt such technologies however volumetric pricing was not necessarily the dominant factor with ownership status and environmental attitudes also playing an important role grafton et al 26 restrict themselves to the subset of the oecd data where water use is also available estimating a model conceptually similar to that of renwick and archibald 42 instrumenting for the presence of water conserving technologies the demand for water is once again found to be price inelastic of the three water saving technologies considered water conserving toilets water conserving showers and rainwater tanks only water conserving toilets had a significant impact on water use only three instrumenting variables were used leaving little scope for drawing inference about the household investment decision dupont and renzetti 20 use canadian data to examine the adoption of indoor and outdoor water conservation technologies among their key findings are that water price plays an important part in predicting the presence of water conserving investments and adoption of water conserving behaviors while non price policies have no significant effect they also find that indoor water conservation activities are correlated as are outdoor water conservation activities focusing specifically on water saving landscaping fan et al 21 find that households with a greater concern about drought are more likely to adopt drought tolerant landscaping dean et al 18 find that water knowledge together with experiencing water restrictions is positively related to the adoption of water conserving technologies brent 10 finds that conversion to water saving landscaping is affected by water price but do not consider water use restrictions martínez espiñeira et al 36 find evidence that pro environmental investments including water efficient appliances is positively influenced by income however they lack information on price or on experience with restrictions so do not consider these effects pérez urdiales and garcía valiñas 40 consider the relationship between investment in water conserving technologies and the adoption of water saving behaviors they find that behaviors reinforce the technological effect for technologies that use electricity and water while behaviors offset the technological effect for technologies that only conserve water as they are using cross sectional survey data within one spanish city impacts of water use restrictions are not considered this recent work has identified attitude knowledge and income effects on conservation investments together with interactions between technologies and between technologies and behaviors however rationing policy impacts have not been considered the present research addresses this gap 4 model modeling the household water conservation technology adoption decision has received limited attention however there is a significant literature examining the household energy conservation adoption decision a key insight behind these modeling efforts was the recognition that households do not consume energy rather they consume services which are produced by combining labor capital and energy e g 30 a number of studies therefore adopt a household production function approach credited to becker 5 which explicitly models this form of the household decision problem examples include willett and naghshpour 49 flaig 23 hansen 28 oikonomou et al 38 brenčič and young 11 and halvorsen and larsen 27 many of these studies set up the model framework then assume a solution exists in order to motivate the variables that are included in a regression model these studies have typically not considered energy use restrictions as in developed countries these are comparatively rare however such restrictions are a key element of water management and the model in this paper is developed to explore the role that these restrictions play a basic becker model defines the household utility function as u z 1 z 2 τ with z 1and z 2 being household produced goods and τ a taste parameter the production functions are z i g i x i t i φ i where x i is a purchased input t i is time and φ i is a measure of production efficiency the household has a time budget constraint t t 1 t 2 h where h is hours of wage labor applying an appropriate budget constraint one can solve for derived demand functions for the purchased input x i and household production time t i extensions of this approach allow a market good to substitute for the household produced good and allow time and or other inputs to also have a direct utility impact such as when the household production activity generates some enjoyment e g gardening for our modeling purposes assume that households receive utility from two sources water related services and a composite commodity similar to 29 the water service production function is given by h h w t where w and t are the effective water and effective time that the household devotes to the production of household services while energy is an important input for some water services such as showering and laundry for a number of activities that involve substantial volumes of water toilet flushing lawn irrigation washing vehicles and driveways it isn t water use restrictions are often focused on outdoor water use and therefore we do not include energy in the model effective water is given by w vw and effective time is given by t st where w and t are the actual amounts of water and time used in the production of water services and v and s are the water and time augmentation factors factor augmenting technical change represented in this form was introduced into the macroeconomics literature by authors such as rose 44 kamien and schwartz 31 and binswanger 6 and was applied in a household production model for energy and time use by binswanger 7 for our purposes these factors themselves are the output of a production function of the form v s g k b v k b s k b where k is the capital invested in enhancing the efficiency of water service production b is the bias of that efficiency investment towards augmenting water and g is a vector valued function the function g k b is defined such that g 0 0 1 1 along with v k 0 and s k 0 the marginal effect of b however depends on the nature of the joint production function for v and s water conservation investments are generally discrete the additional cost of a water saving toilet relative to a normal toilet for example the total capital devoted to water services consists of a portfolio of capital goods toilets laundry machines outdoor landscaping and irrigation etc opportunities exist to invest in more efficient capital for most of these services a similar portfolio approach to appliance choice was used in dubin and mcfadden 19 in the current model the time or water saving bias refers to the overall bias of this portfolio rather than any single item the household has a budget constraint given by y z pw qt rk where y is total income which is divided between the composite good z with a price of one expenditures on water pw the opportunity cost of water services production time qt and the rental cost of the capital used for water services production rk putting it all together the household objective is 1 max z w t k b u z h 2 subject to y z pw qt rk 3 h h w t 4 w vw 5 t st 6 v s g k b along with non negativity constraints on all variables except b if we substitute using these equality constraints then the problem can be rewritten as 7 max w t k b u y pw qt rk h v k b w s k b t the first order conditions for this optimization problem are 8 p vu h h w u z 9 q su h h t u z 10 r u h wh w v k th t s k u z 11 0 wh w v b th t s k if we assume diminishing marginal utility in z and h and diminishing marginal productivity of the water service production function in w and t then we would find the standard results that own demands are downward sloping the modeled households are supplied water by a utility that manages uncertain water availability using a drought response plan with water use restrictions to model the impact of these water use restrictions the decision variables are divided into those that occur prior to the drought stage being revealed and those that occur after it is logical to have conservation capital and the bias of that capital chosen prior to knowing if a water use restriction is in force and water services production time after for simplicity we also put the water use decision prior to knowing whether or not water use will be restricted rather than actual water use we refer to this as planned water use the amount of water the household plans to use if its water use is not restricted this is loosely analogous to water using capacity where households are assumed to fully utilize their capacity when there are no restrictions in place with this assumption we avoid modeling capacity separately from water use and thereby avoid evaluating multiple inequality constraints in the states possible after water inflows are known this simplification means that the cost of maintaining excess capacity to increase water use during a capacity restriction is manifest as the cost of utilizing additional water when there are no restrictions the drought response plan is managed by a water utility that supplies water to a set of households let that set of households be indexed by i where i n let w i be the planned water used of household i for its water service production with w as the vector of all individual planned water uses total water use within the utility service area is then i w where i is a unit vector let the water available to be distributed between the households w range from ω to w the minimum amount of water that will be available in any season is ω while the storage capacity of the water utility w determines the upper limit on what is available to households the utility aims to maintain a safe margin m to accommodate things like environmental flows temporary system failures etc inflows into water storage are distributed with probability density f x and cumulative density f x the water available to distribute is therefore w w with probability f w and equal to w with probability 1 f w the water utility has a three stage drought response plan stage n no restrictions household planned water use is w i stage p proportional reduction relative to unrestricted households can use θ w i triggered when w i w m stage a absolute restriction households can use w triggered when w θ i w m using a proportional stage and an absolute stage is a coarse representation loosely consistent with many drought response plans as in the example above there are typically multiple stages with progressively tighter limits on what water users can do the least strict water use restrictions often limit the frequency with which water using activities can be undertaken in effect reducing the capacity to use water for the model the household is only able to use a fraction θ of the water that they would use were the restriction not in place it is assumed that these drought trigger stages are calculated based on knowledge of planned water use but prior to realizing reservoir storage with the requirement that in no drought stage will households have to use less than the amount they are entitled to during that drought stage the amount of water that a household receives is not further adjusted after the amount available has been realized the time applied to the production of water services is chosen after the realization of the water availability w the time used is conditional on the amount of water used which depends on the drought stage in all three drought stages an interior solution for t is assumed and those interior solutions are described by water service time demand functions t n q w k b t p q θ w k b and t a q w k b and realized water use can be defined as w n w w p θ w and w a w where superscripts indicate the drought stage the expected utility for an individual household is 12 u f w a u a f w p f w a u p 1 f w p u n if w p w f w a u a 1 f w a u p if w a w w p u a if w w a where f w is the cumulative density function for inflows to the reservoir w a θ w i m w p w i m and superscripts a p and n indicate that the utility is evaluated using input vectors w t a k b θ w t p k b and w t n k b respectively the three parts of the expected utility in eq 12 reflect the relationship between the storage capacity and the demands when w p w there is a probability 1 f w p that enough water will be collected in the reservoir for all households to use the amount of water they planned to use however for reservoir capacity w a w w p there is never enough water to consume the planned water use the water system is on a permanent drought stage one finally if w w a then the reservoir is so small relative to planned water use that each water user is strictly rationed to use only w units of water fig 3 illustrates the sequence of events in the model prior to the water inflow level being realized households choose conservation capital k the bias of that capital b and the amount of water that they plan to use when there are no water use restrictions while households choose their planned water use taking the trigger levels as exogenous the water utility is assumed to know the planned water use and sets the trigger level based on the planned water use the household planned water use therefore determines the number of possible states that the household can be in after inflows are determined realization of inflows into the reservoir determine which state the system is in conditional on the state and therefore the amount of water that the household can actually use the household chooses how much time to apply to the production of water services 5 illustrative example 5 1 function specification and parameterization to illustrate results we turn to a simple parameterized

a diminishing marginal product of capital with bias shifting the capital in favor of water augmentation b 0 or time augmentation b 0 a more general specification is described in appendix c water inflows follow a log pearson type iii distribution which is frequently used for modeling hydrologic processes 8 3 24 if a variable x is distributed following a pearson type iii distribution then the logarithm of that variable is distributed as a log pearson type iii distribution the density function for the log pearson type iii distribution is 17 f x ν κ ω κ κ ln x ω ν 1 x γ ν e κ ln x ω 18 γ ν 0 x ν 1 e z dz where ν 0 is known as the shape parameter κ as the rate parameter ω is a threshold parameter that defines the range of the distribution as ω γ ν is the gamma function when κ 0 the distribution is positively skewed shape rate and threshold values see table 2 are chosen to represent a low inflow and a high inflow case where the probability that the reservoir is filled is greater for the high inflow parameterization for the low inflow specification at p q 1 the probability of no restriction is 70 and the probability of an absolute restriction is 0 3 at the same price levels the high inflow distribution has a greater than 99 probability of no restriction and less than 1 0 10 8 probability of absolute restriction equilibria for this system were identified through an iterative process solved using the pracma library 9 in r 41 parameters for the log pearson type iii distribution were identified using functions in the fadist package 4 the iteration was initiated by choosing levels for w a and w p given these values the household problem is solved first order conditions found in appendix b this is a two stage problem first optimal values for t are identified for each state given t the expected utility is maximized by choice of w k and b with w a and w p taken as fixed feasibility of the solution is then assessed by comparing nw with w p m and θ nw with w a m values for w a and w p are then updated and the process repeated until the totals match within an acceptable tolerance this same process is used for solutions where w a w w p by iterating over values of w a 5 2 no uncertainty before examining the role of uncertainty and water use restrictions the model is solved with no restrictions absent restrictions the system is solved for the four variables simultaneously results are shown in fig 4 for all four control variables for partial substitution between water and time ρ 0 5 partial complementarity ρ 2 and neither ρ 0 water use is inversely related to price over the entire range of prices examined panel a the responsiveness to water price changes is increasing in the degree of substitutability when water is a more effective substitute for time in producing water services dropping the price of water results in a larger increase in water use the time devoted to water services production is shown in panel b when water and time are neither substitutes nor complements time used decreases as price increases as the price of water falls the utility contribution of water services increases and households spend more time on water service production activities and reduce consumption of the composite good this response is more pronounced when water and time are complements when water and time are substitutes time is increasing in the price of water as expected cheaper water leads the household to substitute water for time when conservation capital is factor augmenting equilibrium levels of conservation capital decline as the price of water increases panel c this result is inconsistent with the empirical analyses reviewed earlier if conservation capital is factor augmenting then the value of owning this capital is increasing in the amount of water used some forms of water conserving capital are certainly factor augmenting a low flow shower head and a water conserving toilet increase the efficiency with which water can deliver personal cleaning and waste disposal they do not eliminate the need for some water and there are few practical technologies that are able to do so drought resistant landscaping and the extreme case of replacing landscaping with gravel or paving is closer to a substitution of water using capital by capital that does not use water however most households retain some landscaping plants that require some supplemental water suggesting that in terms of the services provided drought resistant landscaping is not a perfect substitute for outdoor water use an alternative formulation of the model was explored using a constant elasticity of substitution between water time and conservation capital for the cobb douglas implementation δ 0 the demand for conservation capital remains downward sloping in the price of water the linear version δ 1 has only corner solutions with threshold price ranges where one of water time or capital are the only inputs into the production of water services the model can be tuned to find a degree of substitution that generates interior solutions with a demand for conservation capital that is upward sloping in the price to conserve space we do not present such results and only discuss their implications where appropriate our model explores the equilibrium demand for water excess to basic human needs as formulated the utility from water services goes to zero as water services produced goes to zero however the formulation also has an infinite marginal utility from water services at zero so as constructed water services production will never go to zero if capital is a substitute for water rather than water augmenting in the present model the investment in water conservation capital would increase as the price of water increases and water use falls a more realistic construction would have a finite marginal utility at zero water services and a choke price for water above which no water excess to basic human needs is used if water is required together with water conservation capital to produce household water services then above this choke price for water water conserving capital would also not be purchased if water is too expensive to irrigate the lawn then the home owner will not purchase a moisture probe managed irrigation timer to enhance the efficiency of lawn watering therefore for some high enough price of water the demand for water conserving capital will fall with further price increases the final panel shows the bias of the conservation capital when water and time are complements increasing the price of water shifts the bias towards water saving when water is cheap and time is a complement time is augmented to increase its contribution to water services production and when water is expensive the converse occurs when water and time are substitutes the effect is opposite when water is expensive time is augmented to offset the utility lost by using less water taken together with the results shown in the other panel fig 4 shows that the model behaves as expected when conservation capital is modeled as augmenting water or time in the household level production of a water service 5 3 drought stage trigger levels for this simplified model seasonal variation in water inflows and demand is not considered the trigger graph shown in panel a of fig 5 therefore has no temporal variation when uncertain inflows are included in the model w k and b are chosen and w p and w a are calculated before the reservoir level is known in panel a to the right of w p the total water consumed is nw between w a and w p total water consumed is θ nw where θ 0 1 below w a total water use is n w since w p and w a depend on w the trigger levels will move as w responds to changes in the price of water or other model parameters panel b of fig 5 shows the two parameterizations of the log pearson type iii distribution the values for w p and w a marked on the graph are for the low inflow distribution and correspond to those in panel a shifts in w will lead to movements of w p and w a changing the probability of being in the different drought stages fig 6 plots the drought stage trigger levels as a function of the water price for both the low and high inflow distributions as the price of water falls planned water use increases and consequently the trigger level increases in the upper portion of each plot where w p w both triggers are relevant with the low inflow distribution the probability that the reservoir is filled is low and therefore when w p grows to exceed w there is a large probability that the household will be under a drought restriction and optimizing water use in the face of this restriction plays a significant role in the selection of planned water use shifting the water price down to a level where water restrictions always apply eliminates an option that the household is not often able to act on and therefore does not have much weight in the choice of w therefore the tighter trigger level w a does not increase much at the price level where w p is no longer less than w the range where w p w and w a w is larger for the low inflow distribution than it is for the high inflow distribution this is mostly a consequence of the higher probability of realized inflows resulting in water restrictions and consequently planned water use being enlarged to reduce the impact of being in the restricted state the price at which w p increases to exceed w is higher with the low inflow distribution on the other end the low inflow distribution translates into a higher probability that inflows are below w a and therefore the utility contribution from the proportional restriction state is less and the resulting planned water use is also less taken together the price at which the unrestricted state is lost is higher for the low inflow case and the price at which the absolute restriction is always in force occurs at a lower price for the low inflow case in contrast with panel a the high inflow distribution results in panel b reflect the fact that when the price falls to the point where w p first exceeds w there is still a large probability that the reservoir will fill equilibria for a water price just below the level where w p w have a probability 1 f w a of being in the proportional restriction state a probability that is much larger than the f w p f w a probability for prices just above the transition the large increase in the weight placed on utility from the proportionally restricted state leads to a large increase in planned water use across this transition since w a θ n w m the increase in w is manifest as a large increase in w a two equilibria with slightly different water prices can have substantially different water restriction thresholds these results show that the equilibrium drought stage trigger graph is determined by the interaction of the water price the water inflow distribution and the water storage capacity household water use is chosen partly in response to the probability that the household will be subject to a water restriction given the standard assumptions of a positive marginal utility from water for all levels of planned water use it follows that the more likely a household is to be in the proportional restriction state the higher planned water use will be when a substantial portion of the inflow distribution probability mass lies below the storage capacity then the planned water use decision becomes dominated by the probability of being in the proportional restriction state while there is still a positive probability of being in the unrestricted state in contrast when the balance of the probability mass lies beyond the storage capacity the probability of being in the proportional restriction state takes a large step up when the price falls to the level where unrestricted state no longer occurs the way that the water price and planned water use interact with the utility s drought stage trigger levels jointly determines planned water use and those trigger levels in a system with a risk of drought restrictions observed equilibrium water demand is a function of both household preferences and water supply conditions 5 4 planned water use and conservation capital panel a in fig 7 shows planned water use given the implied trigger levels relative to reservoir capacity planned water use is shown for both the low and high inflow probability since the trigger levels are functions of planned water use the planned water use curves have shapes similar in form to the trigger stages at high prices planned water use is low enough that it is rare that a drought stage will be triggered as the price falls planned water use in the low inflow equilibria increases more rapidly than for the high inflow equilibria for the low inflow equilibria the higher probability of being in the proportional restriction leads to an increase in planned water use prior to the trigger level exceeding the reservoir capacity which is greater than that for the high inflow case increasing planned water use translates into using more water in the proportional restriction state since the proportional restriction state is less likely for the high inflow case this incentive does not manifest itself as strongly as the low inflow planned water use has already adjusted upwards the actual use in the proportional restriction state isn t much below that when the unrestricted state is unavailable and therefore there is what appears as a large downward step when the proportionally reduced planned water use is displayed in contrast for the high inflow case when the price falls to the point that planned use exceeds reservoir capacity there is a large increase in planned use this is visible as a much smaller leftward shift in planned water use in all cases planned water use is monotonic within a set of drought stages comparing planned water use in fig 7 with that in fig 4 one sees that planned water use is greater with the risk of drought restrictions than without the highly elastic portion of the planned water use is driven in part by the effective reduction in the cost of planned water use as the probability of being in the unrestricted state falls in effect as modeled the cost of capacity is increasing per unit of capacity the more often that capacity is used this is somewhat unrealistic unless the cost of capacity is closely tied to the rate of use however that planned water use capacity increases as the probability of being restricted increases is not unrealistic these results highlight the important role of the cost of installing excess capacity for example where irrigation systems are concerned if installing a system with larger diameter pipes and nozzles that can deliver more water per unit of time doesn t increase costs significantly then the greater the probability of having water use restricted the more likely that households will invest in greater capacity if water use capacity was chosen separately from actual water use then water use in the unrestricted state would be less than capacity and when the drought stage specifies that only a portion of the capacity be utilized the actual reduction in water use will be less than the proportional reduction in capacity use permitted assessments of mandatory drought restrictions in colorado in 2002 by kenney et al 34 are consistent with this result they find that restricting lawn watering to once every three days 66 6 reduction in capacity reduces per capita water use by an average of 22 and twice per week restrictions 71 reduction reduces water use by 33 for lafayette which imposed one day per week watering 86 reduction water use declined by 56 while these reductions are based on total water use not outdoor water use that the water savings are far less than the reduction in allowed use suggests that users are increasing the intensity of their watering when they are allowed to do so similarly kenney et al 33 found that residents of aurora colorado reduced water use by about 12 in response to a variety of outdoor watering restrictions applied over a two and a half year period aurora is primarily a community of single family residential homes and restrictions ranged from three days per week to outright bans they also demonstrated that pricing and restrictions interact with price having reduced influence when restrictions are binding survis and root 47 also find that watering restrictions are not particularly effective for two florida communities in an analysis that considers self supplied water and the fact that watering restrictions address timing and not volume used these results suggest that in many communities home owners have slack capacity which can be used when watering restrictions are implemented our model results suggest that this excess capacity is more likely to be installed if it is cheap and that the effectiveness of restrictions can be enhanced if capacity is more directly controlled introducing a risk of a water restriction substantially changes the relationship between the price of water and the investment in conservation capital when the price of water is low planned water use is high high planned water use translates into a high probability that water use will be restricted households anticipate that they are likely unable to use the amount of water they would like to and therefore do not invest as much in conservation capital increasing the price of water reduces planned water use which reduces the probability of having water use restricted which in turn increases the value of water augmenting conservation capital investment therefore increases as the price of water increases as the price is increased further the probability of being restricted falls enough that in most situations households are able to use the amount of water they planned to use investment in conservation capital then falls as the price of water further increases as in the model without inflow uncertainty see fig 4 this result is consistent with the kelowna data where providers that charge a volumetric price and almost never impose water use restrictions have the same average investment in conservation capital related to water use as providers that charge a flat rate but are more likely to impose restrictions if conservation capital substitutes for water then the demand for conservation capital will be upward sloping in the price of water this is loosely consistent with the results of millock and naug 37 and dupont and renzetti 20 who find that investment in conservation capital tends to be higher where volumetric prices are charged if one ignores the role of restrictions if water use restrictions are an important risk factor then the observed demand for conservation capital should be decreasing in the price of water lower water prices translate into a higher demand for water and a higher probability of being restricted as a substitute for water conservation capital is more important to supplying household water services when there is a greater probability that water will be restricted as the price for water is increased the probability of facing a restriction is reduced and consequently the value of conservation capital as a substitute for water falls only when the water price is high enough that there is little probability of facing a water restriction will substituting conservation capital for water to reduce the water bill become important in contrast when conservation capital is water augmenting then when water prices are low the demand for conservation capital is increasing in the price of water whether conservation capital is water augmenting or a substitute the results developed here suggest that the relationship between the demand for conservation capital and the price of water will depend on the likelihood that water use restrictions are used to manage demand where restrictions are common the equilibrium relationship between investment in conservation capital and the price of water is likely to work in the opposite direction than prevails when restrictions are rare cross sectional analyses such as those of millock and nauges 37 grafton et al 26 and dupont and renzetti 20 should recognize these differences beyond this simple impact of water use restrictions we may also expect the types of conservation investments to vary based on climate and the water system infrastructure where rainfall is reasonably common irrigation needs will be low and conservation investments will focus on indoor use in contrast where conditions are more arid conservation investments are more likely to focus on outdoor uses these investments themselves may differ in the degree to which they are water augmenting or substitute for water millock and nauges 37 do not include climate variables in their regression results and grafton et al 26 do not describe including climate variables in their instrumenting strategy beyond capturing them through a regional penetration variable they constructed dupont and renzetti 20 include rainfall and degree days as explanatory variables interacting these variables with water price would indicate if the price response changes when outdoor water scarcity is more important including a variable reflecting the prevalence of water use restrictions and interacting this variable with the price of water could reveal more information about the nature of conservation investments and how those investments respond to price and the risk of facing restrictions the results reported by kenney et al 33 reinforce the need to consider the interaction between water use restrictions and price rather than treating them independently and or ignoring the role of restrictions the motivation for the model developed here is the interaction between outdoor water use restrictions and household investment in conservation capital this is relevant in many arid communities in the developed world where there is typically more than enough capacity to supply basic human needs however it is not uncommon for water supplies in developing countries to be intermittent investments in enhancing capacity are manifest as storage tanks while water conserving toilets limited flow showers etc are investments in conservation capital to stretch out the supply in these contexts where metering and volumetric charges are often not in place the risk of supply interruption is likely the main motivator for investment in conservation capital 5 5 conservation capital and water bias fig 8 shows equilibrium conservation capital panel a and the water saving bias panel b of that capital for the low inflow case for different elasticities of substitution between water and time in household water services production when water prices are high and therefore the probability of facing restrictions is low the direction of the bias follows the same pattern for the model solved with no risk of water use restrictions fig 4 as with capital the direction of the relationship between bias and water price reverses when the price falls low enough for restrictions to be common when the risk of water use restrictions are high then households emphasize investments that best offset the impact of the restrictions if water and time are complements δ 0 and if water use is restricted then the household will invest in augmenting the services provided by water the augmented water can be combined with an unrestricted amount of time to produce more water services if water and time are substitutes δ 0 then households invest in augmenting time increasing the role of time in the production of household water services when water use is restricted the amount of investment also reflects the impact of restrictions when water and time are complements the restricted availability of water limits the effectiveness of augmenting time in producing household water services resulting in a large drop in conservation investment when water and time are substitutes investing in augmenting water increases effective water which substitutes for the more costly time input as constructed households in this model are identical these last results suggest what may be observed with heterogeneous households one important type of heterogeneity is the value of time households that have a higher opportunity cost for time devoted to the production of household water services would show a qualitatively similar effect to the difference between equilibria when water prices are lowered this bias is manifest in the choice of conservation capital that the household invests in households with a high value of time would be more likely to invest in conservation capital that also saves time or at the least does not use more time high efficiency laundry machines irrigation timing converting yards to forms that require no time gravel paved etc households with a lower value of time would be more likely to invest in conservation capital that uses more time such as rain barrels low flow shower heads etc 6 some preliminary empirical results there are several empirical predictions that follow from the model a the impact of water price on the adoption of water conserving technology should be larger were water use restrictions are more common b the own price elasticity of demand for water will depend on the likelihood of water use restrictions c the water using capacity of the household water using capital should be increasing in the likelihood of water use restrictions and d the bias towards water or time saving in the portfolio of water conserving capital will depend on the relationship between the opportunity cost of household production time and the price of water from the summer of 2009 through to the fall of 2010 a sample of kelowna residents was invited to participate in a household survey the sample was build from a list of addresses and telephone numbers harvested from the website canada411 http www canada411 com keyed on the forward sortation area identifiers in the postal code for kelowna addresses http www canadapost ca the survey instrument was designed in consultation with several local water use experts for content and tested with a small set of volunteers for comprehension it included nine distinct sections 1 household characteristics 2 water source 3 water quality 4 water conservation 5 water issue familiarity 6 views about the environment 7 views on the water conservation behavior of others 8 perceptions about okanagan water issues and 9 demographics the survey itself was built as a web form that connected with a dedicated database designed and implemented by the author the final sample included 516 mostly complete surveys with 387 representing single family homes occupied by the owner analysis of the data collection in this survey inspired to the development of the analytical model presented above and therefore was not collected to test the predictions of that analytical model table 3 shows the total number of respondents who own and occupy single family residences reporting that they undertake each of the listed conservation investments or activities the time column captures the author s subjective judgment about whether the investment saves or uses time relative to not undertaking the conservation activity using income data or proxying for income with assessed value of the home and relating that to a measure constructed from the reported conservation investments and behaviors can provide at least a preliminary indication of consistency with model predictions assessed value is used as a proxy for income to account for the fact that a number of households refuse to report their income a simple indicator of the time saving or time using bias of the conservation choices was constructed from the survey data each conservation choice was subjectively appraised as time using or time saving for each category of conservation choices a relative time saving or time using variable was created for each household by adding up the number of time saving or time using activities and normalizing by the total number of time saving or time using activities that could have been chosen explicitly y i s j s y j s s where s u is the set of water saving using activities possible y j i 1 if household i reports activity j and s u is the count of water saving using activities a binary indicator was then formed for each category saving or using set to zero if time using exceeded time saving and one if time saving exceeded time using with observations where they were equal mostly both time saving and time using choices equal to zero dropped for outdoor choices and behavior choices indoor conservation choices did not have any time saving options so the cases where no time using choices were made were set equal to one using probit regressions this indicator was regressed on assessed value of the property and the number representing the self reported income category results are shown in table 4 similar results are found when the logarithm of income is used and the logarithm of the midpoint of the income interval for assessed value households with higher assessed property value or higher reported income are more likely to have made conservation choices that tend toward saving time this pattern continues for outdoor investments and behaviors when income categories are used but the sign changes for indoor investments studies of the relationship between time saving and investment in energy conservation e g 7 11 suggest a time rebound effect that increases energy use there would seem to be scope for carefully examining these issues in water use as well for example have showers which enable more rapid and convenient bathing increased the amount of bathing and therefore not realized the water savings that they would have had absent a rebound effect see 40 7 extensions and limitations the model results are comparisons of static equilibria the dynamic process of capital accumulation is not considered some authors have suggested that this dynamic process is important e g 29 many capital goods that have a bearing on household water use are quite long lived toilets fixtures etc can often last for decades and with care many appliances can as well landscaping can last for many years and the irrigation systems that support landscaping can as well households would typically replace a capital item that is used to produce water services when it fails or when a major renovation is being undertaken it may be more appropriate to use a vintage capital model where households add to an existing and depreciating capital stock and shift an existing bias of that capital stock in the present model water using capacity is essentially costless households choose the amount of water they plan to use and only pay based on what they actually use in reality households do face capacity constraints a function of water pressure pipe diameter etc some of this capacity can be adjusted such as installing larger diameter pipes as part of an irrigation system or installing multiple shower heads in the same shower others cannot easily be adjusted such as the diameter of the pipe supplying the house and the pressure of that water these physical limits mean that households could not choose capacities as large as the model permitted the actual behavior at the transitions between drought stages would therefore be less pronounced including capacity as a choice and incorporating a set of inequality constraints would better represent reality but at the cost of greater complexity and computational challenges we have not considered the utility value generated by water conservation there is a considerable literature on factors that encourage pro environmental behavior examples include 1 12 13 15 14 16 in many communities including kelowna the financial return from investing in water conservation is generally negative for any reasonable discount rate the price of water is simply too low to make saving money on the water bill a reason to invest in water conservation investments in water conservation are driven by influences other than cost savings we have omitted non economic considerations from our model however the actual decision to invest will depend on privately held attitudes beliefs and social pressures in addition to economic incentives the present result highlights that even when focusing on the economic incentives alone the behavior may not be as simple as seeking to reduce one s water bill in the model the water utility is a passive entity that simply sets the drought trigger levels in reality the utility is a player in a game with the households choosing the drought trigger levels the number of trigger levels the set of restrictions to be implemented resources to be devoted to enforcement any subsidies for conservation investments regulations pertaining to water delivery capacity at the property boundary and of course the price charged for water where the utility is part of a government responsible for local zoning and building code requirements the managing entity also controls variables like lot size landscaping requirements etc that impact on water use an important extension of this work is to identify the optimal mix of policies that a utility can undertake of course this also means specifying an objective for the utility that objective likely differs based on the type of governance private firm independent utility or part of a town or city adding another level of complexity finally this modeling exercise was motivated by the case of water utilities however the results may have application beyond water that the relationship between the water price and water conservation investments need not be monotonic is likely worth paying attention to in all situations where the price of one good is seen as influencing the demand for another likewise the nature of the relationship between conservation investments and resource use needs to be considered carefully the price of electricity and the choice of appliances the price of motor vehicle fuel and the importance of fuel efficiency in vehicle choice etc may also have these effects in developed nations rationing restrictions are not nearly as common with other services such as electricity as they are for water large interconnected electricity grids enable electricity to be moved around quickly in response to demand changes and there is typically enough generating capacity that it is rare that generation cannot be ramped up as necessary however in developing nations where electricity supplies are less dependable and where demand surges can lead to system failure some of the same effects noted here may also be present battery systems that are charged when electricity is available to provide power when the grid is down are expensive and create waste losses in the charging and discharging processes compact fluorescent and led lighting are electricity augmenting investments while substituting propane and or kerosene for heating and lighting is more consistent with simple notions of substitution applying some of the ideas developed here to an analysis of developing nation electricity markets and electricity using capital purchasing decisions may be another fruitful area of inquiry 8 conclusion households rationally consider the risk of water rationing when planning water use and choosing investments related to household water service production we develop a model where households consume water services and a numeraire good and those services are produced with capital that combines water and time model results support the view that households will increase their capacity to use water as a means of minimizing the impact of water use restrictions it is demonstrated that when conservation investments are water augmenting investment in conservation is increasing in the price of water when those price increases translate into a reduced probability of facing water restrictions while investment is decreasing in the price of water when there is little risk of water use restrictions this result is expected to be opposite when conservation investments strongly substitute for water results also demonstrate that the degree to which time and water are substitutes in the household production of water services determines the strength of the response of investment to water price changes results also suggest that the type of conservation investment households choose to make may depend on their value of time some recent empirical work has found that the likelihood of adopting water conservation technologies by households is greater where water is priced volumetrically beyond some use of weather variables this work has typically not considered interactions between pricing and the likelihood of water use restrictions data collected in kelowna british columbia comparing water utilities that price volumetrically and typically do not impose water use restrictions with utilities that do not charge volumetrically but are more likely to impose water use restrictions shows no difference in the adoption of water conservation technologies investigations into household water conservation investments should recognize the interaction between price and water use restrictions particularly as water use restrictions are the fallback response when pricing and other measures have not been sufficient to bring demand in line with available supply practitioners should likewise keep in mind that household water use decisions and water conservation investment decisions are made in response to the entire suite of policies that utilities use and that some of these policies such as pricing and water use restrictions may interact in ways that compound or offset their individual effects acknowledgements funding for collecting the data reported in this paper was provided by the social sciences and humanities research council of canada and by the university of british columbia i am grateful to my graduate students and discussants at conferences where this work has been presented for useful comments i am also grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their suggestions which substantially improved the document remaining errors and oversights are my own appendix a sources and service areas for kelowna water utilities fig a 9 shows the service areas and water catchment areas for the five water providers that supply most of the residents of kelowna two water providers city and rww do not have upland catchment areas city draws water from okanagan lake while rww draws its water from wells near mission creek the largest stream draining the uplands east of the city these two sources are highly dependable the remaining three water providers originally supplied water primarily to irrigators collecting water from upland catchment areas east of the city over the years as the population of kelowna grew an increasing number of residents settled in the service areas supplied by these three providers the amount of water the irrigation districts have available to deliver depends on the amount and form of the precipitation that falls the role of amount is obvious the form of the precipitation is important as precipitation that comes as snow is naturally stored until it melts the uplands themselves are to a great extent a gently rolling plateau making it costly to construct large volume storage when winters are warm and precipitation is dominated by rain the irrigation and improvement districts may not have enough water in storage to supply the demands for the season and with several such winters in a row there is a high likelihood that reserves will be drawn down a hot and dry summer will then almost certainly lead to water rationing climate change promises to reduce the share of winter precipitation that falls as snow potentially increasing the risk of water shortages appendix b system first order conditions system solutions are found by simultaneously solving all three first order conditions given the inflow distribution the trigger levels and the derived demand for time used in water services production the three different first order conditions for w k and b can be written as b 1 u w f w p f w a u p w f w a u a u p 1 f w p u n w f w p u p u n

conditions in eqs b 1 b 2 and b 3 are satisfied together with i w w p m and θ i w w a m when storage capacity satisfies w a w w p such that only drought stages p and a can occur the equilibrium is the vector w k b w a of values where the appropriate first order conditions are satisfied and θ i w w a m finally when w w a and water is always strictly rationed equilibrium is a vector w k b where w i w for each water user and the appropriate first order conditions for k and b are satisfied appendix c factor augmentation production function one particular challenge in creating a workable example was finding a functional form for the water and time augmentation functions we chose to define the function relating conservation investment and factor augmentation as c 1 v s 1 ρ v ke b e b μ e b σ v 1 ρ s ke b μ e b e b σ s this specification has several useful properties first if there is no investment in conservation k 0 then it follows that v 1 and s 1 bias shifts the orientation of the investment between the two factor augmentation terms when b then v 1 ρ v k σ v and s 1 the converse is true when b numerically this is convenient as it ensures that there is nowhere that the function is undefined there are five parameters in this function ρ v ρ s σ v σ s and μ the first two define the steepness of the response to k while the second two define the curvature of that response the parameter μ controls the degree of complementarity in the production of the factor augmentation this can be shown if we define the bias adjusted water saving investment as k v ke b e b μ e b and k s analogously when μ 1 then k v k s k for all values of b if μ 1 then k v k s k which implies that the time and water augmenting effects of that investment interfere with each other in contrast when 0 μ 1 then k v k s k now the time and water augmenting effects are reinforcing 
8723,we examine the relationships among water pollution income and political institutions using country level global water quality data over the period 1980 to 2012 in order to address concerns about the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables to identify these relationships results indicate an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions as well which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve keywords binary variable environmental kuznets curve nonparametric instrumental variable regression water pollution jel classification q53 c14 1 introduction the environmental kuznets curve ekc is a relationship between income and pollution which is hypothesized to have an inverted u shape the ekc hypothesis stems from kuznets famous work in income equality and poverty 1 the ekc hypothesis states that as income increases pollution goes up initially but when income is high enough pollution eventually declines the income level at which pollution level is the highest is called a turning point there are numerous papers on the validity application and measurement of the ekc 2 3 this is evident from the seminal work of 4 as well as from papers focusing specifically on air pollution e g 5 12 water pollution e g 13 16 deforestation e g 7 17 19 hazardous waste and toxins e g 20 21 and carbon dioxide e g 2 22 24 however critics have challenged both the findings and policy implications of these studies 25 26 some suggest that the pollutant income relationship differs depending on the choice of the pollutant study area and time period 27 one strand in the ekc literature posits that there may be a political mechanism underlying the ekc relationship these papers suggest that what cleaned up the environment was not rising income but rather political institutions responding to public demand 28 for example ref 4 speculates that the strongest link between income and pollution in fact is via an induced policy response and that these policies are in turn induced by popular demand according to this line of reasoning poor countries at first have so little development that they have high environmental quality then countries environments degrade as they develop and become richer finally they reach a point at which environmental quality is poor enough and the people are rich enough that they desire to pay for improvements in environmental quality at this point they begin to demand changes from their government and environmental degradation decreases similarly ref 29 indicates that political rights and civil liberties are important components in protecting environmental rights ref 30 finds that political institutional arrangements rather than resource endowments largely determine policies concerning environmental regulation the importance of political institutions in the ekc relationship has also been examined empirically in papers that include political variables in addition to income in the ekc regression ref 31 finds that for many pollution variables political reforms may be as important as economic reforms in improving environmental quality worldwide p 433 however they also find an absence of significant results for some pollution variables which suggests that something other than an induced policy response may be affecting pollution levels ref 14 finds that political institutions have a significant effect on environmental quality for five of the eleven water pollutants that they examine ref 32 hypothesizes that changes in the distribution of power underlie the ekc relationship and finds that literacy political rights and civil liberties have particularly strong effects on environmental quality in low income countries ref 33 develops and estimates an econometric model of the relationship between several local and global air pollutants and economic development while allowing for critical aspects of the sociopolitical economic regime of a state they find that democracy and freedom act as a conduit for people to demand for better environmental quality ref 34 indicates that institutional failures low political rights and civil liberties worsen the deforestation process in developing countries ref 35 examines the effects of political stability corruption control and economic growth on co2 emissions from deforestation and finds that political stability and corruption control do not significantly affect the income turning point but both variables shift the forest income curve up or down 2 2 a related concept to political institutions that may need to be accounted for in the ekc relationship is social capital social capital is defined as shared norms trust and social networks that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutually beneficial collective action an example of social capital is membership in environmental groups ref 36 15 include a social capital index in the ekc model since different political mechanisms for the ekc may have different implications for people s marginal willingness to pay for environmental protection ref 37 develops and implements an empirical test for different political mechanisms and applies it to international survey data from the world value survey their results show strong relationships between marginal willingness to pay and individual characteristics such as age income and education but little evidence that marginal willingness to pay varies systematically with economic growth in the traditional ekc relationship a parametric model is used to analyze the relationship between pollution levels and per capita income where the pollution level is regressed on a quadratic or cubic function of per capita income these types of ad hoc functional form specifications put an a priori restriction on how the relationship should look like in the empirical estimation however pollutants are not created equally and different pollutants have different relationships with income 25 for example stock pollutants like mercury keep accumulating in water bodies unless a substitute product is used in the production process or measures are taken to remove these stock pollutants from water bodies it is therefore possible with stock pollutants that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income even as measures are taken to reduce emissions since the stock pollutant may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced moreover the source and potential abaters of different pollutants may also affect their relationship with income for example industries may focus more on addressing chemical oxygen demand while municipalities may focus more on addressing biological oxygen demand 38 when incomes increase and the people are rich enough that they desire to pay for improvements in environmental quality it is possible for example that these improvements come more from reductions in residential pollution rather than from industrial pollution likewise agricultural pollutants such as phosphorus dissolved oxygen 3 3 dissolved oxygen is an important parameter in assessing water quality because of its influence on the organisms living within a body of water a dissolved oxygen level that is too high or too low can harm aquatic life and affect water quality 39 agricultural practices may affect dissolved oxygen via channel alteration e g straightening or deepening of streams impoundments the introduction of nutrients e g fertilizers animal wastes chemical contaminants e g heavy metals or organic matter e g sewage animal wastes to streams or interactions with other stressors 40 and variants of nitrogen may have a different relationship with income than fecal coliform related pollutants do because different pollutants have different relationships with per capita income it is therefore important to relax the assumption of a one size fit all functional form for pollutants the best approach may instead be a data driven nonparametric model to identify the relationship between income and various pollutants another advantage of nonparametric estimates is that they are more robust in detecting structures that sometimes remain undetected by traditional parametric estimation techniques several authors 16 24 41 42 have refuted the parametric ekc model and suggest a need to include a nonparametric form of income in the regression these semiparametric forms were found to perform better than the parametric form in specification tests although semiparametric and nonparametric methods are tedious these methods are used by many researchers 2 11 16 24 34 41 43 48 in addition to the concerns related to an ad hoc functional form another concern raised by researchers is that the income variable in the ekc model could be endogenous this endogeneity of income in the ekc model comes from simultaneity bias and omitted variable bias the simultaneity bias is present because deteriorated water quality affects economic growth increases in pollution may harm people s health for example thereby reducing gdp in addition output and pollution may also be jointly produced in the production process causing gdp and pollution to be simultaneously determined omitted variable bias in the ekc regression arises from such omitted variables as cultural or geographic factors that affect both environmental quality and income to address the potential endogeneity of income in ekc regressions ref 14 uses a parametric instrumental variables regression approach with and without fixed effects according to their results evidence for an inverted u relationship between income and environmental degradation are found for at least two out of the four iv specifications for seven out of eleven water pollutants biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand arsenic cadmium lead nickel and fecal coliform for these pollutants there is both a peak and a trough their iv results therefore provide some support for an environmental kuznets curve in global water quality in contrast the ols results which do not address the endogeneity of income show no inverted u relationship for any of the pollutants in addition to the concerns regarding parametric functional form and endogeneity of income a third concern affecting ekc estimation is the discrete nature of the political variables although the literature on estimating the environmental kuznets curve is growing fast and becoming very sophisticated in terms of empirical methodology used hitherto published articles in the ekc literature have not properly addressed the properties of categorical binary and or ordered explanatory variables in the model one problem that arises in incorporating political rights and civil liberties variables or any other categorical ordered or binary variable in a semiparametric or nonparametric regression is that such variables cannot be treated as continuous variables the conventional nonparametric approach to handle qualitative variables is a frequency estimator which involves splitting the samples into a number of cells 49 in this paper we use nonparametric functional forms for both categorical and continuous variables the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables are therefore three concerns regarding ekc estimation in order to address all three of these concerns we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to better identify the relationships between pollution income and political institutions we apply this method to analyze the relationships between water quality per capita gdp political rights and civil liberties at the global level over the period 1980 to 2012 our results indicate an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not in general we find that improved civil liberties and political rights are correlated with better water quality by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions as well which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve 2 model we first develop a theoretical model to illustrate why it is important to address the potential endogeneity of income when estimating the relationship between pollution and income why it is important to control for political institutions and why a nonparametric estimation may be better than a parametric estimation let pollution p be given by the following function g of income y political variable x and unobserved variable z 1 p g y x z let income y be given by the following function f of pollution p political variable x and unobserved variable z 2 y f p x z substituting the income function f into the pollution function g one obtains 3 p g f p x z x z the ekc relationship between pollution and income is given by the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income or g y the partial derivative of pollution with respect to income g y is not necessarily the same as the total derivative of pollution with respect to income d p d y as the following proposition illustrates proposition 1 the relationship between the partial derivative of pollution with respect to income and the total derivative of pollution with respect to income is given by 4 g y d p d y g x f p g y f x f p g x f x f z d z d x g z f p g y f z f p g z f x d x d z f z proof taking the total derivative of 1 one obtains 5 d p g y d y g x d x g z d z which upon rearranging yields 6 g y d p d y g x d x d y g z d z d y taking the total derivative of 2 one obtains 7 d y f p d p f x d x f z d z substituting 7 into 6 one obtains 8 g y d p d y g x f p d p d x f x f z d z d x g z f p d p d z f x d x d z f z the total derivative of pollution p with respect to political variable x is given by 9 d p d x g y f x g x the total derivative of pollution p with respect to unobserved variable z is given by 10 d p d z g y f z g z substituting 9 and 10 into 8 yields the desired result as seen in proposition 1 if we ignore the partial derivatives in the second and third terms in the right hand side of equation 4 we will have a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income corollary 1 describes the bias that arises if income is endogenous due to simultaneity bias simultaneity bias is present when pollution affects income so that f p 0 for example one reason pollution may affect income is that deteriorated environmental quality may affect economic growth corollary 1 endogeneity from simultaneity bias if pollution affects income f p 0 then ignoring the effect f p of pollution on income will lead to a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income if either or both of the following are true i the political variable x affects pollution p g x 0 ii the unobserved variable z affects pollution p g z 0 proof if f p 0 then g x 0 is a sufficient condition for the second term on the right hand side of equation 4 to be non zero if f p 0 then g z 0 is a sufficient condition for the third term on the right hand side of equation 4 to be non zero in addition to simultaneity a second reason income may be endogenous is that there may be omitted variables such as political institutions or cultural or geographic factors that affect both environmental quality and income corollary 2 describes the bias that arises if income is endogenous due to omitted variable bias omitted variable bias is present when the unobserved variable z affects both pollution and income i e when g z 0 f z 0 where is the logical operator denoting the logical conjunction and corollary 2 endogenity from omitted variable bias if the unobserved variable z affects both pollution and income g z 0 f z 0 then ignoring the effects of the unobserved variable z on pollution and on income will lead to a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income proof if g z 0 f z 0 then the third term on the right hand side of equation 4 would be non zero owing to simultaneity bias and omitted variable bias it is important to address the endogeneity of income in addition owing to omitted variable bias it is important to control for political institutions as well in addition to highlighting the importance of addressing endogeneity and of controlling for political institutions our model also provides intuition why a non parametric estimation may be better than a parametric estimation this is formalized in corollary 3 below corollary 3 need for nonparametric model if any of the partial derivatives in the second or third terms on the right hand side of equation 4 are nonlinear then the ekc relationship g y which is a nonlinear function of the partial derivatives is highly nonlinear as well and therefore best modeled with a nonparametric model proof follows from proposition 1 in order to address the concerns raised by our theory model regarding endogeneity and the highly nonlinear nature of the relationship between pollution and income as well as a third concern regarding the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to identify the relationship between income and pollution 3 methods we are interested in identifying the relationships between water pollution income and political institutions the highly nonlinear relationship between income and pollution the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables are three concerns regarding such ekc estimation in order to address all three of these concerns we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables to address the potential endogeneity of income ref 14 uses a parametric instrumental variables regression approach with debt service and age dependency ratio as instruments for per capita gdp as their results suggest that the age dependency ratio is not strong instrument in this paper we only use debt as an instrument for gdp for the instrumental variable for gdp we try several variables such as share of gdp from manufacturing sector age dependency ratio and total debt service in the end we choose to use total debt service of gni as it has a very high correlation with our per capita gdp income variable debt is correlated with gdp but does not have a direct effect on environmental quality and is therefore a good instrument for gdp total debt service which includes the principal repayments and interest actually paid on debt is positively correlated with gdp because more debt is likely to be paid off when gdp is higher debt service may be correlated with types of degradation like deforestation if countries liquidate natural assets to pay off debts 50 but there is less reason to believe that countries with high debts would pollute more except indirectly through the effects of debt on gdp since emitting more water pollution does not help them pay off debts the same way liquidating natural assets would it is therefore gdp not debt that has a potential effect on water pollution we test the validity of debt as an instrument for income using a sargan test and the results confirm that debt is an exogenous variable we also test for the endogeneity of political rights and civil liberties in all pollutant income relationships using a durbin wu hausman test for the endogeneity test we use age dependency and share of gdp from manufacturing sector as instruments in the model according to our results we find political rights and civil right liberties to be exogenous in the models for all pollutants except arsenic therefore for the arsenic regression we use instrument not only for gdp but also for political rights and civil liberties as well recent papers in the econometrics literature such as ref 51 52 have developed nonparametric instrumental variable estimation methods in this paper we use a method suggested by ref 52 to estimate a nonparametric instrumental variable ekc regression model that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables such a model addresses three concerns regarding ekc estimation the highly nonlinear relationship between income and pollution the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables the model is given by 11 p g y y j 1 j g j x j u where p is pollution g y is an unknown smooth function for income y and g j is the unknown function for the j 2 political factors x j we use civil liberties and political rights although the model is estimated using a nonparametric regression model we separate the regressors y and x to emphasize the differences between the two types of variables income y is continuous and endogenous while the political factors x j are discrete and exogenous since the civil liberties and political rights variables are ordinal we use the method suggested by ref 49 to address continuous and categorical nature of variables further details on how to estimate a model with continuous and categorical variables in nonparametric estimation can be found in ref 53 55 for simplicity let us consider 12 g y x g y y j 1 j g j x j then equation 11 can be written as 13 p g y x u e u w x 0 for all instruments w and exogenous covariates x which is equivalent to 14 e p g y x w x 0 in this model y denotes per capita gdp which is endogenous x denotes the ordinal exogenous explanatory variables political rights and civil liberties and w denotes the instrument debt to address the ordinal and categorical nature of the political variables in a nonparametric model we use a method suggested by ref 53 55 to estimate the nonparametric instrumental variable model 4 4 we use the crs r package to estimate nonparametric models which contain both categorical and continuous variables 56 given in equation 14 we use cross validation as our bandwidth selection method to estimate the nonparametric model details on estimating equation 14 can be found in ref 52 here we briefly describe the estimation procedure we use a control function approach for nonparametric instrumental variable estimation in the control function model 15 p g y x u and 16 y h w v where g and h are unknown functions 17 e v w 0 w and 18 e u y x v e u v y x v assuming that the mean of y conditional on w exists equations 16 and 17 can always be made to hold by setting h w e y w 52 identification in the control function approach comes from equation 18 it follows from equations 15 and 18 that 19 e p y x v g y x k v where g and k are unknown functions in the above equation 19 v is unobservable and estimated consistently by the residuals from nonparametric estimation of h in equation 16 we then estimate g and k using nonparametric additive models we use splines for the continuous variables and kernels for the categorical variables we use a data driven method to select bandwidths and to estimate all nonparametric functional components including g y x and h w in particular for bandwidth selection we use least squares cross validation 57 our cross validation criterion function is 20 min l i p i g ˆ i y x 2 where g ˆ i y x is the leave one out estimator of g y x omitting observation i and where l is the vector of bandwidths used to construct g ˆ i y x 4 data we use water pollution data from the global environment monitoring system gems water dataset which consists of triennial surveys of water quality statistics since 1979 from countries across the developed and developing world we update the data set used by ref 4 and by ref 31 to include the years from 1991 to 2012 the global environment monitoring system gems for water was established in 1978 to improve water quality monitoring in freshwater ecosystems 58 and to collect worldwide water quality data for assessments of status and trends in global inland water quality 59 under the auspices of unep the united nations environment programme gems involves the world health organisation who the world meteorological organisation wmo and unesco 58 with the cooperation of participating countries the gems water program is creating a unique global water quality monitoring network that provides water quality data to a central database 59 the data and information on water quality provided by participating countries provide a global overview of the condition of water bodies and statements on changes and trends at global regional and local levels 58 the gems water program also provides support and encouragement to developing countries that wish to establish monitoring programs and conduct assessments of water quality through the provision of capacity development in the form of training advice and assessment tools 59 the gems data set consist of over 70 000 observations of dozens of different types of water pollution providing a substantive amount of data on varied measures of water quality each data point consists of the average over the three years of each triennial survey of one or more data point from one of the gems water program s hundreds of sites around the world the year we assign to each data point is the middle of the three years the countries included in our data set are afghanistan algeria argentina australia austria bangladesh belgium bolivia brazil cambodia canada chile china colombia congo cuba denmark ecuador egypt ecuador fiji finland france germany ghana greece guatemala hong kong hungary india indonesia iran ireland israel italy japan jordan kenya korea laos lithuania luxembourg malaysia mali marshall islands mexico morocco netherlands new zealand norway new zealand pakistan panama peru philippines poland portugal russian federation senegal singapore spain sri lanka sudan sweden switzerland tanzania thailand tunisia turkey uganda united kingdom united states of america uruguay vietnam and zimbabwe we focus on four types of water pollutants heavy metal nickel mercury arsenic cadmium lead pathogen related fecal coliform total coliform oxygen regime dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrient related nitrate all data are in the form of concentrations of mg l except for the mercury data which is in the form of μ g l and the coliform data which is in the form of measured count 100 ml lead mercury arsenic and cadmium are four important heavy metal pollutants responsible for adverse health effects in human beings 60 these pollutants pollute water through deposition in soil and subsequent runoff to water bodies cadmium can pollute the soil and water through deposition of air pollution and through application of fertilizer and chemicals to crops mercury pollution in water bodies comes in the form of methyl mercury which can affect humans through consumption of fish lead pollution in water comes from air pollution settling in soil as well as from the application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in crop production although the phase out of lead in gasoline has decreased the emission of lead 61 lead pollution in soil remains a concern for our income measure we use data on per capita gross domestic product gdp based on purchasing power parity ppp in constant 2005 international dollars from the world development indicators wdi in particular gdp per capita is converted to constant 2005 international dollars using purchasing power parity rates an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as the u s dollar has in the united states gdp at purchaser s prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products and is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources for data on political mechanisms we use indices on political rights pr and civil liberties cl from freedom house each index varies from 1 to 7 with 1 meaning the most political rights or civil liberties for example the united states has a 1 in each category in all years indonesia has recently been in the middle of the range and china has 7 in both categories for most years freedom house attempts to use a methodology not bound by culture but instead uses standards drawn from the universal declaration of human rights 62 political rights measure factors such as the fairness of the electoral process the degree of political pluralism and participation and the presence of a non corrupt and transparent government 62 civil liberties measure freedom of expression and beliefs the ability to associate the rule of law and the degree of individual autonomy the mean of the political rights variables is lower than that for civil liberties which implies that political rights are more prevalent in many countries than civil liberties are in previous studies e g 32 63 political rights and civil liberties have been combined into one democracy measure that takes on values from 2 to 14 for the instrumental variable for gdp as explained above we try several variables such as share of gdp from manufacturing sector age dependency ratio dependents the population under age 15 and above age 65 as a proportion of the working age population and total debt service of gni all from the world development indicators wdi in the end we choose to use total debt service of gni as it has a very high correlation with our per capita gdp income variable summary statistics for the water pollution variables are presented in table 1 summary statistics for income political variables and debt are presented in table 2 as seen in table 1 most pollutants exhibit a large range in values and a high standard deviation according to exploratory plots of the data in ref 14 the concentrations of the majority of the pollutants chemical oxygen demand total arsenic dissolved oxygen total lead total nickel and fecal coliform are decreasing functions of per capita income the concentrations of only two pollutants total cadmium and nitrate exhibit increasing functions of per capita income the concentrations of three pollutants biological oxygen demand total mercury and total coliform show no relationship with the income or political variables several of these trends are largely dependent upon the observations from only one or a few countries for example total cadmium s curve is dependent upon 1980s uk and 1990s france data this suggests that water quality generally improves as countries develop exploratory plots of the data also show that only a few of the pollutants chemical oxygen demand total arsenic total mercury and total cadmium potentially have an inverted u form for concentration with respect to income interestingly a few of the pollutants biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total lead fecal coliform appear to have an inverted u shape for the political variables as well the high amounts of pollution and mid range political variables for mexico india and colombia cause this phenomenon for both chemical and biological oxygen demand this is also reflected in the oecd versus non oecd plots in which concentrations decrease for oecd countries with improving political institutions while they increase for non oecd countries with improving political institutions these exploratory plots suggest that to the extent that there is an ekc it may be as much caused by political as income factors 14 5 results in fig 1 we present the graphical results of the estimated relationships between water pollution and per capita gdp political rights and civil liberties resulting from the nonparametric instrumental variable estimation for each of the 11 water pollutants we examine the left column of the figure represents the relationship between per capita gdp and pollution the middle column represents the relationship between political liberties and pollution and the last column represents the relationship between civil liberties and pollution we describe the results for each pollutant below the pollutants are organized by type heavy metal nickel mercury arsenic cadmium lead pathogen related fecal coliform total coliform oxygen regime dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrient related nitrate 5 1 heavy metals 5 1 1 nickel we find a cubic relationship or n shaped curve between nickel concentration and per capita gdp we do not find that variations in either political rights or civil liberties impact the nickel concentration when regressing nickel concentration on gdp gdp squared and gdp cubed ref 4 finds an environmental kuznets curve shape for the nickel income relationship however ref 64 who uses a time series analysis does not find the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for this pollutant 5 1 2 mercury per capita gdp and mercury concentration seem to have a cubic relationship we do not find that variations in either political rights or civil liberties impact the mercury concentration ref 65 finds an environmental kuznets curve relationship for mercury pollution using 1985 2006 data from louisiana watersheds 5 1 3 arsenic per capita gdp and arsenic pollution seem to have a v shaped relationship arsenic pollution declines if there are no political rights i e if the political rights index is high variations in civil liberties do not have any impact on the arsenic pollution 5 1 4 cadmium cadmium concentration seems to decline with increasing per capita gdp especially after per capita gdp hits the 6000 level however we do not find any definitive relationships between cadmium concentration and per capita gdp 5 1 5 lead we find that an inverted u shaped relationship exists between per capita gdp and lead concentration there is no distinct pattern on the relationship between civil liberties and lead pollution or political rights and lead pollution although it looks like lead concentrations reach their peak when the political rights variable has the value of 5 5 2 pathogen related 5 2 1 fecal coliform for fecal coliform we find almost a cubic relationship between pollution and income the lower turning points occur around 4000 whereas the upper turning point is around 10 000 variations in political rights or civil liberties do not seem to have any impact on the fecal coliform concentration in water bodies 5 2 2 total coliform the relationship between total coliform and per capita gdp seem to follow almost a polynomial of 4th degree type of relationship the pollution level seems to reduce substantially after the income level reaches the 11 000 level ref 64 does not find an environmental kuznets curve relationship for total coliform when the level of political rights is lower and the political rights index is higher total coliform concentration is lower 5 3 oxygen regime 5 3 1 dissolved oxygen at lower levels of gdp the relationship between gdp and dissolved oxygen looks flat but once the gdp level is 8000 or higher the dissolved oxygen level starts declining we do see a clear quadratic relationship between political rights and gdp there is no definitive relationship between variations in civil liberties and dissolved oxygen concentration 5 3 2 chemical oxygen demand the relationship between gdp and chemical oxygen demand concentration looks like an n shaped curve we also see that higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index are associated with higher levels of chemical oxygen demand and lower civil liberties are associated with lower levels of chemical oxygen demand the relationship with political rights is flat 5 3 3 biological oxygen demand the biological oxygen demand curve shows 5th degree of polynomial relationship with per capita gdp we see a clear relationship between civil liberties and biological oxygen demand with higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index associated with low biological oxygen demand levels and lower civil liberties associated with higher levels of pollution we do not find that variations in political rights affect the level of biological oxygen demand 5 4 nutrient related 5 4 1 nitrate many studies 15 36 have found the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for nitrate pollution according to our results however there is no definitive relationship between nitrate pollution and per capita gdp higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index lead to lower nitrate pollution but variations in political rights have no impact on the nitrate pollution using gems data ref 64 also does not find support for an environmental kuznets curve in nitrate pollution 6 conclusion this study contributes to a better understanding of the relationships between water pollution and per capita gdp civil liberties and political rights at the global level in order to address concerns about the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to identify these relationships the upshot of our paper is that one shape does not fit all the pollutants and that the shapes vary quite a bit compared to what have been found so far in the literature according to our results we find an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not by using a nonparametric model that accounts for the discrete nature of the political variables we find that fewer pollutants exhibit an environmental kuznets curve than were previously found in studies using gems data including those of ref 4 14 31 64 66 in terms of the political variables we found that the arsenic and total coliform levels decline as the level of political rights declines and as the political rights index increases but lead and dissolved oxygen have an inverted u shaped relationship political rights for lead and dissolved oxygen results suggest that as countries progress towards political rights water pollution increases at first but then decreases after certain levels of political rights have been attained our results indicate that higher biological oxygen demand and nitrate pollution levels are associated with lower levels of civil liberties higher civil liberties index but that lower chemical oxygen demand levels are associated with lower levels of civil liberties higher civil liberties index thus factors affecting political rights such as the fairness of the electoral process the degree of political pluralism and participation and the presence of a non corrupt and transparent government are beneficial for water quality to some extent as seen in our theoretical model even for those water pollutants with which political institutions do not appear to have any systematic relationship it is still important to control for political institutions to address any endogeneity in income that may arise from omitted variable bias by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve we therefore improve upon the empirical analysis of ref 14 whose model uses instrumental variables but unlike the model in this paper is neither nonparametric nor accounts for the discrete nature of the political variables in contrast to our paper ref 14 is unable to tease out the nonlinear nature of some of the relationships and instead finds that the effect of political variables on pollution can be either positive or negative depending on pollutant and political variable our results suggests several avenues for potential research first while the gems global water data set is arguably the most comprehensive and reliable global data set on country level water quality to date while the gems water program aims at improving water quality monitoring in freshwater ecosystems and while the gems data set has been used by previous researchers in seminal papers on the topic e g 4 31 one may worry that water quality monitoring in developing countries may be weak in future work as water quality monitoring continues to improve we hope to further analyze relationships between environmental degradation income and political institutions with improved data as such data becomes available a second avenue for future research is to extend our nonparametric instrumental variable approach to enable the exploration of possible correlations between pollutants ref 65 uses a seemingly unrelated partially linear model to address a potential correlation between pollutants nitrogen phosphorous dissolved oxygen and mercury in an environmental kuznets curve study in future work we hope to address correlations using a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables a third avenue for future research is to build on our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any nonstationarity in the variables a fourth avenue for future research is to build on our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any transboundary pollutants while the water pollutants in our data set are local water pollutants in inland water bodies for which transboundary issues across country borders may be second order in general it is possible for pollutants to cross country borders ref 67 develops a spatial econometric approach to measuring pollution externalities we hope in future work to combine spatial econometrics with our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any transboundary pollutants a fifth avenue for future research is to use new annual country level data on institutions that the world bank has begun collecting in 2008 including variables measuring political stability and absence of violence terrorism regulatory quality rule of law voice and accountability government effectiveness and control of corruption since these data are fairly recent there is less of an overlap with the 1980 2012 time period of the data used in this study however as more years of this new world bank institutions data become available we hope in future work to use this data to further tease out the relationships between water pollution income and institutions a sixth avenue for future research is to further and more rigorously examine possible mechanisms for why pollution levels may increase with income for some pollutants doing so may require more and better data especially at higher levels of income in future work as more and better data at higher levels of income become available we hope to further analyze mechanisms by which pollution levels may increase at higher levels of income our results suggest that there may be nonlinear relationships between environmental degradation income and political institutions as a country s economy develops and its income rises there may be nonlinear effects on water quality similarly improvements in political institutions may have nonlinear effects on water quality as well our results also suggest that policies that improve income and or political institutions may have nonlinear effects on water quality and that these effects vary by pollutant policy makers and academics alike should therefore be aware of the complex nature of the relationships between water pollution income and political institutions as they design strategies for environmental management and sustainable development 
8723,we examine the relationships among water pollution income and political institutions using country level global water quality data over the period 1980 to 2012 in order to address concerns about the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables to identify these relationships results indicate an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions as well which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve keywords binary variable environmental kuznets curve nonparametric instrumental variable regression water pollution jel classification q53 c14 1 introduction the environmental kuznets curve ekc is a relationship between income and pollution which is hypothesized to have an inverted u shape the ekc hypothesis stems from kuznets famous work in income equality and poverty 1 the ekc hypothesis states that as income increases pollution goes up initially but when income is high enough pollution eventually declines the income level at which pollution level is the highest is called a turning point there are numerous papers on the validity application and measurement of the ekc 2 3 this is evident from the seminal work of 4 as well as from papers focusing specifically on air pollution e g 5 12 water pollution e g 13 16 deforestation e g 7 17 19 hazardous waste and toxins e g 20 21 and carbon dioxide e g 2 22 24 however critics have challenged both the findings and policy implications of these studies 25 26 some suggest that the pollutant income relationship differs depending on the choice of the pollutant study area and time period 27 one strand in the ekc literature posits that there may be a political mechanism underlying the ekc relationship these papers suggest that what cleaned up the environment was not rising income but rather political institutions responding to public demand 28 for example ref 4 speculates that the strongest link between income and pollution in fact is via an induced policy response and that these policies are in turn induced by popular demand according to this line of reasoning poor countries at first have so little development that they have high environmental quality then countries environments degrade as they develop and become richer finally they reach a point at which environmental quality is poor enough and the people are rich enough that they desire to pay for improvements in environmental quality at this point they begin to demand changes from their government and environmental degradation decreases similarly ref 29 indicates that political rights and civil liberties are important components in protecting environmental rights ref 30 finds that political institutional arrangements rather than resource endowments largely determine policies concerning environmental regulation the importance of political institutions in the ekc relationship has also been examined empirically in papers that include political variables in addition to income in the ekc regression ref 31 finds that for many pollution variables political reforms may be as important as economic reforms in improving environmental quality worldwide p 433 however they also find an absence of significant results for some pollution variables which suggests that something other than an induced policy response may be affecting pollution levels ref 14 finds that political institutions have a significant effect on environmental quality for five of the eleven water pollutants that they examine ref 32 hypothesizes that changes in the distribution of power underlie the ekc relationship and finds that literacy political rights and civil liberties have particularly strong effects on environmental quality in low income countries ref 33 develops and estimates an econometric model of the relationship between several local and global air pollutants and economic development while allowing for critical aspects of the sociopolitical economic regime of a state they find that democracy and freedom act as a conduit for people to demand for better environmental quality ref 34 indicates that institutional failures low political rights and civil liberties worsen the deforestation process in developing countries ref 35 examines the effects of political stability corruption control and economic growth on co2 emissions from deforestation and finds that political stability and corruption control do not significantly affect the income turning point but both variables shift the forest income curve up or down 2 2 a related concept to political institutions that may need to be accounted for in the ekc relationship is social capital social capital is defined as shared norms trust and social networks that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutually beneficial collective action an example of social capital is membership in environmental groups ref 36 15 include a social capital index in the ekc model since different political mechanisms for the ekc may have different implications for people s marginal willingness to pay for environmental protection ref 37 develops and implements an empirical test for different political mechanisms and applies it to international survey data from the world value survey their results show strong relationships between marginal willingness to pay and individual characteristics such as age income and education but little evidence that marginal willingness to pay varies systematically with economic growth in the traditional ekc relationship a parametric model is used to analyze the relationship between pollution levels and per capita income where the pollution level is regressed on a quadratic or cubic function of per capita income these types of ad hoc functional form specifications put an a priori restriction on how the relationship should look like in the empirical estimation however pollutants are not created equally and different pollutants have different relationships with income 25 for example stock pollutants like mercury keep accumulating in water bodies unless a substitute product is used in the production process or measures are taken to remove these stock pollutants from water bodies it is therefore possible with stock pollutants that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income even as measures are taken to reduce emissions since the stock pollutant may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced moreover the source and potential abaters of different pollutants may also affect their relationship with income for example industries may focus more on addressing chemical oxygen demand while municipalities may focus more on addressing biological oxygen demand 38 when incomes increase and the people are rich enough that they desire to pay for improvements in environmental quality it is possible for example that these improvements come more from reductions in residential pollution rather than from industrial pollution likewise agricultural pollutants such as phosphorus dissolved oxygen 3 3 dissolved oxygen is an important parameter in assessing water quality because of its influence on the organisms living within a body of water a dissolved oxygen level that is too high or too low can harm aquatic life and affect water quality 39 agricultural practices may affect dissolved oxygen via channel alteration e g straightening or deepening of streams impoundments the introduction of nutrients e g fertilizers animal wastes chemical contaminants e g heavy metals or organic matter e g sewage animal wastes to streams or interactions with other stressors 40 and variants of nitrogen may have a different relationship with income than fecal coliform related pollutants do because different pollutants have different relationships with per capita income it is therefore important to relax the assumption of a one size fit all functional form for pollutants the best approach may instead be a data driven nonparametric model to identify the relationship between income and various pollutants another advantage of nonparametric estimates is that they are more robust in detecting structures that sometimes remain undetected by traditional parametric estimation techniques several authors 16 24 41 42 have refuted the parametric ekc model and suggest a need to include a nonparametric form of income in the regression these semiparametric forms were found to perform better than the parametric form in specification tests although semiparametric and nonparametric methods are tedious these methods are used by many researchers 2 11 16 24 34 41 43 48 in addition to the concerns related to an ad hoc functional form another concern raised by researchers is that the income variable in the ekc model could be endogenous this endogeneity of income in the ekc model comes from simultaneity bias and omitted variable bias the simultaneity bias is present because deteriorated water quality affects economic growth increases in pollution may harm people s health for example thereby reducing gdp in addition output and pollution may also be jointly produced in the production process causing gdp and pollution to be simultaneously determined omitted variable bias in the ekc regression arises from such omitted variables as cultural or geographic factors that affect both environmental quality and income to address the potential endogeneity of income in ekc regressions ref 14 uses a parametric instrumental variables regression approach with and without fixed effects according to their results evidence for an inverted u relationship between income and environmental degradation are found for at least two out of the four iv specifications for seven out of eleven water pollutants biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand arsenic cadmium lead nickel and fecal coliform for these pollutants there is both a peak and a trough their iv results therefore provide some support for an environmental kuznets curve in global water quality in contrast the ols results which do not address the endogeneity of income show no inverted u relationship for any of the pollutants in addition to the concerns regarding parametric functional form and endogeneity of income a third concern affecting ekc estimation is the discrete nature of the political variables although the literature on estimating the environmental kuznets curve is growing fast and becoming very sophisticated in terms of empirical methodology used hitherto published articles in the ekc literature have not properly addressed the properties of categorical binary and or ordered explanatory variables in the model one problem that arises in incorporating political rights and civil liberties variables or any other categorical ordered or binary variable in a semiparametric or nonparametric regression is that such variables cannot be treated as continuous variables the conventional nonparametric approach to handle qualitative variables is a frequency estimator which involves splitting the samples into a number of cells 49 in this paper we use nonparametric functional forms for both categorical and continuous variables the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables are therefore three concerns regarding ekc estimation in order to address all three of these concerns we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to better identify the relationships between pollution income and political institutions we apply this method to analyze the relationships between water quality per capita gdp political rights and civil liberties at the global level over the period 1980 to 2012 our results indicate an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not in general we find that improved civil liberties and political rights are correlated with better water quality by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions as well which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve 2 model we first develop a theoretical model to illustrate why it is important to address the potential endogeneity of income when estimating the relationship between pollution and income why it is important to control for political institutions and why a nonparametric estimation may be better than a parametric estimation let pollution p be given by the following function g of income y political variable x and unobserved variable z 1 p g y x z let income y be given by the following function f of pollution p political variable x and unobserved variable z 2 y f p x z substituting the income function f into the pollution function g one obtains 3 p g f p x z x z the ekc relationship between pollution and income is given by the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income or g y the partial derivative of pollution with respect to income g y is not necessarily the same as the total derivative of pollution with respect to income d p d y as the following proposition illustrates proposition 1 the relationship between the partial derivative of pollution with respect to income and the total derivative of pollution with respect to income is given by 4 g y d p d y g x f p g y f x f p g x f x f z d z d x g z f p g y f z f p g z f x d x d z f z proof taking the total derivative of 1 one obtains 5 d p g y d y g x d x g z d z which upon rearranging yields 6 g y d p d y g x d x d y g z d z d y taking the total derivative of 2 one obtains 7 d y f p d p f x d x f z d z substituting 7 into 6 one obtains 8 g y d p d y g x f p d p d x f x f z d z d x g z f p d p d z f x d x d z f z the total derivative of pollution p with respect to political variable x is given by 9 d p d x g y f x g x the total derivative of pollution p with respect to unobserved variable z is given by 10 d p d z g y f z g z substituting 9 and 10 into 8 yields the desired result as seen in proposition 1 if we ignore the partial derivatives in the second and third terms in the right hand side of equation 4 we will have a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income corollary 1 describes the bias that arises if income is endogenous due to simultaneity bias simultaneity bias is present when pollution affects income so that f p 0 for example one reason pollution may affect income is that deteriorated environmental quality may affect economic growth corollary 1 endogeneity from simultaneity bias if pollution affects income f p 0 then ignoring the effect f p of pollution on income will lead to a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income if either or both of the following are true i the political variable x affects pollution p g x 0 ii the unobserved variable z affects pollution p g z 0 proof if f p 0 then g x 0 is a sufficient condition for the second term on the right hand side of equation 4 to be non zero if f p 0 then g z 0 is a sufficient condition for the third term on the right hand side of equation 4 to be non zero in addition to simultaneity a second reason income may be endogenous is that there may be omitted variables such as political institutions or cultural or geographic factors that affect both environmental quality and income corollary 2 describes the bias that arises if income is endogenous due to omitted variable bias omitted variable bias is present when the unobserved variable z affects both pollution and income i e when g z 0 f z 0 where is the logical operator denoting the logical conjunction and corollary 2 endogenity from omitted variable bias if the unobserved variable z affects both pollution and income g z 0 f z 0 then ignoring the effects of the unobserved variable z on pollution and on income will lead to a biased estimate of the partial derivative of the pollution function with respect to income g y and therefore a biased estimate of the ekc relationship between pollution and income proof if g z 0 f z 0 then the third term on the right hand side of equation 4 would be non zero owing to simultaneity bias and omitted variable bias it is important to address the endogeneity of income in addition owing to omitted variable bias it is important to control for political institutions as well in addition to highlighting the importance of addressing endogeneity and of controlling for political institutions our model also provides intuition why a non parametric estimation may be better than a parametric estimation this is formalized in corollary 3 below corollary 3 need for nonparametric model if any of the partial derivatives in the second or third terms on the right hand side of equation 4 are nonlinear then the ekc relationship g y which is a nonlinear function of the partial derivatives is highly nonlinear as well and therefore best modeled with a nonparametric model proof follows from proposition 1 in order to address the concerns raised by our theory model regarding endogeneity and the highly nonlinear nature of the relationship between pollution and income as well as a third concern regarding the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to identify the relationship between income and pollution 3 methods we are interested in identifying the relationships between water pollution income and political institutions the highly nonlinear relationship between income and pollution the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables are three concerns regarding such ekc estimation in order to address all three of these concerns we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables to address the potential endogeneity of income ref 14 uses a parametric instrumental variables regression approach with debt service and age dependency ratio as instruments for per capita gdp as their results suggest that the age dependency ratio is not strong instrument in this paper we only use debt as an instrument for gdp for the instrumental variable for gdp we try several variables such as share of gdp from manufacturing sector age dependency ratio and total debt service in the end we choose to use total debt service of gni as it has a very high correlation with our per capita gdp income variable debt is correlated with gdp but does not have a direct effect on environmental quality and is therefore a good instrument for gdp total debt service which includes the principal repayments and interest actually paid on debt is positively correlated with gdp because more debt is likely to be paid off when gdp is higher debt service may be correlated with types of degradation like deforestation if countries liquidate natural assets to pay off debts 50 but there is less reason to believe that countries with high debts would pollute more except indirectly through the effects of debt on gdp since emitting more water pollution does not help them pay off debts the same way liquidating natural assets would it is therefore gdp not debt that has a potential effect on water pollution we test the validity of debt as an instrument for income using a sargan test and the results confirm that debt is an exogenous variable we also test for the endogeneity of political rights and civil liberties in all pollutant income relationships using a durbin wu hausman test for the endogeneity test we use age dependency and share of gdp from manufacturing sector as instruments in the model according to our results we find political rights and civil right liberties to be exogenous in the models for all pollutants except arsenic therefore for the arsenic regression we use instrument not only for gdp but also for political rights and civil liberties as well recent papers in the econometrics literature such as ref 51 52 have developed nonparametric instrumental variable estimation methods in this paper we use a method suggested by ref 52 to estimate a nonparametric instrumental variable ekc regression model that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables such a model addresses three concerns regarding ekc estimation the highly nonlinear relationship between income and pollution the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables the model is given by 11 p g y y j 1 j g j x j u where p is pollution g y is an unknown smooth function for income y and g j is the unknown function for the j 2 political factors x j we use civil liberties and political rights although the model is estimated using a nonparametric regression model we separate the regressors y and x to emphasize the differences between the two types of variables income y is continuous and endogenous while the political factors x j are discrete and exogenous since the civil liberties and political rights variables are ordinal we use the method suggested by ref 49 to address continuous and categorical nature of variables further details on how to estimate a model with continuous and categorical variables in nonparametric estimation can be found in ref 53 55 for simplicity let us consider 12 g y x g y y j 1 j g j x j then equation 11 can be written as 13 p g y x u e u w x 0 for all instruments w and exogenous covariates x which is equivalent to 14 e p g y x w x 0 in this model y denotes per capita gdp which is endogenous x denotes the ordinal exogenous explanatory variables political rights and civil liberties and w denotes the instrument debt to address the ordinal and categorical nature of the political variables in a nonparametric model we use a method suggested by ref 53 55 to estimate the nonparametric instrumental variable model 4 4 we use the crs r package to estimate nonparametric models which contain both categorical and continuous variables 56 given in equation 14 we use cross validation as our bandwidth selection method to estimate the nonparametric model details on estimating equation 14 can be found in ref 52 here we briefly describe the estimation procedure we use a control function approach for nonparametric instrumental variable estimation in the control function model 15 p g y x u and 16 y h w v where g and h are unknown functions 17 e v w 0 w and 18 e u y x v e u v y x v assuming that the mean of y conditional on w exists equations 16 and 17 can always be made to hold by setting h w e y w 52 identification in the control function approach comes from equation 18 it follows from equations 15 and 18 that 19 e p y x v g y x k v where g and k are unknown functions in the above equation 19 v is unobservable and estimated consistently by the residuals from nonparametric estimation of h in equation 16 we then estimate g and k using nonparametric additive models we use splines for the continuous variables and kernels for the categorical variables we use a data driven method to select bandwidths and to estimate all nonparametric functional components including g y x and h w in particular for bandwidth selection we use least squares cross validation 57 our cross validation criterion function is 20 min l i p i g ˆ i y x 2 where g ˆ i y x is the leave one out estimator of g y x omitting observation i and where l is the vector of bandwidths used to construct g ˆ i y x 4 data we use water pollution data from the global environment monitoring system gems water dataset which consists of triennial surveys of water quality statistics since 1979 from countries across the developed and developing world we update the data set used by ref 4 and by ref 31 to include the years from 1991 to 2012 the global environment monitoring system gems for water was established in 1978 to improve water quality monitoring in freshwater ecosystems 58 and to collect worldwide water quality data for assessments of status and trends in global inland water quality 59 under the auspices of unep the united nations environment programme gems involves the world health organisation who the world meteorological organisation wmo and unesco 58 with the cooperation of participating countries the gems water program is creating a unique global water quality monitoring network that provides water quality data to a central database 59 the data and information on water quality provided by participating countries provide a global overview of the condition of water bodies and statements on changes and trends at global regional and local levels 58 the gems water program also provides support and encouragement to developing countries that wish to establish monitoring programs and conduct assessments of water quality through the provision of capacity development in the form of training advice and assessment tools 59 the gems data set consist of over 70 000 observations of dozens of different types of water pollution providing a substantive amount of data on varied measures of water quality each data point consists of the average over the three years of each triennial survey of one or more data point from one of the gems water program s hundreds of sites around the world the year we assign to each data point is the middle of the three years the countries included in our data set are afghanistan algeria argentina australia austria bangladesh belgium bolivia brazil cambodia canada chile china colombia congo cuba denmark ecuador egypt ecuador fiji finland france germany ghana greece guatemala hong kong hungary india indonesia iran ireland israel italy japan jordan kenya korea laos lithuania luxembourg malaysia mali marshall islands mexico morocco netherlands new zealand norway new zealand pakistan panama peru philippines poland portugal russian federation senegal singapore spain sri lanka sudan sweden switzerland tanzania thailand tunisia turkey uganda united kingdom united states of america uruguay vietnam and zimbabwe we focus on four types of water pollutants heavy metal nickel mercury arsenic cadmium lead pathogen related fecal coliform total coliform oxygen regime dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrient related nitrate all data are in the form of concentrations of mg l except for the mercury data which is in the form of μ g l and the coliform data which is in the form of measured count 100 ml lead mercury arsenic and cadmium are four important heavy metal pollutants responsible for adverse health effects in human beings 60 these pollutants pollute water through deposition in soil and subsequent runoff to water bodies cadmium can pollute the soil and water through deposition of air pollution and through application of fertilizer and chemicals to crops mercury pollution in water bodies comes in the form of methyl mercury which can affect humans through consumption of fish lead pollution in water comes from air pollution settling in soil as well as from the application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in crop production although the phase out of lead in gasoline has decreased the emission of lead 61 lead pollution in soil remains a concern for our income measure we use data on per capita gross domestic product gdp based on purchasing power parity ppp in constant 2005 international dollars from the world development indicators wdi in particular gdp per capita is converted to constant 2005 international dollars using purchasing power parity rates an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as the u s dollar has in the united states gdp at purchaser s prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products and is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources for data on political mechanisms we use indices on political rights pr and civil liberties cl from freedom house each index varies from 1 to 7 with 1 meaning the most political rights or civil liberties for example the united states has a 1 in each category in all years indonesia has recently been in the middle of the range and china has 7 in both categories for most years freedom house attempts to use a methodology not bound by culture but instead uses standards drawn from the universal declaration of human rights 62 political rights measure factors such as the fairness of the electoral process the degree of political pluralism and participation and the presence of a non corrupt and transparent government 62 civil liberties measure freedom of expression and beliefs the ability to associate the rule of law and the degree of individual autonomy the mean of the political rights variables is lower than that for civil liberties which implies that political rights are more prevalent in many countries than civil liberties are in previous studies e g 32 63 political rights and civil liberties have been combined into one democracy measure that takes on values from 2 to 14 for the instrumental variable for gdp as explained above we try several variables such as share of gdp from manufacturing sector age dependency ratio dependents the population under age 15 and above age 65 as a proportion of the working age population and total debt service of gni all from the world development indicators wdi in the end we choose to use total debt service of gni as it has a very high correlation with our per capita gdp income variable summary statistics for the water pollution variables are presented in table 1 summary statistics for income political variables and debt are presented in table 2 as seen in table 1 most pollutants exhibit a large range in values and a high standard deviation according to exploratory plots of the data in ref 14 the concentrations of the majority of the pollutants chemical oxygen demand total arsenic dissolved oxygen total lead total nickel and fecal coliform are decreasing functions of per capita income the concentrations of only two pollutants total cadmium and nitrate exhibit increasing functions of per capita income the concentrations of three pollutants biological oxygen demand total mercury and total coliform show no relationship with the income or political variables several of these trends are largely dependent upon the observations from only one or a few countries for example total cadmium s curve is dependent upon 1980s uk and 1990s france data this suggests that water quality generally improves as countries develop exploratory plots of the data also show that only a few of the pollutants chemical oxygen demand total arsenic total mercury and total cadmium potentially have an inverted u form for concentration with respect to income interestingly a few of the pollutants biological oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total lead fecal coliform appear to have an inverted u shape for the political variables as well the high amounts of pollution and mid range political variables for mexico india and colombia cause this phenomenon for both chemical and biological oxygen demand this is also reflected in the oecd versus non oecd plots in which concentrations decrease for oecd countries with improving political institutions while they increase for non oecd countries with improving political institutions these exploratory plots suggest that to the extent that there is an ekc it may be as much caused by political as income factors 14 5 results in fig 1 we present the graphical results of the estimated relationships between water pollution and per capita gdp political rights and civil liberties resulting from the nonparametric instrumental variable estimation for each of the 11 water pollutants we examine the left column of the figure represents the relationship between per capita gdp and pollution the middle column represents the relationship between political liberties and pollution and the last column represents the relationship between civil liberties and pollution we describe the results for each pollutant below the pollutants are organized by type heavy metal nickel mercury arsenic cadmium lead pathogen related fecal coliform total coliform oxygen regime dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrient related nitrate 5 1 heavy metals 5 1 1 nickel we find a cubic relationship or n shaped curve between nickel concentration and per capita gdp we do not find that variations in either political rights or civil liberties impact the nickel concentration when regressing nickel concentration on gdp gdp squared and gdp cubed ref 4 finds an environmental kuznets curve shape for the nickel income relationship however ref 64 who uses a time series analysis does not find the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for this pollutant 5 1 2 mercury per capita gdp and mercury concentration seem to have a cubic relationship we do not find that variations in either political rights or civil liberties impact the mercury concentration ref 65 finds an environmental kuznets curve relationship for mercury pollution using 1985 2006 data from louisiana watersheds 5 1 3 arsenic per capita gdp and arsenic pollution seem to have a v shaped relationship arsenic pollution declines if there are no political rights i e if the political rights index is high variations in civil liberties do not have any impact on the arsenic pollution 5 1 4 cadmium cadmium concentration seems to decline with increasing per capita gdp especially after per capita gdp hits the 6000 level however we do not find any definitive relationships between cadmium concentration and per capita gdp 5 1 5 lead we find that an inverted u shaped relationship exists between per capita gdp and lead concentration there is no distinct pattern on the relationship between civil liberties and lead pollution or political rights and lead pollution although it looks like lead concentrations reach their peak when the political rights variable has the value of 5 5 2 pathogen related 5 2 1 fecal coliform for fecal coliform we find almost a cubic relationship between pollution and income the lower turning points occur around 4000 whereas the upper turning point is around 10 000 variations in political rights or civil liberties do not seem to have any impact on the fecal coliform concentration in water bodies 5 2 2 total coliform the relationship between total coliform and per capita gdp seem to follow almost a polynomial of 4th degree type of relationship the pollution level seems to reduce substantially after the income level reaches the 11 000 level ref 64 does not find an environmental kuznets curve relationship for total coliform when the level of political rights is lower and the political rights index is higher total coliform concentration is lower 5 3 oxygen regime 5 3 1 dissolved oxygen at lower levels of gdp the relationship between gdp and dissolved oxygen looks flat but once the gdp level is 8000 or higher the dissolved oxygen level starts declining we do see a clear quadratic relationship between political rights and gdp there is no definitive relationship between variations in civil liberties and dissolved oxygen concentration 5 3 2 chemical oxygen demand the relationship between gdp and chemical oxygen demand concentration looks like an n shaped curve we also see that higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index are associated with higher levels of chemical oxygen demand and lower civil liberties are associated with lower levels of chemical oxygen demand the relationship with political rights is flat 5 3 3 biological oxygen demand the biological oxygen demand curve shows 5th degree of polynomial relationship with per capita gdp we see a clear relationship between civil liberties and biological oxygen demand with higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index associated with low biological oxygen demand levels and lower civil liberties associated with higher levels of pollution we do not find that variations in political rights affect the level of biological oxygen demand 5 4 nutrient related 5 4 1 nitrate many studies 15 36 have found the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for nitrate pollution according to our results however there is no definitive relationship between nitrate pollution and per capita gdp higher civil liberties and therefore a lower civil liberties index lead to lower nitrate pollution but variations in political rights have no impact on the nitrate pollution using gems data ref 64 also does not find support for an environmental kuznets curve in nitrate pollution 6 conclusion this study contributes to a better understanding of the relationships between water pollution and per capita gdp civil liberties and political rights at the global level in order to address concerns about the highly nonlinear relationship between pollution and income the endogeneity of income and the discrete nature of political variables we use a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in order to identify these relationships the upshot of our paper is that one shape does not fit all the pollutants and that the shapes vary quite a bit compared to what have been found so far in the literature according to our results we find an inverted u shaped relationship between pollution and income consistent with an environmental kuznets curve for one pollutant lead a cubic shape for three pollutants nickel mercury and fecal coliform and more highly nonlinear relationships for many of the other pollutants for several stock pollutants nickel mercury and arsenic we find that pollution levels may continue to increase at higher levels of income suggesting that stock pollutants may continue to accumulate in productive high income countries even when marginal emissions have been reduced we also find suggestive evidence that levels of pollutants resulting from industrial activity e g chemical oxygen demand may increase with income while those that are more driven by residential activity and population levels e g fecal coliform do not by using a nonparametric model that accounts for the discrete nature of the political variables we find that fewer pollutants exhibit an environmental kuznets curve than were previously found in studies using gems data including those of ref 4 14 31 64 66 in terms of the political variables we found that the arsenic and total coliform levels decline as the level of political rights declines and as the political rights index increases but lead and dissolved oxygen have an inverted u shaped relationship political rights for lead and dissolved oxygen results suggest that as countries progress towards political rights water pollution increases at first but then decreases after certain levels of political rights have been attained our results indicate that higher biological oxygen demand and nitrate pollution levels are associated with lower levels of civil liberties higher civil liberties index but that lower chemical oxygen demand levels are associated with lower levels of civil liberties higher civil liberties index thus factors affecting political rights such as the fairness of the electoral process the degree of political pluralism and participation and the presence of a non corrupt and transparent government are beneficial for water quality to some extent as seen in our theoretical model even for those water pollutants with which political institutions do not appear to have any systematic relationship it is still important to control for political institutions to address any endogeneity in income that may arise from omitted variable bias by estimating a nonparametric relationship between pollution and political institutions and by accounting for the categorical nature of the political variables we are able to detect a nonlinear relationship between pollution and political institutions which for some pollutants is an inverted u shaped curve we therefore improve upon the empirical analysis of ref 14 whose model uses instrumental variables but unlike the model in this paper is neither nonparametric nor accounts for the discrete nature of the political variables in contrast to our paper ref 14 is unable to tease out the nonlinear nature of some of the relationships and instead finds that the effect of political variables on pollution can be either positive or negative depending on pollutant and political variable our results suggests several avenues for potential research first while the gems global water data set is arguably the most comprehensive and reliable global data set on country level water quality to date while the gems water program aims at improving water quality monitoring in freshwater ecosystems and while the gems data set has been used by previous researchers in seminal papers on the topic e g 4 31 one may worry that water quality monitoring in developing countries may be weak in future work as water quality monitoring continues to improve we hope to further analyze relationships between environmental degradation income and political institutions with improved data as such data becomes available a second avenue for future research is to extend our nonparametric instrumental variable approach to enable the exploration of possible correlations between pollutants ref 65 uses a seemingly unrelated partially linear model to address a potential correlation between pollutants nitrogen phosphorous dissolved oxygen and mercury in an environmental kuznets curve study in future work we hope to address correlations using a nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables a third avenue for future research is to build on our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any nonstationarity in the variables a fourth avenue for future research is to build on our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any transboundary pollutants while the water pollutants in our data set are local water pollutants in inland water bodies for which transboundary issues across country borders may be second order in general it is possible for pollutants to cross country borders ref 67 develops a spatial econometric approach to measuring pollution externalities we hope in future work to combine spatial econometrics with our nonparametric instrumental variable approach that allows for the inclusion of continuous and discrete variables in a way that addresses any transboundary pollutants a fifth avenue for future research is to use new annual country level data on institutions that the world bank has begun collecting in 2008 including variables measuring political stability and absence of violence terrorism regulatory quality rule of law voice and accountability government effectiveness and control of corruption since these data are fairly recent there is less of an overlap with the 1980 2012 time period of the data used in this study however as more years of this new world bank institutions data become available we hope in future work to use this data to further tease out the relationships between water pollution income and institutions a sixth avenue for future research is to further and more rigorously examine possible mechanisms for why pollution levels may increase with income for some pollutants doing so may require more and better data especially at higher levels of income in future work as more and better data at higher levels of income become available we hope to further analyze mechanisms by which pollution levels may increase at higher levels of income our results suggest that there may be nonlinear relationships between environmental degradation income and political institutions as a country s economy develops and its income rises there may be nonlinear effects on water quality similarly improvements in political institutions may have nonlinear effects on water quality as well our results also suggest that policies that improve income and or political institutions may have nonlinear effects on water quality and that these effects vary by pollutant policy makers and academics alike should therefore be aware of the complex nature of the relationships between water pollution income and political institutions as they design strategies for environmental management and sustainable development 
8724,this study applies an information theoretic econometric approach in the form of a new maximum likelihood minimum power divergence ml mpd semi parametric binary response estimator to analyze dichotomous contingent valuation data the ml mpd method estimates the underlying behavioral decision process leading to a person s willingness to pay for river recreation site attributes empirical choice probabilities willingness to pay measures for recreation site attributes and marginal effects of changes in some explanatory variables are estimated for comparison purposes a logit model is also implemented a wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution underlying the logit model is rejected at the 0 01 level in favor of the ml mpd distribution model our results also demonstrate the potential for substantially overstating the precision of the estimates and associated inferences when the imposition of unknown structural information is not accounted explicitly for in the model the ml mpd model provides more intuitively reasonable and defensible results regarding the valuation of river recreation than the logit model keywords minimum power divergence cressie read statistics contingent valuation binary response models information theoretic econometrics river recreation 1 introduction economists have used diverse valuation techniques to estimate the economic values of non market water resources including revealed preference aka recreation travel demand models and hedonic property models and stated preference techniques aka contingent valuation cv methods and choice experiments in practice resource economists seek to know marginal effects of changes in different attributes of water resources rivers or lakes that water resource specialists are capable of managing in principle marginal values of changes in river recreation attributes can be obtained using choice experiments or pooling dichotomous choice cv responses derived from either hypothetical scenarios of river quality or from a natural experiment of pooling data obtained at river sites that have varying site quality attributes when the goal is to estimate marginal values of these management relevant attributes using dichotomous choice cv responses strong functional form assumptions of the conditional expectation i e fully parametric functional specifications are frequently imposed for this purpose without invoking such restrictions or when using appropriate non parametric econometric approaches e g the kriström 23 fully non parametric estimator identification of the marginal effects of changes in management relevant explanatory variables will not usually be possible thus most cv studies found in the water resource valuation literature rely on fully parametric discrete choice models e g binary response models brms these brms allow managers to determine how the value of a water based recreation area varies with possible changes in water management e g flow regime reservoir levels the large majority of empirical analysts who have utilized discrete choice models have chosen parametric statistical procedures on the basis of precedent and readily available software these methods require a full parametric functional specification of the relationship between regressors and the response variable and more importantly a full specification of a parametric distribution of the disturbances e g the probit normal or logit cumulative distribution functions cdfs although some distributional assumptions can be benign especially if the parameterization is flexible enough to describe behavior adequately mcfadden 33 mcfadden and train 34 the implementation of an incorrect parametric functional form can lead to spurious statistical inferences due to biased and inconsistent estimates moreover underlying economic theory provides little guidance for using these functional specifications so there is insufficient information regarding the appropriate distribution to adopt in practice mittelhammer et al 37 crooker and herriges 9 thus any parametric functional specification for either the stochastic error or the utility differences used in these methods is in general uncertain and questionable creel and loomis 8 this study applies a new brm to dichotomous cv data which is semi parametric by nature and unlike many non parametric approaches provides both density structure and flexibility allowing identification of marginal effects of changes in the explanatory variables on willingness to pay wtp its density structure is supported by a large and varied new family of cdfs which has the flexibility to fit a very wide variety of distributional shapes to the choices made by survey respondents it also nests the behavior of some prominent binary response estimators e g the logit model and can approximate a vast array of left and right skewed probability density functions pdfs due to its highly flexible class of density shapes mittelhammer and judge 38 this new estimator known as the maximum likelihood minimum power divergence ml mpd binary response estimator avoids using a priori model specification information about the functional form of the conditional expectation of the response variable this feature of the ml mpd estimator reduces the potential for model specification errors that arise when relying on tenuous parametric distributional assumptions underlying binary responses moreover the ml mpd maintains the full set of familiar ml sampling properties consistency asymptotic normality and asymptotic efficiency and unlike most non parametric methods does not employ the usual kernel density estimation methodology with the attendant required implementation choices relating to bandwidth kernel functions and other tuning parameter issues that is the ml mpd estimator is free of user specified tuning parameters and substantially avoids specification problems 1 1 while we note there are important advantages of the ml mpd as compared to fully non parametric approaches a reviewer pointed out that it would be a useful extension of this study to include the implementation of a non parametric version of the model we estimated since the fully parametric logit model is the most commonly employed method to estimate wtp using a dichotomous choice cv question we leave an empirical comparison of the ml mpd to fully non parametric methods to future research notwithstanding mcmillen and redfearn 35 note that in practice non parametric estimates have been shown to be insensitive to the choice of the kernel function and the bandwidth in non parametric models can be estimated via cross validation it has not been shown that insensitivity to the kernel choice is always the case regardless of the data generating processes underlying the data moreover the introduction of estimating the bandwidth parameter is not without cost as it introduces additional noise variation into the estimated model finally since the kernel acts as a weighting function in averaging data one would expect that applying notably different weights in a data neighborhood could result in differing estimates depending upon the distribution of the data in the neighborhood the ml mpd estimator begins in a non parametric information theoretic context regarding model specification then semi parametric orthogonality relationships in the form of empirical sample moments are introduced that within the non parametric information theoretic framework ultimately lead to a new parametric family of probability distributions cdfs for brms see judge and mittelhammer 21 ch 9 as well as a conditional expectation function for brms and estimators for the unknowns in the model thus the ml mpd approach combines attractive features of parametric semi parametric and non parametric estimation methodologies several distribution free estimators for estimating brms have already been proposed in the literature to overcome model misspecification issues e g manski 30 turnbull 44 cosslett 7 kriström 23 horowitz 16 matzkin 32 klein and spady 22 li 27 chen and randall 4 creel and loomis 8 araña and león 1 huang et al 17 however the majority of these estimators have not found widespread application in the empirical discrete choice literature for a number of reasons that may include 1 users lack of understanding regarding the estimation and inference properties of the approaches in empirical applications 2 difficulties in providing economic interpretations of the results of the analysis 3 nonidentification of model parameters e g kriström 23 and the klein and spady 22 estimator 2 2 despite the infrequency of empirical applications the ks estimator is considered in the econometrics literature to be one of the statistically best semi parametric estimators in the sense that its asymptotic covariance matrix achieves the semi parametric efficiency bound for the single index brm ks and marginal effects and 4 ambiguity and or uncertainty regarding the appropriate choices for tuning parameters and other estimator implementation computational issues creel and loomis 8 underscore that the required scale and local normalizations for the identification of ks parameter estimates are questionable because they go beyond restrictions implied by demand theory moreover it has been found that other suggested semi parametric methods do not achieve root n consistency e g the manski 30 and horowitz 16 estimators and their finite sample behavior is in question e g the cosslett 7 ks and ichimura 18 estimators 3 3 see chen and khan 5 for more details while fully non parametric estimation techniques tend to be more robust to incorrect functional specifications of conditional expectation functions as well as probability distributions most of them involve various choices of tuning parameters kernels and other implementation choices crooker and herriges 9 state that the gains and losses from using non parametric and semi parametric estimators to recover wtp measures relative to the standard parametric approaches are still unknown there remains a continuing need to seek robust and efficient methods for analyzing binary decision making behavior this empirical application of the new ml mpd estimator relates to a stated preference cv on site dataset collected along two rivers at the caribbean national forest cnf in puerto rico the ml mpd estimator is used to analyze the underlying behavioral economic decision process leading to a person s wtp for river recreation site attributes in order to compare the new ml mpd approach to a leading empirical method for analyzing brms we also implement the commonly used fully parametric logit estimator 4 4 probit ml results are available from the senior author upon request as well as the data employed in this paper in the next section we discuss the ml mpd estimator for the brm and its implementation section 3 describes the dataset utilized in this study and the nature of the decision making context in section 4 we present the results from our analyses we conclude in section 5 with a summary of our findings and its corresponding implications 2 the ml mpd estimator for the brm and estimation framework we present an overview of the ml mpd estimator for the brm in this section the logit model is well documented in the literature and is not reviewed here the statistical approaches used in this study allow one to model the underlying consumers binary choices as the outcomes of a latent utility maximizing process where respondents are assumed to choose the alternative that result in the greatest indirect utility 2 1 the ml mpd estimator for the brm to motivate the ml mpd estimator note that the n dimensional vector of unknown bernoulli probabilities corresponding to a brm 1 p y i 1 x i p i 1 f x i β f x i β i 1 n is associated with an unknown link or transformation function f of factors affecting the decision environment and that in practice is expressed in terms of an index function assumed to be linear 5 5 this index is usually a function of the covariates x and a vector of β unknown parameters which is estimated along with the link function although non linear specifications and the linear box cox utility function are also possible the commonly used linear index representation x i β with β being a vector of parameters is considered in this study the ml mpd approach can be generalized to utilize nonlinear index representations more generally one can always characterize the bernoulli random variables y 1 y 2 y n r n as being defined by y i p i ε i i with zero mean error e ε i 0 i without knowledge of the particular parametric distributional specification of the link function the traditional ml estimation approach is not available one might then consider a quasi ml estimator but this econometric estimator does not assure the full set of attractive ml sampling properties mittelhammer et al 37 and moreover it can be challenging to characterize its sampling properties in any given application alternatively one might consider the two stage generalized method of moment estimator however the approach is not appealing for the current application due to the ill posed underdetermined nature of the estimating equations see equation 2 ahead in this study we adopt an information theoretic estimator for β unlike classical estimation procedures information theoretic estimators rely on kullback s 24 information theoretic minimum discrimination information principle 6 6 an alternative to this principle is the maximum entropy principle also known as the shannon s 43 entropy measure or the generalized maximum entropy approach although there are some recent theoretical and empirical contributions in the econometric literature using the latter approach e g golan et al 10 crooker and herriges 9 marsh and mittelhammer 31 a user of the method is also confronted with a notable number of tuning parameter type of decisions to make for which the performance consequences are not well known currently and on data moment constraints sample moments as defined in mittelhammer and judge 38 and judge and mittelhammer 21 the information theoretic estimation principle allows joint estimation of the unknown parameters of the model along with the empirical sampling distributions that exhibit minimum discrepancy relative to a reference distribution the mpd approach is robust in terms of the uncountably infinite number of highly varied candidate distributions that are members of the distribution class and it maintains the full set of usual ml estimation and inference sampling behavior properties under familiar regularity conditions as noted by judge and mittelhammer 21 the mpd has been shown through monte carlo simulations to exhibit mean square error mse superiority relative to probit and logit estimators moreover the ml mpd estimator has been shown to be mse superior to the best semi parametric estimator i e the ks estimator under certain sampling conditions and has the flexibility to fit a wide variety of distributional shapes to the latent variables underlying the bernoulli process the application of the ml mpd can be conceptualized in two stages although implementation of the estimation methodology can actually be performed in one computational step one begins with an ill posed inverse problem 7 7 by inverse problem we mean the problem of recovering information about unknown and uncontrolled unobservable components of an econometric model from indirect noisy observations based on observable data consisting of the non parametric linear model y i p i ε i i noted above along with generally applicable semi parametric orthogonality conditions between explanatory variables and model noise of the general form e g x y p 0 then an mpd solution for the probabilities is found that identifies a complete set of new parametric probability distributions for the brm see 4 in a second stage based on the mpd solution of probability distributions ml estimation is used to estimate the unknowns that occur in the class of probability distributions the results produce estimates of the effects of explanatory variables on the conditional bernoulli probabilities and also concurrently identify a link function for those probabilities in effect the method estimates the functional form of the probability model along with estimates of the unknown probabilities in the model regarding the first stage of the method an estimation objective function is represented in terms of the information theoretic cressie read cr 8 8 this goodness of fit measure encompasses the empirical likelihood objective as a special case when γ 1 and the maximum entropy or kullback leibler objective when γ 0 among others as γ ranges from to the cr divergence measure leads to different information theoretic estimators see mittelhammer et al 37 chapter 13 4 lee et al 26 and judge and mittelhammer 21 power divergence criterion which measures the discrepancy between the probabilities to be estimated and a reference distribution for those probabilities then including sample moment constraints based on zero mean population conditions the mpd extremum problem is specified as 2 min p c r p q γ s t n 1 g x y p 0 and 0 p i 1 i where c r p q γ is a member of the cr family of statistics 9 9 for more details about the flexible cr power divergence family of statistics see read and cressie 42 and imbens et al 19 q q 1 q 2 q n i 1 n 0 1 is an n dimensional vector of reference bernoulli probabilities and γ is the scalar power parameter of the divergence measure the sample moment constraint vector equation n 1 g x y p 0 is of dimension m 1 where g r k r m is a real valued measurable function the inequality non negativity and upper bound constraints on the solved probability values p p 1 p 2 p n i 1 n 0 1 are logically necessary for p to represent an n dimensional vector of conditional on x bernoulli probabilities underlying the binary decisions in the current empirical application the specification g x x is utilized where x is a vector of explanatory variables affecting the binary decision outcome the cr power divergence criterion in this binary application takes the following form mittelhammer and judge 38 3 cr p q γ i 1 n p i p i q i γ 1 1 p i 1 p i 1 q i γ 1 γ γ 1 this discrepancy measure is always positive valued unless p i q i no matter the choice of γ the value of the discrepancy measure becomes larger the more divergent p i and q i are and the measure is convex in the p i s and second order continuously differentiable the mpd family of cdfs i e a minimum power divergence solution for the probabilities that solve the extremum problem represented in equation 2 using equation 3 for the cr power divergence criterion is given by 4 p w i q i γ arg p i p i q i γ 1 p i 1 q i γ w i γ 0 when γ 0 arg p i l n p i q i l n 1 p i 1 q i w i 0 when γ 0 arg p i 1 p i q i γ 1 p i 1 q i γ w i γ 0 0 when γ 0 and w i γ 1 q i γ γ 1 1 q i γ γ 1 q i γ γ 1 1 q i γ where w i x i β β represents the m 1 vector of lagrange multipliers of the moment constraints when 2 is expressed in lagrange form and x i denotes the ith 1 k row vector contained within the n k matrix of covariates x a complete analytic derivation of the mpd family of cdfs solution is provided in appendix a the definition in 4 characterizes an uncountably infinite number of cdfs with argument w i indexed by the values of γ and q i for example when γ 0 and q i 0 5 the standard logit model is subsumed by the family of distributions it is clear that the inverse cdf of the mpd family always exists in closed form but except for a measure zero set of possibilities for γ and q i the probabilities themselves must be solved for numerically fortunately strict monotonicity properties of the terms involving the p i s in 4 make for a relatively straightforward and efficient numerical solution procedure that is guaranteed to provide an appropriate solution for p i for any admissible argument w i of the cdf in the application ahead the empirical probabilities were solved for numerically using the interval bisection method root finding algorithm additional detail on both computational methodology and characteristics of the mpd family of distributions including their myriad different shapes and properties can be found in mittelhammer and judge 38 and judge and mittelhammer 21 the mpd family of parametric probability distributions in 4 is used as a basis for specifying the likelihood function associated with the data outcomes leading to a log likelihood function of the general form l β q γ i 1 n y i ln p x i β q i γ 1 y i ln 1 p x i β q i γ where we henceforth define β λ 10 10 a formal argument rationalizing the equating of the lagrange multiplier vector λ and the unknown parameter vector β is given in judge and mittelhammer 21 chapter 10 2 2 estimation framework in the implementation of the ml mpd estimator we specify q i q i which is tantamount to assuming that the same basic functional form for the probability distribution p x i β q γ is used across the observations for representing the conditional bernoulli probabilities in this context it is the x i s and thus the arguments of the distributions that cause the probabilities to vary across survey respondents the negative of the log likelihood function is maximized using the non gradient based nelder mead simplex minimization algorithm proposed by nelder and mead 39 11 11 a detailed explanation of this algorithm and its implementation can be found in nelder and mead 39 and jacoby et al 20 this optimization method belongs to the general class of direct search methods and has become one of the most widely used techniques for non linear unconstrained optimization the nelder mead algorithm does not rely on gradients or hessians so that it typically generates iterations more quickly than search methods that depend on derivatives of the objective function e g newton raphson the nelder mead approach also mitigates numerical problems caused by highly nonlinear problems extreme flatness of log likelihood functions and associated unstable gradient and or hessian calculations from iteration to iteration preliminary graphical investigations with our data regarding the behavior of the log likelihood function suggested that the log likelihood was notably flat in the γ direction over a range of values in which the maximum of the likelihood function was likely to reside in order to facilitate stability and accuracy in the search for the ml optimum over a concave but relatively flat likelihood function while mitigating the possibility of convergence to local optima we implement a grid search in the γ direction specifically we begin the search using the standard logistic distribution γ 0 q 0 5 as the starting probability distribution and solve 2 for q β given γ 0 then a grid above and below γ 0 in 0 2 increments is implemented using a recursively updated set of starting values based on immediately preceding solutions identifying a γ grid indexed series of solutions for 2 that bracketed the optimum within an interval of length 0 2 a second grid search based on 0 01 increments between the bracket values is then utilized to determine the optimum with a 0 01 tolerance level while this grid search method with recursively updated starting values does not guarantee a global optimum it reduces the possibility of not searching in the neighborhood of the global optimum the estimated covariance matrix of the ml mpd estimator is based on the optimized log likelihood function and the standard outer product of gradients opg approach for defining the asymptotic covariance matrix of the mle in particular by letting θ β q γ the covariance matrix was estimated via l θ θ l θ θ 1 θ ˆ where θ ˆ is the ml mpd estimate of the parameters and l θ θ is the n k 2 matrix of derivatives of the log of the likelihood function contributions l i θ i 1 n with respect to θ 12 12 an alternative approach could follow the result of patefield 40 based on the profile likelihood function concentrated on only the β parameter if one were not interested in inferences concerning the mpd distribution parameters because there is generally no closed form solution for the probabilities in 4 one needs to apply implicit differentiation in order to define the derivatives of the log likelihood with respect to β q and γ expressions for the derivatives are somewhat involved but are straightforward to compute using generalized hadamard multiplication and division operators see appendix b for comparison purposes we also calculate and report the conditional on q ˆ γ ˆ covariance matrix of β ˆ based on the opg method note that this comparison is informative in the sense that conditioning on a particular q and γ e g standard symmetric logistic distribution if γ 0 and q 0 5 is analogous to the common empirical practice of choosing a specific functional form for the distribution underlying binary responses like specifying the probit or logit model in the parametric ml estimation method since the covariance matrix is generally understated when conditioning on unknown parameters that were estimated the empirical comparison of the ml mpd and the logit model suggests the potential for overstating the precision of estimates and associated inferences when lack of information regarding the appropriate functional form of the probability distribution is not explicitly accounted for in the model computational implementation of all of the preceding procedures relating to the ml mpd estimator and logit mle is based on aptech systems gauss 3 data and problem setting the dataset contains information on 718 in person interviews with visitors at ten recreation sites along the mameyes and espiritu santo rivers in puerto rico during the summers of 2004 and 2005 both rivers are located in northeastern puerto rico are only about 2 miles apart originate in the caribbean national forest cnf drain the cnf on and off forest and extend toward the atlantic ocean the ten river recreation sites are with the exception of the variables we control for in this study very similar since the sites are just upstream or downstream from one another and several of them are accessed by a paved road therefore we do not attempt to control for any spatial heterogeneity across the ten recreation sites on the two rivers other than the site specific variables such as flows or volume of the natural water pools table 1 provides a list of site attributes considered in this study the river recreation sites under study are available to visitors for swimming wading and soaking and some of them have the attraction of providing a hydromassage experience similar to that of a jacuzzi the data was collected through dichotomous response cv surveys administered on site by in person interviews at the recreation pool sites employing the single bounded 13 13 this approach has the potential to be less efficient than the double bounded protocol however mcfadden 33 and cooper et al 6 have documented that the single bounded cv question eliminates the response inconsistency and its associated bias dichotomous choice approach as the elicitation protocol which is also referred to in the literature as the closed ended cv approach or the take it or leave it approach the survey asked each randomly sampled recreation user the following cv question as you know the price of gasoline often goes up taking into consideration that there are other rivers as well as beaches nearby where you could go visit if the cost of this visit to this river was more than what you have already spent would you still have come today yes or no the hypothetical additional cost of the visit was randomly drawn from a set of 18 bid thresholds 14 14 the chosen bid vector of 18 prices was 1 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 130 140 150 160 180 200 for each respondent and ranged from 1 to 200 the payment vehicle was added travel cost this has been used in past cv surveys reviewed by gonzalez sepulveda 11 in part because it is a neutral payment vehicle loomis and walsh 29 and is less likely to result in protest responses compared to entrance fees therefore no check for protest responses was made the respondents were reminded of the availability of substitute rivers and beaches in the area however they were not reminded to consider their budget constraints further the potential of yea saying 15 15 yea saying is the tendency of the respondent to want to agree with the dollar amount suggested by the reviewer mitchell and carson 36 that can lead to hypothetical bias in cv has not been addressed however for the purposes of comparing mean wtp derived from the logit estimator and the ml mpd estimator the influence of omission of budget constraints and detection for and adjustment to yea saying will not affect our comparison of wtp between these two estimators although it may affect the absolute magnitude of the wtp amounts with both of these methods additional details of the survey and its design are given in gonzalez sepulveda 11 additional information used in the models include on site attributes road quality volume and speed of water in the pools and size of rocks or sand surrounding the pools a threshold indicator of the level of a recreation user s income and travel time information as cameron and james 3 propose 16 16 the binary specification for travel time and its cut off was meant to differentiate local visitors from the nearby towns from more distant visitors from the major city of san juan tables 1 and 2 summarize the variables included in the estimated models along with descriptive statistics 4 results results presented in this section are based on the variables defined in table 1 the wtp measures are interpreted on an aggregate per group basis 17 17 the average group in the ten different river recreation sites under study at the cnf consisted of 3 5 visitors and are calculated for the logit and ml mpd models using hanemann s 14 15 approach following hanemann the difference in utilities of visitors from accepting or rejecting the hypothetical additional cost i e the bid a of the visit to the river recreation sites at the cnf is denoted by 5 δ u a i z u 1 i a i z u 0 i z where u is the utility function i denotes annual income z is a vector of visitor and recreational site characteristics and a i is the offered bid to visitor i the bid value that makes the visitor indifferent between acceptance rejection defines the wtp and the calculation of its mean is obtained by dividing the negative grand constant term by the absolute value of the estimated coefficient associated with a the grand constant term is calculated as a linear combination of the means of the explanatory variables times their associated coefficients with the effect of a suppressed 4 1 logit model results to solve for the mle of the logit model see table 3 we utilized the berndt hall hall hausman optimization approach berndt et al 2 the logit model results indicate that the bid variable is highly significant and its sign is consistent with economic theory indicating that the higher the price of a visit to the river recreation site the less willing users are to visit that site a continuous measure of the dollar amount of respondent s income has often been dropped in dichotomous choice cv studies sometimes it is dropped based on theoretical grounds in the linear in bid binary logit model see e g hanemann 14 haab and mcconnell 13 but it can also be dropped due mainly to lack of statistical significance gonzalez et al 12 however when expressed as a dichotomous income threshold indicator its coefficient in this application was found to be significantly different from zero and positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount the variables bid size size of the rocks or sand surrounding the water pools and road non paved roads contribute to the explanation of the dependent variable at the 0 01 level of type i error volume of water in the pools of the two rivers is also positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount whereas the variables bid discharge non paved dirt road size and travel time are negatively associated with the probability of paying the bid amount it is worth noting that discharge could be positive or negative the available literature indicates that recreation benefits increase with river flow up to a point so a negative coefficient is unusual in this case however in this application the river is used by families with small children so the parents would not want high flows as it endangers their children hence discharge is treated as two tailed travel time is often negative in recreation demand analyses since travel time reflects the higher opportunity cost of time to visit more distant recreation destinations wilman 45 larson and lew 25 table 3 also reports the estimated mean wtp from the logit model as well as confidence intervals cis for the compensated wtp measure employing hanneman s approach for estimating the mean wtp as described above and the delta method to derive the asymptotic standard errors the mean logit wtp measure is 114 74 and the 95 ci based on z scores ranges from 101 28 to 128 19 we note that the estimated mean wtp obtained from the fully parametric logit model appears to be relatively high given the typical levels of income of visitors surveyed at the cnf 45 of visitors annual income is less than 15 000 and the values in the literature for swimming and other non boating non fishing water based recreation loomis 28 as well as the type of recreation experience obtained by visiting the river recreation sites 4 2 ml mpd model results parameter estimates β ˆ m l m p d of the β vector corresponding to γ ˆ 4 23 and q ˆ 0 8853 are presented in table 3 along with associated asymptotic standard errors derived from the conditional and unconditional variance covariance matrices for β ˆ m l m p d goodness of fit measures mcfadden r2 aic and bic and the mean ml mpd wtp estimate and its corresponding cis are also reported in this table based on the goodness of fit measures the ml mpd model performs better than the logit model from table 3 we see that r squared from the ml mpd model is about 22 higher than the r squared for the logit model also the akaike information criterion and the bayesian information criterion both improve under the ml mpd which provides additional evidence that the ml mpd fits better than the logit model regarding parameter estimates the coefficients for the ml mpd and logit models have identical signs except for the income variable as mentioned previously the dichotomous income indicator is positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount in the logit model but when using the ml mpd approach a negative effect of income arises suggesting that a visit to the river recreation sites is an inferior good although the income effect is not statistically significant at any conventional level as in other studies of this type the ml mpd approach does not result in uniformly smaller estimated standard errors relative to logit especially in reference to the standard errors derived from the full unconditional covariance matrix see table 3 as indicated in section 4 1 the variables that are statistically significant at the 0 01 level of type i error using the logit model are bid size and road the ml mpd results based on the conditional covariance matrix for the bid and size regressors are also significant at the 0 01 level with the road regressor being significant at the 0 05 level however these same three variables achieve significance at only the 0 10 level when the unconditional covariance matrix for the ml mpd is used this result recognizes the uncertainty involved in choosing the appropriate functional form of the probability distribution underlying binary responses the discharge variable is significant at the 0 05 level for the logit model and statistically insignificant at conventional levels in the ml mpd case however its probability value of 0 12 suggests that its effect should not necessarily be ignored the travel time indicator variable is significant at the 0 05 level under the logit estimator but insignificant under the ml mpd estimator regardless of whether conditional or unconditional covariance matrices are utilized regarding the ml mpd results for q and γ we conducted a wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution hypothesis h o q 0 5 and γ 0 and the null hypothesis is rejected at the 0 01 level this suggests that a logistic approach is inappropriate for this application we also tested separately the individual hypotheses of symmetric distributions h o q 0 5 and a general i e possibly skewed logistic distribution h o γ 0 both hypotheses are also rejected at the 0 01 level table 3 also shows that the ml mpd mean wtp estimate of 27 46 for a visit to the river recreation sites is substantially lower in value than the result estimated with the logit 114 74 approach moreover it is apparent from the fact that the 95 ci for the ml mpd approach 13 01 41 91 does not overlap the ci of the logit estimate that the mean wtp estimated via ml mpd is statistically significantly smaller than the logit estimate at any conventional level of confidence lastly we tested whether there is a difference in wtp distributions based on the logit and ml mpd approaches i e ho wtplogit wtpml mpd using the nonparametric complete combinatorial convolution approach of poe et al 41 the resulting two tailed p value of zero to five decimal places rejected the null hypothesis very convincingly indicating that the two empirical wtp distributions are statistically significantly different turning to the reasonableness of the binary logit and the ml mpd mean wtp estimates we believe that given low incomes of the visitors to these two rivers and the wtp values in the literature for similar recreation experiences the estimated mean wtp derived from the ml mpd approach appears to be considerably more plausible corroborating this conclusion is the fact that the wtp from this same data but estimated using the revealed preference travel cost method gonzalez sepulveda 11 yields an estimate of wtp of 21 63 to 33 29 this result provides further support for the ml mpd over the logit estimate lastly in order to provide additional perspective regarding the mean wtp results for the ml mpd and logit estimates fig 1 plots the logistic distribution underlying the logit model as well as the mpd distribution resulting from ml mpd estimation of the brm the non symmetric nature of the optimal distribution relative to the a priori symmetric logit distribution is quite apparent in fig 1 the mpd distribution is substantially left skewed the right most and left most vertical lines in the figure correspond to the estimated values of the probability distribution indices i e x β for the logit and ml mpd estimates evaluated at the sample mean values of the explanatory variables respectively it is evident from this figure that the probability of accepting the mean bid when evaluating other characteristics also at their mean values is substantially lower for the mpd estimated model than for the logit model also examining the probability of bid acceptance when evaluating the bids at the estimated mean wtps generated by the two estimators again for mean values of the other explanatory variables which occurs at an index value of 0 on the horizontal axis for both approaches results in a substantially higher probability of acceptance for the mpd approach in the lower trail range of the range of bids offered to the visitors than for the logit approach essentially the flexibility obtained from simultaneously estimating the skew spread and index of the link function representing bernoulli probabilities allowed the ml mpd estimates to accommodate higher acceptance probabilities in a small lower tail range of the bids offered to visitors thus leading to the lower mean wtp 4 3 comparisons of marginal values of river recreation site attributes based on the fact that the logit model is rejected marginal effects of changes in the explanatory variables on wtp are calculated here for the ml mpd model only in pursuit of this task marginal values of changes in river recreation site attributes are computed by forming the ratio of the value of the coefficient of the explanatory variable associated with the site attribute and the absolute value of the coefficient of the bid variable using the ml mpd approach the marginal values of changes in river recreation site attributes indicate that visitors would be willing to pay 33 70 for reducing high instream flows lower discharge for the reasons discussed previously and 39 90 to have paved roads to the river recreation site the change in wtp relating to decreasing the size of rocks or sand around the water pools is 2 10 whereas the marginal effect associated with the increased volume of water in the pools is 0 26 per cubic foot of water 5 conclusions and implications in this paper we present an information theoretic econometric approach to empirically analyzing the willingness to pay for river recreation site attributes using a new ml mpd binary response estimator for dichotomous cv data in contrast to many alternative estimators the ml mpd estimator mitigates the need for subjective choices of distributional functional form and tuning parameters the ml mpd has the flexibility to fit a wide range of varied distributional shapes to conform to the choice process observed while utilizing only very general non parametric moment assumptions relating to the data moreover the ml mpd method allows for statistical testing of the symmetry of distribution assumption q 0 5 as well as a test of the validity of the logistic family of distributions γ 0 either symmetric with q 0 5 or non symmetric for general q as such and based on our results the ml mpd approach to estimation appears to represent a useful innovative estimation framework for providing general and testable representations of data generating processes underlying economic decision making behavior in binary choice situations in our case study of river recreation the ml mpd model rejects the special case of a logit model restriction at the 0 01 level of significance in addition another empirical finding of this study is that the ml mpd approach yields a substantially lower estimate of the mean wtp 27 46 for a visit to the river recreation sites at the caribbean national forest compared to the mean wtp obtained from the fully parametric logit 114 74 approach based on the nature of the recreational experience the very low income of typical visitors to the rivers and the comparison to a prior travel cost method recreation demand benefit estimate the lower ml mpd mean wtp value appears to be a more reasonable and defensible estimate of the mean wtp for visiting these river recreation sites if policymakers were to contemplate entry fees to these recreation sites in the caribbean national forest the lower mean wtp estimate of the ml mpd approach would also suggest a substantially lower range of fees than those implied by the logit model except for income the effects of all other visitor characteristics or site attributes on wtp were the same in sign using either the logit or ml mpd approach while the two methods were in agreement that the size of the bid size of rocks or sand and road quality all significantly impacted the acceptance of the bid they differed in the magnitude of the impacts moreover the methods differed on the statistical significance of other attributes the results beg the question of whether the parametric logit approach is understating uncertainty about model components and overstating significance of estimation results by assuming that the functional form of the probability distribution underlying decision outcomes is fully known and certain the ml mpd method has an inherent feature of mitigating unwarranted indications of over precision by explicitly introducing uncertainty with respect to the functional form of the distribution underlying the

8724,this study applies an information theoretic econometric approach in the form of a new maximum likelihood minimum power divergence ml mpd semi parametric binary response estimator to analyze dichotomous contingent valuation data the ml mpd method estimates the underlying behavioral decision process leading to a person s willingness to pay for river recreation site attributes empirical choice probabilities willingness to pay measures for recreation site attributes and marginal effects of changes in some explanatory variables are estimated for comparison purposes a logit model is also implemented a wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution underlying the logit model is rejected at the 0 01 level in favor of the ml mpd distribution model our results also demonstrate the potential for substantially overstating the precision of the estimates and associated inferences when the imposition of unknown structural information is not accounted explicitly for in the model the ml mpd model provides more intuitively reasonable and defensible results regarding the valuation of river recreation than the logit model keywords minimum power divergence cressie read statistics contingent valuation binary response models information theoretic econometrics river recreation 1 introduction economists have used diverse valuation techniques to estimate the economic values of non market water resources including revealed preference aka recreation travel demand models and hedonic property models and stated preference techniques aka contingent valuation cv methods and choice experiments in practice resource economists seek to know marginal effects of changes in different attributes of water resources rivers or lakes that water resource specialists are capable of managing in principle marginal values of changes in river recreation attributes can be obtained using choice experiments or pooling dichotomous choice cv responses derived from either hypothetical scenarios of river quality or from a natural experiment of pooling data obtained at river sites that have varying site quality attributes when the goal is to estimate marginal values of these management relevant attributes using dichotomous choice cv responses strong functional form assumptions of the conditional expectation i e fully parametric functional specifications are frequently imposed for this purpose without invoking such restrictions or when using appropriate non parametric econometric approaches e g the kriström 23 fully non parametric estimator identification of the marginal effects of changes in management relevant explanatory variables will not usually be possible thus most cv studies found in the water resource valuation literature rely on fully parametric discrete choice models e g binary response models brms these brms allow managers to determine how the value of a water based recreation area varies with possible changes in water management e g flow regime reservoir levels the large majority of empirical analysts who have utilized discrete choice models have chosen parametric statistical procedures on the basis of precedent and readily available software these methods require a full parametric functional specification of the relationship between regressors and the response variable and more importantly a full specification of a parametric distribution of the disturbances e g the probit normal or logit cumulative distribution functions cdfs although some distributional assumptions can be benign especially if the parameterization is flexible enough to describe behavior adequately mcfadden 33 mcfadden and train 34 the implementation of an incorrect parametric functional form can lead to spurious statistical inferences due to biased and inconsistent estimates moreover underlying economic theory provides little guidance for using these functional specifications so there is insufficient information regarding the appropriate distribution to adopt in practice mittelhammer et al 37 crooker and herriges 9 thus any parametric functional specification for either the stochastic error or the utility differences used in these methods is in general uncertain and questionable creel and loomis 8 this study applies a new brm to dichotomous cv data which is semi parametric by nature and unlike many non parametric approaches provides both density structure and flexibility allowing identification of marginal effects of changes in the explanatory variables on willingness to pay wtp its density structure is supported by a large and varied new family of cdfs which has the flexibility to fit a very wide variety of distributional shapes to the choices made by survey respondents it also nests the behavior of some prominent binary response estimators e g the logit model and can approximate a vast array of left and right skewed probability density functions pdfs due to its highly flexible class of density shapes mittelhammer and judge 38 this new estimator known as the maximum likelihood minimum power divergence ml mpd binary response estimator avoids using a priori model specification information about the functional form of the conditional expectation of the response variable this feature of the ml mpd estimator reduces the potential for model specification errors that arise when relying on tenuous parametric distributional assumptions underlying binary responses moreover the ml mpd maintains the full set of familiar ml sampling properties consistency asymptotic normality and asymptotic efficiency and unlike most non parametric methods does not employ the usual kernel density estimation methodology with the attendant required implementation choices relating to bandwidth kernel functions and other tuning parameter issues that is the ml mpd estimator is free of user specified tuning parameters and substantially avoids specification problems 1 1 while we note there are important advantages of the ml mpd as compared to fully non parametric approaches a reviewer pointed out that it would be a useful extension of this study to include the implementation of a non parametric version of the model we estimated since the fully parametric logit model is the most commonly employed method to estimate wtp using a dichotomous choice cv question we leave an empirical comparison of the ml mpd to fully non parametric methods to future research notwithstanding mcmillen and redfearn 35 note that in practice non parametric estimates have been shown to be insensitive to the choice of the kernel function and the bandwidth in non parametric models can be estimated via cross validation it has not been shown that insensitivity to the kernel choice is always the case regardless of the data generating processes underlying the data moreover the introduction of estimating the bandwidth parameter is not without cost as it introduces additional noise variation into the estimated model finally since the kernel acts as a weighting function in averaging data one would expect that applying notably different weights in a data neighborhood could result in differing estimates depending upon the distribution of the data in the neighborhood the ml mpd estimator begins in a non parametric information theoretic context regarding model specification then semi parametric orthogonality relationships in the form of empirical sample moments are introduced that within the non parametric information theoretic framework ultimately lead to a new parametric family of probability distributions cdfs for brms see judge and mittelhammer 21 ch 9 as well as a conditional expectation function for brms and estimators for the unknowns in the model thus the ml mpd approach combines attractive features of parametric semi parametric and non parametric estimation methodologies several distribution free estimators for estimating brms have already been proposed in the literature to overcome model misspecification issues e g manski 30 turnbull 44 cosslett 7 kriström 23 horowitz 16 matzkin 32 klein and spady 22 li 27 chen and randall 4 creel and loomis 8 araña and león 1 huang et al 17 however the majority of these estimators have not found widespread application in the empirical discrete choice literature for a number of reasons that may include 1 users lack of understanding regarding the estimation and inference properties of the approaches in empirical applications 2 difficulties in providing economic interpretations of the results of the analysis 3 nonidentification of model parameters e g kriström 23 and the klein and spady 22 estimator 2 2 despite the infrequency of empirical applications the ks estimator is considered in the econometrics literature to be one of the statistically best semi parametric estimators in the sense that its asymptotic covariance matrix achieves the semi parametric efficiency bound for the single index brm ks and marginal effects and 4 ambiguity and or uncertainty regarding the appropriate choices for tuning parameters and other estimator implementation computational issues creel and loomis 8 underscore that the required scale and local normalizations for the identification of ks parameter estimates are questionable because they go beyond restrictions implied by demand theory moreover it has been found that other suggested semi parametric methods do not achieve root n consistency e g the manski 30 and horowitz 16 estimators and their finite sample behavior is in question e g the cosslett 7 ks and ichimura 18 estimators 3 3 see chen and khan 5 for more details while fully non parametric estimation techniques tend to be more robust to incorrect functional specifications of conditional expectation functions as well as probability distributions most of them involve various choices of tuning parameters kernels and other implementation choices crooker and herriges 9 state that the gains and losses from using non parametric and semi parametric estimators to recover wtp measures relative to the standard parametric approaches are still unknown there remains a continuing need to seek robust and efficient methods for analyzing binary decision making behavior this empirical application of the new ml mpd estimator relates to a stated preference cv on site dataset collected along two rivers at the caribbean national forest cnf in puerto rico the ml mpd estimator is used to analyze the underlying behavioral economic decision process leading to a person s wtp for river recreation site attributes in order to compare the new ml mpd approach to a leading empirical method for analyzing brms we also implement the commonly used fully parametric logit estimator 4 4 probit ml results are available from the senior author upon request as well as the data employed in this paper in the next section we discuss the ml mpd estimator for the brm and its implementation section 3 describes the dataset utilized in this study and the nature of the decision making context in section 4 we present the results from our analyses we conclude in section 5 with a summary of our findings and its corresponding implications 2 the ml mpd estimator for the brm and estimation framework we present an overview of the ml mpd estimator for the brm in this section the logit model is well documented in the literature and is not reviewed here the statistical approaches used in this study allow one to model the underlying consumers binary choices as the outcomes of a latent utility maximizing process where respondents are assumed to choose the alternative that result in the greatest indirect utility 2 1 the ml mpd estimator for the brm to motivate the ml mpd estimator note that the n dimensional vector of unknown bernoulli probabilities corresponding to a brm 1 p y i 1 x i p i 1 f x i β f x i β i 1 n is associated with an unknown link or transformation function f of factors affecting the decision environment and that in practice is expressed in terms of an index function assumed to be linear 5 5 this index is usually a function of the covariates x and a vector of β unknown parameters which is estimated along with the link function although non linear specifications and the linear box cox utility function are also possible the commonly used linear index representation x i β with β being a vector of parameters is considered in this study the ml mpd approach can be generalized to utilize nonlinear index representations more generally one can always characterize the bernoulli random variables y 1 y 2 y n r n as being defined by y i p i ε i i with zero mean error e ε i 0 i without knowledge of the particular parametric distributional specification of the link function the traditional ml estimation approach is not available one might then consider a quasi ml estimator but this econometric estimator does not assure the full set of attractive ml sampling properties mittelhammer et al 37 and moreover it can be challenging to characterize its sampling properties in any given application alternatively one might consider the two stage generalized method of moment estimator however the approach is not appealing for the current application due to the ill posed underdetermined nature of the estimating equations see equation 2 ahead in this study we adopt an information theoretic estimator for β unlike classical estimation procedures information theoretic estimators rely on kullback s 24 information theoretic minimum discrimination information principle 6 6 an alternative to this principle is the maximum entropy principle also known as the shannon s 43 entropy measure or the generalized maximum entropy approach although there are some recent theoretical and empirical contributions in the econometric literature using the latter approach e g golan et al 10 crooker and herriges 9 marsh and mittelhammer 31 a user of the method is also confronted with a notable number of tuning parameter type of decisions to make for which the performance consequences are not well known currently and on data moment constraints sample moments as defined in mittelhammer and judge 38 and judge and mittelhammer 21 the information theoretic estimation principle allows joint estimation of the unknown parameters of the model along with the empirical sampling distributions that exhibit minimum discrepancy relative to a reference distribution the mpd approach is robust in terms of the uncountably infinite number of highly varied candidate distributions that are members of the distribution class and it maintains the full set of usual ml estimation and inference sampling behavior properties under familiar regularity conditions as noted by judge and mittelhammer 21 the mpd has been shown through monte carlo simulations to exhibit mean square error mse superiority relative to probit and logit estimators moreover the ml mpd estimator has been shown to be mse superior to the best semi parametric estimator i e the ks estimator under certain sampling conditions and has the flexibility to fit a wide variety of distributional shapes to the latent variables underlying the bernoulli process the application of the ml mpd can be conceptualized in two stages although implementation of the estimation methodology can actually be performed in one computational step one begins with an ill posed inverse problem 7 7 by inverse problem we mean the problem of recovering information about unknown and uncontrolled unobservable components of an econometric model from indirect noisy observations based on observable data consisting of the non parametric linear model y i p i ε i i noted above along with generally applicable semi parametric orthogonality conditions between explanatory variables and model noise of the general form e g x y p 0 then an mpd solution for the probabilities is found that identifies a complete set of new parametric probability distributions for the brm see 4 in a second stage based on the mpd solution of probability distributions ml estimation is used to estimate the unknowns that occur in the class of probability distributions the results produce estimates of the effects of explanatory variables on the conditional bernoulli probabilities and also concurrently identify a link function for those probabilities in effect the method estimates the functional form of the probability model along with estimates of the unknown probabilities in the model regarding the first stage of the method an estimation objective function is represented in terms of the information theoretic cressie read cr 8 8 this goodness of fit measure encompasses the empirical likelihood objective as a special case when γ 1 and the maximum entropy or kullback leibler objective when γ 0 among others as γ ranges from to the cr divergence measure leads to different information theoretic estimators see mittelhammer et al 37 chapter 13 4 lee et al 26 and judge and mittelhammer 21 power divergence criterion which measures the discrepancy between the probabilities to be estimated and a reference distribution for those probabilities then including sample moment constraints based on zero mean population conditions the mpd extremum problem is specified as 2 min p c r p q γ s t n 1 g x y p 0 and 0 p i 1 i where c r p q γ is a member of the cr family of statistics 9 9 for more details about the flexible cr power divergence family of statistics see read and cressie 42 and imbens et al 19 q q 1 q 2 q n i 1 n 0 1 is an n dimensional vector of reference bernoulli probabilities and γ is the scalar power parameter of the divergence measure the sample moment constraint vector equation n 1 g x y p 0 is of dimension m 1 where g r k r m is a real valued measurable function the inequality non negativity and upper bound constraints on the solved probability values p p 1 p 2 p n i 1 n 0 1 are logically necessary for p to represent an n dimensional vector of conditional on x bernoulli probabilities underlying the binary decisions in the current empirical application the specification g x x is utilized where x is a vector of explanatory variables affecting the binary decision outcome the cr power divergence criterion in this binary application takes the following form mittelhammer and judge 38 3 cr p q γ i 1 n p i p i q i γ 1 1 p i 1 p i 1 q i γ 1 γ γ 1 this discrepancy measure is always positive valued unless p i q i no matter the choice of γ the value of the discrepancy measure becomes larger the more divergent p i and q i are and the measure is convex in the p i s and second order continuously differentiable the mpd family of cdfs i e a minimum power divergence solution for the probabilities that solve the extremum problem represented in equation 2 using equation 3 for the cr power divergence criterion is given by 4 p w i q i γ arg p i p i q i γ 1 p i 1 q i γ w i γ 0 when γ 0 arg p i l n p i q i l n 1 p i 1 q i w i 0 when γ 0 arg p i 1 p i q i γ 1 p i 1 q i γ w i γ 0 0 when γ 0 and w i γ 1 q i γ γ 1 1 q i γ γ 1 q i γ γ 1 1 q i γ where w i x i β β represents the m 1 vector of lagrange multipliers of the moment constraints when 2 is expressed in lagrange form and x i denotes the ith 1 k row vector contained within the n k matrix of covariates x a complete analytic derivation of the mpd family of cdfs solution is provided in appendix a the definition in 4 characterizes an uncountably infinite number of cdfs with argument w i indexed by the values of γ and q i for example when γ 0 and q i 0 5 the standard logit model is subsumed by the family of distributions it is clear that the inverse cdf of the mpd family always exists in closed form but except for a measure zero set of possibilities for γ and q i the probabilities themselves must be solved for numerically fortunately strict monotonicity properties of the terms involving the p i s in 4 make for a relatively straightforward and efficient numerical solution procedure that is guaranteed to provide an appropriate solution for p i for any admissible argument w i of the cdf in the application ahead the empirical probabilities were solved for numerically using the interval bisection method root finding algorithm additional detail on both computational methodology and characteristics of the mpd family of distributions including their myriad different shapes and properties can be found in mittelhammer and judge 38 and judge and mittelhammer 21 the mpd family of parametric probability distributions in 4 is used as a basis for specifying the likelihood function associated with the data outcomes leading to a log likelihood function of the general form l β q γ i 1 n y i ln p x i β q i γ 1 y i ln 1 p x i β q i γ where we henceforth define β λ 10 10 a formal argument rationalizing the equating of the lagrange multiplier vector λ and the unknown parameter vector β is given in judge and mittelhammer 21 chapter 10 2 2 estimation framework in the implementation of the ml mpd estimator we specify q i q i which is tantamount to assuming that the same basic functional form for the probability distribution p x i β q γ is used across the observations for representing the conditional bernoulli probabilities in this context it is the x i s and thus the arguments of the distributions that cause the probabilities to vary across survey respondents the negative of the log likelihood function is maximized using the non gradient based nelder mead simplex minimization algorithm proposed by nelder and mead 39 11 11 a detailed explanation of this algorithm and its implementation can be found in nelder and mead 39 and jacoby et al 20 this optimization method belongs to the general class of direct search methods and has become one of the most widely used techniques for non linear unconstrained optimization the nelder mead algorithm does not rely on gradients or hessians so that it typically generates iterations more quickly than search methods that depend on derivatives of the objective function e g newton raphson the nelder mead approach also mitigates numerical problems caused by highly nonlinear problems extreme flatness of log likelihood functions and associated unstable gradient and or hessian calculations from iteration to iteration preliminary graphical investigations with our data regarding the behavior of the log likelihood function suggested that the log likelihood was notably flat in the γ direction over a range of values in which the maximum of the likelihood function was likely to reside in order to facilitate stability and accuracy in the search for the ml optimum over a concave but relatively flat likelihood function while mitigating the possibility of convergence to local optima we implement a grid search in the γ direction specifically we begin the search using the standard logistic distribution γ 0 q 0 5 as the starting probability distribution and solve 2 for q β given γ 0 then a grid above and below γ 0 in 0 2 increments is implemented using a recursively updated set of starting values based on immediately preceding solutions identifying a γ grid indexed series of solutions for 2 that bracketed the optimum within an interval of length 0 2 a second grid search based on 0 01 increments between the bracket values is then utilized to determine the optimum with a 0 01 tolerance level while this grid search method with recursively updated starting values does not guarantee a global optimum it reduces the possibility of not searching in the neighborhood of the global optimum the estimated covariance matrix of the ml mpd estimator is based on the optimized log likelihood function and the standard outer product of gradients opg approach for defining the asymptotic covariance matrix of the mle in particular by letting θ β q γ the covariance matrix was estimated via l θ θ l θ θ 1 θ ˆ where θ ˆ is the ml mpd estimate of the parameters and l θ θ is the n k 2 matrix of derivatives of the log of the likelihood function contributions l i θ i 1 n with respect to θ 12 12 an alternative approach could follow the result of patefield 40 based on the profile likelihood function concentrated on only the β parameter if one were not interested in inferences concerning the mpd distribution parameters because there is generally no closed form solution for the probabilities in 4 one needs to apply implicit differentiation in order to define the derivatives of the log likelihood with respect to β q and γ expressions for the derivatives are somewhat involved but are straightforward to compute using generalized hadamard multiplication and division operators see appendix b for comparison purposes we also calculate and report the conditional on q ˆ γ ˆ covariance matrix of β ˆ based on the opg method note that this comparison is informative in the sense that conditioning on a particular q and γ e g standard symmetric logistic distribution if γ 0 and q 0 5 is analogous to the common empirical practice of choosing a specific functional form for the distribution underlying binary responses like specifying the probit or logit model in the parametric ml estimation method since the covariance matrix is generally understated when conditioning on unknown parameters that were estimated the empirical comparison of the ml mpd and the logit model suggests the potential for overstating the precision of estimates and associated inferences when lack of information regarding the appropriate functional form of the probability distribution is not explicitly accounted for in the model computational implementation of all of the preceding procedures relating to the ml mpd estimator and logit mle is based on aptech systems gauss 3 data and problem setting the dataset contains information on 718 in person interviews with visitors at ten recreation sites along the mameyes and espiritu santo rivers in puerto rico during the summers of 2004 and 2005 both rivers are located in northeastern puerto rico are only about 2 miles apart originate in the caribbean national forest cnf drain the cnf on and off forest and extend toward the atlantic ocean the ten river recreation sites are with the exception of the variables we control for in this study very similar since the sites are just upstream or downstream from one another and several of them are accessed by a paved road therefore we do not attempt to control for any spatial heterogeneity across the ten recreation sites on the two rivers other than the site specific variables such as flows or volume of the natural water pools table 1 provides a list of site attributes considered in this study the river recreation sites under study are available to visitors for swimming wading and soaking and some of them have the attraction of providing a hydromassage experience similar to that of a jacuzzi the data was collected through dichotomous response cv surveys administered on site by in person interviews at the recreation pool sites employing the single bounded 13 13 this approach has the potential to be less efficient than the double bounded protocol however mcfadden 33 and cooper et al 6 have documented that the single bounded cv question eliminates the response inconsistency and its associated bias dichotomous choice approach as the elicitation protocol which is also referred to in the literature as the closed ended cv approach or the take it or leave it approach the survey asked each randomly sampled recreation user the following cv question as you know the price of gasoline often goes up taking into consideration that there are other rivers as well as beaches nearby where you could go visit if the cost of this visit to this river was more than what you have already spent would you still have come today yes or no the hypothetical additional cost of the visit was randomly drawn from a set of 18 bid thresholds 14 14 the chosen bid vector of 18 prices was 1 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 120 130 140 150 160 180 200 for each respondent and ranged from 1 to 200 the payment vehicle was added travel cost this has been used in past cv surveys reviewed by gonzalez sepulveda 11 in part because it is a neutral payment vehicle loomis and walsh 29 and is less likely to result in protest responses compared to entrance fees therefore no check for protest responses was made the respondents were reminded of the availability of substitute rivers and beaches in the area however they were not reminded to consider their budget constraints further the potential of yea saying 15 15 yea saying is the tendency of the respondent to want to agree with the dollar amount suggested by the reviewer mitchell and carson 36 that can lead to hypothetical bias in cv has not been addressed however for the purposes of comparing mean wtp derived from the logit estimator and the ml mpd estimator the influence of omission of budget constraints and detection for and adjustment to yea saying will not affect our comparison of wtp between these two estimators although it may affect the absolute magnitude of the wtp amounts with both of these methods additional details of the survey and its design are given in gonzalez sepulveda 11 additional information used in the models include on site attributes road quality volume and speed of water in the pools and size of rocks or sand surrounding the pools a threshold indicator of the level of a recreation user s income and travel time information as cameron and james 3 propose 16 16 the binary specification for travel time and its cut off was meant to differentiate local visitors from the nearby towns from more distant visitors from the major city of san juan tables 1 and 2 summarize the variables included in the estimated models along with descriptive statistics 4 results results presented in this section are based on the variables defined in table 1 the wtp measures are interpreted on an aggregate per group basis 17 17 the average group in the ten different river recreation sites under study at the cnf consisted of 3 5 visitors and are calculated for the logit and ml mpd models using hanemann s 14 15 approach following hanemann the difference in utilities of visitors from accepting or rejecting the hypothetical additional cost i e the bid a of the visit to the river recreation sites at the cnf is denoted by 5 δ u a i z u 1 i a i z u 0 i z where u is the utility function i denotes annual income z is a vector of visitor and recreational site characteristics and a i is the offered bid to visitor i the bid value that makes the visitor indifferent between acceptance rejection defines the wtp and the calculation of its mean is obtained by dividing the negative grand constant term by the absolute value of the estimated coefficient associated with a the grand constant term is calculated as a linear combination of the means of the explanatory variables times their associated coefficients with the effect of a suppressed 4 1 logit model results to solve for the mle of the logit model see table 3 we utilized the berndt hall hall hausman optimization approach berndt et al 2 the logit model results indicate that the bid variable is highly significant and its sign is consistent with economic theory indicating that the higher the price of a visit to the river recreation site the less willing users are to visit that site a continuous measure of the dollar amount of respondent s income has often been dropped in dichotomous choice cv studies sometimes it is dropped based on theoretical grounds in the linear in bid binary logit model see e g hanemann 14 haab and mcconnell 13 but it can also be dropped due mainly to lack of statistical significance gonzalez et al 12 however when expressed as a dichotomous income threshold indicator its coefficient in this application was found to be significantly different from zero and positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount the variables bid size size of the rocks or sand surrounding the water pools and road non paved roads contribute to the explanation of the dependent variable at the 0 01 level of type i error volume of water in the pools of the two rivers is also positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount whereas the variables bid discharge non paved dirt road size and travel time are negatively associated with the probability of paying the bid amount it is worth noting that discharge could be positive or negative the available literature indicates that recreation benefits increase with river flow up to a point so a negative coefficient is unusual in this case however in this application the river is used by families with small children so the parents would not want high flows as it endangers their children hence discharge is treated as two tailed travel time is often negative in recreation demand analyses since travel time reflects the higher opportunity cost of time to visit more distant recreation destinations wilman 45 larson and lew 25 table 3 also reports the estimated mean wtp from the logit model as well as confidence intervals cis for the compensated wtp measure employing hanneman s approach for estimating the mean wtp as described above and the delta method to derive the asymptotic standard errors the mean logit wtp measure is 114 74 and the 95 ci based on z scores ranges from 101 28 to 128 19 we note that the estimated mean wtp obtained from the fully parametric logit model appears to be relatively high given the typical levels of income of visitors surveyed at the cnf 45 of visitors annual income is less than 15 000 and the values in the literature for swimming and other non boating non fishing water based recreation loomis 28 as well as the type of recreation experience obtained by visiting the river recreation sites 4 2 ml mpd model results parameter estimates β ˆ m l m p d of the β vector corresponding to γ ˆ 4 23 and q ˆ 0 8853 are presented in table 3 along with associated asymptotic standard errors derived from the conditional and unconditional variance covariance matrices for β ˆ m l m p d goodness of fit measures mcfadden r2 aic and bic and the mean ml mpd wtp estimate and its corresponding cis are also reported in this table based on the goodness of fit measures the ml mpd model performs better than the logit model from table 3 we see that r squared from the ml mpd model is about 22 higher than the r squared for the logit model also the akaike information criterion and the bayesian information criterion both improve under the ml mpd which provides additional evidence that the ml mpd fits better than the logit model regarding parameter estimates the coefficients for the ml mpd and logit models have identical signs except for the income variable as mentioned previously the dichotomous income indicator is positively related to the probability of paying the bid amount in the logit model but when using the ml mpd approach a negative effect of income arises suggesting that a visit to the river recreation sites is an inferior good although the income effect is not statistically significant at any conventional level as in other studies of this type the ml mpd approach does not result in uniformly smaller estimated standard errors relative to logit especially in reference to the standard errors derived from the full unconditional covariance matrix see table 3 as indicated in section 4 1 the variables that are statistically significant at the 0 01 level of type i error using the logit model are bid size and road the ml mpd results based on the conditional covariance matrix for the bid and size regressors are also significant at the 0 01 level with the road regressor being significant at the 0 05 level however these same three variables achieve significance at only the 0 10 level when the unconditional covariance matrix for the ml mpd is used this result recognizes the uncertainty involved in choosing the appropriate functional form of the probability distribution underlying binary responses the discharge variable is significant at the 0 05 level for the logit model and statistically insignificant at conventional levels in the ml mpd case however its probability value of 0 12 suggests that its effect should not necessarily be ignored the travel time indicator variable is significant at the 0 05 level under the logit estimator but insignificant under the ml mpd estimator regardless of whether conditional or unconditional covariance matrices are utilized regarding the ml mpd results for q and γ we conducted a wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution hypothesis h o q 0 5 and γ 0 and the null hypothesis is rejected at the 0 01 level this suggests that a logistic approach is inappropriate for this application we also tested separately the individual hypotheses of symmetric distributions h o q 0 5 and a general i e possibly skewed logistic distribution h o γ 0 both hypotheses are also rejected at the 0 01 level table 3 also shows that the ml mpd mean wtp estimate of 27 46 for a visit to the river recreation sites is substantially lower in value than the result estimated with the logit 114 74 approach moreover it is apparent from the fact that the 95 ci for the ml mpd approach 13 01 41 91 does not overlap the ci of the logit estimate that the mean wtp estimated via ml mpd is statistically significantly smaller than the logit estimate at any conventional level of confidence lastly we tested whether there is a difference in wtp distributions based on the logit and ml mpd approaches i e ho wtplogit wtpml mpd using the nonparametric complete combinatorial convolution approach of poe et al 41 the resulting two tailed p value of zero to five decimal places rejected the null hypothesis very convincingly indicating that the two empirical wtp distributions are statistically significantly different turning to the reasonableness of the binary logit and the ml mpd mean wtp estimates we believe that given low incomes of the visitors to these two rivers and the wtp values in the literature for similar recreation experiences the estimated mean wtp derived from the ml mpd approach appears to be considerably more plausible corroborating this conclusion is the fact that the wtp from this same data but estimated using the revealed preference travel cost method gonzalez sepulveda 11 yields an estimate of wtp of 21 63 to 33 29 this result provides further support for the ml mpd over the logit estimate lastly in order to provide additional perspective regarding the mean wtp results for the ml mpd and logit estimates fig 1 plots the logistic distribution underlying the logit model as well as the mpd distribution resulting from ml mpd estimation of the brm the non symmetric nature of the optimal distribution relative to the a priori symmetric logit distribution is quite apparent in fig 1 the mpd distribution is substantially left skewed the right most and left most vertical lines in the figure correspond to the estimated values of the probability distribution indices i e x β for the logit and ml mpd estimates evaluated at the sample mean values of the explanatory variables respectively it is evident from this figure that the probability of accepting the mean bid when evaluating other characteristics also at their mean values is substantially lower for the mpd estimated model than for the logit model also examining the probability of bid acceptance when evaluating the bids at the estimated mean wtps generated by the two estimators again for mean values of the other explanatory variables which occurs at an index value of 0 on the horizontal axis for both approaches results in a substantially higher probability of acceptance for the mpd approach in the lower trail range of the range of bids offered to the visitors than for the logit approach essentially the flexibility obtained from simultaneously estimating the skew spread and index of the link function representing bernoulli probabilities allowed the ml mpd estimates to accommodate higher acceptance probabilities in a small lower tail range of the bids offered to visitors thus leading to the lower mean wtp 4 3 comparisons of marginal values of river recreation site attributes based on the fact that the logit model is rejected marginal effects of changes in the explanatory variables on wtp are calculated here for the ml mpd model only in pursuit of this task marginal values of changes in river recreation site attributes are computed by forming the ratio of the value of the coefficient of the explanatory variable associated with the site attribute and the absolute value of the coefficient of the bid variable using the ml mpd approach the marginal values of changes in river recreation site attributes indicate that visitors would be willing to pay 33 70 for reducing high instream flows lower discharge for the reasons discussed previously and 39 90 to have paved roads to the river recreation site the change in wtp relating to decreasing the size of rocks or sand around the water pools is 2 10 whereas the marginal effect associated with the increased volume of water in the pools is 0 26 per cubic foot of water 5 conclusions and implications in this paper we present an information theoretic econometric approach to empirically analyzing the willingness to pay for river recreation site attributes using a new ml mpd binary response estimator for dichotomous cv data in contrast to many alternative estimators the ml mpd estimator mitigates the need for subjective choices of distributional functional form and tuning parameters the ml mpd has the flexibility to fit a wide range of varied distributional shapes to conform to the choice process observed while utilizing only very general non parametric moment assumptions relating to the data moreover the ml mpd method allows for statistical testing of the symmetry of distribution assumption q 0 5 as well as a test of the validity of the logistic family of distributions γ 0 either symmetric with q 0 5 or non symmetric for general q as such and based on our results the ml mpd approach to estimation appears to represent a useful innovative estimation framework for providing general and testable representations of data generating processes underlying economic decision making behavior in binary choice situations in our case study of river recreation the ml mpd model rejects the special case of a logit model restriction at the 0 01 level of significance in addition another empirical finding of this study is that the ml mpd approach yields a substantially lower estimate of the mean wtp 27 46 for a visit to the river recreation sites at the caribbean national forest compared to the mean wtp obtained from the fully parametric logit 114 74 approach based on the nature of the recreational experience the very low income of typical visitors to the rivers and the comparison to a prior travel cost method recreation demand benefit estimate the lower ml mpd mean wtp value appears to be a more reasonable and defensible estimate of the mean wtp for visiting these river recreation sites if policymakers were to contemplate entry fees to these recreation sites in the caribbean national forest the lower mean wtp estimate of the ml mpd approach would also suggest a substantially lower range of fees than those implied by the logit model except for income the effects of all other visitor characteristics or site attributes on wtp were the same in sign using either the logit or ml mpd approach while the two methods were in agreement that the size of the bid size of rocks or sand and road quality all significantly impacted the acceptance of the bid they differed in the magnitude of the impacts moreover the methods differed on the statistical significance of other attributes the results beg the question of whether the parametric logit approach is understating uncertainty about model components and overstating significance of estimation results by assuming that the functional form of the probability distribution underlying decision outcomes is fully known and certain the ml mpd method has an inherent feature of mitigating unwarranted indications of over precision by explicitly introducing uncertainty with respect to the functional form of the distribution underlying the
