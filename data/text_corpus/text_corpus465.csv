2325,soil moisture is a key component of global hydrological cycles and is closely linked to climate and vegetation however exactly how vegetation affects the response of soil moisture to climate remains unclear in this study soil moisture sensitivity was investigated as an indicator of soil moisture response to climate change including temperature and precipitation twenty years of data from the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model meteorological station and remote sensing of the loess plateau of china were used to estimate the impact of the vegetation regulatory action on soil moisture sensitivity the results show that soil moisture sensitivity to both temperature and precipitation exhibits distinct spatiotemporal patterns with increasing enhanced vegetation index evi soil moisture sensitivity to temperature decreased at first and increased subsequently while that to precipitation decreased continuously reaching a stable value the overall level of soil moisture sensitivity to both temperature and precipitation in the loess plateau was declining specifically vegetation variation contributed 23 78 and 78 57 of the soil moisture sensitivity to precipitation in the surface and root zone respectively which is higher than it contributed to the soil moisture sensitivity to temperature 11 4 and 17 23 the results of this study provide a scientific basis for the effective implementation of the grain for green program and the sustainable management of water resources on the loess plateau keywords soil moisture sensitivity climate change vegetation variation temperature precipitation the grain for green program data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to control soil erosion and ecosystem degradation the loess plateau lp has undergone the grain for green program ggp a large scale conversion of agricultural land over recent decades zhang and shangguan 2018 a large amount of farmlands have been transformed into natural vegetation i e grasslands shrubs and forests zhang and shangguan 2018 the extensive implementation of the ggp has improved the ecosystem of the lp in terms of climate change regulation carbon sink enhancement and soil water holding capacity ye et al 2019 the ggp and related measures have exerted a considerable impact on the temporal and spatial patterns quality and quantity of soil moisture sm the ggp implementation in 1999 effectively controlled soil erosion yuan et al 2016 however afforestation has increased the scarcity of water resources and caused soil dryness wang et al 2009 ye et al 2019 sm is an important factor in hydrological processes and water resource management especially in arid and semi arid areas such as the lp where groundwater is buried under thick unsaturated loess soil zhang and shangguan 2018 in semi arid areas with thick loess soil rainfall is the only supply of sm as well as the main source of water for vegetation growth owing to strong evaporation and a lack of rainfall water is the key constraint for ecological recovery and vegetation reconstruction in this region thus the effects of climate change and vegetation variation on sm dynamics are significant and thus must be accounted for when formulating engineering measures for vegetation reconstruction fu et al 2011 2017 sm is a key variable that governs the exchange of material and transformation of energy in ecohydrological processes and is closely related to the evolution of macro climate conditions and micro vegetation feedback rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 berry et al 2006 troch et al 2013 multiple factors i e vegetation climate and human activities contribute to the spatio temporal heterogeneity of sm which in return impacts processes related to soil water balance nutrient cycling and crop production teuling and troch 2005 dari et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 the study of sm focuses on three scales with different environmental factors large scale climate change meso scale land use change human activity small scale bio physical mechanisms between vegetation and soil dekker et al 2007 janssen et al 2008 liu and shao 2015 a fully coupled climate vegetation model demonstrated that vegetation disturbance would lead to direct positive feedback of vegetation on climate and indirect negative feedback of vegetation on sm liu et al 2010 such direct and indirect feedback of vegetation is closely related to the vegetation species jian et al 2015 trees are prone to direct positive feedback because of their strong plant transpiration and low albedo in contrast grasses are more effective in producing indirect feedback because of their limited evapotranspiration and shallow roots which can alter surface sm and evaporation liu et al 2010 studies suggest that trees affect the formation of edaphic heterogeneity which does not contribute to the distribution of woody vegetation d odorico et al 2007 özkan and gökbulak 2017 plant water uptake typically dominates soil evaporation in the case of complete vegetation cover approximately 64 of precipitation exits the ecosystem via evapotranspiration whereas in bare soil only approximately 36 of precipitation is evaporated ivanov et al 2010 revegetation is predicted to impact both the water content and soil properties vegetation roots alter the structural characteristics of the surrounding soil the enhancement of porosity near the root promotes stemflow to greater depths and beyond the rooting zone metzger et al 2017 sm depletion is related to the root depth distribution singh et al 1998 the depth and density of the root distribution vary depending on species and age which affect the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration accounting for 21 to 26 of the spatial heterogeneity of sm on a regional scale respectively wang et al 2012 in addition vegetation appears to exert a relatively homogenizing effect on sm over the long term reducing the possibility of topographic redistribution of sm ivanov et al 2010 under certain precipitation conditions plant population density restricts the normal growth of forests by affecting sm content li and duan 2012 excessive afforestation intensifies the scarcity of sm and restricts the ecological and economic benefits of vegetation li and duan 2012 the heterogeneity of sm also depends on canopy interception and redistribution meteorological and climate forcing and so on famiglietti et al 2008 the complexity of the soil vegetation climate feedback mechanism poses a challenge to the understanding of the terrestrial water cycle geris et al 2017 continuous afforestation on the lp has increased the vegetation coverage in the northwest at a slow growth rate and in the southeast at a rapid growth rate however sm in this region has shown wet to dry and dry to wet patterns over the past 30 years li et al 2021 understanding this special phenomenon requires further exploration of the relationship between sm dynamics and vegetation change studies have shown that long term vegetation restoration could substantially impact the soil water storage of grasslands and forests zhang et al 2016 zhang and shangguan 2018 the increase in vegetation promotes sm loss through absorption and transpiration while reducing the evaporation of bare land liu et al 2010 vegetation variation considerably influences sm by transpiration and evaporation which are closely related to climate forcing thus there is a feedback relationship not only among these three elements but also among the elements and processes despite numerous studies addressing the sm response to climate change it remains unclear whether the state of vegetation will aggravate or alleviate the response process to clarify how vegetation regulates intensifies or mitigates the sm responses to climate change statistical analysis was performed on a pixel scale on sm of the surface layer and root layer vegetation and climate forcing data sm sensitivity δsm the degree of response of sm to climatic forcing was employed to analyse the indirect effects previous study has calculated the temporal and spatial distribution of the sensitivity of terrestrial water storage tws but the results lack data on the sensitivity of sm which is a component of the terrestrial water cycle and is severely affected by climate change scheffer et al 2005 tao et al 2020 the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to illustrate the spatiotemporal distribution of δsm on the lp 2 to clarify the relationship between vegetation and δsm to precipitation and temperature and 3 to quantify the contribution of vegetation to δsm on the lp the findings are representative of the dynamic response of the water resource reserves of the lp to the ggp over the past 20 years offering guidance for the practical strategies of vegetation reconstruction and the scientific management of water resources in arid and semi arid regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study regions the lp 33 69 n 41 28 n 100 87 e 114 52 e is located along the middle reach of the yellow river in northern china with an area of approximately 6 4 105 km2 li et al 2021 fig 1 the lp is the largest and deepest loess deposit globally and has long been one of the most severely eroded areas on earth fu et al 2017 the main soil types are loose yellow soil brown soil and black soil the region is characterized by an arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 100 800 mm with approximately 55 78 occurring during the wet season xin et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 li et al 2021 the annual potential evaporation 800 1000 mm far exceeds precipitation which is relatively insufficient for supplying soil moisture and unevenly distributed qian 1991 soils of the lp have high water storage capacity owing to the thick loess material li and shao 2007 wang et al 2019 however the high soil porosity also promotes evaporation leading to poor water storage and deeply buried groundwater which in turn results in scarce soil water broken terrain and severe soil loss qian 1991 the fragile ecology of the lp is sensitive to climate change the ggp launched in 1999 has made the lp a focal point of water resources research the integrated impact of soil vegetation climate exacerbates the severity of the water shortage issue zeng et al 2005 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 datasets the dataset used in this study included data for sm precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and the enhanced vegetation index evi sm data were retrieved from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam database http gleam eu the gleam is a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation based on satellite observations miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 root zone soil moisture smroot and surface soil moisture smsurf are intermediate outputs of the model this study selected the relevant sm data released by gleam v3 5a from january 2000 to december 2020 including the sm m3 m 3 of the surface smsurf 0 10 cm and the root zone smroot 10 250 cm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 point scale sampling is challenging for the exploration of long term spatio temporal changes in sm on a large spatial scale whereas the gleam data is deemed representative of the spatial and temporal patterns of sm distribution for the entire lp ye et al 2019 statistical analysis at the pixel scale is conducive to obtaining information on regularity vegetation data involves the mod13c2 product of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https earthdata nasa gov which included monthly data of 0 05 0 05 resolution meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service platform https data cma cn including daily data from 154 stations on the lp owing to the large elevation variation across the lp the anusplin software was used to interpolate the meteorological elements with elevation as a covariate and then resampled to obtain monthly t and p data of 0 25 0 25 resolution liu et al 2008 based on this interpolated data the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated according to the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the reliability of gleam sm data has been validated by in situ sm measurements on the lp ye et al 2019 we also validated the gleam sm data with nasa global land data assimilation system gldas sm data gldas 2 1 provides a 0 25 x 0 25 grid sm data 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm with a monthly temporal resolution the pearson correlation coefficient r between the smsurf data of the gleam dataset and the sm0 10 data of the gldas dataset was shown in fig 2 and indicate that the two data products exhibit significant coherence in addition the δsm calculated using the gleam smsurf data and that using the gldas sm0 10 data also exhibit significant coherence fig 2 2 2 2 investigating sm in association with climate and vegetation to investigate the relationship between sm and climate and vegetation the partial correlations between sm and temperature precipitation and evi for each 0 25 grid from 2000 to 2020 was calculated in addition a non linear regression equation with sm as a dependent variable enhanced vegetation index precipitation and temperature as independent variables was developed by multivariable linear regression for each 0 25 grid cell with the monthly time series data from 2000 to 2020 as eq 1 1 s m p t e v i a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 a 3 t a 4 t 2 a 5 p t a 6 e v i ε where p is precipitation mm t is temperature c evi is the enhanced vegetation index and ε is the residual value the a 0 is the constant term and a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 and a 6 are the coefficients for each term respectively 2 2 3 estimating the sensitivity of sm to climate δsm soil moisture sensitivity a representative indicator reflecting the response of sm to climate change or stability of sm in the context of climate change was investigated the establishment and calculation of this indicator were performed using a previously described method tao et al 2020 according to the fitting coefficients and meteorological data values of each point and layer the sensitivity value of the soil was obtained at each point and layer of the climate using eqs 2 and 3 2 δ s m t 1 c s m p t 1 e v

sensitivity of sm to temperature δ s m p 1 m m is the amount of change in sm when the precipitation changes by 1 mm i e the sensitivity of sm to precipitation and the coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 are the same as those in eq 1 pixel unit statistical regression was performed to obtain the regression equation of δsm with respect to climate and vegetation and to determine the contribution of vegetation to the change in δsm in the context of climate change 3 results 3 1 correlations between sm and environmental elements overall the spatial distribution of the changing trends of environmental elements on the lp exhibited heterogeneity fig 3 the potential evapotranspiration pet showed a declining trend in the western and an increasing trend in the south temperature tem demonstrated an upward trend with sharp rises in some areas precipitation pre has increased almost throughout the lp but decreased in a small number of regions precipitation across the lp increased by 45 mm from 2000 to 2020 the evi increased but the increase in the northwest region was slower than that in the southeast region the sms of the surface layer smsurf and root layer smroot showed a consistent spatial distribution with most areas showing a downward trend and the southeastern corner decreasing more prominently overall the spatial heterogeneity of sm had no similarity to any individual climate factor implying that the sm patterns are dependent on multiple factors rather than a single factor factors pre tem and evi were defined as the three major climate forcing factors for determining sm in eq 1 to understand the individual influence of the three factors on sm partial correlations analysis and a t test were performed fig 4 the results show consistent effects of the three climate forcing factors on smsurf and smroot regardless of the spatial pattern correlation degree or positive negative correlation a significant negative correlation between tem and sm was detected for almost the entire region there was a positive correlation between pre and sm throughout the northwest and southeast regions of the lp a significant correlation between evi and sm was identified in most areas of the lp except for a small number of points in the south which showed a negative correlation the partial correlation of sm and tem passed a significance test for the entire lp indicating that it had a greater probability of correlation however from the correlation extent point of view sm and both pre and evi had strong correlations with most points exhibiting significant positive correlations in addition the spatial distributions of sm pre and sm evi had more significant spatial heterogeneity and were more similar to the spatial pattern of sm fig 4 the sm and pet had a weak correlation with most points exhibiting significant negative correlations p 0 05 in addition the resultant spatial patterns of the coefficient of determination r2 in eq 1 are presented in fig 5 almost all point passed the significance test p 0 05 3 2 soil moisture sensitivity response to changes in climate and evi the δsm of each point and year was calculated according to the fitting equation eq 1 the spatial distributions of δsm t trend and δsm p trend presented significant heterogeneity fig 6 for the trends in smsurf and smroot the spatial patterns were generally consistent however the region area with a downward trend for smsurf was large than that for smroot this may illustrate the proliferation and lag phenomena of the response the δsm usually starts from a local area gradually spreading outwards meanwhile the response of the surface layer appears earlier than that of the root layer therefore the similarity in spatial distribution may be delayed the δsm t exhibited a reducing trend in the central region of the lp a shape similar to and increasing trends in other regions similar to the spatial distribution of vegetation trends δsm p presented a distinct separation between the northwest and southeast with rapidly reducing and slowly decreasing or even increasing trends respectively to clarify the relationship between δsm and vegetation the vegetation and both δsm t and δsm p were fitted the δsm p and δsm t in association with vegetation present the forms of ln and secondary functions respectively fig 7 the correlation between vegetation and δsm calculated by gldas sm0 10 data is basically consistent with the results obtained by gleam smsurf data fig 8 in particular the r2 of the fitting function for δsm p was higher than that of δsm t the δsm p rate was high in the northwest and low in the southeast consistent with the results indicated by the ln curve the ln relationship of δsm p and evi showed that δsm p gradually reduced with increasing vegetation as the reduction rate gradually decreased δsm p eventually stabilized the relationship between δsm t and vegetation is similar to the secondary function meaning that with the increase in vegetation δsm t gradually decreased to a minimum and then increased thus there were two cases with a vegetation increase in the first case the vegetation index increased but did not meet the turning point of the trend transition leading to continuously reduced sensitivity this occurred in the north western region with a low rate of vegetation reconstruction in the second case as the vegetation index further increased the sensitivity presented an increasing trend this was observed in the southeast region with a high rate of vegetation reconstruction 3 3 quantitative contribution of vegetation variation and climate change to δsm the factors involved in this study have undergone significant changes over 20 years owing to the strong and rapid response of sm to climate change and the vigorous implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects on the lp using the pettitt test to assess each element we identified 2011 as the communal mutation year with significant changes fig 9 the overall level of precipitation on the lp was significantly elevated after 2011 fig 10 specifically the precipitation increased before 2011 and was basically stable after 2011 the temperature slowly declined and was almost stable before 2011 and rapidly increased after 2011 fig 10 the trend of potential evapotranspiration converted from a slow decline before 2011 to a significant rise after 2011 the increase in vegetation was rapid before 2011 but slowed after 2011 fig 10 the overall level of sm rapidly increased in 2011 and then gradually decreased fig 11 the sms of the root and surface layers were consistent across the lp both δsm p and δsm t presented a smooth rise before 2011 and a significant reduction after 2011 fig 11 overall sm on the lp showed a declining trend over the 20 year study period and the response of sm to climate change was weakened to calculate the contribution of vegetation variation to the δsm on the lp the equations of δsms eqs 4 11 were fitted separately for the two periods before 2011 and after 2011 using the data of δsm evi precipitation and temperature for each point and year the fitting of δsmsurf p was found to be the best r2 0 54 in the first stage and r2 0 53 in the second stage the fittings of δsms in the first stage were as follows 4 δ s m 1 surf t 4 8 10 6 p 1 4 10 4 t 9 8 10 4 e v i 5 1 10 2 e v i 2 1 89 10 3 r 2 0 29 5 δ s

r 2 0 42 where δ s m surf t and δ s m root t are the sm sensitivities to the temperatures of the surface and root layers respectively and δ s m surf p and δ s m root p are the sm sensitivities to precipitations of the surface and root layers respectively the 1 and 2 represent the first stage and second stages respectively the first and second phases of climate change are separated by the year 2011 the average of each factor within the two phases was used as the value of the first and second phases and the difference between the two periods was considered as the change amount on this basis eq 4 11 were used to estimate the contribution of vegetation variation and climate change to changes in δsm change in δsm only considering vegetation variation during the 20 years was calculated as follows 12 δ δ sm evi p t δ e v i δ s m 2 p t e v i δ e v i δ s m 1 p t e v i change in δsm considering both vegetation variation and climate change during the 20 years was calculated as follows 13 δ

δ sm evi p t δ e v i is the change in δsm induced only by vegetation variation δ δ s m δ p δ t δ e v i is the change in δsm induced by both vegetation and climate change r evi is the contribution value of vegetation variation to δsm and r climate is the contribution value of climate change to δsm for the entire lp over the 20 year study period the increase in vegetation had an intensifying effect on δsm t and δsmsurf p while vegetation played a weakening role on δsmroot p fig 12 the contributions of vegetation to δsmsurf t and δsmroot t were 11 44 and 17 23 respectively which were offset by the negative effects of climate change 88 56 and 82 77 resulting in overall negative effects on δsmsurf t and δsmroot t fig 12 in other words the response of sm to temperature change in lp was declining although vegetation improved δsm t the contributions of vegetation to the changes in δsmsurf p and δsmroot p were 23 78 and 78 57 respectively which were offset by the contribution of climate change 76 22 and 21 43 eventually exhibiting a negative effect on δsmsurf p and δsmroot p in other words the response of smsurf to precipitation change was intensified by vegetation while the response of smroot to precipitation change was weakened by vegetation the response of sm to precipitation change in lp was declining here we assume that the contribution of climate change is the residual of influence of vegetation however in reality vegetation and climate are definitely not two independent variables as such our conclusions are limited by the assumption that there is no mutual contribution between vegetation and climate 4 discussion 4 1 role of vegetation in sm sensitivity to precipitation and temperature the lp is facing water shortages and drying typically vegetation is considered an important factor in soil drying wang et al 2009 this is consistent with the declining trend of sm on the south eastern lp observed in our study however our research also suggests that vegetation exerts an important indirect impact on sm based on the response degree of sm to climate in addition to its direct effects through capillary action and transpiration notably the decline in δsm in the northwest was consistent with that for the overall lp while in the southeast area δsm exhibited a slower decline rate and even increasing trends and the vegetation rapidly increased this phenomenon indicates that the impact of vegetation on δsm was nonlinear our research suggests that vegetation had a potential impact on sm affecting the degree of response of sm to climate change this response could be interpreted as the reduction or intensification of δsm the sm showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in response to pre and tem which were two of the major climatic forcing factors affecting sm the spatial patterns were consistent between the sm sensitivities of the surface and root layers although with a lag effect the lag period of sm change gradually increases with increasing soil depth li and duan 2012 our discussion does not distinguish between the surface and root layers owing to the consistency between the spatial patterns of these two depths for the entire lp vegetation contributes positively to δsmsurf t and δsmroot t positively to δsmsurf p and negatively to δsmroot p the main mechanism by which vegetation connects to soil and climate forcing has been explored in previous ecohydrological studies metzger et al 2017 the increase and decrease of the δsm p of the surface and root zone respectively owing to the influence of vegetation can be explained by the following reasons from the calculated δsm results it can be recognized that the response of sm to precipitation δsm p is always positive that is sm increases whenever precipitation increases fig 7 however under the influence of vegetation the degree of this increase will be different a study reported that the plant canopy intercepts rainwater reducing the speed and energy of raindrops and the surface runoff and increasing sm metzger et al 2017 although the intercepted water will transpire again the rainwater from the canopy shows better penetration into the soil additionally a larger leaf area index for the vegetation facilitates litter production and enhances the moisture content of litter and soil liu and shao 2015 thus increased vegetation on the lp allows for increased δsmsurf p however a larger leaf area index of the vegetation also enhances the ability of the root system to absorb water tao et al 2020 water absorbed by roots is transmitted to the leaf surface through capillary action and then transferred to the atmosphere in the form of transpiration water vapour which reduces the sm of the root zone thus increased vegetation on the lp allows for decreased δsmroot p moreover differences in vegetation types and growth periods lead to spatial heterogeneity of local soil properties i e porosity thereby affecting the storage and evaporation of sm zhang and shangguan 2018 the positive contribution of vegetation to δsm t in the surface and root zones can be explained as follows from the calculated δsm results it can be recognized that the response of sm to temperature δsm t is always positive that is sm decreases whenever temperature increases fig 7 we found that vegetation first alleviated and subsequently intensified δsm t the response of δsm t to vegetation can be explained by two processes on the one hand vegetation lowers the temperature of subcanopy soil when transforming bare land into grass and forest which reduces soil evaporation on the other hand with the continuous increase in vegetation and reduction of bare land area the transpiration from dense forest canopy exceeds evaporation from bare land intensifying δsm t in semi arid areas the absorption of moisture and transpiration from vegetation is usually greater than the evaporation from the soil ivanov et al 2010 as vegetation increases the area of bare soil is reduced and sm is consumed resulting in soil drying liu et al 2010 the effect of vegetation on δsm t depends on the trade off of these two mechanisms the vegetation level of the lp reached a high level in the second stage and the dominant mechanism may be the latter thus vegetation exacerbates δsm t of the lp albeit to a small extent compared with δsm p in reality the effect of soil type also affects the response of sm to climate but in this study the role of vegetation was mainly considered in future research the lp will be divided into several sub regions according to different soil types 4 2 new perspective for evaluating the ggp the exploration of the relationship between δsm and vegetation stemmed from an interesting phenomenon the spatial distribution of the δsm t trend and vegetation trend both show differences between the southeast and northwest the final quantification of the vegetation contribution indicated that vegetation changes during the two periods before and after 2011 did have a large effect on δsm this index of δsm refers to the tws sensitivity tao et al 2020 this could be adopted to characterize soil health and soil safety soil sensitivity to pre and tem becomes more and less stable respectively under the influence of vegetation this suggests that in the context of global warming rainfall events may no longer have the same impact on sm as they did in the past such as producing the rain splash compaction enhancing the sm content or changing the sm distribution as vegetation continues to rebuild while the increase in temperature may increase soil dryness leading to greater spatial heterogeneity of sm d odorico et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 ivanov et al 2010 past studies have often considered the content or the spatial distribution of sm but not the stability or sensitivity of sm which may represent a complex and close relationship with vegetation as per the results of our study as such our study offers an important reference for the lp and other arid and semi arid regions by investigating δsm our study provides a fresh perspective on revegetation on the one hand our contribution analysis showed that vegetation plays a very important role in soil water stability on the other hand the response of δsm to vegetation is nonlinear thus this complex response relationship should be taken into account when formulating vegetation reconstruction policies to ensure that the changes in soil water stability caused by reconstruction are within an acceptable range although our conclusions have implications for the implementation of the ggp we do not specify a threshold for revegetation measures we did not distinguish human and nature induced vegetation change on the lp which hindered our determination of the threshold for the implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects moreover the response of sm to precipitation may be underestimated as we ignored the lag period the lag effect of sm response to precipitation will be considered in future work 5 conclusions vegetation indirectly affects sm patterns by influencing its sensitivity to climatic change a closer ln relationship existed between vegetation and δsm p while vegetation and δsm t had a large v type impact mode on the lp the absolute contribution of vegetation variation to δsm was smaller than that of climate change where the influence on δsm p was higher than that on δsm t the vegetation variation had an intensifying action on δsm t and δsmsurf p and an alleviation action on δsmroot p these effects coupled with the influence of climate change have led to declines in both δsm t and δsm p on the lp notably vegetation is important for the sensitivity of the sm to climate change and over reconstruction may increase the instability of soil water this study provides a new perspective for evaluating the sustainable effects of the ggp as we investigated the effect of vegetation on sm considering the sm sensitivity to climate change in this case soil water stability the results show that the pattern by which δsm is affected by vegetation is complicated and the relationship between vegetation reconstruction and δsm is nonlinear this helps to explain the dynamic changes in sm since the implementation of the ggp on the lp this study provides a scientific basis for the rational implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects and the continuous management of water resources it is recommended that the government should continue vegetation reconstruction at a moderate scale considering the vegetation recovery rate credit authorship

2325,soil moisture is a key component of global hydrological cycles and is closely linked to climate and vegetation however exactly how vegetation affects the response of soil moisture to climate remains unclear in this study soil moisture sensitivity was investigated as an indicator of soil moisture response to climate change including temperature and precipitation twenty years of data from the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model meteorological station and remote sensing of the loess plateau of china were used to estimate the impact of the vegetation regulatory action on soil

undergone the grain for green program ggp a large scale conversion of agricultural land over recent decades zhang and shangguan 2018 a large amount of farmlands have been transformed into natural vegetation i e grasslands shrubs and forests zhang and shangguan 2018 the extensive implementation of the ggp has improved the ecosystem of the lp in terms of climate change regulation carbon sink enhancement and soil water holding capacity ye et al 2019 the ggp and related measures have exerted a considerable impact on the temporal and spatial patterns quality and quantity of soil moisture sm the ggp implementation in 1999 effectively controlled soil erosion yuan et al 2016 however afforestation has increased the scarcity of water resources and caused soil dryness wang et al 2009 ye et al 2019 sm is an important factor in hydrological processes and water resource management especially in arid and semi arid areas such as the lp where groundwater is buried under thick unsaturated loess soil zhang and shangguan 2018 in semi arid areas with thick loess soil rainfall is the only supply of sm as well as the main source of water for vegetation growth owing to strong evaporation and a lack of rainfall water is the key constraint for ecological recovery and vegetation reconstruction in this region thus the effects of climate change and vegetation variation on sm dynamics are significant and thus must be accounted for when formulating engineering measures for vegetation reconstruction fu et al 2011 2017 sm is a key variable that governs the exchange of material and transformation of energy in ecohydrological processes and is closely related to the evolution of macro climate conditions and micro vegetation feedback rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 berry et al 2006 troch et al 2013 multiple factors i e vegetation climate and human activities contribute to the spatio temporal heterogeneity of sm which in return impacts processes related to soil water balance nutrient cycling and crop production teuling and troch 2005 dari et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 the study of sm focuses on three scales with different environmental factors large scale climate change meso scale land use change human activity small scale bio physical mechanisms between vegetation and soil dekker et al 2007 janssen et al 2008 liu and shao 2015 a fully coupled climate vegetation model demonstrated that vegetation disturbance would lead to direct positive feedback of vegetation on climate and indirect negative feedback of vegetation on sm liu et al 2010 such direct and indirect feedback of vegetation is closely related to the vegetation species jian et al 2015 trees are prone to direct positive feedback because of their strong plant transpiration and low albedo in contrast grasses are more effective in producing indirect feedback because of their limited evapotranspiration and shallow roots which can alter surface sm and evaporation liu et al 2010 studies suggest that trees affect the formation of edaphic heterogeneity which does not contribute to the distribution of woody vegetation d odorico et al 2007 özkan and gökbulak 2017 plant water uptake typically dominates soil evaporation in the case of complete vegetation cover approximately 64 of precipitation exits the ecosystem via evapotranspiration whereas in bare soil only approximately 36 of precipitation is evaporated ivanov et al 2010 revegetation is predicted to impact both the water content and soil properties vegetation roots alter the structural characteristics of the surrounding soil the enhancement of porosity near the root promotes stemflow to greater depths and beyond the rooting zone metzger et al 2017 sm depletion is related to the root depth distribution singh et al 1998 the depth and density of the root distribution vary depending on species and age which affect the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration accounting for 21 to 26 of the spatial heterogeneity of sm on a regional scale respectively wang et al 2012 in addition vegetation appears to exert a relatively homogenizing effect on sm over the long term reducing the possibility of topographic redistribution of sm ivanov et al 2010 under certain precipitation conditions plant population density restricts the normal growth of forests by affecting sm content li and duan 2012 excessive afforestation intensifies the scarcity of sm and restricts the ecological and economic benefits of vegetation li and duan 2012 the heterogeneity of sm also depends on canopy interception and redistribution meteorological and climate forcing and so on famiglietti et al 2008 the complexity of the soil vegetation climate feedback mechanism poses a challenge to the understanding of the terrestrial water cycle geris et al 2017 continuous afforestation on the lp has increased the vegetation coverage in the northwest at a slow growth rate and in the southeast at a rapid growth rate however sm in this region has shown wet to dry and dry to wet patterns over the past 30 years li et al 2021 understanding this special phenomenon requires further exploration of the relationship between sm dynamics and vegetation change studies have shown that long term vegetation restoration could substantially impact the soil water storage of grasslands and forests zhang et al 2016 zhang and shangguan 2018 the increase in vegetation promotes sm loss through absorption and transpiration while reducing the evaporation of bare land liu et al 2010 vegetation variation considerably influences sm by transpiration and evaporation which are closely related to climate forcing thus there is a feedback relationship not only among these three elements but also among the elements and processes despite numerous studies addressing the sm response to climate change it remains unclear whether the state of vegetation will aggravate or alleviate the response process to clarify how vegetation regulates intensifies or mitigates the sm responses to climate change statistical analysis was performed on a pixel scale on sm of the surface layer and root layer vegetation and climate forcing data sm sensitivity δsm the degree of response of sm to climatic forcing was employed to analyse the indirect effects previous study has calculated the temporal and spatial distribution of the sensitivity of terrestrial water storage tws but the results lack data on the sensitivity of sm which is a component of the terrestrial water cycle and is severely affected by climate change scheffer et al 2005 tao et al 2020 the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to illustrate the spatiotemporal distribution of δsm on the lp 2 to clarify the relationship between vegetation and δsm to precipitation and temperature and 3 to quantify the contribution of vegetation to δsm on the lp the findings are representative of the dynamic response of the water resource reserves of the lp to the ggp over the past 20 years offering guidance for the practical strategies of vegetation reconstruction and the scientific management of water resources in arid and semi arid regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study regions the lp 33 69 n 41 28 n 100 87 e 114 52 e is located along the middle reach of the yellow river in northern china with an area of approximately 6 4 105 km2 li et al 2021 fig 1 the lp is the largest and deepest loess deposit globally and has long been one of the most severely eroded areas on earth fu et al 2017 the main soil types are loose yellow soil brown soil and black soil the region is characterized by an arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 100 800 mm with approximately 55 78 occurring during the wet season xin et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 li et al 2021 the annual potential evaporation 800 1000 mm far exceeds precipitation which is relatively insufficient for supplying soil moisture and unevenly distributed qian 1991 soils of the lp have high water storage capacity owing to the thick loess material li and shao 2007 wang et al 2019 however the high soil porosity also promotes evaporation leading to poor water storage and deeply buried groundwater which in turn results in scarce soil water broken terrain and severe soil loss qian 1991 the fragile ecology of the lp is sensitive to climate change the ggp launched in 1999 has made the lp a focal point of water resources research the integrated impact of soil vegetation climate exacerbates the severity of the water shortage issue zeng et al 2005 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 datasets the dataset used in this study included data for sm precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and the enhanced vegetation index evi sm data were retrieved from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam database http gleam eu the gleam is a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation based on satellite observations miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 root zone soil moisture smroot and surface soil moisture smsurf are intermediate outputs of the model this study selected the relevant sm data released by gleam v3 5a from january 2000 to december 2020 including the sm m3 m 3 of the surface smsurf 0 10 cm and the root zone smroot 10 250 cm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 point scale sampling is challenging for the exploration of long term spatio temporal changes in sm on a large spatial scale whereas the gleam data is deemed representative of the spatial and temporal patterns of sm distribution for the entire lp ye et al 2019 statistical analysis at the pixel scale is conducive to obtaining information on regularity vegetation data involves the mod13c2 product of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis https earthdata nasa gov which included monthly data of 0 05 0 05 resolution meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service platform https data cma cn including daily data from 154 stations on the lp owing to the large elevation variation across the lp the anusplin software was used to interpolate the meteorological elements with elevation as a covariate and then resampled to obtain monthly t and p data of 0 25 0 25 resolution liu et al 2008 based on this interpolated data the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated according to the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the reliability of gleam sm data has been validated by in situ sm measurements on the lp ye et al 2019 we also validated the gleam sm data with nasa global land data assimilation system gldas sm data gldas 2 1 provides a 0 25 x 0 25 grid sm data 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm with a monthly temporal resolution the pearson correlation coefficient r between the smsurf data of the gleam dataset and the sm0 10 data of the gldas dataset was shown in fig 2 and indicate that the two data products exhibit significant coherence in addition the δsm calculated using the gleam smsurf data and that using the gldas sm0 10 data also exhibit significant coherence fig 2 2 2 2 investigating sm in association with climate and vegetation to investigate the relationship between sm and climate and vegetation the partial correlations between sm and temperature precipitation and evi for each 0 25 grid from 2000 to 2020 was calculated in addition a non linear regression equation with sm as a dependent variable enhanced vegetation index precipitation and temperature as independent variables was developed by multivariable linear regression for each 0 25 grid cell with the monthly time series data from 2000 to 2020 as eq 1 1 s m p t e v i a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 a 3 t a 4 t 2 a 5 p t a 6 e v i ε where p is precipitation mm t is temperature c evi is the enhanced vegetation index and ε is the residual value the a 0 is the constant term and a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 and a 6 are the coefficients for each term respectively 2 2 3 estimating the sensitivity of sm to climate δsm soil moisture sensitivity a representative indicator reflecting the response of sm to climate change or stability of sm in the context of climate change was investigated the establishment and calculation of this indicator were performed using a previously described method tao et al 2020 according to the fitting coefficients and meteorological data values of each point and layer the sensitivity value of the soil was obtained at each point and layer of the climate using eqs 2 and 3 2 δ s m t 1 c s m p t 1 e v

sensitivity of sm to temperature δ s m p 1 m m is the amount of change in sm when the precipitation changes by 1 mm i e the sensitivity of sm to precipitation and the coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 are the same as those in eq 1 pixel unit statistical regression was performed to obtain the regression equation of δsm with respect to climate and vegetation and to determine the contribution of vegetation to the change in δsm in the context of climate change 3 results 3 1 correlations between sm and environmental elements overall the spatial distribution of the changing trends of environmental elements on the lp exhibited heterogeneity fig 3 the potential evapotranspiration pet showed a declining trend in the western and an increasing trend in the south temperature tem demonstrated an upward trend with sharp rises in some areas precipitation pre has increased almost throughout the lp but decreased in a small number of regions precipitation across the lp increased by 45 mm from 2000 to 2020 the evi increased but the increase in the northwest region was slower than that in the southeast region the sms of the surface layer smsurf and root layer smroot showed a consistent spatial distribution with most areas showing a downward trend and the southeastern corner decreasing more prominently overall the spatial heterogeneity of sm had no similarity to any individual climate factor implying that the sm patterns are dependent on multiple factors rather than a single factor factors pre tem and evi were defined as the three major climate forcing factors for determining sm in eq 1 to understand the individual influence of the three factors on sm partial correlations analysis and a t test were performed fig 4 the results show consistent effects of the three climate forcing factors on smsurf and smroot regardless of the spatial pattern correlation degree or positive negative correlation a significant negative correlation between tem and sm was detected for almost the entire region there was a positive correlation between pre and sm throughout the northwest and southeast regions of the lp a significant correlation between evi and sm was identified in most areas of the lp except for a small number of points in the south which showed a negative correlation the partial correlation of sm and tem passed a significance test for the entire lp indicating that it had a greater probability of correlation however from the correlation extent point of view sm and both pre and evi had strong correlations with most points exhibiting significant positive correlations in addition the spatial distributions of sm pre and sm evi had more significant spatial heterogeneity and were more similar to the spatial pattern of sm fig 4 the sm and pet had a weak correlation with most points exhibiting significant negative correlations p 0 05 in addition the resultant spatial patterns of the coefficient of determination r2 in eq 1 are presented in fig 5 almost all point passed the significance test p 0 05 3 2 soil moisture sensitivity response to changes in climate and evi the δsm of each point and year was calculated according to the fitting equation eq 1 the spatial distributions of δsm t trend and δsm p trend presented significant heterogeneity fig 6 for the trends in smsurf and smroot the spatial patterns were generally consistent however the region area with a downward trend for smsurf was large than that for smroot this may illustrate the proliferation and lag phenomena of the response the δsm usually starts from a local area gradually spreading outwards meanwhile the response of the surface layer appears earlier than that of the root layer therefore the similarity in spatial distribution may be delayed the δsm t exhibited a reducing trend in the central region of the lp a shape similar to and increasing trends in other regions similar to the spatial distribution of vegetation trends δsm p presented a distinct separation between the northwest and southeast with rapidly reducing and slowly decreasing or even increasing trends respectively to clarify the relationship between δsm and vegetation the vegetation and both δsm t and δsm p were fitted the δsm p and δsm t in association with vegetation present the forms of ln and secondary functions respectively fig 7 the correlation between vegetation and δsm calculated by gldas sm0 10 data is basically consistent with the results obtained by gleam smsurf data fig 8 in particular the r2 of the fitting function for δsm p was higher than that of δsm t the δsm p rate was high in the northwest and low in the southeast consistent with the results indicated by the ln curve the ln relationship of δsm p and evi showed that δsm p gradually reduced with increasing vegetation as the reduction rate gradually decreased δsm p eventually stabilized the relationship between δsm t and vegetation is similar to the secondary function meaning that with the increase in vegetation δsm t gradually decreased to a minimum and then increased thus there were two cases with a vegetation increase in the first case the vegetation index increased but did not meet the turning point of the trend transition leading to continuously reduced sensitivity this occurred in the north western region with a low rate of vegetation reconstruction in the second case as the vegetation index further increased the sensitivity presented an increasing trend this was observed in the southeast region with a high rate of vegetation reconstruction 3 3 quantitative contribution of vegetation variation and climate change to δsm the factors involved in this study have undergone significant changes over 20 years owing to the strong and rapid response of sm to climate change and the vigorous implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects on the lp using the pettitt test to assess each element we identified 2011 as the communal mutation year with significant changes fig 9 the overall level of precipitation on the lp was significantly elevated after 2011 fig 10 specifically the precipitation increased before 2011 and was basically stable after 2011 the temperature slowly declined and was almost stable before 2011 and rapidly increased after 2011 fig 10 the trend of potential evapotranspiration converted from a slow decline before 2011 to a significant rise after 2011 the increase in vegetation was rapid before 2011 but slowed after 2011 fig 10 the overall level of sm rapidly increased in 2011 and then gradually decreased fig 11 the sms of the root and surface layers were consistent across the lp both δsm p and δsm t presented a smooth rise before 2011 and a significant reduction after 2011 fig 11 overall sm on the lp showed a declining trend over the 20 year study period and the response of sm to climate change was weakened to calculate the contribution of vegetation variation to the δsm on the lp the equations of δsms eqs 4 11 were fitted separately for the two periods before 2011 and after 2011 using the data of δsm evi precipitation and temperature for each point and year the fitting of δsmsurf p was found to be the best r2 0 54 in the first stage and r2 0 53 in the second stage the fittings of δsms in the first stage were as follows 4 δ s m 1 surf t 4 8 10 6 p 1 4 10 4 t 9 8 10 4 e v i 5 1 10 2 e v i 2 1 89 10 3 r 2 0 29 5 δ s

r 2 0 42 where δ s m surf t and δ s m root t are the sm sensitivities to the temperatures of the surface and root layers respectively and δ s m surf p and δ s m root p are the sm sensitivities to precipitations of the surface and root layers respectively the 1 and 2 represent the first stage and second stages respectively the first and second phases of climate change are separated by the year 2011 the average of each factor within the two phases was used as the value of the first and second phases and the difference between the two periods was considered as the change amount on this basis eq 4 11 were used to estimate the contribution of vegetation variation and climate change to changes in δsm change in δsm only considering vegetation variation during the 20 years was calculated as follows 12 δ δ sm evi p t δ e v i δ s m 2 p t e v i δ e v i δ s m 1 p t e v i change in δsm considering both vegetation variation and climate change during the 20 years was calculated as follows 13 δ

value of vegetation variation to δsm and r climate is the contribution value of climate change to δsm for the entire lp over the 20 year study period the increase in vegetation had an intensifying effect on δsm t and δsmsurf p while vegetation played a weakening role on δsmroot p fig 12 the contributions of vegetation to δsmsurf t and δsmroot t were 11 44 and 17 23 respectively which were offset by the negative effects of climate change 88 56 and 82 77 resulting in overall negative effects on δsmsurf t and δsmroot t fig 12 in other words the response of sm to temperature change in lp was declining although vegetation improved δsm t the contributions of vegetation to the changes in δsmsurf p and δsmroot p were 23 78 and 78 57 respectively which were offset by the contribution of climate change 76 22 and 21 43 eventually exhibiting a negative effect on δsmsurf p and δsmroot p in other words the response of smsurf to precipitation change was intensified by vegetation while the response of smroot to precipitation change was weakened by vegetation the response of sm to precipitation change in lp was declining here we assume that the contribution of climate change is the residual of influence of vegetation however in reality vegetation and climate are definitely not two independent variables as such our conclusions are limited by the assumption that there is no mutual contribution between vegetation and climate 4 discussion 4 1 role of vegetation in sm sensitivity to precipitation and temperature the lp is facing water shortages and drying typically vegetation is considered an important factor in soil drying wang et al 2009 this is consistent with the declining trend of sm on the south eastern lp observed in our study however our research also suggests that vegetation exerts an important indirect impact on sm based on the response degree of sm to climate in addition to its direct effects through capillary action and transpiration notably the decline in δsm in the northwest was consistent with that for the overall lp while in the southeast area δsm exhibited a slower decline rate and even increasing trends and the vegetation rapidly increased this phenomenon indicates that the impact of vegetation on δsm was nonlinear our research suggests that vegetation had a potential impact on sm affecting the degree of response of sm to climate change this response could be interpreted as the reduction or intensification of δsm the sm showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in response to pre and tem which were two of the major climatic forcing factors affecting sm the spatial patterns were consistent between the sm sensitivities of the surface and root layers although with a lag effect the lag period of sm change gradually increases with increasing soil depth li and duan 2012 our discussion does not distinguish between the surface and root layers owing to the consistency between the spatial patterns of these two depths for the entire lp vegetation contributes positively to δsmsurf t and δsmroot t positively to δsmsurf p and negatively to δsmroot p the main mechanism by which vegetation connects to soil and climate forcing has been explored in previous ecohydrological studies metzger et al 2017 the increase and decrease of the δsm p of the surface and root zone respectively owing to the influence of vegetation can be explained by the following reasons from the calculated δsm results it can be recognized that the response of sm to precipitation δsm p is always positive that is sm increases whenever precipitation increases fig 7 however under the influence of vegetation the degree of this increase will be different a study reported that the plant canopy intercepts rainwater reducing the speed and energy of raindrops and the surface runoff and increasing sm metzger et al 2017 although the intercepted water will transpire again the rainwater from the canopy shows better penetration into the soil additionally a larger leaf area index for the vegetation facilitates litter production and enhances the moisture content of litter and soil liu and shao 2015 thus increased vegetation on the lp allows for increased δsmsurf p however a larger leaf area index of the vegetation also enhances the ability of the root system to absorb water tao et al 2020 water absorbed by roots is transmitted to the leaf surface through capillary action and then transferred to the atmosphere in the form of transpiration water vapour which reduces the sm of the root zone thus increased vegetation on the lp allows for decreased δsmroot p moreover differences in vegetation types and growth periods lead to spatial heterogeneity of local soil properties i e porosity thereby affecting the storage and evaporation of sm zhang and shangguan 2018 the positive contribution of vegetation to δsm t in the surface and root zones can be explained as follows from the calculated δsm results it can be recognized that the response of sm to temperature δsm t is always positive that is sm decreases whenever temperature increases fig 7 we found that vegetation first alleviated and subsequently intensified δsm t the response of δsm t to vegetation can be explained by two processes on the one hand vegetation lowers the temperature of subcanopy soil when transforming bare land into grass and forest which reduces soil evaporation on the other hand with the continuous increase in vegetation and reduction of bare land area the transpiration from dense forest canopy exceeds evaporation from bare land intensifying δsm t in semi arid areas the absorption of moisture and transpiration from vegetation is usually greater than the evaporation from the soil ivanov et al 2010 as vegetation increases the area of bare soil is reduced and sm is consumed resulting in soil drying liu et al 2010 the effect of vegetation on δsm t depends on the trade off of these two mechanisms the vegetation level of the lp reached a high level in the second stage and the dominant mechanism may be the latter thus vegetation exacerbates δsm t of the lp albeit to a small extent compared with δsm p in reality the effect of soil type also affects the response of sm to climate but in this study the role of vegetation was mainly considered in future research the lp will be divided into several sub regions according to different soil types 4 2 new perspective for evaluating the ggp the exploration of the relationship between δsm and vegetation stemmed from an interesting phenomenon the spatial distribution of the δsm t trend and vegetation trend both show differences between the southeast and northwest the final quantification of the vegetation contribution indicated that vegetation changes during the two periods before and after 2011 did have a large effect on δsm this index of δsm refers to the tws sensitivity tao et al 2020 this could be adopted to characterize soil health and soil safety soil sensitivity to pre and tem becomes more and less stable respectively under the influence of vegetation this suggests that in the context of global warming rainfall events may no longer have the same impact on sm as they did in the past such as producing the rain splash compaction enhancing the sm content or changing the sm distribution as vegetation continues to rebuild while the increase in temperature may increase soil dryness leading to greater spatial heterogeneity of sm d odorico et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 ivanov et al 2010 past studies have often considered the content or the spatial distribution of sm but not the stability or sensitivity of sm which may represent a complex and close relationship with vegetation as per the results of our study as such our study offers an important reference for the lp and other arid and semi arid regions by investigating δsm our study provides a fresh perspective on revegetation on the one hand our contribution analysis showed that vegetation plays a very important role in soil water stability on the other hand the response of δsm to vegetation is nonlinear thus this complex response relationship should be taken into account when formulating vegetation reconstruction policies to ensure that the changes in soil water stability caused by reconstruction are within an acceptable range although our conclusions have implications for the implementation of the ggp we do not specify a threshold for revegetation measures we did not distinguish human and nature induced vegetation change on the lp which hindered our determination of the threshold for the implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects moreover the response of sm to precipitation may be underestimated as we ignored the lag period the lag effect of sm response to precipitation will be considered in future work 5 conclusions vegetation indirectly affects sm patterns by influencing its sensitivity to climatic change a closer ln relationship existed between vegetation and δsm p while vegetation and δsm t had a large v type impact mode on the lp the absolute contribution of vegetation variation to δsm was smaller than that of climate change where the influence on δsm p was higher than that on δsm t the vegetation variation had an intensifying action on δsm t and δsmsurf p and an alleviation action on δsmroot p these effects coupled with the influence of climate change have led to declines in both δsm t and δsm p on the lp notably vegetation is important for the sensitivity of the sm to climate change and over reconstruction may increase the instability of soil water this study provides a new perspective for evaluating the sustainable effects of the ggp as we investigated the effect of vegetation on sm considering the sm sensitivity to climate change in this case soil water stability the results show that the pattern by which δsm is affected by vegetation is complicated and the relationship between vegetation reconstruction and δsm is nonlinear this helps to explain the dynamic changes in sm since the implementation of the ggp on the lp this study provides a scientific basis for the rational implementation of vegetation reconstruction projects and the continuous management of water resources it is recommended that the government should continue vegetation reconstruction at a moderate scale considering the vegetation recovery rate credit authorship

frequency analysis hfa has been a commonly used approach for design flood estimation under nonstationary conditions which underlies deep uncertainty most of the previous studies focus on the influence of model parameter mp uncertainty on design flood little is known about quantitative assessment on the commonly used precipitation projection pp uncertainty impact on it to address this concern this

introduction hydrological frequency analysis hfa is a vital tool to estimate the design flood with a given design standard which is extremely important for hydraulic engineering construct and water resources management compared with the commonly used stationary hfa the nonstationary hfa has been paid more attention in recent years because the nonstationarity of extreme hydrological series has been observed in many regions around the world strupczewski et al 2001 katz et al 2002 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 cooley 2013 rootzen and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 salas and obeysekera 2013 xiong et al 2015 hu et al 2018 liang et al 2018 in theory the stationary hfa is no longer applicable for inferring the design flood under nonstationarity milly et al 2008 lopez and frances 2013 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2017 related to the design flood calculation under nonstationarity the approaches can be roughly divided into two categories hydrological simulation based and flow hfa based approaches françois et al 2019 ammar et al 2020 lan et al 2020 the hydrological simulation based approaches include 1 to convert the design precipitation with a specified design standard or probable maximum precipitation into the design flood by using the runoff generation and flow routing methods lan et al 2020 2 to simulate the flow series by forcing the hydrological model with the input of gcm projection precipitation temperature etc then to analyze the flood frequency based on the simulated flow series camici et al 2014 ammar et al 2020 the flow hfa based approaches are to directly use the hfa for inferring the design flood based on the flow series xie et al 2005 rootzen and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2016 liang et al 2018 over the past few years a larger body of researches focused on the latter and many typical approaches have been proposed such as sample reconstruction based approaches mixture distribution based approaches and parameter varying distribution based approaches khaliq et al 2006 hu et al 2018 françois et al 2019 the sample reconstruction based approaches aim to reconstruct the nonstationary extreme flood series to ensure the reconstructed series meet the requirements of stationarity and then the stationary hfa method is used to calculate the design flood xie et al 2005 gado and nguyen 2016 hu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 liang et al 2018 for example xie et al 2005 developed a sample decomposition composition based approach for nonstationary hfa the approach decomposes the extreme flood into a nonstationary deterministic component and a stationary random component the deterministic component in any given future year is predicted using a model then it is synthesized with the random component to reconstruct a stationary flood series liang et al 2018 made use of a modified reservoir index as a scalar factor to reconstruct the reservoir influenced nonstationary annual maximum flow series to make it stationary thus ensure the feasibility of the stationary hfa approach in the mixture distribution based approaches the whole extreme flood series is firstly divided into several sub series to ensure that each sub series is stationary secondly to weighted synthesize the distribution corresponding to each subsample series finally a comprehensive mixture distribution is derived to infer the design flood with a given return period alila and mtiraoui 2002 singh et al 2005 yan et al 2017 for example alila and mtiraoui 2002 proposed to employ the mixture distribution model composed of a mixture of two or more populations for flood frequency analysis with the consideration that floods were often generated by heterogeneous distributions their analysis results based on the long term hydro climatic records from ten stations in the gila river in the usa indicated that the mixture distribution was more appropriate besides based on the assumption that the extreme flood series in the same season obeys the same distribution and in different seasons the distributions are different and independent of each other singh et al 2005 derived the frequency distribution for the annual maximum flood flow by using the probability multiplication theorem the parameter varying distribution based approaches have been commonly used to describe the distribution of a non stationary extreme flood series in which one or more of the distribution parameters are modelled as a function of time or other factors such as precipitation temperature and population growth strupczewski et al 2001 vogel et al 2011 gilroy and mccuen 2012 lopez and frances 2013 liu et al 2014 li and tan 2015 condon et al 2015 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 condon et al 2015 employed a nonstationary generalized extreme value model in which the location and scale parameters were simulated as a function of monthly precipitation totals and average temperature to fit the frequency distribution of cool season november april monthly maximum flows in their research the projections of precipitation and temperature from the gcms were used to infer the future distributions of the monthly maximum flows hu et al 2019 applied a nonstationary person type three pe3 distribution model to assess the change of annual precipitation at the level of the quantile in their research the location and scale parameters of the pe3 distribution were modelled as a linear function of time it should be emphasized that in the parameter varying distribution based approaches the distribution varies over time and is not the same with each other in different years which results in the design flood with a given annual exceedance probability being different in different years cooley 2013 hu et al 2018 the question now arises that the relationship between the return period and corresponding design flood is not unique which leads to difficulties in engineering practice to deal with the above issue several typical approaches have been proposed such as expected waiting time until a given exceedance event occurs ewt olsen et al 1998 cooley 2013 yan et al 2020 expected occurrence number of the given event over the return period enerp parey et al 2010 design life level dll rootzen and katz 2013 average design life level adll read and vogel 2015 expected occurrence number of the given event over the engineering design life enedl obeysekera and salas 2016 and equivalent reliability method er liang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 yan et al 2017 investigated and compared the performance of four nonstationary design approaches including enepr dll er and adll they recommended both er and adll approaches to be applied in practice because the two methods associate design floods with the design life period of projects and yield reasonable design quantiles and confidence intervals especially recommended the er method because it can bridge the gap between stationary and nonstationary design criteria besides given that the univariate hfa based design flood cannot fully present design flood characteristic because a complete flood event usually contains multiple flood features e g flood peaks and flood volume the study on nonstationary multivariate hfa based on parameter varying copulas allowing for the nonstationarity of the marginal distribution of each flood variable and the dependence structure is attracting more and more attention bender et al 2014 kwon and lall 2016 bracken et al 2018 hu et al 2022 this study is limited to the nonstationary univariate hfa therefore the nonstationary multivariate hfa will not be discussed too much here compared to the sample reconstruction based approaches and mixture distribution based approaches the parameter varying distribution based approaches received more attention and has been widely studied because it has the advantage to predict the future distribution of the extreme variable in any future year e g rootzen and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2014 read and vogel 2015 hu et al 2018 however it should be noted that the predicted distribution in the future time is influenced by more sources of uncertainties compared to the stationary hfa this leads to deep uncertainty in the design flood estimation under changing environments serinaldi and kilsby 2015 in stationary hfa the uncertainty on estimation of design flood generally results from the uncertainty of sample representation hu et al 2015 parameter estimation renard 2011 and frequency distribution function selection bobo and unny 1976 liang et al 2012 however under nonstationary conditions the uncertainty on design flood estimation results from not only the three factors same with the stationary hfa but also the uncertainty on climate variable projection used as a factor to simulate the model parameter change in the parameter varying distribution model the projection data of climatic variables from the gcms are widely used gilroy and mccuen 2012 yan et al 2017 however the projection data provided by different gcm models have different precision and are of high uncertainty which inevitably produces an impact on design value estimation a great deal of effort has been made on uncertainty analysis of design flood estimation under nonstationary conditions cheng et al 2014 obeysekera and salas 2014 sun et al 2015 hu et al 2017 bracken et al 2018 d oria et al 2018 for instance obeysekera and salas 2014 employed three methods including delta bootstrap and profile likelihood methods to investigate the impact of the limited observations sample size on the uncertainty of the design flood under a nonstationary framework their research results show that the delta and the bootstrap method can be computationally efficient and the profile likelihood method is quite burdensome computationally but provides more realistic asymmetric confidence intervals hu et al 2017 used the bayesian method to analyze the impact of model parameter mp uncertainty on the ewt and ene based estimation of design peak flow under nonstationary conditions they found that mp uncertainty significantly affects the design flood uncertainty and the ewt based estimation is different from the ene based estimation in light of mp uncertainty however to sum up the studies on design flood estimation uncertainty in the parameter varying distribution based approaches mainly focus on considering the impact of mp uncertainty and limited sample size on it little is known about quantitative assessment on the precipitation projections pp uncertainty impact on design flood when the precipitation factor is used to model the temporal evolution of the distribution parameters to address this concern this study attempts to put forward a framework to analyze the design flood uncertainty in light of mp uncertainty and pp uncertainty this objective is threefold 1 to correct the pp data from gcms to improve its quality and then establish different parameter varying distribution models for a nonstationary series 2 to analyze the impact of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them on the design flood estimation 3 to investigate which one between mp and pp uncertainty is dominated in the total uncertainty on design flood estimation finally a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv series of huanglongtan stations located in the duhe basin in china is applied to illustrate this proposed approach 2 method methodologies for estimating the design flood and quantifying such estimation uncertainty under nonstationarity are described here including the twenty six nonstationary hfa models for describing the distribution of a nonstationary series the equidistant cumulative distribution function method for correcting the twenty eight gcms pp the equivalent reliability method for estimating the design flood under nonstationarity the framework composed of bayesian theory and poor man ensemble strategy for analyzing the design flood estimation uncertainty in the lights of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them following the description aforementioned the main components are summarized in fig 1 2 1 nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis models to describe the distribution characteristic of a nonstationary extreme variable the nonstationary hfa models with its parameters modelled as a function of time or other factors have been commonly used e g strupczewski et al 2001 lopez and frances 2013 cheng et al 2014 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 in this study twenty six nonstationary hfa models based on the pearson type three pe3 and generalized extreme value gev distribution are developed to analyze the evolution characteristics of the distribution of the annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv the akaike s information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic metrics hu et al 2017 are used to assess the performance of different models the nonstationary pe3 probability distribution can be expressed by e g hu et al 2017 1 f x μ t β t γ t β t γ t γ γ t x μ t γ t 1 e β t x μ t where μ t 0 β t 0 and γ t 0 are the location scale and shape parameters of pe3 distribution in time t γ γ t is a gamma function the nonstationary gev distribution can be expressed by e g cooley 2013 2 f x α t σ t δ t exp 1 δ t x α t σ t 1 δ t 1 δ t x α t σ t 0 where α t σ t and δ t are the location scale and shape parameters of gev distribution in time t in the nonstationary pe3 and nonstationary gev distribution models the parameters are modelled as a function of precipitation p or reservoir index ri or both of them ri value is calculated by the method proposed by lopez and frances 2013 then the twenty six nonstationary hfa models are developed which are listed in table 1 ri value is calculated by lopez and frances 2013 3 ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where n is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station ci is the total capacity of each reservoir and ct is the mean annual runoff at the gauge station 2 2 equidistant cumulative distribution function method to evaluate the future changes in the distribution of an extreme variable the projected precipitation pp datasets from the gcms are used because the precipitation factor is used in several nonstationary hfa models the pp from twenty eight gcms under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario is used table 2 due to the pp data provided by different gcms have different precision the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method li et al 2010 is applied to correct them this method can incorporate both the gcm climatological mean and variance by taking into account the changes of climate fields in the future period watanabe et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the method can be written as 4 x f u t c o r x f u t g c m f b a s o b s 1 f f u t g c m x f u t g c m f b a s g c m 1 f f u t g c m x f u t g c m where x f u t g c m is the precipitation provided series by gcm for the future period fut x f u t c o r is the corrected gcm series f b a s o b s 1 is the quantile function of the observations obs in the baseline period bas f b a s g c m 1 is the quantile function of gcm data in the baseline period bas f f u t g c m is the cdf of the gcm series in the future projection period a two parameter gamma distribution is used for matching the cumulative distribution function of a given precipitation series 5 f x α β β α γ α x α 1 e β x x 0 where α and β is the location and scale parameter 2 3 equivalent reliability method to estimate the design flood under nonstationarity the equivalent reliability er method is employed liang et al 2016 yan et al 2017a hu et al 2018 under stationarity for a project with the l year design lifespan from t1 to t2 year and t year design return period the corresponding hydrological design reliability r s that the probability of the design flood x t s will not be exceeded is calculated by 6 r s i t 1 t 2 1 1 t 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 the t years design return period can be defined as the expected waiting time until the next exceedance is t year or the expected occurrences number of events in t years is equal to one cooley 2013 under nonstationarity the hydrological design reliability r ns that the probability of no flood exceeding the design flood x t ns is calculated by hu et al 2018 7 r ns t t 1 t 2 f t x t ns θ t where f t θ t t t 1 t 1 1 t 2 is the nonstationary frequency analysis model given the parameters θ t in year t according to the er method yan et al 2017a hu et al 2018 the design reliability r ns under nonstationarity should be equal to r s under stationarity i e 8 t t 1 t 2 f i x t ns θ t 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 the design flood x t ns under nonstationarity can be obtained by solving eq 8 it should be emphasized that the design flood x t ns and x t s are not the same but the design reliability r ns corresponding to x t ns and r s related to x t s are equal 2 4 uncertainty analysis of the design flood estimation 2 4 1 parameter uncertainty consideration to analyze the impact of mp uncertainty on the er based estimations of design flood the bayesian method is employed the posterior distribution f θ x of parameters θ conditional observation x can be expressed by cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2017 9 f θ x f x θ π θ f x f x θ π θ f x θ π θ d θ where θ is parameter set such as for the model 1 listed in table 1 θ μ 0 μ 1 β 0 γ 0 π θ is the prior distribution of all parameters in the set θ before any data is observed which are described by using a normal distribution separately f x θ is the likelihood of quantifying the information brought by the observed data x the differential evolution markov chain approach is used to generate n groups of samples from the posterior distribution of each parameter cheng et al 2014 the convergence test criterion r gelman and shirley 2011 is used to check if the sampling approach is converged based on the generated n groups of parameter samples combined with the er method the n corresponding estimations of the design flood x t ns with a given design standard are calculated which can be used to estimate the distribution of estimations of x t ns and to quantify its uncertainty in the nonstationary hfa models with one or more parameters simulated as a function of precipitation variable the average of the corrected pp series corresponding to the twenty eight gcms table 3 is used 2 4 2 precipitation projection uncertainty consideration while using precipitation factor as a covariate to model the future change of mp in nonstationary hfa models such as pe3m6 it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of the future pp impact on the design flood estimation because the pp from gcms subjects to bias and uncertainty even after correction based on the pe3m6 model the procedures for analyzing the pp uncertainty impact on the design flood are followings in the pe3m6 model the location parameter μ of the pe3 distribution is modelled as a function of precipitation while the other two parameters are constant i e 10 μ t exp μ 0 μ 1 p β t exp β 0 γ t exp γ 0 the exp form is used to model the relationship between model parameters and covariates to ensure the three parameters are great than zero which are required in the pe3 distribution the parameters are estimated by using the maximum posterior estimation of each parameter provided by the bayesian method mentioned in sec 2 4 1 based on each one of the twenty eight corrected pp series provided by the twenty eight gcms one corresponding estimation of the design flood x t ns with a given design standard is calculated by the er method thus twenty eight estimations of x t ns can be obtained then the impact of pp uncertainty on the design flood x t ns can be assessed by using the distribution calibrated by its twenty eight estimations for the other nonstationary hfa models in which one or more parameters is driven by precipitation factor similar strategies can be used for assessing the future pp impact on the design flood estimation uncertainty 2 4 3 consideration of parameter and precipitation projection uncertainties to evaluate the joint impact of the mp and pp uncertainty on the design flood estimation the poor man s ensemble strategy is used the poor man s ensemble strategy has been commonly used to create a useful probability forecasting system in the field of numerical weather prediction nwp by comprising a set of nwp model forecasts from several operational centres which can be used to assess the uncertainty of prediction results ebert 2001 arribas et al 2005 in this study the ensemble strategy is used to assess the mp and pp uncertainty impacts on the design flood by comprising different mp and different pp input based on the pe3m6 model the procedures for analyzing the joint impact of both mp and future pp uncertainty on the design flood are followings similar strategies can be used for the other nonstationary hfa models 1 to calculate the engineering design reliability r s for given design return period t and design lifespan from t1 to t2 year by using eq 5 2 given one of the n groups of parameters and one of the m corrected pp series from year t1 to t2 one corresponding er based estimation of the design flood x t ns can be obtained using eq 7 3 to repeat step 2 given n groups of mp and m corrected future pp series the n m corresponding estimations of the design flood x t ns can be obtained 4 based on the n m estimations of the design flood its empirical distribution can be estimated and some key eigenvalues such as median and interval estimation can be derived thus the joint impact of mp and pp uncertainty on the uncertainty of the design flood estimation can be assessed 3 study area and data the data used in this study is covering the huanglongtan hlt basin with the hydrological control station of hlt hlt basin is located in the lower reaches of the duhe river basin and the duhe river is an important tributary of the danjiangkou reservoir in china hlt basin area is about 10 995 km2 which accounts for 88 of the total area of duhe basin sun et al 2016 there are hlt pankou pk eping ep songhuling sll longbeiwan lbw and zhuxihe zxh hydropower stations in the hlt basin fig 2 the hlt hydropower station with a total storage capacity of 1 1625 billion cubic meters was completed in 1976 and located about 3 km upstream of the hlt hydrological station the pk hydropower station with a total storage capacity of 2 3432 billion cubic meters was completed in 2011 and located about 106 8 km upstream of the hlt reservoir the ep and lbw hydropower station was completed in 2010 and 2014 their total storage capacity is 0 825 and 0 296 billion cubic meters respectively the zxh and sll are the smallest two hydropower stations with a total storage capacity of 0 02348 and 0 058 billion cubic meters which were completed in 1970 and 2005 respectively the total storage capacity of the two largest power stations hlt and pk accounted for 63 5 of the annual average runoff in the duhe river basin sun et al 2016 the runoff regulation of these power stations can influence the flood volume which usually leads to a decrease in the observation flow of the downstream hydrological station above mentioned six reservoirs information are listed in table 2 ri values in different years are calculated and the evolution of ri over the historical period was provided in fig s1 in the supplementary it is observed that there is a visible reservoir impact on the alteration of the flood regime the data includes observed annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv of the hlt hydrological station area average observed monthly precipitation and area average projected precipitation of the hlt basin the am15fv series covers the period from 1956 to 2014 and the observed area averaged precipitation in twelve different months is from 1956 to 2014 the future pp data is from twenty eight gcms the resolution and detail information of the gcms are listed in table 3 the area average observed precipitation in hlt basin is calculated by thiessen polygon method and the area averaged pp is calculated by weight averaging the pp at model grid points for each gcm model 4 results 4 1 selection of the optimal nonstationary hfa models the occurrence number of the am15fv event in different months from 1956 to 2014 is counted as been seen in fig 3 that the am15fv event mainly occurred from april to october and didn t occur in january february and december the number of am15fv events that occurred from april to october is 57 which accounts for about 96 7 percent of the 59 total occurrences fig 4 gives a time series diagram of the am15fv series the am15fv series shows a decreasing trend the man kendell test indicates that the am15fv series exhibits a significantly decreasing trend at 0 05 significant level also the kendall correlation coefficient metric is employed to analyze the relationship between the cumulative precipitation from april to october and the am15fv series the result shows that there is a strong correlation between such cumulative precipitation and the am15fv with a correlation coefficient of 0 77 finally the cumulative precipitation from april to october is chosen as a covariate factor in the nonstationary hfa models the performances of the twenty six nonstationary hfa models are assessed in terms of the aic and bic metrics in which the parameters of each nonstationary hfa model are estimated by its maximum posterior estimation provided by the bayesian method it can be seen from table 4 that the pe3m12 model is optimal for fitting the nonstationary am15fv series because its aic and bic value is obviously smallest among the twenty six models thus the pe3m12 model is selected to analyze the distribution evolution of the am15fv fig 5 presents the posterior distribution and maximum posterior estimation of parameters in the pe3m12 model in terms of maximum posterior estimation of coefficient of each variable the coefficient of ri variable μ 1 is less than zero μ 1 6 1742 and the coefficient of precipitation variable μ 2 is greater than zero μ 2 0 0341 there is a negative correlation between ri and model location parameter which means that the reservoirs construction has influenced the flow regime and lead to a reduction in flow over time there is a positive correlation between precipitation and model location parameter which implies that flood will increase if precipitation increase the pe3m12 model is employed to calculate the quantiles of the am15fv with the exceedance probabilities of 0 01 0 02 0 05 and 0 1 in each year of the period from 1956 to 2014 as can be seen from fig 6 that for a given exceedances probability the corresponding quantiles of the am15fv vary with time and exhibit a decreasing trend through time which coincides with the decreasing trend of the am15fv series itself this implies that flood risk decreases over the historical observed period 4 2 correction of projected precipitation to assess the performance of the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method for correcting the pp from gcms the retrospect projected cumulative precipitation from april to october covering the period from 1956 to 2014 provided by the twenty eight gcms are used the performance of the ecdf method is quantified by using the metric of root mean square error rmse it can be found from fig 7 that for all gcm models the rmse values of the corrected precipitation are significantly smaller than those of the gcm original precipitation the results indicate that the original precipitation provided by the twenty eight different gcms can be improved by using the ecdf method 4 3 estimation of design flood volume 4 3 1 design value estimation considering parameter uncertainty the posterior distribution of each parameter in the pe3m12 model is obtained by using the bayesian method the mcmc sampler is employed to sample 1000 groups of parameters from their corresponding posterior distribution then the 1000 estimations of the design am15fv related to four different return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 year and seven different design lifespans of 20 2015 2034 30 2015 2044 40 2015 2054 50 2015 2064 60 2015 2074 70 2015 2084 and 80 years 2015 2094 are calculated by using the scheme mentioned in section 2 4 1 the projected cumulative precipitation from april to october used in the pe3m12 model is the average of the corresponding twenty eight gcms correction precipitation the ri value in future years is assumed to be equal to that in 2014 the distribution of the estimations of 50 and 100 year design am15fv related to the design lifespan of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario are shown as boxplot in fig 8 the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s2 the spread of each boxplot confirms the considerable uncertainty in the estimation of design am15fv it can be observed that mp uncertainty produces a considerable impact on the design am15fv estimation for a given return period and a given design lifespan the median estimation and uncertainty of the design am15fv under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario are not visibly different 4 3 2 design value estimation considering projected precipitation uncertainty based on the twenty eight gcms corrected pp under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario the twenty eight estimations of the design am15fv related to the return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 year and the design lifespans of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years are calculated by using the scheme mentioned in section 2 4 2 the parameters in the pe3m12 model is the maximum posterior estimation of each parameter provided by the bayesian method fig 9 gives the boxplot of the estimations of the design am15fv corresponding to return periods of 50 and 100 year and different design lifespans from 20 to 80 years with the consideration of pp uncertainty the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s3 it is found that the am15fv estimations under different scenarios are different in terms of median estimation and its uncertainty for example the median estimation of am15fv under rcp2 6 scenario are the biggest while such estimation under rcp8 5 scenario are the smallest under the design lifespan length from 20 to 50 years however under the 70 years design lifespan length the median estimation of am15fv under rcp8 5 are the largest among the three scenarios in most cases the uncertainty of the am15fv estimation under the rc8 5 scenario is greater than those under the other two scenarios 4 3 3 design value estimation jointly considering two uncertainties according to the ensemble strategy mentioned in section 2 4 3 combining 1000 sets of mp with the twenty eight gcms future pp 28 000 estimations of the design am15fv are calculated related to a given return period and design lifespan under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario separately fig 10 gives the boxplot of the estimations of 50 and 100 year design am15fv for the design lifespan of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s4 it is found that the am15fv design value owns significant uncertainty but there is no visible difference in terms of the median estimation and uncertainty under the three different scenarios this implies that the uncertainty of the am15fv design value is mainly caused by mp uncertainty 4 3 4 comparison of the two uncertainties impact on design value estimation to investigate which one between mp and pp uncertainty is dominated in the total uncertainty on the am15fv design value estimation the 90 confidence interval estimation of the design am15fv corresponding to return periods of 50 and 100 year and different design lifespans from 20 to 80 years with the consideration of mp uncertainty future pp uncertainty and both of them are shown in fig 11 the results for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s5 it can be found that for different return periods under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario the mp uncertainty caused interval width is larger than those caused by pp uncertainty which implies that the mp uncertainty impact on design value is greater than that results from pp uncertainty moreover the mp uncertainty caused interval width including upper and lower boundary is very close to those caused by the joint impacts of mp and pp uncertainty this indicates that the mp uncertainty has a dominant influence on the am15fv design value uncertainty 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we proposed a framework for assessing the uncertainty of nonstationary design flood estimation in light of model parameters mp and gcms projected precipitation pp uncertainty a case study based on a nonstationary annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv series is used to demonstrate this proposed framework moreover the contribution of mp caused uncertainty and pp caused uncertainty to the total uncertainty caused by both of them on the am15fv design value estimation is investigated to describe the temporal evolution of the distribution characteristic of the nonstationary am15fv twenty six nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis hfa models are developed and the aic and bic metrics are used to select the optimal one then the change characteristic of the am15fv quantiles is analyzed based on the optimal model results show that the am15fv quantiles related to a specified exceedances probability exhibit a decreasing trend through time the pp from twenty eight gcms under the rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario is used in this study the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method is applied to correct gcms pp results show that the original pp can be improved by using the ecdf method the framework composed of bayesian theory and poor man ensemble strategy is proposed to quantify the design flood estimation uncertainty in lights of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them in terms of median and uncertainty of design value estimations results based on the nonstationary am15fv show that there is no visibly different in the design am15fv with the consideration of mp uncertainty under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario however the am15fv estimations with the consideration of pp uncertainty are different under the three different scenarios in most cases the median of the am15fv estimation under the rc8 5 scenario is smaller and its uncertainty is greater than those under the other two scenarios compared to pp uncertainty the mp uncertainty impact on the am15fv design value uncertainty is dominated in our case study the pe3m12 model with its location parameter varying through precipitation and reservoir index and its scale parameter changing with precipitation is employed to predict the distribution evolution of am15fv it is noted that using the time factor to force the mp change is not an ideal way because the trend detected in the fitting period may not necessarily continue into the future period this is also emphasized in previous studies luke et al 2017 schlef et al 2018 françois et al 2019 the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes is usually affected by a combination of factors such as climate change and human activities therefore to develop a nonstationary hfa model that can take into account climate information and human activities impact on hydrological extreme is necessary and promising related to the nonstationary hfa model construction it is extremely important to consider the predictive capability of the model because the distribution function used for estimating the design flood under nonstationarity are those in the next few decades or even hundreds of years this is reflected in various nonstationary design flood calculation methods such as the expected waiting time method cooley 2013 expected occurrence number method parey et al 2010 design life level rootzen and katz 2013 average design life level read and vogel 2015 and equivalent reliability hu et al 2018 thus the covariates forcing the mp change must be predictable otherwise the distribution function under future conditions cannot be predicted meanwhile the predicted covariate must be of reliable accuracy otherwise the predicted distribution function may be meaningless it also needs to consider the robustness of the model it is not that the more complex the model the better the predictive capability of the model although the more complex model can match the series well the robustness of the model prediction may be reduced and greater uncertainty may be introduced it should be acknowledged that it is something to fit model parameters against historical events and it is another thing to build a model able to predict unknown future distribution in our case study pp uncertainty impact on the design am15fv estimation is assessed as only precipitation factor among the climate variables is used to model the distribution parameters in nonstationary hfa models however the uncertainty analysis framework can be extended to quantify the uncertainty results from other climate covariates such as temperature by implementing a similar strategy also we do not consider the impact of the selection of nonstationary hfa model on design flood estimation uncertainty in this study all these we plan to investigate further credit authorship contribution statement yiming hu conceptualization methodology visualization formal analysis writing original draft writing review

frequency analysis hfa has been a commonly used approach for design flood estimation under nonstationary conditions which underlies deep uncertainty most of the previous studies focus on the influence of model parameter mp uncertainty on design flood little is known about quantitative assessment on the commonly used precipitation projection pp uncertainty impact on it to address this concern this

introduction hydrological frequency analysis hfa is a vital tool to estimate the design flood with a given design standard which is extremely important for hydraulic engineering construct and water resources management compared with the commonly used stationary hfa the nonstationary hfa has been paid more attention in recent years because the nonstationarity of extreme hydrological series has been observed in many regions around the world strupczewski et al 2001 katz et al 2002 khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 cooley 2013 rootzen and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 salas and obeysekera 2013 xiong et al 2015 hu et al 2018 liang et al 2018 in theory the stationary hfa is no longer applicable for inferring the design flood under nonstationarity milly et al 2008 lopez and frances 2013 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2017 related to the design flood calculation under nonstationarity the approaches can be roughly divided into two categories hydrological simulation based and flow hfa based approaches françois et al 2019 ammar et al 2020 lan et al 2020 the hydrological simulation based approaches include 1 to convert the design precipitation with a specified design standard or probable maximum precipitation into the design flood by using the runoff generation and flow routing methods lan et al 2020 2 to simulate the flow series by forcing the hydrological model with the input of gcm projection precipitation temperature etc then to analyze the flood frequency based on the simulated flow series camici et al 2014 ammar et al 2020 the flow hfa based approaches are to directly use the hfa for inferring the design flood based on the flow series xie et al 2005 rootzen and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2016 liang et al 2018 over the past few years a larger body of researches focused on the latter and many typical approaches have been proposed such as sample reconstruction based approaches mixture distribution based approaches and parameter varying distribution based approaches khaliq et al 2006 hu et al 2018 françois et al 2019 the sample reconstruction based approaches aim to reconstruct the nonstationary extreme flood series to ensure the reconstructed series meet the requirements of stationarity and then the stationary hfa method is used to calculate the design flood xie et al 2005 gado and nguyen 2016 hu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 liang et al 2018 for example xie et al 2005 developed a sample decomposition composition based approach for nonstationary hfa the approach decomposes the extreme flood into a nonstationary deterministic component and a stationary random component the deterministic component in any given future year is predicted using a model then it is synthesized with the random component to reconstruct a stationary flood series liang et al 2018 made use of a modified reservoir index as a scalar factor to reconstruct the reservoir influenced nonstationary annual maximum flow series to make it stationary thus ensure the feasibility of the stationary hfa approach in the mixture distribution based approaches the whole extreme flood series is firstly divided into several sub series to ensure that each sub series is stationary secondly to weighted synthesize the distribution corresponding to each subsample series finally a comprehensive mixture distribution is derived to infer the design flood with a given return period alila and mtiraoui 2002 singh et al 2005 yan et al 2017 for example alila and mtiraoui 2002 proposed to employ the mixture distribution model composed of a mixture of two or more populations for flood frequency analysis with the consideration that floods were often generated by heterogeneous distributions their analysis results based on the long term hydro climatic records from ten stations in the gila river in the usa indicated that the mixture distribution was more appropriate besides based on the assumption that the extreme flood series in the same season obeys the same distribution and in different seasons the distributions are different and independent of each other singh et al 2005 derived the frequency distribution for the annual maximum flood flow by using the probability multiplication theorem the parameter varying distribution based approaches have been commonly used to describe the distribution of a non stationary extreme flood series in which one or more of the distribution parameters are modelled as a function of time or other factors such as precipitation temperature and population growth strupczewski et al 2001 vogel et al 2011 gilroy and mccuen 2012 lopez and frances 2013 liu et al 2014 li and tan 2015 condon et al 2015 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 condon et al 2015 employed a nonstationary generalized extreme value model in which the location and scale parameters were simulated as a function of monthly precipitation totals and average temperature to fit the frequency distribution of cool season november april monthly maximum flows in their research the projections of precipitation and temperature from the gcms were used to infer the future distributions of the monthly maximum flows hu et al 2019 applied a nonstationary person type three pe3 distribution model to assess the change of annual precipitation at the level of the quantile in their research the location and scale parameters of the pe3 distribution were modelled as a linear function of time it should be emphasized that in the parameter varying distribution based approaches the distribution varies over time and is not the same with each other in different years which results in the design flood with a given annual exceedance probability being different in different years cooley 2013 hu et al 2018 the question now arises that the relationship between the return period and corresponding design flood is not unique which leads to difficulties in engineering practice to deal with the above issue several typical approaches have been proposed such as expected waiting time until a given exceedance event occurs ewt olsen et al 1998 cooley 2013 yan et al 2020 expected occurrence number of the given event over the return period enerp parey et al 2010 design life level dll rootzen and katz 2013 average design life level adll read and vogel 2015 expected occurrence number of the given event over the engineering design life enedl obeysekera and salas 2016 and equivalent reliability method er liang et al 2016 hu et al 2018 yan et al 2017 investigated and compared the performance of four nonstationary design approaches including enepr dll er and adll they recommended both er and adll approaches to be applied in practice because the two methods associate design floods with the design life period of projects and yield reasonable design quantiles and confidence intervals especially recommended the er method because it can bridge the gap between stationary and nonstationary design criteria besides given that the univariate hfa based design flood cannot fully present design flood characteristic because a complete flood event usually contains multiple flood features e g flood peaks and flood volume the study on nonstationary multivariate hfa based on parameter varying copulas allowing for the nonstationarity of the marginal distribution of each flood variable and the dependence structure is attracting more and more attention bender et al 2014 kwon and lall 2016 bracken et al 2018 hu et al 2022 this study is limited to the nonstationary univariate hfa therefore the nonstationary multivariate hfa will not be discussed too much here compared to the sample reconstruction based approaches and mixture distribution based approaches the parameter varying distribution based approaches received more attention and has been widely studied because it has the advantage to predict the future distribution of the extreme variable in any future year e g rootzen and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2014 read and vogel 2015 hu et al 2018 however it should be noted that the predicted distribution in the future time is influenced by more sources of uncertainties compared to the stationary hfa this leads to deep uncertainty in the design flood estimation under changing environments serinaldi and kilsby 2015 in stationary hfa the uncertainty on estimation of design flood generally results from the uncertainty of sample representation hu et al 2015 parameter estimation renard 2011 and frequency distribution function selection bobo and unny 1976 liang et al 2012 however under nonstationary conditions the uncertainty on design flood estimation results from not only the three factors same with the stationary hfa but also the uncertainty on climate variable projection used as a factor to simulate the model parameter change in the parameter varying distribution model the projection data of climatic variables from the gcms are widely used gilroy and mccuen 2012 yan et al 2017 however the projection data provided by different gcm models have different precision and are of high uncertainty which inevitably produces an impact on design value estimation a great deal of effort has been made on uncertainty analysis of design flood estimation under nonstationary conditions cheng et al 2014 obeysekera and salas 2014 sun et al 2015 hu et al 2017 bracken et al 2018 d oria et al 2018 for instance obeysekera and salas 2014 employed three methods including delta bootstrap and profile likelihood methods to investigate the impact of the limited observations sample size on the uncertainty of the design flood under a nonstationary framework their research results show that the delta and the bootstrap method can be computationally efficient and the profile likelihood method is quite burdensome computationally but provides more realistic asymmetric confidence intervals hu et al 2017 used the bayesian method to analyze the impact of model parameter mp uncertainty on the ewt and ene based estimation of design peak flow under nonstationary conditions they found that mp uncertainty significantly affects the design flood uncertainty and the ewt based estimation is different from the ene based estimation in light of mp uncertainty however to sum up the studies on design flood estimation uncertainty in the parameter varying distribution based approaches mainly focus on considering the impact of mp uncertainty and limited sample size on it little is known about quantitative assessment on the precipitation projections pp uncertainty impact on design flood when the precipitation factor is used to model the temporal evolution of the distribution parameters to address this concern this study attempts to put forward a framework to analyze the design flood uncertainty in light of mp uncertainty and pp uncertainty this objective is threefold 1 to correct the pp data from gcms to improve its quality and then establish different parameter varying distribution models for a nonstationary series 2 to analyze the impact of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them on the design flood estimation 3 to investigate which one between mp and pp uncertainty is dominated in the total uncertainty on design flood estimation finally a case study based on the nonstationary annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv series of huanglongtan stations located in the duhe basin in china is applied to illustrate this proposed approach 2 method methodologies for estimating the design flood and quantifying such estimation uncertainty under nonstationarity are described here including the twenty six nonstationary hfa models for describing the distribution of a nonstationary series the equidistant cumulative distribution function method for correcting the twenty eight gcms pp the equivalent reliability method for estimating the design flood under nonstationarity the framework composed of bayesian theory and poor man ensemble strategy for analyzing the design flood estimation uncertainty in the lights of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them following the description aforementioned the main components are summarized in fig 1 2 1 nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis models to describe the distribution characteristic of a nonstationary extreme variable the nonstationary hfa models with its parameters modelled as a function of time or other factors have been commonly used e g strupczewski et al 2001 lopez and frances 2013 cheng et al 2014 lima et al 2015 hu et al 2019 in this study twenty six nonstationary hfa models based on the pearson type three pe3 and generalized extreme value gev distribution are developed to analyze the evolution characteristics of the distribution of the annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv the akaike s information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic metrics hu et al 2017 are used to assess the performance of different models the nonstationary pe3 probability distribution can be expressed by e g hu et al 2017 1 f x μ t β t γ t β t γ t γ γ t x μ t γ t 1 e β t x μ t where μ t 0 β t 0 and γ t 0 are the location scale and shape parameters of pe3 distribution in time t γ γ t is a gamma function the nonstationary gev distribution can be expressed by e g cooley 2013 2 f x α t σ t δ t exp 1 δ t x α t σ t 1 δ t 1 δ t x α t σ t 0 where α t σ t and δ t are the location scale and shape parameters of gev distribution in time t in the nonstationary pe3 and nonstationary gev distribution models the parameters are modelled as a function of precipitation p or reservoir index ri or both of them ri value is calculated by the method proposed by lopez and frances 2013 then the twenty six nonstationary hfa models are developed which are listed in table 1 ri value is calculated by lopez and frances 2013 3 ri i 1 n a i a t c i c t where n is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station ci is the total capacity of each reservoir and ct is the mean annual runoff at the gauge station 2 2 equidistant cumulative distribution function method to evaluate the future changes in the distribution of an extreme variable the projected precipitation pp datasets from the gcms are used because the precipitation factor is used in several nonstationary hfa models the pp from twenty eight gcms under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario is used table 2 due to the pp data provided by different gcms have different precision the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method li et al 2010 is applied to correct them this method can incorporate both the gcm climatological mean and variance by taking into account the changes of climate fields in the future period watanabe et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the method can be written as 4 x f u t c o r x f u t g c m f b a s o b s 1 f f u t g c m x f u t g c m f b a s g c m 1 f f u t g c m x f u t g c m where x f u t g c m is the precipitation provided series by gcm for the future period fut x f u t c o r is the corrected gcm series f b a s o b s 1 is the quantile function of the observations obs in the baseline period bas f b a s g c m 1 is the quantile function of gcm data in the baseline period bas f f u t g c m is the cdf of the gcm series in the future projection period a two parameter gamma distribution is used for matching the cumulative distribution function of a given precipitation series 5 f x α β β α γ α x α 1 e β x x 0 where α and β is the location and scale parameter 2 3 equivalent reliability method to estimate the design flood under nonstationarity the equivalent reliability er method is employed liang et al 2016 yan et al 2017a hu et al 2018 under stationarity for a project with the l year design lifespan from t1 to t2 year and t year design return period the corresponding hydrological design reliability r s that the probability of the design flood x t s will not be exceeded is calculated by 6 r s i t 1 t 2 1 1 t 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 the t years design return period can be defined as the expected waiting time until the next exceedance is t year or the expected occurrences number of events in t years is equal to one cooley 2013 under nonstationarity the hydrological design reliability r ns that the probability of no flood exceeding the design flood x t ns is calculated by hu et al 2018 7 r ns t t 1 t 2 f t x t ns θ t where f t θ t t t 1 t 1 1 t 2 is the nonstationary frequency analysis model given the parameters θ t in year t according to the er method yan et al 2017a hu et al 2018 the design reliability r ns under nonstationarity should be equal to r s under stationarity i e 8 t t 1 t 2 f i x t ns θ t 1 1 t t 2 t 1 1 the design flood x t ns under nonstationarity can be obtained by solving eq 8 it should be emphasized that the design flood x t ns and x t s are not the same but the design reliability r ns corresponding to x t ns and r s related to x t s are equal 2 4 uncertainty analysis of the design flood estimation 2 4 1 parameter uncertainty consideration to analyze the impact of mp uncertainty on the er based estimations of design flood the bayesian method is employed the posterior distribution f θ x of parameters θ conditional observation x can be expressed by cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2017 9 f θ x f x θ π θ f x f x θ π θ f x θ π θ d θ where θ is parameter set such as for the model 1 listed in table 1 θ μ 0 μ 1 β 0 γ 0 π θ is the prior distribution of all parameters in the set θ before any data is observed which are described by using a normal distribution separately f x θ is the likelihood of quantifying the information brought by the observed data x the differential evolution markov chain approach is used to generate n groups of samples from the posterior distribution of each parameter cheng et al 2014 the convergence test criterion r gelman and shirley 2011 is used to check if the sampling approach is converged based on the generated n groups of parameter samples combined with the er method the n corresponding estimations of the design flood x t ns with a given design standard are calculated which can be used to estimate the distribution of estimations of x t ns and to quantify its uncertainty in the nonstationary hfa models with one or more parameters simulated as a function of precipitation variable the average of the corrected pp series corresponding to the twenty eight gcms table 3 is used 2 4 2 precipitation projection uncertainty consideration while using precipitation factor as a covariate to model the future change of mp in nonstationary hfa models such as pe3m6 it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of the future pp impact on the design flood estimation because the pp from gcms subjects to bias and uncertainty even after correction based on the pe3m6 model the procedures for analyzing the pp uncertainty impact on the design flood are followings in the pe3m6 model the location parameter μ of the pe3 distribution is modelled as a function of precipitation while the other two parameters are constant i e 10 μ t exp μ 0 μ 1 p β t exp β 0 γ t exp γ 0 the exp form is used to model the relationship between model parameters and covariates to ensure the three parameters are great than zero which are required in the pe3 distribution the parameters are estimated by using the maximum posterior estimation of each parameter provided by the bayesian method mentioned in sec 2 4 1 based on each one of the twenty eight corrected pp series provided by the twenty eight gcms one corresponding estimation of the design flood x t ns with a given design standard is calculated by the er method thus twenty eight estimations of x t ns can be obtained then the impact of pp uncertainty on the design flood x t ns can be assessed by using the distribution calibrated by its twenty eight estimations for the other nonstationary hfa models in which one or more parameters is driven by precipitation factor similar strategies can be used for assessing the future pp impact on the design flood estimation uncertainty 2 4 3 consideration of parameter and precipitation projection uncertainties to evaluate the joint impact of the mp and pp uncertainty on the design flood estimation the poor man s ensemble strategy is used the poor man s ensemble strategy has been commonly used to create a useful probability forecasting system in the field of numerical weather prediction nwp by comprising a set of nwp model forecasts from several operational centres which can be used to assess the uncertainty of prediction results ebert 2001 arribas et al 2005 in this study the ensemble strategy is used to assess the mp and pp uncertainty impacts on the design flood by comprising different mp and different pp input based on the pe3m6 model the procedures for analyzing the joint impact of both mp and future pp uncertainty on the design flood are followings similar strategies can be used for the other nonstationary hfa models 1 to calculate the engineering design reliability r s for given design return period t and design lifespan from t1 to t2 year by using eq 5 2 given one of the n groups of parameters and one of the m corrected pp series from year t1 to t2 one corresponding er based estimation of the design flood x t ns can be obtained using eq 7 3 to repeat step 2 given n groups of mp and m corrected future pp series the n m corresponding estimations of the design flood x t ns can be obtained 4 based on the n m estimations of the design flood its empirical distribution can be estimated and some key eigenvalues such as median and interval estimation can be derived thus the joint impact of mp and pp uncertainty on the uncertainty of the design flood estimation can be assessed 3 study area and data the data used in this study is covering the huanglongtan hlt basin with the hydrological control station of hlt hlt basin is located in the lower reaches of the duhe river basin and the duhe river is an important tributary of the danjiangkou reservoir in china hlt basin area is about 10 995 km2 which accounts for 88 of the total area of duhe basin sun et al 2016 there are hlt pankou pk eping ep songhuling sll longbeiwan lbw and zhuxihe zxh hydropower stations in the hlt basin fig 2 the hlt hydropower station with a total storage capacity of 1 1625 billion cubic meters was completed in 1976 and located about 3 km upstream of the hlt hydrological station the pk hydropower station with a total storage capacity of 2 3432 billion cubic meters was completed in 2011 and located about 106 8 km upstream of the hlt reservoir the ep and lbw hydropower station was completed in 2010 and 2014 their total storage capacity is 0 825 and 0 296 billion cubic meters respectively the zxh and sll are the smallest two hydropower stations with a total storage capacity of 0 02348 and 0 058 billion cubic meters which were completed in 1970 and 2005 respectively the total storage capacity of the two largest power stations hlt and pk accounted for 63 5 of the annual average runoff in the duhe river basin sun et al 2016 the runoff regulation of these power stations can influence the flood volume which usually leads to a decrease in the observation flow of the downstream hydrological station above mentioned six reservoirs information are listed in table 2 ri values in different years are calculated and the evolution of ri over the historical period was provided in fig s1 in the supplementary it is observed that there is a visible reservoir impact on the alteration of the flood regime the data includes observed annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv of the hlt hydrological station area average observed monthly precipitation and area average projected precipitation of the hlt basin the am15fv series covers the period from 1956 to 2014 and the observed area averaged precipitation in twelve different months is from 1956 to 2014 the future pp data is from twenty eight gcms the resolution and detail information of the gcms are listed in table 3 the area average observed precipitation in hlt basin is calculated by thiessen polygon method and the area averaged pp is calculated by weight averaging the pp at model grid points for each gcm model 4 results 4 1 selection of the optimal nonstationary hfa models the occurrence number of the am15fv event in different months from 1956 to 2014 is counted as been seen in fig 3 that the am15fv event mainly occurred from april to october and didn t occur in january february and december the number of am15fv events that occurred from april to october is 57 which accounts for about 96 7 percent of the 59 total occurrences fig 4 gives a time series diagram of the am15fv series the am15fv series shows a decreasing trend the man kendell test indicates that the am15fv series exhibits a significantly decreasing trend at 0 05 significant level also the kendall correlation coefficient metric is employed to analyze the relationship between the cumulative precipitation from april to october and the am15fv series the result shows that there is a strong correlation between such cumulative precipitation and the am15fv with a correlation coefficient of 0 77 finally the cumulative precipitation from april to october is chosen as a covariate factor in the nonstationary hfa models the performances of the twenty six nonstationary hfa models are assessed in terms of the aic and bic metrics in which the parameters of each nonstationary hfa model are estimated by its maximum posterior estimation provided by the bayesian method it can be seen from table 4 that the pe3m12 model is optimal for fitting the nonstationary am15fv series because its aic and bic value is obviously smallest among the twenty six models thus the pe3m12 model is selected to analyze the distribution evolution of the am15fv fig 5 presents the posterior distribution and maximum posterior estimation of parameters in the pe3m12 model in terms of maximum posterior estimation of coefficient of each variable the coefficient of ri variable μ 1 is less than zero μ 1 6 1742 and the coefficient of precipitation variable μ 2 is greater than zero μ 2 0 0341 there is a negative correlation between ri and model location parameter which means that the reservoirs construction has influenced the flow regime and lead to a reduction in flow over time there is a positive correlation between precipitation and model location parameter which implies that flood will increase if precipitation increase the pe3m12 model is employed to calculate the quantiles of the am15fv with the exceedance probabilities of 0 01 0 02 0 05 and 0 1 in each year of the period from 1956 to 2014 as can be seen from fig 6 that for a given exceedances probability the corresponding quantiles of the am15fv vary with time and exhibit a decreasing trend through time which coincides with the decreasing trend of the am15fv series itself this implies that flood risk decreases over the historical observed period 4 2 correction of projected precipitation to assess the performance of the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method for correcting the pp from gcms the retrospect projected cumulative precipitation from april to october covering the period from 1956 to 2014 provided by the twenty eight gcms are used the performance of the ecdf method is quantified by using the metric of root mean square error rmse it can be found from fig 7 that for all gcm models the rmse values of the corrected precipitation are significantly smaller than those of the gcm original precipitation the results indicate that the original precipitation provided by the twenty eight different gcms can be improved by using the ecdf method 4 3 estimation of design flood volume 4 3 1 design value estimation considering parameter uncertainty the posterior distribution of each parameter in the pe3m12 model is obtained by using the bayesian method the mcmc sampler is employed to sample 1000 groups of parameters from their corresponding posterior distribution then the 1000 estimations of the design am15fv related to four different return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 year and seven different design lifespans of 20 2015 2034 30 2015 2044 40 2015 2054 50 2015 2064 60 2015 2074 70 2015 2084 and 80 years 2015 2094 are calculated by using the scheme mentioned in section 2 4 1 the projected cumulative precipitation from april to october used in the pe3m12 model is the average of the corresponding twenty eight gcms correction precipitation the ri value in future years is assumed to be equal to that in 2014 the distribution of the estimations of 50 and 100 year design am15fv related to the design lifespan of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario are shown as boxplot in fig 8 the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s2 the spread of each boxplot confirms the considerable uncertainty in the estimation of design am15fv it can be observed that mp uncertainty produces a considerable impact on the design am15fv estimation for a given return period and a given design lifespan the median estimation and uncertainty of the design am15fv under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario are not visibly different 4 3 2 design value estimation considering projected precipitation uncertainty based on the twenty eight gcms corrected pp under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario the twenty eight estimations of the design am15fv related to the return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 year and the design lifespans of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years are calculated by using the scheme mentioned in section 2 4 2 the parameters in the pe3m12 model is the maximum posterior estimation of each parameter provided by the bayesian method fig 9 gives the boxplot of the estimations of the design am15fv corresponding to return periods of 50 and 100 year and different design lifespans from 20 to 80 years with the consideration of pp uncertainty the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s3 it is found that the am15fv estimations under different scenarios are different in terms of median estimation and its uncertainty for example the median estimation of am15fv under rcp2 6 scenario are the biggest while such estimation under rcp8 5 scenario are the smallest under the design lifespan length from 20 to 50 years however under the 70 years design lifespan length the median estimation of am15fv under rcp8 5 are the largest among the three scenarios in most cases the uncertainty of the am15fv estimation under the rc8 5 scenario is greater than those under the other two scenarios 4 3 3 design value estimation jointly considering two uncertainties according to the ensemble strategy mentioned in section 2 4 3 combining 1000 sets of mp with the twenty eight gcms future pp 28 000 estimations of the design am15fv are calculated related to a given return period and design lifespan under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario separately fig 10 gives the boxplot of the estimations of 50 and 100 year design am15fv for the design lifespan of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 years under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario the boxplots for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s4 it is found that the am15fv design value owns significant uncertainty but there is no visible difference in terms of the median estimation and uncertainty under the three different scenarios this implies that the uncertainty of the am15fv design value is mainly caused by mp uncertainty 4 3 4 comparison of the two uncertainties impact on design value estimation to investigate which one between mp and pp uncertainty is dominated in the total uncertainty on the am15fv design value estimation the 90 confidence interval estimation of the design am15fv corresponding to return periods of 50 and 100 year and different design lifespans from 20 to 80 years with the consideration of mp uncertainty future pp uncertainty and both of them are shown in fig 11 the results for the 10 and 20 year design am15fv are provided in fig s5 it can be found that for different return periods under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario the mp uncertainty caused interval width is larger than those caused by pp uncertainty which implies that the mp uncertainty impact on design value is greater than that results from pp uncertainty moreover the mp uncertainty caused interval width including upper and lower boundary is very close to those caused by the joint impacts of mp and pp uncertainty this indicates that the mp uncertainty has a dominant influence on the am15fv design value uncertainty 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we proposed a framework for assessing the uncertainty of nonstationary design flood estimation in light of model parameters mp and gcms projected precipitation pp uncertainty a case study based on a nonstationary annual maximum 15 day flood volume am15fv series is used to demonstrate this proposed framework moreover the contribution of mp caused uncertainty and pp caused uncertainty to the total uncertainty caused by both of them on the am15fv design value estimation is investigated to describe the temporal evolution of the distribution characteristic of the nonstationary am15fv twenty six nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis hfa models are developed and the aic and bic metrics are used to select the optimal one then the change characteristic of the am15fv quantiles is analyzed based on the optimal model results show that the am15fv quantiles related to a specified exceedances probability exhibit a decreasing trend through time the pp from twenty eight gcms under the rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario is used in this study the equidistant cumulative distribution function ecdf method is applied to correct gcms pp results show that the original pp can be improved by using the ecdf method the framework composed of bayesian theory and poor man ensemble strategy is proposed to quantify the design flood estimation uncertainty in lights of mp uncertainty pp uncertainty and both of them in terms of median and uncertainty of design value estimations results based on the nonstationary am15fv show that there is no visibly different in the design am15fv with the consideration of mp uncertainty under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario however the am15fv estimations with the consideration of pp uncertainty are different under the three different scenarios in most cases the median of the am15fv estimation under the rc8 5 scenario is smaller and its uncertainty is greater than those under the other two scenarios compared to pp uncertainty the mp uncertainty impact on the am15fv design value uncertainty is dominated in our case study the pe3m12 model with its location parameter varying through precipitation and reservoir index and its scale parameter changing with precipitation is employed to predict the distribution evolution of am15fv it is noted that using the time factor to force the mp change is not an ideal way because the trend detected in the fitting period may not necessarily continue into the future period this is also emphasized in previous studies luke et al 2017 schlef et al 2018 françois et al 2019 the nonstationarity of hydrological extremes is usually affected by a combination of factors such as climate change and human activities therefore to develop a nonstationary hfa model that can take into account climate information and human activities impact on hydrological extreme is necessary and promising related to the nonstationary hfa model construction it is extremely important to consider the predictive capability of the model because the distribution function used for estimating the design flood under nonstationarity are those in the next few decades or even hundreds of years this is reflected in various nonstationary design flood calculation methods such as the expected waiting time method cooley 2013 expected occurrence number method parey et al 2010 design life level rootzen and katz 2013 average design life level read and vogel 2015 and equivalent reliability hu et al 2018 thus the covariates forcing the mp change must be predictable otherwise the distribution function under future conditions cannot be predicted meanwhile the predicted covariate must be of reliable accuracy otherwise the predicted distribution function may be meaningless it also needs to consider the robustness of the model it is not that the more complex the model the better the predictive capability of the model although the more complex model can match the series well the robustness of the model prediction may be reduced and greater uncertainty may be introduced it should be acknowledged that it is something to fit model parameters against historical events and it is another thing to build a model able to predict unknown future distribution in our case study pp uncertainty impact on the design am15fv estimation is assessed as only precipitation factor among the climate variables is used to model the distribution parameters in nonstationary hfa models however the uncertainty analysis framework can be extended to quantify the uncertainty results from other climate covariates such as temperature by implementing a similar strategy also we do not consider the impact of the selection of nonstationary hfa model on design flood estimation uncertainty in this

2327,a national survey identifies the extent and origin of nitrates in new zealand s freshwater resources using nitrogen δ15n and oxygen δ18o isotopes a comprehensive database with 1042 samples investigates freshwater type land use geology soil type and geographic effects on nitrate isotopes across new zealand nitrate contamination is the biggest threat to new zealand s drinking water resources with almost 60 of samples in the study having above baseline nitrate no3 n concentrations 0 9 mg l a threshold noted for higher colorectal cancer risk groundwater 2 89 mg l had higher median no3 n concentration than surface water 0 65 mg l traditional nitrate isotope biplots based on the haber bosch cycle which integrates synthetic fertilizers into the food chain are reinterpreted to place new zealand s unique farming nitrogen contributions from urea and ammonia into context the majority of new zealand s freshwater nitrate isotopes lie in a normal nitrogen retention nnr zone which also acts as a mixed urea urine fertilizer mixed uuf zone transitioning nitrified fertilizers and animal waste via redox reactions microbial action and or dissipation towards a denitrification zone nitrogen hot spots with strong urea urine input can be differentiated from natural n cycling in the nnr mixed uuf transition zone by a combined no3 n concentration and dual isotope approach to identify high risk sites keywords nitrate groundwater surface water stable isotopes new zealand contamination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate is the most pervasive groundwater contaminant posing a human health hazard in drinking water and leading to eutrophication causing hypoxia and algal blooms of water ways the two most prevalent water quality problems globally united nations 2014 oecd 2017 approximately 40 of long term groundwater monitoring sites in new zealand historically show above baseline 0 9 mg l nitrate n concentrations daughney and wall 2007 moreau et al 2016 with increasing urbanisation and agricultural production the ongoing balance between freshwater allocation and polluted water discharge is under threat degradation of new zealand s freshwater resources and declining health of waterways and ecosystems after years of unregulated discharge are now being addressed by more stringent policies and land management mbie 2020 which aim to halt reverse and improve declining water quality in new zealand nitrate loads in freshwater are routinely monitored in new zealand by regional authorities and other groups involved with discharge of contaminated water such as farmers mining organisations landfill authorities environmental researchers and consulting companies to investigate the long term evolution of nitrates in new zealand s water bodies yet until now these mostly local studies have not widely integrated nitrate isotopes to characterise nutrient sources and determine denitrification effects on a national scale regionally new zealand is agriculturally diverse with some areas being ideal for farming dairy sheep while others are used intensively for forestry horticulture and growing crops new zealand s nitrate balance the difference between n inputs to farming systems and n outputs has rapidly become more positive over the last few decades due to expansion and intensification of farming oecd 2019 leaching of nitrates into surface waters and penetration of nitrates into groundwater systems not only leaves an indelible trace of nitrate through measurable nitrate concentrations but also through stable isotope fingerprints which reflect the nitrate contamination source nitrate concentration no3 n characterises the level of nitrate contamination in a water body and is a primary indicator of water quality ballantine and davies colley 2014 new zealand s drinking water standards are set at a maximum acceptable value mav of 50 mg l for total nitrate ministry of health 2018 which corresponds to 11 3 mg l no3 n in line with world health organization guidelines who 2016 who 2017 current regulations maintain that if community supplied drinking water no3 n reaches half the permissible level 5 65 mg l additional monitoring must be undertaken given potential links to cancer and other health issues such as methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome which can cause depletion of oxygen in blood supply recent research has suggested an increased colon cancer risk from drinking water containing 0 97 mg l of no3 n and for colorectal cancer crc and rectal cancer from 1 9 mg l no3 n espejo herrera et al 2016 while schullehner et al 2018 published similar results that showed an increased crc risk in denmark for drinking waters above 0 87 mg l no3 n nitrate toxicity guidelines have also been set at a maximum median for no3 n of 6 9 mg l for freshwater aquatic systems such as rivers hickey and martin 2009 furthermore these thresholds suggest significant risks of nitrate toxicity to aquatic organisms in freshwater environments containing 1 0 mg l no3 n or more although the mechanisms of nitrate uptake in aquatic organisms are still not clearly understood in the last 10 years nitrate stable isotopes δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 and no3 n concentrations from a range of freshwater investigations across new zealand have been reported providing evidence of local freshwater contamination

2004 xue et al 2009 duta et al 2008 and identify which processes nitrification anammox mineralization and denitrification dominate systems nitrification is the biological oxidation of organic n ammonia or ammonium from urea to nitrite followed by further oxidation to nitrate by either ammonia oxidising bacteria aob or ammonia oxidising archaea aoa watson et al 1981 nitrosomonas is frequently the most common genus associated with aob eq 1 followed by further aoa oxidation eq 2 in this second step nitrobacter is the most frequently identified genus but others include nitrosococcus and nitrosospira different heterotrophic bacteria or fungi can also carry out nitrification 1 organic n nh4 o2 nh3 o2 h no2 4h 2e 2 no2 h2o no3 2h 2e anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation is an important microbial process which converts nitrite and ammonium ions directly into nitrogen gas and water rather than via oxidative steps winkler et al 2012 frequently seen in wastewater treatment ammonium undergoes partial nitrification to nitrite by ammonia oxidising bacteria aob eq 3 then the remaining ammonium and nitrite is directly converted using the anammox process to nitrogen gas eq 4 3 nh4 o2 no2 4h 2e 4 nh4 no2 n2 2h2o mineralization results in the production of ammonium nh4 from organic soil nitrogen eq 5 during mineralization soil microbes depolymerize organic matter which is rich in carbon and nitrogen fujii et al 2020 the decomposition process results in monomers which are then mineralized into inorganic compounds such as ammonium or assimilated by the microbes for their biosynthetic needs nitrogen mineralization depends on the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n ratio of the organic matter in general if the c n ratio is higher than 30 1 then there may be insufficient nitrogen available for mineralization and the decomposing microbes will absorb the nitrogen for their own biosynthesis when the c n ratio is 25 1 n mineralization results in a loss of ammonium to the environment under favourable conditions ammonium is further converted by micro organisms to inorganic nitrate 5 n org nh4 no3 denitrification is a multistep no3 n removal process via microbes which consume and assimilate diffuse no3 n sources followed by the stepwise reduction of the no3 n to n2 gas in the presence of carbon as an electron donor kendall and aravena 2000 eq 6 this fractionation process enriches the 15n of the water sample through preferential consumption removal and uptake of the biologically more available 14n by bacteria this step is twofold where both the residual nitrate 15n increases and the no3 n concentration decreases as denitrification progresses through several intermediary steps to the end product n2 gas isotope fractionation may be refreshed reset back to original values or interrupted through new contaminant pulses in the environment mobilisation or remobilisation of surface contaminants from irrigation or precipitation causes further contaminant infiltration into the vadose or phreatic zones mixing with residual contaminants that may be more or less denitrified in this instance transportation and anammox processes will also influence the fractionation processes 6 no3 no2 no g n2o g n2 g previous studies have shown that groundwater samples with elevated iron and ammonia n concentrations are generally reducing higher redox potential and likely to encourage microbial denitrification and loss of no3 n snow 2018 they also found surface water samples with elevated nitrate contents also tended to have elevated chloride sulphate iron and ammonia n moreover the lighter 16o isotope is also preferentially removed by bacteria during denitrification enriching residual nitrates in 18o as denitrification progresses although temperature dilution and mixing with rainfall new water and groundwater old water have also been shown to affect these contributions jung et al 2020 volatilisation occurs when ammonia gas released from urea based fertilisers or animal waste is hydrolysed to ammonia and is lost from soils to the atmosphere eq 7 residual soil ammonia is enriched in 15n with the loss of the lighter 14n fraction and with nitrification enriches the 15n of resulting nitrate 7 co nh2 2 2h2o 2nh4 2co2 2nh3 2h co3 globally there is a recognised range of typical δ 15n values for different nitrogenous sources xue et al 2009 fig 1 synthetic nitrate fertilizers manufactured via the haber bosch method urea fertilizer or ammonification of urine induces lower δ 15nno3 values in water typically from 4 to 4 loo et al 2017 suchy et al 2018 fig 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din supplied by fertilisers manure or urban waste is transported into groundwater by contaminated surface water percolating through the root zone source load and subsurface sediments in the vadose and phreatic zones generally coarse grained permeable sediments provide the fastest direct nitrate entry route into a receiving freshwater body i e aquifer delivered load with minimal likelihood of retention or remediation processes such as microbial denitrification redox processes convert root zone din loss into nitrates under oxic conditions while denitrification occurs under reducing conditions changing the nitrate back to harmless nitrogen gas wilson et al 2020 organic soil nitrogen covers a broad range of δ 15nno3 values from 4 to 10 kendall 1998 fig 2 freshwater with δ 15nno3 values 10 are typically classed as undergoing denitrification when on a 1 1 linear relationship with δ 18ono3 or as containing effluent when on a 2 1 linear relationship with δ 18ono3 fig 2 δ 18ono3 values were found to be more useful than δ 15nno3 values to separate atmospheric no3 deposition from microbially produced soil no3 as their δ 18ono3 values were significantly different wassenaar 1995 δ 18ono3 values produced by nitrification in freshwater range from 15 to 15 while atmospheric no3 has a δ 18ono3 range from 15 to 70 granger and wankel 2016 previously it was thought that the mechanism of nitrate formation during nitrification was oxidation of nh3 to no2 which incorporated one oxygen from air and one oxygen from water while subsequent oxidation of no2 to no3 incorporated an oxygen from water providing a 1 1 denitrification trajectory on the nitrate biplot fig 2 more recent work has shown that δ 18oh2o kinetic isotope effects are associated with denitrification as well as the isotopic equilibrium of the oxygen atoms between no2 and water which has an inverse kinetic effect on no2 to no3 in freshwater systems these nitrifiers can coexist with denitrifiers revealing nitrates can be replenished by co existing no2 oxidising bacteria and anammox processes during denitrification granger and wankel 2016 this results in a lower denitrification trajectory providing a 2 1 gradient which integrates the replenishment of 15n from anammox processes furthermore δ 18ono3 values can be up to 5 higher if the δ 18oh2o value is isotopically enriched as a result of evaporation which can occur in surface water denitrification ponds seasonal groundwater recharged from higher altitudes or if the soil δ 18o value is higher than atmospheric o2 due to fractionation during soil bacterial respiration zhang et al 2019 other reactions may also induce higher fractionation in δ 18ono3 than the theoretical fractionation such as low ph environments water with a high redox potential or fractionation processes occurring during the initial nitrification process commonly biplots of nitrogen δ 15nno3 and oxygen δ 18ono3 from the extracted nitrate are used to identify sources kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2015 however the biplot is often over interpreted and is not adjusted to new zealand s unique nitrate sources and environmental conditions the nitrate biplot was developed by kendall 1998 with a view to interpreting different groundwater nitrate sources which reflected anthropogenic inputs denitrification loss of the lighter 14n isotope due to bacterial consumption was the only nitrate reduction mechanism proposed abiotic and biotic cycling processes such as mineralization which transform n2 from atmospheric deposition or urea from urine or fertilizers into nitrates were not incorporated into the biplot as the use of nitrate isotope analyses has evolved it has become more apparent that measuring locally appropriate sources of nitrogen to understand the range of initial δ 15n values is the best way to constrain their interpretation rather than using the limited number of measurements on source specific issues outlined in the literature stewart and aitchison earl 2020 typically higher δ 18ono3 values of nitrates 25 suggest they are formed from atmospheric sources and are dependent on latitude michalski et al 2012 while lower δ 18ono3 values 15 reflect the δ 18oh2o of the surface water where the nitrate is formed via nitrification from ammonia fertiliser or urea from animal waste snider et al 2010 nicolini et al 2016 nitrate formation studies have shown that for the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria two oxygen atoms are derived from water and one from atmospheric o2 nicolini et al 2016 usually δ 18oh2o values of surface water ranges from 25 to 4 and atmospheric o2 is around 23 5 kendall et al 2007 therefore δ 18ono3 values of soil microbial no3 produced from in situ nitrification in new zealand are predicted to be between 10 and 10 kendall 1998 incubation experiments have shown that the δ 18oh2o contribution to the final δ 18ono3 value may be considerably higher than 2 3 and sometime close to 1 snider et al 2010 due to abiotic exchange this process may occur more readily in surface waters with diurnal 18oh2o exchange venkiteswaran et al 2015 wassenaar et al 2010 which may cause more positive δ 18ono3 values 10 than would normally be expected conversely higher proportions of 18oh2o from uncontaminated freshwater interacting with nitrogenous sources will produce more negative δ 18ono3 values this paper summarises the nitrate concentrations given in mg l no3 n and nitrate isotope values δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 from 1042 groundwater and surface water samples collected around new zealand from 2010 to 2020 to provide an overview of the geographic and environmental variability of nitrate signatures encountered in new zealand data trends will be useful to understand the effects of land use geology and soil type on retaining or reducing anthropogenic nitrates for future models to increase specificity down to regional and sub regional scales from these baselines nitrate mitigation and reduction efforts can be tailored to reduce nitrate contamination in national freshwater policy reforms mfe 2014 2020a mfe 2020c 2 methods 2 1 sample and data collection 1042 samples were collected from 14 regions around new zealand by regional councils universities crown research institutes and industry water researchers from 2010 to 2020 with the majority sampled during 2012 2013 and 2016 to 2020 these wells included national groundwater monitoring wells along with groundwater and surface water samples submitted to the stable isotope laboratory to investigate baseline and elevated nitrate responses water samples were filtered through whatman 0 45 µm acetate membrane filters and refrigerated for a few days until analysis water samples 250 ml were analysed for nitrate n concentrations according to standard ion chromatographic methods apha 2012 results are reported to within 90 to 110 of the expected value and the limit of detection was 0 01 mg l nitrate n any samples with a nitrate n value lower than 0 01 mg l is reported as 0 005 mg l or half the detection limit a range of potassium nitrate standard solutions from 0 5 to 100 mg l were used to establish a calibration curve of these 1042 samples 1012 were successfully measured for no3 n concentrations water type and geographical location around two thirds of the samples had land use type n 652 geology n 646 and soil type n 643 data available this data was sourced from the laboratory database or directly from the sample submitters water samples were further correlated to published gis layers of land use mfe 2020b newsome et al 2018 geology heron and custodian 2020 and soil orders mfe 2016 it was not possible to link data with specific sampling dates although it may be possible to infer summer winter sampling and year from the submission date to the laboratory there were 979 samples that had sufficient no3 n present for isotopic analysis 0 1 mg l nitrate isotopes δ1 5n and δ 18ono3 were measured on 426 groundwater samples such as springs and wells with sampling depths ranging from 0 m to 320 m 90 of wells had depths of 50 m and two thirds had depths 19 m a further 507 samples were analysed from surface water sites such as rivers lakes streams and drains 17 samples were from wastewater sources 15 samples were from geothermal sources and 14 samples from estuaries samples were analysed for nitrate concentration and stable isotopes at the stable isotope laboratory at the national isotope centre gns science in lower hutt 2 2 stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate the analytical method used in this study follows the published method by mcilvin and altabet 2005 but is slightly modified following personal communication with mark altabet in brief samples were collected and filtered through gf f filters 0 2 or 0 45 μm into hdpe bottles and preserved by freezing or acidification to ph 2 3 by adding 1 ml 2 5 mm sulfanilic acid in 10 degassed hcl to remove nitrite to each 100 ml of sample nitrates no3 were converted to nitrite no2 using spongy cadmium and the extra addition of 100 mg magnesium oxide as an intial buffer then to nitrous oxide n2o using sodium azide in an acetic acid buffer the nitrous oxide was then purged from the water sample passed through a series of chemical traps to remove h2o and co2 and cryogenically trapped using liquid nitrogen after being cryofocused in a second trap the n2o went through a gc hewlett packard gas chromatograph column and into an isoprime uk isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms to determine δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values all results are reported with respect to air for δ 15nno3 and vsmow for δ 18ono3 and normalized to

different freshwater sources sampled nationally are summarised in table 1 fig 3 and fig 4 a the nitrate n of the 1012 samples ranged from 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l to 76 3 mg l with a mean concentration of 2 81 5 11 mg l although the median concentration 0 99 mg l better reflects the average data range as the mean was skewed by several high outliers fig s1 insert the nitrate n concentration distribution was a log normal or exponential distribution rather than a normal distribution fig s1 the upper quartile was 3 1 mg l and all but 44 samples were below the nitrate n mav of 11 3 mg l of the 44 exceedances 3 were wastewater and 41 were groundwater samples groundwater n 435 had a nitrate n range of 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l to 76 3 mg l mean 5 05 6 87 mg l fig 4 a with 41 groundwater samples exceeding nitrate n mav the three highest nitrate n samples were from taranaki and had nitrate n concentrations of 31 59 and 76 3 mg l two of these samples were taken from irrigation wells located on a dairy farm and another from a groundwater monitoring bore near a urea fertiliser factory where they redistributed wastewater using pasture spray irrigation surface water n 539 had a nitrate n range from 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l nitrate n to 8 8 mg l mean 1 02 1 35 mg l fig 4 a these samples all fell below mav for nitrate n as did the few

mav 14 3 16 3 and 20 2 mg l respectively 3 1 2 regional land use lithology and soil type nitrate n results sample numbers were mainly concentrated in regions where farming and agriculture are most prevalent waikato 116 bay of plenty 130 horizons manawatu 200 wairarapa 121 canterbury 86 and southland 166 fig 4 b high nitrate n concentrations i e nitrate n 11 3 mg l were widely distributed across new zealand canterbury n 18 horizons manawatu n 5 including the 3 wastewater samples southland n 5 taranaki n 5 tasman n 2 taupo n 1 waikato n 2 wairarapa n 6 proportionally canterbury had the highest number of nitrate n mav exceedances 21 these regions all have significant proportions of land used for rural farming activities including intensive dairy nitrate n concentration correlated with land use type fig 4 c and showed that high producing grasslands and annual cropland had respectively the highest nitrate n values and the greatest numbers of mav exceedances high producing grassland and annual cropland typically accommodates more intensive farming activities and represents strong n point source inputs which diffuse into the surrounding catchment croplands orchards and vineyards low producing grasslands urban and wetlands all had intermediate nitrate n concentrations ranging up to 14 mg l the lowest nitrate n levels arise from land use such as forest or open wetlands where plants are actively removing nitrate n as nutrients and fertilization inputs are either low and or diffuse or non existent in terms of lithology nitrate n concentrations appeared to be highest in permeable media such as basalt breccia ignimbrite gravels sand with the highest exceedances occurring in breccia and gravels fig 4 d soil types also reflect the propensity for land use cropping non dairy grazing and grazed dairy farming soils are associated with brown gley recent pallic allophanic and pumice soils which have higher nitrate n concentrations conversely semiarid podzols town and riverine soils do not experience such high nitrate inputs fig 4 e and are associated with less intensive land use systems 3 2 nitrate isotopes nitrate isotope data for 981 sites across new zealand are summarized in table 2 the range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 values for different water types across new zealand is plotted in fig 5 a 3 2 1 water type δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 results new zealand s mean groundwater and surface water δ 1 5nno3 values are very similar at 6 8 5 1 and 6 8 3 7 respectively suggesting that they share similar contaminant sources groundwater δ 1 5nno3 values have a larger standard deviation than surface water δ 1 5nno3 values consistent with a wider range of o2 availability which may limit nitrification groundwater had the most positive δ 1 5nno3 value 42 5 in this dataset fig 5 a although wastewater had the highest mean δ 1 5nno3 value 14 1 and median δ 1 5nno3 value 14 5 reflecting the positive enrichment of 15n through denitrification of nitrate sources or loss of 14n via ammonia volatilisation prior to nitrification mean estuarine δ 1 5nno3 values were similar to surface water and groundwater but had a much smaller range of δ 1 5nno3 values and no3 n concentrations suggesting nitrate n entering estuarine environments is quickly assimilated into its receiving environment through ecosystem n uptake geothermal water tended to have lower δ 1 5nno3 values and a significantly lower mean δ 1 5nno3 value of 4 2 wastewater and estuarine samples had higher mean δ 1 8ono3 values 6 1 5 3 and 6 6 4 1 respectively than groundwater and surface water samples indicative of nitrate formation in enriched or evaporative conditions groundwater surface water and geothermal water all showed lower mean δ 1 8ono3 values 4 1 than wastewater and estuarine samples consistent with either nitrification of soil organic n values or nitrate sources that were initially mixed with non evaporated groundwater or precipitation 3 2 2 region land use lithology and soil type δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 results regionally δ 15nno3 values showed a narrow range for northland hawkes bay nelson and otago fig 5 b these regions are generally more well known for their agriculture and horticulture land use rather than animal farming many of sites from otago and nelson represented grasslands high and low producing croplands orchards vineyards and non dairy grazing a wider range of δ 15nno3 values were seen for waikato bay of plenty taupo horizons manawatu wairarapa marlborough west coast and southland fig 5 b waikato and taranaki regions have proportionally higher grazed dairy farming while the other regions tend to have more diverse non dairy farming activities such as sheep farming beef finishing and agriculture these regions often experience dry summer conditions and much wetter winter conditions which tends to mobilise farm nutrients in an intensive nutrient slug in the wetter months rather than a gradual diffusion across an annual continuum similar to the nitrate n concentration results freshwater from high producing grassland still has the widest range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values from 11 6 to 42 5 and 9 8 to 47 7 respectively indicating the diverse range of mineralization volatilization and denitrification processes across new zealand landscapes fig 5 c geologically water sampled from the most porous sediments ignimbrite gravels breccia sand and silt had the widest ranges of δ 1 5nno3 values although samples from finer grained mud mudstone and silt lithologies retained the highest mean δ 15nno3 values fig 5 d gravel ignimbrite and sand also had the widest range of δ 1 8ono3 values although an outlying mudstone sample had a very high δ 1 8ono3 value 47 7 analysis of site lithology suggested that isotopic outliers and water samples with more extreme δ 1 8ono3 values mostly occur in groundwater samples rather than surface water supporting the strong influence of aquifer dynamics and reducing groundwater conditions which contribute to the isotopic fractionation of both 15n and 18o at depth wilson et al 2020 soil type has been shown to strongly influenced the range of nitrate isotope values with carbon rich sediments acting as electron donors during denitrification reyner 2019 in this study more positive δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values were seen in water samples from reducing organic rich brown gley allophanic pumice pallic and recent soils and a wider range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values for samples from gley allophanic pumice pallic and recent soils that had mixed redox ability fig 5 e 3 3 nitrate isotope biplot the use of 15n vs 18o biplots evolved from kendall 1998 who proposed a simple biplot to differentiate nitrates using nitrification soil n and denitrification as the main classification zones in the new zealand context we do not see strong usage of synthetic nitrate no3 fertilisers or nitrates present in precipitation that rise to the high δ18ono3 values outlined in the kendall biplot fig 2 furthermore in new zealand the effluent zone manure and waste tends more towards enriched δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values than those documented by kendall 1998 as animal waste is primarily derived from animals ingesting manure fertilized pasture rather than dry feeds commonly used in usa or europe which are grown using synthetic fertilisers however δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values not only characterise the source or origin of nitrate or urea but also identify biological activity which leads to mineralisation nitrogen fixation nitrification or denitrification and the subsequent isotopic fractionation and preferential enrichment or in some cases depletion of the heavier 15n or 18o isotopes an upgraded kendall biplot was modified baisden et al 2016 morgenstern et al 2019 fig 6 a to identify nitrate inputs from the new zealand context descriptions of each zone are provided in table 3 samples have been grouped into classes based on relationships between δ 15n δ 18o and nitrate concentrations animal urine and urea based fertilizers uuf are the main nitrate sources in rural new zealand rather than haber bosch generated nitrate fertilizers used in other parts of the world most urine urea and ammonia fertilizers have δ 15n values less than 4 rogers 2008 an intermediate transition or mixing zone for urea urine ammonia fertilizers mixed uuf overlaps with the normal n retention nnr zone with δ 15n values from 4 to 9 mixed uuf contaminated groundwater or surface water either transitions unchanged through the nnr zone to the denitrification effluent zone or may mix with natural baseline nitrate containing groundwater or surface water in the nnr mixed uuf zone further diluting the original nitrate concentration prior to transitioning into the denitrification zone the δ 15n transition threshold from nnr mixed uuf to the denitrification effluent zone tends to be somewhat arbitrary and was set at 9 although many surface waters would still be classed as denitrified if it was set at 8 the higher cut off also allows for the inclusion of higher δ 15n values of recycled farm effluent that is redistributed during irrigation as a fertilizer on pasture li et al 2021 the denitrification effluent zone ranges from 9 to 28 the highest δ 1 5nno3 values are associated with effluent ponds and highly denitrified animal wastes that have been exposed to bacterial fractionation and 14n loss a range of denitrification slopes have previously been proposed nestler et al 2011 baily et al 2011 clague et al 2015 in new zealand denitrification shifts the δ 18o δ 15n ratio along a 1 1 slope although denitrified water mixed with fresh effluent samples lowers the slope towards a 1 2 gradient the biplot of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values from this study fig 6 a shows around 58 of groundwater and surface water samples fall in the nnr mixed uuf zone table 4 this zone contains either low level diffuse nitrate contaminants or background organic soil derived n samples 40 nnr but also contains mixed urine or urea fertilizer samples 18 mixed uuf which are distinguishable by their higher nitrate n concentrations and in some cases higher δ 1 8ono3 values fig 6 b the majority of the remaining samples are classified either as uuf 10 or baseline 8 due to their lower δ 15nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values no3 fertilizer 2 no3fert with high δ 1 8ono3 values or denitrified 18 denitrif and effluent 4 with decreasing no3 n concentrations and higher δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values beyond the obvious generalizations more positive δ 1 8ono3 values are seen at the top of the nnr mixed uuf zone representing samples that have higher nitrate n concentrations larger sample icons and are most likely derived from synthetic fertilizers which have higher δ 1 8ono3 values due to the incorporation of atmospheric oxygen δ 1 8oair of 23 5 through the haber bosch nitrate making process less positive δ 1 8ono3 values at the bottom of the nnr zone correspond either nnr baseline or uuf samples with lower nitrate n concentrations that are transitioning through to the denitrification zone or may become mixed with nnr or new uuf water in the effluent denitrification zone fig 6 a most groundwater samples have correspondingly lower nitrate n concentrations shown by smaller sample icons than in the nnr zone and more positive δ 1 5nno3 values due to 14n loss through bacterial removal or volatilization denitrification zone samples with lower nitrate concentrations and higher δ15n and δ18o values are clearly distinguishable from effluent samples with higher nitrate concentrations and less 15n and 18o enrichment fig 6 b nnr samples in the transition zone can be further distinguished from denitrification and mixed uuf samples by their lower nitrate concentrations and lower δ18ono3 values the δ 1 8ono3 values are primarily used to differentiate between fresh effluent or wastewater and denitrified samples in the effluent zone fresh effluent or wastewater samples fall into the lower part of the effluent zone as they may have been rapidly denitrified with preferential loss of 14n or mixed with groundwater or surface water which has lower δ 1 8oh2o values and undergone 18o exchange and consequently lower δ 1 8ono3 values denitrified samples undergo partial or total 18o exchange and both δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values subsequently become more positive according to the level of denitrification 1 2 partial or 1 1 total groundwater and surface water samples that plot in the uuf zone are characteristic of nitrified samples with lower δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values these values indicate that there is preservation of the nitrogenous sources due to an oxygenated environment and that denitrification has not occurred typically water containing animal waste ammonia or ammonium or dissolved organic nitrogen don from soil organic matter may undergo nitrification a process which converts ammonia ammonium or don compounds through bacterial action to nitrite then nitrate in these instances any nitrates formed from these samples have much lower δ 1 8ono3 values as they mix with water that has naturally lower δ 1 8oh2o values 12 to 4 synthetic fertiliser nitrates seen in the fertiliser no3 zone formed through the haber bosch process have much more positive δ18ono3 and δ 1 5nno3 values as they are manufactured from air which has an atmospheric oxygen δ18oatm value of c 23 5 and a δ 1 5nair value between 2 to 4 further mixing of synthetic fertilisers with surface or groundwater causes oxygen dissociation and exchange between the fertiliser and water 18o values which lowers the resulting δ18ono3 values nicolini et al 2016 plots of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 against nitrate n concentration shows the prevalence for the majority of groundwater samples to lie in the nnr mixed uuf zone fig 7 a and b however a number of groundwater samples are highly denitrified blue dots with δ15nno3 from 15 to 27 and have nitrate n 5 mg l a number of surface water samples orange dots display a lower level of denitrification with δ15nno3 values from 10 to 20 fig 7 a surface water does not tend to retain as much nitrate as groundwater and in general the isotopes do not usually reach the most enriched 15n values of groundwater mainly because of the isotopic regeneration in surface water via open system mixing with precipitation and available ecosystem uptake processes the prevalence for most surface water δ18ono3 values to be 10 also suggests that nitrate contamination is more likely to be uuf derived than fertilizer no3 derived fig 7 b 4 discussion a national review of new zealand s groundwater and surface water nitrates found the isotopic composition is regionally consistent with the majority of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 values lying between 4 and 9 and 2 to 6 respectively in a nnr mixed uuf transition zone these samples consist of either nnr mixed uuf or samples either transitioning through to denitrification or nitrification highly denitrified δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 outlier samples are noted in some key farming regions such as waikato taupo horizons manawatu wairarapa and southland strong deviations from median δ 1 5nno3 values c 4 to 8 and δ 18 ono3 values c 2 to 6 represent an inability of the system to reset to natural background nitrate n levels primarily because there is continued n input ongoing contamination or the system is unable to assimilate or remove the available nitrate nitrate isotopes also give a strong indication of freshwater denitrification or nitrification ability which significantly modifies the δ 1 5nno3 values to more positive 10 or more negative 4 values respectively combined with the nitrate content dual δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 isotopes provide a guide to the level of other ongoing environmental and biological processes table 5 actual denitrification occurring as a single event will result in reduced nitrate n concentrations and more positive δ 1 5nno3 values as the nitrate is removed yet slow or older nitrate loads entering via a continuous input over time into the effluent or uuf zone will not only result in apparent denitrification ie increased δ 1 5nno3 values or nitrification ie reduced δ 1 5nno3 values but there will be little to no reduction in nitrate concentration over time table 5 furthermore increasing δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values cannot always be attributed to denitrification of a single nitrate contaminant source or the assumption that closed system denitrification no exchange with nitrate entering or leaving the system occurs indeed more complex open systems exist where groundwater is continuously recycled or multiple n source inputs may occur denk et al 2017 stewart and aitchison earl 2020 contemporary anthropogenic nitrates such as animal waste sewage or fertilizers in surface water may mix with nitrate enriched groundwater that has been transported some distance from the initial contamination zone or source moreover old groundwater nitrate may have entered the system many years or decades prior and only be emerging after a significant time delay adding further complexity to understanding nitrate n loadings in these instances δ 18ono3 and δ 18oh2o isotopes become useful environmental indicators to tease out more complex contributions and identify which processes nitrification mineralization and denitrification dominate a system table 5 the pervasive nature of new zealand s freshwater nitrate is now a serious environmental concern from a health perspective our data shows that new zealand s groundwater is significantly affected by nitrate contamination with 58 of samples tested in this study having nitrate n concentrations exceeding 0 9 mg l and 33 of sites exceeding half mav of 5 6 mg l based on recent international research these levels pose a higher risk of colorectal cancers among communities consuming these sources schullehner et al 2018 espejo herrera et al 2016 temkin et al 2019 although there is conflicting opinion among new zealand researchers richards et al 2021 chambers and hales 2021 cressey and cridge 2021 cressey et al 2021 richards 2020 further robust epidemiological and experimental evidence is required to better understand the potential risk nitrate poses for colorectal cancer from an environmental and land use perspective nitrate exceedances not only occur in regions recognised for high intensity dairy farming waikato taupo taranaki wairarapa canterbury and southland but also in agricultural regions where annual cropping prevails higher nitrate concentrations are preferentially found in water associated with more porous lithology such as sand gravel pumice breccia and basalt and it is clear that not all nitrate n loads can be treated as equal as nitrate n is clearly dependant on different geological environmental and land use factors concurrently denitrification is highly associated with wastewater surface water and groundwater from higher intensity farming regions with a particular emphasis on high productive grassland estuaries and wetlands estuaries and wetland δ 15nno3 values consistently express background nnr denitrification zone isotope values δ 15nno3 values from 5 to 10 as the available vegetation and carbon rich soil assimilates any nitrate loads immediately high producing grasslands have the largest range of δ 15n values δ 1 5nno3 values from 11 6 to 42 5 indicating both denitrification and nitrification can actively take place depending on temperature rainfall soil redox potential and nitrate mobility the results from this survey indicate that nitrate isotopes δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 may be a useful tool to incorporate into nitrogen attenuation models at a regional or even catchment scale current nutrient budget tools commonly used in new zealand such as overseerfm murray and freeman 2017 account only for on farm nutrient losses via the root zone yet the isotopic fractionation of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values clearly indicate significant trends in groundwater and surface water denitrification based on catchment physical characteristics and geographical location it may be possible to fine tune these classifications to higher spatial resolution approaches such as catchments and sub catchments to inform nitrate remediation and assimilation capacity based on enrichment or depletion of 15n and 18o and determine their corresponding source inputs nitrate removal denitrification or sustained contamination nitrification depends on the ongoing level of n attenuation input and or removal via groundwater reduction and bacterial action which can be inferred by the isotopic signature and the nitrate concentration in new zealand seasonal precipitation patterns influence surface to groundwater interactions temporally integrating multiple nitrogenous pulses through different biochemical reactions and it is rare that leachable nitrate sources are completely removed 5 conclusion this study presents the first comprehensive national and regional new zealand baseline study of nitrate n concentrations and isotope data sampled across 1012 sites from 2010 to 2020 almost 60 of freshwater in this study had nitrate n concentrations 0 9 mg l a threshold that has been identified by overseas researchers as posing a higher risk of negative human health impacts nitrate isotopes show that the majority of nitrate samples lie in the nnr mixed uuf zone which is traditionally associated with soil organic n and low background nitrate n concentrations however this work demonstrates that in the new zealand context this zone is also an intermediate zone for urine and urea fertiliser uuf contaminated water from farming agriculture transitioning through to the denitrified zone or undergoing nitrification this mixing zone also allows uuf samples to combine with low or nitrate free water generating diffuse sources that are increasingly complex to identify using nitrate n concentration and isotopes in most instances a combination of dissolved gases such as n2 ne and ar age dating and tracer studies will be required to compliment the dual nitrate isotope approach to integrate groundwater transport and nitrate lag times the data collected in this survey not only describes the current status and source of new zealand s freshwater nitrate contamination but also provides clarification around the use of dual nitrate isotopes to understand nitrate transformation pathways unique to new zealand collectively this dataset provides a national overview that can be incorporated into freshwater models and used to inform policy through understanding regional variations affected by land use climate and geology the full pervasive extent of nitrates in new zealand freshwater systems are yet to be realised as many past studies have been catchment or regionally specific in longer established farming regions such as waikato wairarapa canterbury or southland rural development is now rapidly growing in lesser monitored regions such as northland hawkes bay marlborough and low lying arable regions between southland and canterbury and will benefit from this isotope approach nonetheless while dual nitrate isotopes can identify nitrate source attenuation and tease out time bound inputs on national scales in the future longer term regional monitoring integrating seasonal climatic and spatial specifics will further refine these interpretations credit authorship contribution statement karyne m rogers resources investigation

investigates freshwater type land use geology soil type and geographic effects on nitrate isotopes across new zealand nitrate contamination is the biggest threat to new zealand s drinking water resources with almost 60 of samples in the study having above baseline nitrate no3 n concentrations 0 9 mg l a threshold noted for higher colorectal cancer risk groundwater 2 89 mg l had higher median no3 n concentration than surface water 0 65 mg l traditional nitrate isotope biplots based on the haber bosch cycle which integrates synthetic fertilizers into the food chain are reinterpreted to place new zealand s unique farming nitrogen contributions from urea and ammonia into context the majority of new zealand s freshwater nitrate isotopes lie in a normal nitrogen retention nnr zone which also acts as a mixed urea urine fertilizer mixed uuf zone transitioning nitrified fertilizers and animal waste via redox reactions microbial action and or dissipation towards a denitrification zone

most pervasive groundwater contaminant posing a human health hazard in drinking water and leading to eutrophication causing hypoxia and algal blooms of water ways the two most prevalent water quality problems globally united nations 2014 oecd 2017 approximately 40 of long term groundwater monitoring sites in new zealand historically show above baseline 0 9 mg l nitrate n concentrations daughney and wall 2007 moreau et al 2016 with increasing urbanisation and agricultural production the ongoing balance between freshwater allocation and polluted water discharge is under threat degradation of new zealand s freshwater resources and declining health of waterways and ecosystems after years of unregulated discharge are now being addressed by more stringent policies and land management mbie 2020 which aim to halt reverse and improve declining water quality in new zealand nitrate loads in freshwater are routinely monitored in new zealand by regional authorities and other groups involved with discharge of contaminated water such as farmers mining organisations landfill authorities environmental researchers and consulting companies to investigate the long term evolution of nitrates in new zealand s water bodies yet until now these mostly local studies have not widely integrated nitrate isotopes to characterise nutrient sources and determine denitrification effects on a national scale regionally new zealand is agriculturally diverse with some areas being ideal for farming dairy sheep while others are used intensively for forestry horticulture and growing crops new zealand s nitrate balance the difference between n inputs to farming systems and n outputs has rapidly become more positive over the last few decades due to expansion and intensification of farming oecd 2019 leaching of nitrates into surface waters and penetration of nitrates into groundwater systems not only leaves an indelible trace of nitrate through measurable nitrate concentrations but also through stable isotope fingerprints which reflect the nitrate contamination source nitrate concentration no3 n characterises the level of nitrate contamination in a water body and is a primary indicator of water quality ballantine and davies colley 2014 new zealand s drinking water standards are set at a maximum acceptable value mav of 50 mg l for total nitrate ministry of health 2018 which corresponds to 11 3 mg l no3 n in line with world health organization guidelines who 2016 who 2017 current regulations maintain that if community supplied drinking water no3 n reaches half the permissible level 5 65 mg l additional monitoring must be undertaken given potential links to cancer and other health issues such as methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome which can cause depletion of oxygen in blood supply recent research has suggested an increased colon cancer risk from drinking water containing 0 97 mg l of no3 n and for colorectal cancer crc and rectal cancer from 1 9 mg l no3 n espejo herrera et al 2016 while schullehner et al 2018 published similar results that showed an increased crc risk in denmark for drinking waters above 0 87 mg l no3 n nitrate toxicity guidelines have also been set at a maximum median for no3 n of 6 9 mg l for freshwater aquatic systems such as rivers hickey and martin 2009 furthermore these thresholds suggest significant risks of nitrate toxicity to aquatic organisms in freshwater environments containing 1 0 mg l no3 n or more although the mechanisms of nitrate uptake in aquatic organisms are still not clearly understood in the last 10 years nitrate

the most common genus associated with aob eq 1 followed by further aoa oxidation eq 2 in this second step nitrobacter is the most frequently identified genus but others include nitrosococcus and

no2 4h 2e 4 nh4 no2 n2 2h2o mineralization results in the production of ammonium nh4 from organic soil nitrogen eq 5 during mineralization soil microbes depolymerize organic matter which is rich in carbon and nitrogen fujii et al 2020 the decomposition process results in monomers which are then mineralized into inorganic compounds such as ammonium or assimilated by the microbes for their biosynthetic needs nitrogen mineralization depends on the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n ratio of the organic matter in general if the c n ratio is higher than 30 1 then there may be insufficient nitrogen available for mineralization and the decomposing microbes will absorb the nitrogen for their own biosynthesis when the c n ratio is 25 1 n mineralization results in a loss of ammonium to the environment under favourable conditions ammonium is further converted by micro organisms to inorganic nitrate 5 n org nh4 no3 denitrification is a multistep no3 n removal process via microbes which consume and assimilate diffuse no3 n sources followed by the stepwise reduction of the no3 n to n2 gas in the presence of carbon as an electron donor kendall and aravena 2000 eq 6 this fractionation process enriches the 15n of the water sample through preferential consumption removal and uptake of the biologically more available 14n by bacteria this step is twofold where both the residual nitrate 15n increases and the no3 n concentration decreases as denitrification progresses through several intermediary steps to the end product n2 gas isotope fractionation may be refreshed reset back to original values or interrupted through new contaminant pulses in the environment mobilisation or remobilisation of surface contaminants from irrigation or precipitation causes further contaminant infiltration into the vadose or phreatic zones mixing with residual contaminants that may be more or less denitrified in this instance transportation and anammox processes will also influence the fractionation processes 6 no3 no2 no g n2o g n2 g previous studies have shown that groundwater samples with elevated iron and ammonia n concentrations are generally reducing higher redox potential and likely to encourage microbial denitrification and loss of no3 n snow 2018 they also found surface water samples with elevated nitrate contents also tended to have elevated chloride sulphate iron and ammonia n moreover the lighter 16o isotope is also preferentially removed by bacteria during denitrification enriching residual nitrates in 18o as denitrification progresses although temperature dilution and mixing with rainfall new water and groundwater old water have also been shown to affect these contributions jung et al 2020 volatilisation occurs when ammonia gas released from urea based fertilisers or animal waste is hydrolysed to ammonia and is lost from soils to the atmosphere eq 7 residual soil ammonia is enriched in 15n with the loss of the lighter 14n fraction and with nitrification enriches the 15n of resulting nitrate 7 co nh2 2 2h2o 2nh4 2co2 2nh3 2h co3 globally there is a recognised range of typical δ 15n values for different nitrogenous sources xue et al 2009 fig 1 synthetic nitrate fertilizers manufactured via the haber bosch method urea fertilizer or ammonification of urine induces lower δ 15nno3 values in water typically from 4 to 4 loo et al 2017 suchy et al 2018 fig 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din supplied by fertilisers manure or urban waste is transported into groundwater by contaminated surface water percolating through the root zone source load and subsurface sediments in the vadose and phreatic zones generally coarse grained permeable sediments provide the fastest direct nitrate entry route into a receiving freshwater body i e aquifer delivered load with minimal likelihood of retention or remediation processes such as microbial denitrification redox processes convert root zone din loss into nitrates under oxic conditions while denitrification occurs under reducing conditions changing the nitrate back to harmless nitrogen gas wilson et al 2020 organic soil nitrogen covers a broad range of δ 15nno3 values from 4 to 10 kendall 1998 fig 2 freshwater with δ 15nno3 values 10 are typically classed as undergoing denitrification when on a 1 1 linear relationship with δ 18ono3 or as containing effluent when on a 2 1 linear relationship with δ 18ono3 fig 2 δ 18ono3 values were found to be more useful than δ 15nno3 values to separate atmospheric no3 deposition from microbially produced soil no3 as their δ 18ono3 values were significantly different wassenaar 1995 δ 18ono3 values produced by nitrification in freshwater range from 15 to 15 while atmospheric no3 has a δ 18ono3 range from 15 to 70 granger and wankel 2016 previously it was thought that the mechanism of nitrate formation during nitrification was oxidation of nh3 to no2 which incorporated one oxygen from air and one oxygen from water while subsequent oxidation of no2 to no3 incorporated an oxygen from water providing a 1 1 denitrification trajectory on the nitrate biplot fig 2 more recent work has shown that δ 18oh2o kinetic isotope effects are associated with denitrification as well as the isotopic equilibrium of the oxygen atoms between no2 and water which has an inverse kinetic effect on no2 to no3 in freshwater systems these nitrifiers can coexist with denitrifiers revealing nitrates can be replenished by co existing no2 oxidising bacteria and anammox processes during denitrification granger and wankel 2016 this results in a lower denitrification trajectory providing a 2 1 gradient which integrates the replenishment of 15n from anammox processes furthermore δ 18ono3 values can be up to 5 higher if the δ 18oh2o value is isotopically enriched as a result of evaporation which can occur in surface water denitrification ponds seasonal groundwater recharged from higher altitudes or if the soil δ 18o value is higher than atmospheric o2 due to fractionation during soil bacterial respiration zhang et al 2019 other reactions may also induce higher fractionation in δ 18ono3 than the theoretical fractionation such as low ph environments water with a high redox potential or fractionation processes occurring during the initial nitrification process commonly biplots of nitrogen δ 15nno3 and oxygen δ 18ono3 from the extracted nitrate are used to identify sources kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2015 however the biplot is often over interpreted and is not adjusted to new zealand s unique nitrate sources and environmental conditions the nitrate biplot was developed by kendall 1998 with a view to interpreting different groundwater nitrate sources which reflected anthropogenic inputs denitrification loss of the lighter 14n isotope due to bacterial consumption was the only nitrate reduction mechanism proposed abiotic and biotic cycling processes such as mineralization which transform n2 from atmospheric deposition or urea from urine or fertilizers into nitrates were not incorporated into the biplot as the use of nitrate isotope analyses has evolved it has become more apparent that measuring locally appropriate sources of nitrogen to understand the range of initial δ 15n values is the best way to constrain their interpretation rather than using the limited number of measurements on source specific issues outlined in the literature stewart and aitchison earl 2020 typically higher δ 18ono3 values of nitrates 25 suggest they are formed from atmospheric sources and are dependent on latitude michalski et al 2012 while lower δ 18ono3 values 15 reflect the δ 18oh2o of the surface water where the nitrate is formed via nitrification from ammonia fertiliser or urea from animal waste snider et al 2010 nicolini et al 2016 nitrate formation studies have shown that for the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria two oxygen atoms are derived from water and one from atmospheric o2 nicolini et al 2016 usually δ 18oh2o values of surface water ranges from 25 to 4 and atmospheric o2 is around 23 5 kendall et al 2007 therefore δ 18ono3 values of soil microbial no3 produced from in situ nitrification in new zealand are predicted to be between 10 and 10 kendall 1998 incubation experiments have shown that the δ 18oh2o contribution to the final δ 18ono3 value may be considerably higher than 2 3 and sometime close to 1 snider et al 2010 due to abiotic exchange this process may occur more readily in surface waters with diurnal 18oh2o exchange venkiteswaran et al 2015 wassenaar et al 2010 which may cause more positive δ 18ono3 values 10 than would normally be expected conversely higher proportions of 18oh2o from uncontaminated freshwater interacting with nitrogenous sources will produce more negative δ 18ono3 values this paper summarises the nitrate concentrations given in mg l no3 n and nitrate isotope values δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 from 1042 groundwater and surface water samples collected around new zealand from 2010 to 2020 to provide an overview of the geographic and environmental variability of nitrate signatures encountered in new zealand data trends will be useful to understand the effects of land use geology and soil type on retaining or reducing anthropogenic nitrates for future models to increase specificity down to regional and sub regional scales from these baselines nitrate mitigation and reduction efforts can be tailored to reduce nitrate contamination in national freshwater policy reforms mfe 2014 2020a mfe 2020c 2 methods 2 1 sample and data collection 1042 samples were collected from 14 regions around new zealand by regional councils universities crown research institutes and industry water researchers from 2010 to 2020 with the majority sampled during 2012 2013 and 2016 to 2020 these wells included national groundwater monitoring wells along with groundwater and surface water samples submitted to the stable isotope laboratory to investigate baseline and elevated nitrate responses water samples were filtered through whatman 0 45 µm acetate membrane filters and refrigerated for a few days until analysis water samples 250 ml were analysed for nitrate n concentrations according to standard ion chromatographic methods apha 2012 results are reported to within 90 to 110 of the expected value and the limit of detection was 0 01 mg l nitrate n any samples with a nitrate n value lower than 0 01 mg l is reported as 0 005 mg l or half the detection limit a range of potassium nitrate standard solutions from 0 5 to 100 mg l were used to establish a calibration curve of these 1042 samples 1012 were successfully measured for no3 n concentrations water type and geographical location around two thirds of the samples had land use type n 652 geology n 646 and soil type n 643 data available this data was sourced from the laboratory database or directly from the sample submitters water samples were further correlated to published gis layers of land use mfe 2020b newsome et al 2018 geology heron and custodian 2020 and soil orders mfe 2016 it was not possible to link data with specific sampling dates although it may be possible to infer summer winter sampling and year from the submission date to the laboratory there were 979 samples that had sufficient no3 n present for isotopic analysis 0 1 mg l nitrate isotopes δ1 5n and δ 18ono3 were measured on 426 groundwater samples such as springs and wells with sampling depths ranging from 0 m to 320 m 90 of wells had depths of 50 m and two thirds had depths 19 m a further 507 samples were analysed from surface water sites such as rivers lakes streams and drains 17 samples were from wastewater sources 15 samples were from geothermal sources and 14 samples from estuaries samples were analysed for nitrate concentration and stable isotopes at the stable isotope laboratory at the national isotope centre gns science in lower hutt 2 2 stable isotopes of dissolved nitrate the analytical method used in this study follows the published method by mcilvin and altabet 2005 but is slightly modified following personal communication with mark altabet in brief samples were collected and filtered through gf f filters 0 2 or 0 45 μm into hdpe bottles and preserved by freezing or acidification to ph 2 3 by adding 1 ml 2 5 mm sulfanilic acid in 10 degassed hcl to remove nitrite to each 100 ml of sample nitrates no3 were converted to nitrite no2 using spongy cadmium and the extra addition of 100 mg magnesium oxide as an intial buffer then to nitrous oxide n2o using sodium azide in an acetic acid buffer the nitrous oxide was then purged from the water sample passed through a series of chemical traps to remove h2o and co2 and cryogenically trapped using liquid nitrogen after being cryofocused in a second trap the n2o went through a gc hewlett packard gas chromatograph column and into an isoprime uk isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms to determine δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values all results are reported with respect to air for δ 15nno3 and vsmow for δ 18ono3 and normalized to

different freshwater sources sampled nationally are summarised in table 1 fig 3 and fig 4 a the nitrate n of the 1012 samples ranged from 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l to 76 3 mg l with a mean concentration of 2 81 5 11 mg l although the median concentration 0 99 mg l better reflects the average data range as the mean was skewed by several high outliers fig s1 insert the nitrate n concentration distribution was a log normal or exponential distribution rather than a normal distribution fig s1 the upper quartile was 3 1 mg l and all but 44 samples were below the nitrate n mav of 11 3 mg l of the 44 exceedances 3 were wastewater and 41 were groundwater samples groundwater n 435 had a nitrate n range of 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l to 76 3 mg l mean 5 05 6 87 mg l fig 4 a with 41 groundwater samples exceeding nitrate n mav the three highest nitrate n samples were from taranaki and had nitrate n concentrations of 31 59 and 76 3 mg l two of these samples were taken from irrigation wells located on a dairy farm and another from a groundwater monitoring bore near a urea fertiliser factory where they redistributed wastewater using pasture spray irrigation surface water n 539 had a nitrate n range from 0 005 half detection limit of 0 01 mg l nitrate n to 8 8 mg l mean 1 02 1 35 mg l fig 4 a these samples all fell below mav for nitrate n as did the few

mav 14 3 16 3 and 20 2 mg l respectively 3 1 2 regional land use lithology and soil type nitrate n results sample numbers were mainly concentrated in regions where farming and agriculture are most prevalent waikato 116 bay of plenty 130 horizons manawatu 200 wairarapa 121 canterbury 86 and southland 166 fig 4 b high nitrate n concentrations i e nitrate n 11 3 mg l were widely distributed across new zealand canterbury n 18 horizons manawatu n 5 including the 3 wastewater samples southland n 5 taranaki n 5 tasman n 2 taupo n 1 waikato n 2 wairarapa n 6 proportionally canterbury had the highest number of nitrate n mav exceedances 21 these regions all have significant proportions of land used for rural farming activities including intensive dairy nitrate n concentration correlated with land use type fig 4 c and showed that high producing grasslands and annual cropland had respectively the highest nitrate n values and the greatest numbers of mav exceedances high producing grassland and annual cropland typically accommodates more intensive farming activities and represents strong n point source inputs which diffuse into the surrounding catchment croplands orchards and vineyards low producing grasslands urban and wetlands all had intermediate nitrate n concentrations ranging up to 14 mg l the lowest nitrate n levels arise from land use such as forest or open wetlands where plants are actively removing nitrate n as nutrients and fertilization inputs are either low and or diffuse or non existent in terms of lithology nitrate n concentrations appeared to be highest in permeable media such as basalt breccia ignimbrite gravels sand with the highest exceedances occurring in breccia and gravels fig 4 d soil types also reflect the propensity for land use cropping non dairy grazing and grazed dairy farming soils are associated with brown gley recent pallic allophanic and pumice soils which have higher nitrate n concentrations conversely semiarid podzols town and riverine soils do not experience such high nitrate inputs fig 4 e and are associated with less intensive land use systems 3 2 nitrate isotopes nitrate isotope data for 981 sites across new zealand are summarized in table 2 the range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 values for different water types across new zealand is plotted in fig 5 a 3 2 1 water type δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 results new zealand s mean groundwater and surface water δ 1 5nno3 values are very similar at 6 8 5 1 and 6 8 3 7 respectively suggesting that they share similar contaminant sources groundwater δ 1 5nno3 values have a larger standard deviation than surface water δ 1 5nno3 values consistent with a wider range of o2 availability which may limit nitrification groundwater had the most positive δ 1 5nno3 value 42 5 in this dataset fig 5 a although wastewater had the highest mean δ 1 5nno3 value 14 1 and median δ 1 5nno3 value 14 5 reflecting the positive enrichment of 15n through denitrification of nitrate sources or loss of 14n via ammonia volatilisation prior to nitrification mean estuarine δ 1 5nno3 values were similar to surface water and groundwater but had a much smaller range of δ 1 5nno3 values and no3 n concentrations suggesting nitrate n entering estuarine environments is quickly assimilated into its receiving environment through ecosystem n uptake geothermal water tended to have lower δ 1 5nno3 values and a significantly lower mean δ 1 5nno3 value of 4 2 wastewater and estuarine samples had higher mean δ 1 8ono3 values 6 1 5 3 and 6 6 4 1 respectively than groundwater and surface water samples indicative of nitrate formation in enriched or evaporative conditions groundwater surface water and geothermal water all showed lower mean δ 1 8ono3 values 4 1 than wastewater and estuarine samples consistent with either nitrification of soil organic n values or nitrate sources that were initially mixed with non evaporated groundwater or precipitation 3 2 2 region land use lithology and soil type δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 results regionally δ 15nno3 values showed a narrow range for northland hawkes bay nelson and otago fig 5 b these regions are generally more well known for their agriculture and horticulture land use rather than animal farming many of sites from otago and nelson represented grasslands high and low producing croplands orchards vineyards and non dairy grazing a wider range of δ 15nno3 values were seen for waikato bay of plenty taupo horizons manawatu wairarapa marlborough west coast and southland fig 5 b waikato and taranaki regions have proportionally higher grazed dairy farming while the other regions tend to have more diverse non dairy farming activities such as sheep farming beef finishing and agriculture these regions often experience dry summer conditions and much wetter winter conditions which tends to mobilise farm nutrients in an intensive nutrient slug in the wetter months rather than a gradual diffusion across an annual continuum similar to the nitrate n concentration results freshwater from high producing grassland still has the widest range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values from 11 6 to 42 5 and 9 8 to 47 7 respectively indicating the diverse range of mineralization volatilization and denitrification processes across new zealand landscapes fig 5 c geologically water sampled from the most porous sediments ignimbrite gravels breccia sand and silt had the widest ranges of δ 1 5nno3 values although samples from finer grained mud mudstone and silt lithologies retained the highest mean δ 15nno3 values fig 5 d gravel ignimbrite and sand also had the widest range of δ 1 8ono3 values although an outlying mudstone sample had a very high δ 1 8ono3 value 47 7 analysis of site lithology suggested that isotopic outliers and water samples with more extreme δ 1 8ono3 values mostly occur in groundwater samples rather than surface water supporting the strong influence of aquifer dynamics and reducing groundwater conditions which contribute to the isotopic fractionation of both 15n and 18o at depth wilson et al 2020 soil type has been shown to strongly influenced the range of nitrate isotope values with carbon rich sediments acting as electron donors during denitrification reyner 2019 in this study more positive δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values were seen in water samples from reducing organic rich brown gley allophanic pumice pallic and recent soils and a wider range of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values for samples from gley allophanic pumice pallic and recent soils that had mixed redox ability fig 5 e 3 3 nitrate isotope biplot the use of 15n vs 18o biplots evolved from kendall 1998 who proposed a simple biplot to differentiate nitrates using nitrification soil n and denitrification as the main classification zones in the new zealand context we do not see strong usage of synthetic nitrate no3 fertilisers or nitrates present in precipitation that rise to the high δ18ono3 values outlined in the kendall biplot fig 2 furthermore in new zealand the effluent zone manure and waste tends more towards enriched δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values than those documented by kendall 1998 as animal waste is primarily derived from animals ingesting manure fertilized pasture rather than dry feeds commonly used in usa or europe which are grown using synthetic fertilisers however δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values not only characterise the source or origin of nitrate or urea but also identify biological activity which leads to mineralisation nitrogen fixation nitrification or denitrification and the subsequent isotopic fractionation and preferential enrichment or in some cases depletion of the heavier 15n or 18o isotopes an upgraded kendall biplot was modified baisden et al 2016 morgenstern et al 2019 fig 6 a to identify nitrate inputs from the new zealand context descriptions of each zone are provided in table 3 samples have been grouped into classes based on relationships between δ 15n δ 18o and nitrate concentrations animal urine and urea based fertilizers uuf are the main nitrate sources in rural new zealand rather than haber bosch generated nitrate fertilizers used in other parts of the world most urine urea and ammonia fertilizers have δ 15n values less than 4 rogers 2008 an intermediate transition or mixing zone for urea urine ammonia fertilizers mixed uuf overlaps with the normal n retention nnr zone with δ 15n values from 4 to 9 mixed uuf contaminated groundwater or surface water either transitions unchanged through the nnr zone to the denitrification effluent zone or may mix with natural baseline nitrate containing groundwater or surface water in the nnr mixed uuf zone further diluting the original nitrate concentration prior to transitioning into the denitrification zone the δ 15n transition threshold from nnr mixed uuf to the denitrification effluent zone tends to be somewhat arbitrary and was set at 9 although many surface waters would still be classed as denitrified if it was set at 8 the higher cut off also allows for the inclusion of higher δ 15n values of recycled farm effluent that is redistributed during irrigation as a fertilizer on pasture li et al 2021 the denitrification effluent zone ranges from 9 to 28 the highest δ 1 5nno3 values are associated with effluent ponds and highly denitrified animal wastes that have been exposed to bacterial fractionation and 14n loss a range of denitrification slopes have previously been proposed nestler et al 2011 baily et al 2011 clague et al 2015 in new zealand denitrification shifts the δ 18o δ 15n ratio along a 1 1 slope although denitrified water mixed with fresh effluent samples lowers the slope towards a 1 2 gradient the biplot of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values from this study fig 6 a shows around 58 of groundwater and surface water samples fall in the nnr mixed uuf zone table 4 this zone contains either low level diffuse nitrate contaminants or background organic soil derived n samples 40 nnr but also contains mixed urine or urea fertilizer samples 18 mixed uuf which are distinguishable by their higher nitrate n concentrations and in some cases higher δ 1 8ono3 values fig 6 b the majority of the remaining samples are classified either as uuf 10 or baseline 8 due to their lower δ 15nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values no3 fertilizer 2 no3fert with high δ 1 8ono3 values or denitrified 18 denitrif and effluent 4 with decreasing no3 n concentrations and higher δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values beyond the obvious generalizations more positive δ 1 8ono3 values are seen at the top of the nnr mixed uuf zone representing samples that have higher nitrate n concentrations larger sample icons and are most likely derived from synthetic fertilizers which have higher δ 1 8ono3 values due to the incorporation of atmospheric oxygen δ 1 8oair of 23 5 through the haber bosch nitrate making process less positive δ 1 8ono3 values at the bottom of the nnr zone correspond either nnr baseline or uuf samples with lower nitrate n concentrations that are transitioning through to the denitrification zone or may become mixed with nnr or new uuf water in the effluent denitrification zone fig 6 a most groundwater samples have correspondingly lower nitrate n concentrations shown by smaller sample icons than in the nnr zone and more positive δ 1 5nno3 values due to 14n loss through bacterial removal or volatilization denitrification zone samples with lower nitrate concentrations and higher δ15n and δ18o values are clearly distinguishable from effluent samples with higher nitrate concentrations and less 15n and 18o enrichment fig 6 b nnr samples in the transition zone can be further distinguished from denitrification and mixed uuf samples by their lower nitrate concentrations and lower δ18ono3 values the δ 1 8ono3 values are primarily used to differentiate between fresh effluent or wastewater and denitrified samples in the effluent zone fresh effluent or wastewater samples fall into the lower part of the effluent zone as they may have been rapidly denitrified with preferential loss of 14n or mixed with groundwater or surface water which has lower δ 1 8oh2o values and undergone 18o exchange and consequently lower δ 1 8ono3 values denitrified samples undergo partial or total 18o exchange and both δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values subsequently become more positive according to the level of denitrification 1 2 partial or 1 1 total groundwater and surface water samples that plot in the uuf zone are characteristic of nitrified samples with lower δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values these values indicate that there is preservation of the nitrogenous sources due to an oxygenated environment and that denitrification has not occurred typically water containing animal waste ammonia or ammonium or dissolved organic nitrogen don from soil organic matter may undergo nitrification a process which converts ammonia ammonium or don compounds through bacterial action to nitrite then nitrate in these instances any nitrates formed from these samples have much lower δ 1 8ono3 values as they mix with water that has naturally lower δ 1 8oh2o values 12 to 4 synthetic fertiliser nitrates seen in the fertiliser no3 zone formed through the haber bosch process have much more positive δ18ono3 and δ 1 5nno3 values as they are manufactured from air which has an atmospheric oxygen δ18oatm value of c 23 5 and a δ 1 5nair value between 2 to 4 further mixing of synthetic fertilisers with surface or groundwater causes oxygen dissociation and exchange between the fertiliser and water 18o values which lowers the resulting δ18ono3 values nicolini et al 2016 plots of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 against nitrate n concentration shows the prevalence for the majority of groundwater samples to lie in the nnr mixed uuf zone fig 7 a and b however a number of groundwater samples are highly denitrified blue dots with δ15nno3 from 15 to 27 and have nitrate n 5 mg l a number of surface water samples orange dots display a lower level of denitrification with δ15nno3 values from 10 to 20 fig 7 a surface water does not tend to retain as much nitrate as groundwater and in general the isotopes do not usually reach the most enriched 15n values of groundwater mainly because of the isotopic regeneration in surface water via open system mixing with precipitation and available ecosystem uptake processes the prevalence for most surface water δ18ono3 values to be 10 also suggests that nitrate contamination is more likely to be uuf derived than fertilizer no3 derived fig 7 b 4 discussion a national review of new zealand s groundwater and surface water nitrates found the isotopic composition is regionally consistent with the majority of δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 values lying between 4 and 9 and 2 to 6 respectively in a nnr mixed uuf transition zone these samples consist of either nnr mixed uuf or samples either transitioning through to denitrification or nitrification highly denitrified δ 1 5nno3 and δ 18ono3 outlier samples are noted in some key farming regions such as waikato taupo horizons manawatu wairarapa and southland strong deviations from median δ 1 5nno3 values c 4 to 8 and δ 18 ono3 values c 2 to 6 represent an inability of the system to reset to natural background nitrate n levels primarily because there is continued n input ongoing contamination or the system is unable to assimilate or remove the available nitrate nitrate isotopes also give a strong indication of freshwater denitrification or nitrification ability which significantly modifies the δ 1 5nno3 values to more positive 10 or more negative 4 values respectively combined with the nitrate content dual δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 isotopes provide a guide to the level of other ongoing environmental and biological processes table 5 actual denitrification occurring as a single event will result in reduced nitrate n concentrations and more positive δ 1 5nno3 values as the nitrate is removed yet slow or older nitrate loads entering via a continuous input over time into the effluent or uuf zone will not only result in apparent denitrification ie increased δ 1 5nno3 values or nitrification ie reduced δ 1 5nno3 values but there will be little to no reduction in nitrate concentration over time table 5 furthermore increasing δ 1 5nno3 and δ 1 8ono3 values cannot always be attributed to denitrification of a single nitrate contaminant source or the assumption that closed system denitrification no exchange with nitrate entering or leaving the system occurs indeed more complex open systems exist where groundwater is continuously recycled or multiple n source inputs may occur denk et al 2017 stewart and aitchison earl 2020 contemporary anthropogenic nitrates such as animal waste sewage or fertilizers in surface water may mix with nitrate enriched groundwater that has been transported some distance from the initial contamination zone or source moreover old groundwater nitrate may have entered the system many years or decades prior and only be emerging after a significant time delay adding further complexity to understanding nitrate n loadings in these instances δ 18ono3 and δ 18oh2o isotopes become useful environmental indicators to tease out more complex contributions and identify which processes nitrification mineralization and denitrification dominate a system table 5 the pervasive nature of new zealand s freshwater nitrate is now a serious environmental concern from a health perspective our data shows that new zealand s groundwater is significantly affected by nitrate contamination with 58 of samples tested in this study having nitrate n concentrations exceeding 0 9 mg l and 33 of sites exceeding half mav of 5 6 mg l based on recent international research these levels pose a higher risk of colorectal cancers among communities consuming these sources schullehner et al 2018 espejo herrera et al 2016 temkin et al 2019 although there is conflicting opinion among new zealand researchers richards et al 2021 chambers and hales 2021 cressey and cridge 2021 cressey et al 2021 richards 2020 further robust epidemiological and experimental evidence is required to better understand the potential risk nitrate poses for colorectal cancer from an environmental and land use perspective nitrate exceedances not only occur in regions recognised for high intensity dairy farming waikato taupo taranaki wairarapa canterbury and southland but also in agricultural regions where annual cropping prevails higher nitrate concentrations are preferentially found in water associated with more porous lithology such as sand gravel pumice breccia and basalt and it is clear that not all nitrate n loads can be treated as equal as nitrate n is clearly dependant on different geological environmental and land use factors concurrently denitrification is highly associated with wastewater surface water and groundwater from higher intensity farming regions with a particular emphasis on high productive grassland estuaries and wetlands estuaries and wetland δ 15nno3 values consistently express background nnr denitrification zone isotope values δ 15nno3 values from 5 to 10 as the available vegetation and carbon rich soil assimilates any nitrate loads immediately high producing grasslands have the largest range of δ 15n values δ 1 5nno3 values from 11 6 to 42 5 indicating both denitrification and nitrification can actively take place depending on temperature rainfall soil redox potential and nitrate mobility the results from this survey indicate that nitrate isotopes δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 may be a useful tool to incorporate into nitrogen attenuation models at a regional or even catchment scale current nutrient budget tools commonly used in new zealand such as overseerfm murray and freeman 2017 account only for on farm nutrient losses via the root zone yet the isotopic fractionation of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values clearly indicate significant trends in groundwater and surface water denitrification based on catchment physical characteristics and geographical location it may be possible to fine tune these classifications to higher spatial resolution approaches such as catchments and sub catchments to inform nitrate remediation and assimilation capacity based on enrichment or depletion of 15n and 18o and determine their corresponding source inputs nitrate removal denitrification or sustained contamination nitrification depends on the ongoing level of n attenuation input and or removal via groundwater reduction and bacterial action which can be inferred by the isotopic signature and the nitrate concentration in new zealand seasonal precipitation patterns influence surface to groundwater interactions temporally integrating multiple nitrogenous pulses through different biochemical reactions and it is rare that leachable nitrate sources are completely removed 5 conclusion this study presents the first comprehensive national and regional new zealand baseline study of nitrate n concentrations and isotope data sampled across 1012 sites from 2010 to 2020 almost 60 of freshwater in this study had nitrate n concentrations 0 9 mg l a threshold that has been identified by overseas researchers as posing a higher risk of negative human health impacts nitrate isotopes show that the majority of nitrate samples lie in the nnr mixed uuf zone which is traditionally associated with soil organic n and low background nitrate n concentrations however this work demonstrates that in the new zealand context this zone is also an intermediate zone for urine and urea fertiliser uuf contaminated water from farming agriculture transitioning through to the denitrified zone or undergoing nitrification this mixing zone also allows uuf samples to combine with low or nitrate free water generating diffuse sources that are increasingly complex to identify using nitrate n concentration and isotopes in most instances a combination of dissolved gases such as n2 ne and ar age dating and tracer studies will be required to compliment the dual nitrate isotope approach to integrate groundwater transport and nitrate lag times the data collected in this survey not only describes the current status and source of new zealand s freshwater nitrate contamination but also provides clarification around the use of dual nitrate isotopes to understand nitrate transformation pathways unique to new zealand collectively this dataset provides a national overview that can be incorporated into freshwater models and used to inform policy through understanding regional variations affected by land use climate and geology the full pervasive extent of nitrates in new zealand freshwater systems are yet to be realised as many past studies have been catchment or regionally specific in longer established farming regions such as waikato wairarapa canterbury or southland rural development is now rapidly growing in lesser monitored regions such as northland hawkes bay marlborough and low lying arable regions between southland and canterbury and will benefit from this isotope approach nonetheless while dual nitrate isotopes can identify nitrate source attenuation and tease out time bound inputs on national scales in the future longer term regional monitoring integrating seasonal climatic and spatial specifics will further refine these interpretations credit authorship contribution statement karyne m rogers resources investigation

2328,drainage facilities such as drainage pumping systems and low impact development lid practices are effective measures to reduce urban flood risk the quantitative identification of their influence on the reduction of urban flood susceptibility ufs is of great significance in providing scientific references for urban flood control in this study we constructed a conceptual method to investigate the spatial variation of ufs based on the machine learning models i e convolution neural network cnn and support vector machine svm which has been tested in wuhan city of china with good performances after model evaluation we have quantitatively studied the impact of two flood mitigation measures pumping stations and lid practices on the ufs in particular we evaluated the ufs mitigation efficiency of several designed scenarios using different combinations of pump discharges and lid area fractions by comparing them against default scenarios we found a nonlinear negative response relation between the reduction of ufs with either the increase in pump discharge or lid area fractions the proportion of the area of highest susceptibility pah decreases as the pumping capacity increases and when the pumping capacity is 2 5 times the default condition the pah reduces to 45 from 73 7 of no pump stations and reaches its minimum value when the lid layout area is 100 of the whole region the pah can reduce to 51 from 67 7 of no lid the findings can be beneficial for the design of optimal preventative strategy to sufficiently reduces ufs keywords urban flood susceptibility machine learning pump stations low impact development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flood a recurring and destructive natural hazard around the world is occurring more frequently because of the changing climate and intensified human influence suriya and mudgal 2012 and has caused huge demographic and economic losses darabi et al 2019 some typical urban flood events include the 2015 2016 floods in the uk the 21 july 2012 beijing flood the 6 july 2016 wuhan flood and the 20 july 2021 zhengzhou flood in china which resulted in a huge economic loss of 5 billion gbp miller and hutchins 2017 yu et al 2020 20 billion cny qiu 2012 2 265 billion cny zeng et al 2020 and 65 5 billion cny dong et al 2022 respectively rapid urbanization has changed the underlying surface in recent years and made the affected areas more vulnerable to urban flood events wu et al 2020 many measurements can be undertaken to alleviate the losses from urban floods including structural and non structural measures in the meanwhile it is of great importance to obtain an early prediction and warning signal of urban flood susceptibility ufs i e the probability of urban flood occurrence and location of flood prone areas zhao et al 2019 so that people can take corresponding defensive measures for flood mitigation in highly susceptible areas lai et al 2016 generally the ufs can be obtained based on three kinds of models hydrodynamic models multi criteria decision analysis mcda models and machine learning ml models lyu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 urban hydrodynamic models such as swmm info works icm mike urban and lisflood fp bisht et al 2016 huong and pathirana 2013 koga et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 shaw et al 2021 sosa et al 2020 are popular in urban flood simulation with high accuracy and easy visualization zhou et al 2022 however abundant high resolution geographic hydrological and artificial facility data are required for model construction and validation so the hydrodynamic models are not feasible in data sparse urban areas caviedes voullième et al 2012 the mcda model such as analytic hierarchy process ahp kazakis et al 2015 often makes an optimal decision under a set of factors with multiple criteria mahmoud and gan 2018 it is simple to calculate and easily understood in the ufs assessment and can reflect the disaster risk situation in a large region bertilsson et al 2019 however most methods are based on experts experience and knowledge resulting in large subjectivity and uncertainty of the results ishizaka and labib 2009 ml is a data driven model without complex physical processes which is widely used in several fields aiken et al 2022 ge et al 2022 ghahramani 2015 especially for nonlinear multidimensional modeling problems mignot and dewals 2022 youssef et al 2022 to date many ml methods have been developed such as random forest rf rizeei et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis hong et al 2018 support vector machine svm zhao et al 2019 decision tree based models costache 2019 naive bayes ali et al 2020 and convolutional neural network cnn perol et al 2018 they were proved to be powerful and efficient for ufs assessment in highly urbanized terrain nguyen et al 2022 tang et al 2019 tang et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 drainage facilities low impact development lid practices and other non structures are important measures to alleviate ufs green et al 2021 li et al 2019 lid practices like rain gardens permeable pavements and many other practices can regulate surface runoff from the source and help improve resilience to ufs yang et al 2022 pump station drainage belongs to engineered structures distributed near the outfalls of the drainage network and can help to reduce the ufs by draining a large amount of rainfall that falls in an urban area from piped networks into nearby rivers and lakes the rational design of the discharge capacity of pumps could prevent the backwater effect and upstream overflowing yang et al 2019 yazdi et al 2016 previous studies mainly focused on the environmental and economic benefits assessment of lid practices such as its total capacity in reduction of runoff quantity or quality he et al 2022 yang et al 2022 optimization of lid combinations yu et al 2022 and their economic cost jia et al 2015 liu et al 2016 most of these studies use runoff volume reduction and flow peak reduction to quantify the effectiveness of different lid practices over a specific region rong et al 2021 whereas there might be a highly susceptible area even with low runoff thus the volume reduction cannot directly reflect the impact of lid on the ufs hua et al 2020 previous studies have focused more on the real time control rtc of single or few pump stations liu et al 2021b wang et al 2022 however it cannot be applied to all watersheds and the multi period optimization brings computational load lee et al 2017 a clear and systematic pump flow design can offset the time and cost limitations in more large scale complex urban drainage systems to determine the optimal alternative layout strategy the quantitative evaluation of the impact of drainage facilities and lid practices on ufs is of great significance it has become an essential step for urban flood mitigation and urban construction especially in a large scale urban region however this task remains a significant challenge because the commonly used hydrodynamic models require high precision input data and are limited by computing time computing cost size of the study area and difficult data acquisition green et al 2021 and the mcda has great subjectivity and uncertainty of the results therefore the ml model is considered beneficial in investigating the ufs evaluation at the urban scale in this study we develop a conceptual method based on the ml methods cnn and svm to investigate the ufs in space and to quantitatively separate the impact of pumping stations and lid practices on ufs the main objectives of this study are to i examine the efficiency of two commonly used ml models in the conceptual method ii quantitatively assess the impact of drainage pump stations and lid practices on the ufs in various designed scenarios iii find the optimal pump discharge and lid layout area strategy that have the highest effect on the ufs reduction we selected wuhan in china a stereotyped high ufs city with abundant pump stations and lid practices as our case study area to examine the performance of the developed method the integrated evaluation of constructed method can be used to design preventative strategies more scientific for urban flood risk management 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 study area wuhan 29 58 31 22 n 113 41 115 05 e is the capital city of hubei province in china covering an area of 8494 km2 fig 1 a wuhan city belongs to the north subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1280 9 mm and 73 of its precipitation occurs from may to october there are many rivers lakes and reservoirs in wuhan city with a water body area of approximately 2217 6 km2 accounting for about a quarter of the city s total land area wuhan has become one of the pilot cities under the sponge city program scp of china since 2015 and a comprehensive renovation has been carried out with the implementation of lid practices sixin district fig 1b and qingshan district fig 1c are the two demonstration regions of lid practices with areas of 15 5 km2 and 23 km2 respectively a total of 288 pilot projects including municipal roads community facilities green park space and the urban drainage system are constructed in the two regions to mitigate ufs and capture the pollutants 2 2 data the historical urban flood site information is collected from the bureau of water resources of wuhan municipality field surveys official news and the internet the heavy rain events with rainfall amounts exceeding 50 mm in 24 h defined by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration https www nmic gov cn in wuhan from 2013 to 2021 consist of 260 sites in total repeated sites for multiple flood events are merged the spatial distribution of these flooded sites is shown in fig 1 the daily rainfall data is collected at 10 meteorological stations from china meteorological forcing dataset https data cma cn during 1951 2019 the lid practices distribution is obtained from the sponge facility design document in 2020 and the drainage pumping systems distribution of wuhan in 2019 is obtained from the planning research institute of wuhan the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m is obtained from the earth science data systems https www earthdata nasa gov and the land use cover change lucc data with 30 m spatial resolution is obtained from the globeland30 http www globallandcover com the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data with 1 km spatial resolution is obtained from the earth science data systems https www earthdata nasa gov 2 3 the conceptual method of urban flood susceptibility ufs evaluation based on the machine learning method the conceptual method to investigate the ufs and separate the impact of pump stations and lid practices on the ufs includes three steps fig 2 1 the selection of the candidate sample datasets including flood inventories and explanatory factors affecting the ufs 2 the evaluation of the performance of the cnn and svm method to determine the most suitable model for the ufs assessment 3 the quantification of the impact of the pump stations and lid practices on the ufs under various designed scenarios the details of these steps are described below 2 3 1 data processing in this study nine explanatory factors are extracted to evaluate ufs including the annual maximum daily precipitation ap frequency of heavy rainstorms fp impervious rate imp elevation ev slope sl distance to river dtr normalized difference vegetation index ndvi low impact development lid and drainage pump stations pp all explanatory factors are calculated and resampled to 90 m 90 m spatial resolution based on arcgis 10 2 software these factors can be divided into three categories 1 rainfall extreme rainfall is the main disaster causing factor of urban floods zhang et al 2018 ap is the average of the annual maximum daily precipitation and fp is the frequency of heavy rainstorms throughout each pixel s time series ap and fp determine the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall occurrence and can directly influence ufs in this study a heavy rainstorm is defined as a day with a 24 hour rainfall amount that exceeds 50 mm zhao et al 2020 2 topography topography factors include five indices ev sl imp dtr and ndvi ev is the basic terrain factor that can be extracted directly from dem fig 3 c sl is the average slope between each pixel and its adjacent pixel it is calculated based on the toolbox in arcgis 10 2 software fig 3d the region with the larger ev and sl has less possibility of causing urban flooding imp is the proportion of impervious surface in a certain region and represents the infiltration capacity a region with a higher imp will retain more surface runoff the imp can be calculated using the empirical coefficients of various land covers fig 3e dtr is the minimum distance from the center of each grid to the nearest rive fig 3f places that are close to rivers and lakes are more likely to be invaded by floods tien bui et al 2019 ndvi can accurately display surface vegetation coverage and different soil surface characteristics have a diverse potential for water storage fig 3g 3 infrastructures pump stations and lid practices are the basic water conservancy facilities that can reflect the resistance to urban flood and the recovery ability and play an important role in urban flood prevention and disaster reduction according to the location and pumping capacity of pump stations the average pumping capacity per unit area of the corresponding control area is obtained fig 3h in this study the model considering lid practices are only carried out in qingshan and sixin district fig 1 specifically to simplify the calculation of the model lid is considered as an average state scenario in other words only considers the state with or without lid set as 1 or 0 in each pixel in the model fig 1b the flooded or non flooded sites are geo referenced in a digital map with arcgis 10 2 software and assigned a code of 1 or 0 the non flooded sites are sampled randomly with the same number as flooded sites for the convenience of comparing the two situations in the ufs analysis both the flooded and non flooded sites are randomly divided into two subsets for the training and testing accounting for 70 and 30 of the total number of sites respectively 2 3 2 convolutional neural network cnn and support vector machine svm the commonly used conventional machine learning model svm and the latest model cnn are chosen in the conceptual ufs quantification method respectively they have received widespread attention for their excellent performance in ufs assessment costache et al 2020 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020 schmidhuber 2015 2 3 2 1 cnn cnn is frequently used in image processing fields and prediction problems because of its excellent feature extraction and learning capacity lecun et al 1998 perol et al 2018 in this study the cnn s structure is mainly composed of five layers a the input layer nine explanatory factors are stacked together and comprise the sequential data as model inputs and they are described as v v 1 v 2 v 9 b the convolutional layer this layer consists of convolution kernels to extract the features from the complicated and nonlinear input datasets the output of the convolutional layer is the weighted sum of multiple inputs and can be calculated as 1 c j i 9 f w j v i β j j 1 2 k where f is the nonlinear function wj is the weight of the jth kernel k is the convolutional kernel size and is assigned as 3 according to wang et al 2020a in this study β is the bias and is the convolution operator c the pooling layer this layer is usually carried out after a convolutional layer and can avoid overfitting and reduce the length of feature vectors while retaining the critical information through a down sampling algorithm chen et al 2016 d the full connected layer is a simple multilayer perceptron in which the object is classified and the weights of vectors are learned liu et al 2021c e the output layer can transfer the detected vector into a prediction probability using softmax activation in this study the learning rate and the epochs could decide the performance of the cnn model to a certain degree as the learning rate controls the learning speed during the training process and the epochs mean the number of iterations of the model we set these optimal hyper parameters according to the literature the learning rate is set as 0 001 and the epochs as 200 chen et al 2021a khosravi et al 2020 nemni et al 2020 2 3 2 2 svm svm was first proposed by vladimir vapnik for classification and regression which is based on statistical learning theory vladimir n vapnik 1997 it is a supervised machine learning method to find an optimal separating hyperplane that considers nonlinear arrangements as linear arrangements between two individual sites classes roy et al 2020 yao et al 2008 in this study a sample dataset is constructed including flooded and non flooded sites these two classes are defined as different pixels on either side of the hyperplane and are assigned the value of 1 flooded sites and 0 non flooded sites the optimal separating hyperplane is calculated as follows wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 2 r w t x i b w 3 w t x i b 1 y i 1 w t x i b 1 y i 1 where x i i 1 2 n n is the number of training samples and y i 0 1 represents the samples of flooded or non flooded w represents the direction of the hyper plane and b represents the distance from the origin to the plane in addition r represents the distance from xi to the hyper plane a selection of suitable mathematical kernel types is the most important step to achieving high classification accuracy of the training dataset sutao et al 2011 previous studies have proved that radial basis function rbf is the best performing on ufs compared to other types of kernel methods such as polynomial pl sigmoid sig and linear ln the rbf kernel provides a better generalization with only a few parameters that directly influence the function s complexity meanwhile it can deal with multiple dataset dimensionalities which conform to the characteristics of the dataset of this study xu et al 2012 youssef et al 2022 the objective function can be rewritten as 4 min w b 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i 5 s t y i w t ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ζi is the slack variable and represents the acceptable deviation between the function margin and data xi c is a parameter that controls the weight of the penalty term in the objective function and ϕ x is a transformed function to fit the maximum margin hyperplane in a high dimensional space 2 3 3 description of realistic scenarios and designed scenarios to find the individual impact of lid practices and drainage pump stations on ufs we designed six scenarios that represent the minimum default and maximum strategies of the two measures in this study lid1 lid2 and lid3 represent three different lid layout area schemes with 0 37 3 and 100 lid fractions respectively pp1 pp2 and pp3 represent three different pump station operation scenarios with no drainage discharge default drainage discharge and enhanced drainage discharge i e m times of default values respectively the specific value of m can be determined by the state of pump discharge having the maximum impact on ufs in the realistic situation the lid practices are distributed in sixin district and qingshan district with approximately 37 3 layout area of the two districts fig 1 the drainage region of the pump stations is mainly in the central city fig 3h therefore the comparison of various scenarios is mainly focused on the corresponding region of the two measures that is to say the default drainage scenario is based on the current lid layout strategy and the default lid scenario is based on the current drainage discharge 2 3 4 quantification of the ufs to quantify the impact of the pump stations and lid practices on the ufs and find the potential relationship between the infrastructures and their impacts we designed scenarios of different drainage pumping discharges and lid layout areas with an increment interval of 0 2 times default drainage discharge 10 of the typical sponge demonstration area respectively specifically the lid scenarios are randomly laid on the pixels assigned as 0 or 1 representing the area without or with lid practices we quantify the ufs of different scenarios with the index named the proportion of the area of highest susceptibility pah which can be calculated as the area given the highest susceptible level divided by the total study area the pah value can reflect the impact of different pump stations and lid practices on ufs 2 3 5 evaluation metrics the receiver operating characteristics roc is one of the most used measures to evaluate the performance of ml models chen et al 2021b a roc curve is a graphical produced by the relationship between a true and false positive rates chen et al 2020 the area under the roc curve auc is often used to quantitatively evaluate the probability that a record is accurately differentiated from a random point in the predetermined context the range of the auc varies from 0 5 to 1 0 and the closer auc to 1 indicates the better model performance chapi et al 2017 in this study we also use four indices to evaluate the model performances costache et al 2022 6 p tp tp f p 7 r tp tp f n 8 acc tp t n tp f p t n f n 9 f 2 p r p r where precision p recall r and f score f represent the prediction performance of flooded sites acc represents the samples correctly predicted in the training and testing process true positive tp is the number of a positive sample flooded sites correctly predicted true negative tn is the number of a negative sample non flooded sites correctly predicted false positive fp is the number of negative samples incorrectly predicted as a positive sample false negative fn is the number of positive samples incorrectly predicted as a negative sample based on a confusion matrix we can find a preliminary good model performance with a higher tp and a lower fp then the four indices are closer to 1 indicating the model s good performance 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model performance both cnn and svm have good performances in urban flood sites prediction from the statistical measures in table 1 and fig 4 and can be used to predict the ufs in the study area the cnn model and svm show better performance of all indices during the training and testing period respectively it is worth noting that the difference between the performance of the two models is minor furthermore fig 4 shows that the auc value of the cnn model in the training 0 9917 and testing 0 9670 period is slightly higher than that of the svm model 0 9857 in training and 0 9619 in testing indicating a slightly better performance of cnn model than the svm model in the study area 3 2 comparison of the ufs map in this study the ufs maps generated under the default situation of lid practices and pump stations are divided into five classes lowest low moderate high and highest based on the natural break method in arcgis 10 2 software chapi et al 2017 chen et al 2020 pham et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2020 the ufs maps produced by cnn and svm models in fig 5 a and b show that the areas with high susceptibility and highest susceptibility in wuhan are located along water body in addition the susceptibility of the central city is higher than that of the suburb as the area fraction of the highest susceptible level is 65 80 in the central city this result can be confirmed based on different models by other studies du et al 2022 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021d which also indicated that the central and southeast sub districts of wuhan could be easily affected by the urban flood table 2 shows the statistical results of three indices including the area ratio of each susceptibility class the number of flooded sites located in each susceptible area and the ratio of flooded sites per unit susceptible area this result indicates a relatively high consistency between historical flooded sites and susceptible areas for the svm model 54 82 of the study area is in the lowest susceptible area 12 41 8 55 6 64 and 17 58 are in the low moderate high and highest susceptible areas respectively for the cnn model 45 09 of the study area is located in the very low susceptible area 14 99 16 85 9 42 and 13 65 are in the low moderate high and highest susceptible areas respectively furthermore although svm has more flooded sites 238 sites than the cnn model 222 sites in the highest susceptible area the area of this level predicted by the svm model 17 58 is higher than that predicted by the cnn model 13 65 therefore the ratio of the svm model 13 54 is lower than that predicted by the cnn model 16 26 it can be reasonably stated that the ufs produced by the cnn model is more reliable compared with the svm model with the combined consideration of the performance of cnn and svm models in section 3 1 we give further analysis in the following section using the cnn model 3 3 impact assessment of drainage pump station and lid on ufs 3 3 1 nonlinear impact of pump stations and lid on ufs we can observe that both pump discharge and lid layout area are nonlinearly correlated with pah fig 6 specifically pah decreased slowly when the pumping discharge is between 1 6 and 2 2 times the default pump scenario the pah changes little when pumping discharge reaches 2 5 times default pump scenario fig 6a as for the lid layout area the pah continuously decreases with the increase of lid layout area if the proportion is between 0 and 50 then it almost unchanges until the proportion area reaches 100 fig 6b based on the nonlinear relationship we can find the optimal pump discharge 2 5 times default pump scenario and lid layout area 100 of the study area strategy that have the highest effect on the ufs in these situations the region becomes saturated in this way we can carry out the pp3 scenario designed in section 2 3 3 is 2 5 times discharge of the default scenario m 2 5 generally the impact threshold of pah for the pump stations is 0 45 and the lid practices is 0 51 3 3 2 comparison of susceptible areas under different scenarios the trained cnn model is used to simulate six scenarios designed in section 2 3 3 the lid scenarios are based on default pump capacity in two districts sixin district and qingshan district and the pump effects are focused on the pump drainage region mainly in the central city with a default lid layout strategy the results of different ufs levels of different scenarios are counted under the condition of the annual average rainfall fig 7 the highest susceptible area under the lid2 scenario 61 67 and lid3 scenario 51 11 was reduced by 6 03 and 16 59 compared to the lid1 scenario 67 70 respectively the lowest susceptible area under the lid2 scenario 17 58 and lid3 scenario 28 51 increased by 7 07 and 18 00 compared to the lid1 scenario 10 51 respectively this indicates that the layout area of lid can have a certain effect on reducing the ufs similarly the highest susceptible area under the pp2 scenario 63 71 and pp3 scenario 45 06 was reduced by 10 02 and 28 6 compared to the pp1 scenario 73 69 respectively the lowest susceptible area under the pp2 scenario 6 91 and pp3 scenario 9 35 increased by 5 68 and 8 12 compared to the pp1 scenario 1 23 respectively this indicates that the drainage pump station significantly reduces ufs especially in the highest susceptible area therefore the increase of lid area fractions could increase the lowest susceptible areas while the increase in the capacity of pump stations in the study area can largely mitigate high susceptible areas of urban flood it proves that pump stations play a significant role in controlling urban flood fig 8a1 c1 shows a slight change under scenarios of lid1 to lid3 in sixin district a very small part of the low susceptible area becomes the lowest susceptible level fig 8 d1 f1 illustrates the spatial variation of lid effects although the ufs difference between lid1 and lid3 is slightly more obvious while 100 lid layout area could not reduce the ufs level of sixin district there remain high susceptible areas due to geographical location and drainage system which indicates a limited impact of lid practices on ufs however there are different effects in qingshan district fig 8a2 c2 shows that some highest susceptible areas turn to high ufs level and most low susceptible areas turn to the lowest the comparison between fig 8f2 and fig 8d2 suggests a better ufs reduction effect in highly susceptible areas fig 9a c shows that the drainage region is mainly in the highest susceptible area under pp1 and pp2 scenarios while in the lowest susceptible area under pp3 indicating that the capacity of pump stations can reduce the ufs to a large extent only a tiny portion of the area under pp2 appears to be the lowest susceptible area while large portion of areas is in the highest susceptible area this proves that the default drainage system could be optimized the reduction effect on ufs is maximized when the pump discharge increases to a state consistent with the pp3 scenario in which most areas show the lowest susceptibility with default pp2 and enhanced pp3 pumping capacity 3 48 and 20 68 of areas in the highest ufs level were reduced to the lowest ufs level respectively the spatial comparison illustrates that the default pumping scenario can only help mitigate ufs near the water body and the maximum scenario can help mitigate the ufs in almost the whole drainage region fig 9 d f shows an obvious increase in the ufs reduction effect in most areas with many pump stations indicating that the optimization of the drainage pumping system significantly impacts the ufs therefore it can be reasonably stated that both the pump stations and lid practices can significantly reduce the ufs especially in the highest susceptible area however the increase of the pump discharge can largely mitigate high susceptible areas of urban flood while the impact of lid layout area is limited it is necessary to find an optimal strategy that reasonably combines drainage facilities and lid practices to alleviate urban flood effectively 4 discussion 4 1 application of machine learning to ufs this study developed a conceptual method for quantitatively assessing the impact of lid practices and drainage pump stations on ufs with the machine learning method the application of the ml model is proven to improve the accuracy of ufs prediction especially in data sparse urban areas balogun et al 2022 darabi et al 2021 pham et al 2021 rafiei sardooi et al 2021 shahabi et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 in the same study area an integrated internet media method zeng et al 2020 particle swarm optimization pso and weakly labeled support vector machine wellsvm method du et al 2022 and the ahp method li et al 2021 are used to generate ufs map while lacking further quantitative study on flood influencing factors moreover the ml models are more objective than mcda in integrating multiple factors in ufs assessment and as flexible as the mcda models li et al 2020 most previous studies use the hydrodynamic models under limited scenarios and require high resolution data and preprocessing which limits its application on a large spatial scale especially in our study with an area of 8494 km2 however the ml models could reduce the complexity of hydrodynamic models and provide a more efficient solution for ufs assessment the ufs assessments are highly data reliant and the location of samples collected from field surveys and the internet might need to be more accurate liu et al 2021a noymanee et al 2017 which would affect the assessment accuracy the ml model could not simulate the complex hydrological process zahura et al 2020 and the trained model would meet the local minimum dilemma during the simulation li et al 2020 moreover the learning process is completely based on collected samples it does not include flooded sites in extreme cases and would not perform well in predicting extreme cases prosdocimi et al 2015 nevertheless the increased attention to the ml model might serve as an opportunity to broadly drive conversations in our field about the limits of disaster data 4 2 ufs reduction of drainage pump stations and lid practices in this study we find a nonlinear response relation between the reduction rate of ufs with the increase in pump discharges or lid areas thus determining the impact threshold previous studies focused on providing a simple rate of relative reduction of lid and pump stations or simply studying the changes in ufs based on statistical or hydrodynamic methods baek et al 2015 webber et al 2022 yang et al 2021 however they are difficult to be used to understand the interior distribution of susceptibility and determine the exact locations for flood defense zhang et al 2021 while the quantitative impact on ufs in large areas even trend analysis has been seldom explored to sufficiently address the increasing requirements for the accuracy and depth of susceptibility analysis the integrated method to explore the detailed nonlinear regularities is first proposed to find the most effective design we find that the optimal strategy for lids and pump station is when the lid area is 50 of the study area and the pump discharge is 2 2 times the default pump drainage discharge although the pah is not the final threshold the strategy with the maximum reduction rate have advantages in economic decision analysis there will be no greater improvement if the pump discharge or lid layout areas increase this result confirmed the conclusion given by yin et al 2020 who illustrated that lid practices can reduce runoff volume to a limited extent the result can provide suggestions for the design of the lid layout area and drainage pumping discharge which can help to respond positively to flood disasters and take targeted measures in practical projects 5 conclusions drainage facilities such as pump stations and lid are effective measures to reduce urban flood this study investigates the ufs spatially and quantitatively separates the impact of pump stations and lid practices in wuhan we proposed a new conceptual ufs quantification method based on machine learning techniques with two options cnn svm and designed various scenarios of different pump capacities and lid area fractions it is used to assess ufs reduction and could assist in flood mitigation and management the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 two options cnn and svm in the proposed method both have good performances in ufs but the cnn model auc 0 9670 is slightly higher than that of svm auc 0 9619 moreover the cnn model has a relatively higher consistency between historical flooded sites and susceptible areas 2 13 65 of wuhan city is in the highest ufs level and 65 80 of the central city by default the most susceptible areas in wuhan are located in the central city especially along lakes and rivers with default and maximum lid 6 03 and 16 59 of highest ufs have been reduced 7 07 and 18 00 of lowest ufs have been increased respectively the maximum lid area could reduce the ufs probability by up to 0 26 3 with default and enhanced pumping scenarios 10 02 and 28 6 of highest ufs have been reduced among which 3 48 and 20 68 of areas in the highest ufs level were reduced to the lowest ufs level respectively the default pumping scenario can only help mitigate ufs near the river and the maximum scenario can help mitigate the ufs in almost the whole drainage region 4 drainage pump stations and lid practices have a nonlinear effect on ufs in that the reduction capacity is higher when the lid layout area or pump discharge increases within a reasonable range area proportion between 0 and 50 or 0 2 2 times of basic pumping scenario then it becomes the same when reaches a certain level area proportion between 100 or 2 5 times basic pumping scenario 5 under the condition of the annual average rainfall when the pumping capacity is 2 5 times of the default condition the pah reaches its minimum threshold and can be reduced to 45 when the lid layout area is 100 of the whole region the pah can be reduced to 51 the ufs assessments are highly data reliant we can collect more up to date flood inventories in the future furthermore the suggestion on the design of the lid layout area and drainage pumping discharge based on the conceptual ufs quantification method can also be applied in other flood prone areas as an alternative way for the policy making on the other hand given more current studies on lid optimization layout strategy huang et al 2022 wang et al 2020b we can make further lid combination and layout analysis combing the machine learning in future works credit authorship

2328,drainage facilities such as drainage pumping systems and low impact development lid practices are effective measures to reduce urban flood risk the quantitative identification of their influence on the reduction of urban flood susceptibility ufs is of great significance in providing scientific references for urban flood control in this study we constructed a conceptual method to investigate the spatial variation of ufs based on the machine learning models i e convolution neural network cnn and support vector machine svm which has been tested in wuhan city of china with good performances after model evaluation we have quantitatively studied the impact of two flood mitigation measures pumping stations and lid practices on the ufs in particular we evaluated the ufs mitigation efficiency of several designed scenarios using different combinations of pump discharges and lid area fractions by comparing them against default scenarios we found a nonlinear negative response relation between the reduction of ufs with either the increase in pump discharge or lid area fractions the proportion of the area of highest susceptibility pah decreases as the pumping capacity increases and when the pumping capacity is 2 5 times the default condition the pah reduces to 45 from 73 7 of no pump stations and reaches its minimum value when the lid layout area is 100 of the whole region the pah can reduce to 51 from 67 7 of no lid the findings can be beneficial for the design of optimal preventative strategy to sufficiently reduces ufs keywords urban flood susceptibility machine learning pump stations low impact development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban flood a recurring and destructive natural hazard around the world is occurring more frequently because of the changing climate and intensified human influence suriya and mudgal 2012 and has caused huge demographic and economic losses darabi et al 2019 some typical urban flood events include the 2015 2016 floods in the uk the 21 july 2012 beijing flood the 6 july 2016 wuhan flood and the 20 july 2021 zhengzhou flood in china which resulted in a huge economic loss of 5 billion gbp miller and hutchins 2017 yu et al 2020 20 billion cny qiu 2012 2 265 billion cny zeng et al 2020 and 65 5 billion cny dong et al 2022 respectively rapid urbanization has changed the underlying surface in recent years and made the affected areas more vulnerable to urban flood events wu et al 2020 many measurements can be undertaken to alleviate the losses from urban floods including structural and non structural measures in the meanwhile it is of great importance to obtain an early prediction and warning signal of urban flood susceptibility ufs i e the probability of urban flood occurrence and location of flood prone areas zhao et al 2019 so that people can take corresponding defensive measures for flood mitigation in highly susceptible areas lai et al 2016 generally the ufs can be obtained based on three kinds of models hydrodynamic models multi criteria decision analysis mcda models and machine learning ml models lyu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 urban hydrodynamic models such as swmm info works icm mike urban and lisflood fp bisht et al 2016 huong and pathirana 2013 koga et al 2016 palla and gnecco 2015 shaw et al 2021 sosa et al 2020 are popular in urban flood simulation with high accuracy and easy visualization zhou et al 2022 however abundant high resolution geographic hydrological and artificial facility data are required for model construction and validation so the hydrodynamic models are not feasible in data sparse urban areas caviedes voullième et al 2012 the mcda model such as analytic hierarchy process ahp kazakis et al 2015 often makes an optimal decision under a set of factors with multiple criteria mahmoud and gan 2018 it is simple to calculate and easily understood in the ufs assessment and can reflect the disaster risk situation in a large region bertilsson et al 2019 however most methods are based on experts experience and knowledge resulting in large subjectivity and uncertainty of the results ishizaka and labib 2009 ml is a data driven model without complex physical processes which is widely used in several fields aiken et al 2022 ge et al 2022 ghahramani 2015 especially for nonlinear multidimensional modeling problems mignot and dewals 2022 youssef et al 2022 to date many ml methods have been developed such as random forest rf rizeei et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis hong et al 2018 support vector machine svm zhao et al 2019 decision tree based models costache 2019 naive bayes ali et al 2020 and convolutional neural network cnn perol et al 2018 they were proved to be powerful and efficient for ufs assessment in highly urbanized terrain nguyen et al 2022 tang et al 2019 tang et al 2021 zahura et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 drainage facilities low impact development lid practices and other non structures are important measures to alleviate ufs green et al 2021 li et al 2019 lid practices like rain gardens permeable pavements and many other practices can regulate surface runoff from the source and help improve resilience to ufs yang et al 2022 pump station drainage belongs to engineered structures distributed near the outfalls of the drainage network and can help to reduce the ufs by draining a large amount of rainfall that falls in an urban area from piped networks into nearby rivers and lakes the rational design of the discharge capacity of pumps could prevent the backwater effect and upstream overflowing yang et al 2019 yazdi et al 2016 previous studies mainly focused on the environmental and economic benefits assessment of lid practices such as its total capacity in reduction of runoff quantity or quality he et al 2022 yang et al 2022 optimization of lid combinations yu et al 2022 and their economic cost jia et al 2015 liu et al 2016 most of these studies use runoff volume reduction and flow peak reduction to quantify the effectiveness of different lid practices over a specific region rong et al 2021 whereas there might be a highly susceptible area even with low runoff thus the volume reduction cannot directly reflect the impact of lid on the ufs hua et al 2020 previous studies have focused more on the real time control rtc of single or few pump stations liu et al 2021b wang et al 2022 however it cannot be applied to all watersheds and the multi period optimization brings computational load lee et al 2017 a clear and systematic pump flow design can offset the time and cost limitations in more large scale complex urban drainage systems to determine the optimal alternative layout strategy the quantitative evaluation of the impact of drainage facilities and lid practices on ufs is of great significance it has become an essential step for urban flood mitigation and urban construction especially in a large scale urban region however this task remains a significant challenge because the commonly used hydrodynamic models require high precision input data and are limited by computing time computing cost size of the study area and difficult data acquisition green et al 2021 and the mcda has great subjectivity and uncertainty of the results therefore the ml model is considered beneficial in investigating the ufs evaluation at the urban scale in this study we develop a conceptual method based on the ml methods cnn and svm to investigate the ufs in space and to quantitatively separate the impact of pumping stations and lid practices on ufs the main objectives of this study are to i examine the efficiency of two commonly used ml models in the conceptual method ii quantitatively assess the impact of drainage pump stations and lid practices on the ufs in various designed scenarios iii find the optimal pump discharge and lid layout area strategy that have the highest effect on the ufs reduction we selected wuhan in china a stereotyped high ufs city with abundant pump stations and lid practices as our case study area to examine the performance of the developed method the integrated evaluation of constructed method can be used to design preventative strategies more scientific for urban flood risk management 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 study area wuhan 29 58 31 22 n 113 41 115 05 e is the capital city of hubei province in china covering an area of 8494 km2 fig 1 a wuhan city belongs to the north subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1280 9 mm and 73 of its precipitation occurs from may to october there are many rivers lakes and reservoirs in wuhan city with a water body area of approximately 2217 6 km2 accounting for about a quarter of the city s total land area wuhan has become one of the pilot cities under the sponge city program scp of china since 2015 and a comprehensive renovation has been carried out with the implementation of lid practices sixin district fig 1b and qingshan district fig 1c are the two demonstration regions of lid practices with areas of 15 5 km2 and 23 km2 respectively a total of 288 pilot projects including municipal roads community facilities green park space and the urban drainage system are constructed in the two regions to mitigate ufs and capture the pollutants 2 2 data the historical urban flood site information is collected from the bureau of water resources of wuhan municipality field surveys official news and the internet the heavy rain events with rainfall amounts exceeding 50 mm in 24 h defined by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration https www nmic gov cn in wuhan from 2013 to 2021 consist of 260 sites in total repeated sites for multiple flood events are merged the spatial distribution of these flooded sites is shown in fig 1 the daily rainfall data is collected at 10 meteorological stations from china meteorological forcing dataset https data cma cn during 1951 2019 the lid practices distribution is obtained from the sponge facility design document in 2020 and the drainage pumping systems distribution of wuhan in 2019 is obtained from the planning

lucc data with 30 m spatial resolution is obtained from the globeland30 http www globallandcover com the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data with 1 km spatial resolution is obtained from the earth science data systems https www earthdata nasa gov 2 3 the conceptual method of urban flood susceptibility ufs evaluation based on the machine learning method the conceptual method to investigate the ufs and separate the impact of pump stations and lid practices on the ufs includes three steps fig 2 1 the selection of the candidate sample datasets including flood inventories and explanatory factors affecting the ufs 2 the evaluation of the performance of the cnn and svm method to determine the most suitable model for the ufs assessment 3 the quantification of the impact of the pump stations and lid practices on the ufs under various designed scenarios the details of these steps are described below 2 3 1 data processing in this study nine explanatory factors are extracted to evaluate ufs including the annual maximum daily precipitation ap frequency of heavy rainstorms fp impervious rate imp elevation ev slope sl distance to river dtr normalized difference vegetation index ndvi low impact development lid and drainage pump stations pp all explanatory factors are calculated and resampled to 90 m 90 m spatial resolution based on arcgis 10 2 software these factors can be divided into three categories 1 rainfall extreme rainfall is the main disaster causing factor of urban floods zhang et al 2018 ap is the average of the annual maximum daily precipitation and fp is the frequency of heavy rainstorms throughout each pixel s time series ap and fp determine the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall occurrence and can directly influence ufs in this study a heavy rainstorm is defined as a day with a 24 hour rainfall amount that exceeds 50 mm zhao et al 2020 2 topography topography factors include five indices ev sl imp dtr and ndvi ev is the basic terrain factor that can be extracted directly from dem fig 3 c sl is the average slope between each pixel and its adjacent pixel it is calculated based on the toolbox in arcgis 10 2 software fig 3d the region with the larger ev and sl has less possibility of causing urban flooding imp is the proportion of impervious surface in a certain region and represents the infiltration capacity a region with a higher imp will retain more surface runoff the imp can be calculated using the empirical coefficients of various land covers fig 3e dtr is the minimum distance from the center of each grid to the nearest rive fig 3f places that are close to rivers and lakes are more likely to be invaded by floods tien bui et al 2019 ndvi can accurately display surface vegetation coverage and different soil surface characteristics have a diverse potential for water storage fig 3g 3 infrastructures pump stations and lid practices are the basic water conservancy facilities that can reflect the resistance to urban flood and the recovery ability and play an important role in urban flood prevention and disaster reduction according to the location and pumping capacity of pump stations the average pumping capacity per unit area of the corresponding control area is obtained fig 3h in this study the model considering lid practices are only carried out in qingshan and sixin district fig 1 specifically to simplify the calculation of the model lid is considered as an average state scenario in other words only considers the state with or without lid set as 1 or 0 in each pixel in the model fig 1b the flooded or non flooded sites are geo referenced in a digital map with arcgis 10 2 software and assigned a code of 1 or 0 the non flooded sites are sampled randomly with the same number as flooded sites for the convenience of comparing the two situations in the ufs analysis both the flooded and non flooded sites are randomly divided into two subsets for the training and testing accounting for 70 and 30 of the total number of sites respectively 2 3 2 convolutional neural network cnn and support vector machine svm the commonly used conventional machine learning model svm and the latest model cnn are chosen in the conceptual ufs quantification method respectively they have received widespread attention for their excellent performance in ufs assessment costache et al 2020 gudiyangada nachappa et al 2020 schmidhuber 2015 2 3 2 1 cnn cnn is frequently used in image processing fields and prediction problems because of its excellent feature extraction and learning capacity lecun et al 1998 perol et al 2018 in this study the cnn s structure is mainly composed of five layers a the input layer nine explanatory factors are stacked together and comprise the sequential data as model inputs and they are described as v v 1 v 2 v 9 b the convolutional layer this layer consists of convolution kernels to extract the features from the complicated and nonlinear input datasets the output of the convolutional layer is the weighted sum of multiple inputs and can be calculated as 1 c j i 9 f w j v i β j j 1 2 k where f is the nonlinear function wj is the weight of the jth kernel k is the convolutional kernel size and is assigned as 3 according to wang et al 2020a in this study β is the bias and is the convolution operator c the pooling layer this layer is usually carried out after a convolutional layer and can avoid overfitting and reduce the length of feature vectors while retaining the critical information through a down sampling algorithm chen et al 2016 d the full connected layer is a simple multilayer perceptron in which the object is classified and the weights of vectors are learned liu et al 2021c e the output layer can transfer the detected vector into a prediction probability using softmax activation in this study the learning rate and the epochs could decide the performance of the cnn model to a certain degree as the learning rate controls the learning speed during the training process and the epochs mean the number of iterations of the model we set these optimal hyper parameters according to the literature the learning rate is set as 0 001 and the epochs as 200 chen et al 2021a khosravi et al 2020 nemni et al 2020 2 3 2 2 svm svm was first proposed by vladimir vapnik for classification and regression which is based on statistical learning theory vladimir n vapnik 1997 it is a supervised machine learning method to find an optimal separating hyperplane that considers nonlinear arrangements as linear arrangements between two individual sites classes roy et al 2020 yao et al 2008 in this study a sample dataset is constructed including flooded and non flooded sites these two classes are defined as different pixels on either side of the hyperplane and are assigned the value of 1 flooded sites and 0 non flooded sites the optimal separating hyperplane is calculated as follows wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 2 r w t x i b w 3 w t x i b 1 y i 1 w t x i b 1 y i 1 where x i i 1 2 n n is the number of training samples and y i 0 1 represents the samples of flooded or non flooded w represents the direction of the hyper plane and b represents the distance from the origin to the plane in addition r represents the distance from xi to the hyper plane a selection of suitable mathematical kernel types is the most important step to achieving high classification accuracy of the training dataset sutao et al 2011 previous studies have proved that radial basis function rbf is the best performing on ufs compared to other types of kernel methods such as polynomial pl sigmoid sig and linear ln the rbf kernel provides a better generalization with only a few parameters that directly influence the function s complexity meanwhile it can deal with multiple dataset dimensionalities which conform to the characteristics of the dataset of this study xu et al 2012 youssef et al 2022 the objective function can be rewritten as 4 min w b 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i 5 s t y i w t ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ζi is the slack variable and represents the acceptable deviation between the function margin and data xi c is a parameter that controls the weight of the penalty term in the objective function and ϕ x is a transformed function to fit the maximum margin hyperplane in a high dimensional space 2 3 3 description of realistic scenarios and designed scenarios to find the individual impact of lid practices and drainage pump stations on ufs we designed six scenarios that represent the minimum default and maximum strategies of the two measures in this study lid1 lid2 and lid3 represent three different lid layout area schemes with 0 37 3 and 100 lid fractions respectively pp1 pp2 and pp3 represent three different pump station operation scenarios with no drainage discharge default drainage discharge and enhanced drainage discharge i e m times of default values respectively the specific value of m can be determined by the state of pump discharge having the maximum impact on ufs in the realistic situation the lid practices are distributed in sixin district and qingshan district with approximately 37 3 layout area of the two districts fig 1 the drainage region of the pump stations is mainly in the central city fig 3h therefore the comparison of various scenarios is mainly focused on the corresponding region of the two measures that is to say the default drainage scenario is based on the current lid layout strategy and the default lid scenario is based on the current drainage discharge 2 3 4 quantification of the ufs to quantify the impact of the pump stations and lid practices on the ufs and find the potential relationship between the infrastructures and their impacts we designed scenarios of different drainage pumping discharges and lid layout areas with an increment interval of 0 2 times default drainage discharge 10 of the typical sponge demonstration area respectively specifically the lid scenarios are randomly laid on the pixels assigned as 0 or 1 representing the area without or with lid practices we quantify the ufs of different scenarios with the index named the proportion of the area of highest susceptibility pah which can be calculated as the area given the highest susceptible level divided by the total study area the pah value can reflect the impact of different pump stations and lid practices on ufs 2 3 5 evaluation metrics the receiver operating characteristics roc is one of the most used measures to evaluate the performance of ml models chen et al 2021b a roc curve is a graphical produced by the relationship between a true and false positive rates chen et al 2020 the area under the roc curve auc is often used to quantitatively evaluate the probability that a record is accurately differentiated from a random point in the predetermined context the range of the auc varies from 0 5 to 1 0 and the closer auc to 1 indicates the better model performance chapi et al 2017 in this study we also use four indices to evaluate the model performances costache et al 2022 6 p tp tp f p 7 r tp tp f n 8 acc tp t n tp f p t n f n 9 f 2 p r p r where precision p recall r and f score f represent the prediction performance of flooded sites acc represents the samples correctly predicted in the training and testing process true positive tp is the number of a positive sample flooded sites correctly predicted true negative tn is the number of a negative sample non flooded sites correctly predicted false positive fp is the number of negative samples incorrectly predicted as a positive sample false negative fn is the number of positive samples incorrectly predicted as a negative sample based on a confusion matrix we can find a preliminary good model performance with a higher tp and a lower fp then the four indices are closer to 1 indicating the model s good performance 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model performance both cnn and svm have good performances in urban flood sites prediction from the statistical measures in table 1 and fig 4 and can be used to predict the ufs in the study area the cnn model and svm show better performance of all indices during the training and testing period respectively it is worth noting that the difference between the performance of the two models is minor furthermore fig 4 shows that the auc value of the cnn model in the training 0 9917 and testing 0 9670 period is slightly higher than that of the svm model 0 9857 in training and 0 9619 in testing indicating a slightly better performance of cnn model than the svm model in the study area 3 2 comparison of the ufs map in this study the ufs maps generated under the default situation of lid practices and pump stations are divided into five classes lowest low moderate high and highest based on the natural break method in arcgis 10 2 software chapi et al 2017 chen et al 2020 pham et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2020 the ufs maps produced by cnn and svm models in fig 5 a and b show that the areas with high susceptibility and highest susceptibility in wuhan are located along water body in addition the susceptibility of the central city is higher than that of the suburb as the area fraction of the highest susceptible level is 65 80 in the central city this result can be confirmed based on different models by other studies du et al 2022 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021d which also indicated that the central and southeast sub districts of wuhan could be easily affected by the urban flood table 2 shows the statistical results of three indices including the area ratio of each susceptibility class the number of flooded sites located in each susceptible area and the ratio of flooded sites per unit susceptible area this result indicates a relatively high consistency between historical flooded sites and susceptible areas for the svm model 54 82 of the study area is in the lowest susceptible area 12 41 8 55 6 64 and 17 58 are in the low moderate high and highest susceptible areas respectively for the cnn model 45 09 of the study area is located in the very low susceptible area 14 99 16 85 9 42 and 13 65 are in the low moderate high and highest susceptible areas respectively furthermore although svm has more flooded sites 238 sites than the cnn model 222 sites in the highest susceptible area the area of this level predicted by the svm model 17 58 is higher than that predicted by the cnn model 13 65 therefore the ratio of the svm model 13 54 is lower than that predicted by the cnn model 16 26 it can be reasonably stated that the ufs produced by the cnn model is more reliable compared with the svm model with the combined consideration of the performance of cnn and svm models in section 3 1 we give further analysis in the following section using the cnn model 3 3 impact assessment of drainage pump station and lid on ufs 3 3 1 nonlinear impact of pump stations and lid on ufs we can observe that both pump discharge and lid layout area are nonlinearly correlated with pah fig 6 specifically pah decreased slowly when the pumping discharge is between 1 6 and 2 2 times the default pump scenario the pah changes little when pumping discharge reaches 2 5 times default pump scenario fig 6a as for the lid layout area the pah continuously decreases with the increase of lid layout area if the proportion is between 0 and 50 then it almost unchanges until the proportion area reaches 100 fig 6b based on the nonlinear relationship we can find the optimal pump discharge 2 5 times default pump scenario and lid layout area 100 of the study area strategy that have the highest effect on the ufs in these situations the region becomes saturated in this way we can carry out the pp3 scenario designed in section 2 3 3 is 2 5 times discharge of the default scenario m 2 5 generally the impact threshold of pah for the pump stations is 0 45 and the lid practices is 0 51 3 3 2 comparison of susceptible areas under different scenarios the trained cnn model is used to simulate six scenarios designed in section 2 3 3 the lid scenarios are based on default pump capacity in two districts sixin district and qingshan district and the pump effects are focused on the pump drainage region mainly in the central city with a default lid layout strategy the results of different ufs levels of different scenarios are counted under the condition of the annual average rainfall fig 7 the highest susceptible area under the lid2 scenario 61 67 and lid3 scenario 51 11 was reduced by 6 03 and 16 59 compared to the lid1 scenario 67 70 respectively the lowest susceptible area under the lid2 scenario 17 58 and lid3 scenario 28 51 increased by 7 07 and 18 00 compared to the lid1 scenario 10 51 respectively this indicates that the layout area of lid can have a certain effect on reducing the ufs similarly the highest susceptible area under the pp2 scenario 63 71 and pp3 scenario 45 06 was reduced by 10 02 and 28 6 compared to the pp1 scenario 73 69 respectively the lowest susceptible area under the pp2 scenario 6 91 and pp3 scenario 9 35 increased by 5 68 and 8 12 compared to the pp1 scenario 1 23 respectively this indicates that the drainage pump station significantly reduces ufs especially in the highest susceptible area therefore the increase of lid area fractions could increase the lowest susceptible areas while the increase in the capacity of pump stations in the study area can largely mitigate high susceptible areas of urban flood it proves that pump stations play a significant role in controlling urban flood fig 8a1 c1 shows a slight change under scenarios of lid1 to lid3 in sixin district a very small part of the low susceptible area becomes the lowest susceptible level fig 8 d1 f1 illustrates the spatial variation of lid effects although the ufs difference between lid1 and lid3 is slightly more obvious while 100 lid layout area could not reduce the ufs level of sixin district there remain high susceptible areas due to geographical location and drainage system which indicates a limited impact of lid practices on ufs however there are different effects in qingshan district fig 8a2 c2 shows that some highest susceptible areas turn to high ufs level and most low susceptible areas turn to the lowest the comparison between fig 8f2 and fig 8d2 suggests a better ufs reduction effect in highly susceptible areas fig 9a c shows that the drainage region is mainly in the highest susceptible area under pp1 and pp2 scenarios while in the lowest susceptible area under pp3 indicating that the capacity of pump stations can reduce the ufs to a large extent only a tiny portion of the area under pp2 appears to be the lowest susceptible area while large portion of areas is in the highest susceptible area this proves that the default drainage system could be optimized the reduction effect on ufs is maximized when the pump discharge increases to a state consistent with the pp3 scenario in which most areas show the lowest susceptibility with default pp2 and enhanced pp3 pumping capacity 3 48 and 20 68 of areas in the highest ufs level were reduced to the lowest ufs level respectively the spatial comparison illustrates that the default pumping scenario can only help mitigate ufs near the water body and the maximum scenario can help mitigate the ufs in almost the whole drainage region fig 9 d f shows an obvious increase in the ufs reduction effect in most areas with many pump stations indicating that the optimization of the drainage pumping system significantly impacts the ufs therefore it can be reasonably stated that both the pump stations and lid practices can significantly reduce the ufs especially in the highest susceptible area however the increase of the pump discharge can largely mitigate high susceptible areas of urban flood while the impact of lid layout area is limited it is necessary to find an optimal strategy that reasonably combines drainage facilities and lid practices to alleviate urban flood effectively 4 discussion 4 1 application of machine learning to ufs this study developed a conceptual method for quantitatively assessing the impact of lid practices and drainage pump stations on ufs with the machine learning method the application of the ml model is proven to improve the accuracy of ufs prediction especially in data sparse urban areas balogun et al 2022 darabi et al 2021 pham et al 2021 rafiei sardooi et al 2021 shahabi et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 in the same study area an integrated internet media method zeng et al 2020 particle swarm optimization pso and weakly labeled support vector machine wellsvm method du et al 2022 and the ahp method li et al 2021 are used to generate ufs map while lacking further quantitative study on flood influencing factors moreover the ml models are more objective than mcda in integrating multiple factors in ufs assessment and as flexible as the mcda models li et al 2020 most previous studies use the hydrodynamic models under limited scenarios and require high resolution data and preprocessing which limits its application on a large spatial scale especially in our study with an area of 8494 km2 however the ml models could reduce the complexity of hydrodynamic models and provide a more efficient solution for ufs assessment the ufs assessments are highly data reliant and the location of samples collected from field surveys and the internet might need to be more accurate liu et al 2021a noymanee et al 2017 which would affect the assessment accuracy the ml model could not simulate the complex hydrological process zahura et al 2020 and the trained model would meet the local minimum dilemma during the simulation li et al 2020 moreover the learning process is completely based on collected samples it does not include flooded sites in extreme cases and would not perform well in predicting extreme cases prosdocimi et al 2015 nevertheless the increased attention to the ml model might serve as an opportunity to broadly drive conversations in our field about the limits of disaster data 4 2 ufs reduction of drainage pump stations and lid practices in this study we find a nonlinear response relation between the reduction rate of ufs with the increase in pump discharges or lid areas thus determining the impact threshold previous studies focused on providing a simple rate of relative reduction of lid and pump stations or simply studying the changes in ufs based on statistical or hydrodynamic methods baek et al 2015 webber et al 2022 yang et al 2021 however they are difficult to be used to understand the interior distribution of susceptibility and determine the exact locations for flood defense zhang et al 2021 while the quantitative impact on ufs in large areas even trend analysis has been seldom explored to sufficiently address the increasing requirements for the accuracy and depth of susceptibility analysis the integrated method to explore the detailed nonlinear regularities is first proposed to find the most effective design we find that the optimal strategy for lids and pump station is when the lid area is 50 of the study area and the pump discharge is 2 2 times the default pump drainage discharge although the pah is not the final threshold the strategy with the maximum reduction rate have advantages in economic decision analysis there will be no greater improvement if the pump discharge or lid layout areas increase this result confirmed the conclusion given by yin et al 2020 who illustrated that lid practices can reduce runoff volume to a limited extent the result can provide suggestions for the design of the lid layout area and drainage pumping discharge which can help to respond positively to flood disasters and take targeted measures in practical projects 5 conclusions drainage facilities such as pump stations and lid are effective measures to reduce urban flood this study investigates the ufs spatially and quantitatively separates the impact of pump stations and lid practices in wuhan we proposed a new conceptual ufs quantification method based on machine learning techniques with two options cnn svm and designed various scenarios of different pump capacities and lid area fractions it is used to assess ufs reduction and could assist in flood mitigation and management the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 two options cnn and svm in the proposed method both have good performances in ufs but the cnn model auc 0 9670 is slightly higher than that of svm auc 0 9619 moreover the cnn model has a relatively higher consistency between historical flooded sites and susceptible areas 2 13 65 of wuhan city is in the highest ufs level and 65 80 of the central city by default the most susceptible areas in wuhan are located in the central city especially along lakes and rivers with default and maximum lid 6 03 and 16 59 of highest ufs have been reduced 7 07 and 18 00 of lowest ufs have been increased respectively the maximum lid area could reduce the ufs probability by up to 0 26 3 with default and enhanced pumping scenarios 10 02 and 28 6 of highest ufs have been reduced among which 3 48 and 20 68 of areas in the highest ufs level were reduced to the lowest ufs level respectively the default pumping scenario can only help mitigate ufs near the river and the maximum scenario can help mitigate the ufs in almost the whole drainage region 4 drainage pump stations and lid practices have a nonlinear effect on ufs in that the reduction capacity is higher when the lid layout area or pump discharge increases within a reasonable range area proportion between 0 and 50 or 0 2 2 times of basic pumping scenario then it becomes the same when reaches a certain level area proportion between 100 or 2 5 times basic pumping scenario 5 under the condition of the annual average rainfall when the pumping capacity is 2 5 times of the default condition the pah reaches its minimum threshold and can be reduced to 45 when the lid layout area is 100 of the whole region the pah can be reduced to 51 the ufs assessments are highly data reliant we can collect more up to date flood inventories in the future furthermore the suggestion on the design of the lid layout area and drainage pumping discharge based on the conceptual ufs quantification method can also be applied in other flood prone areas as an alternative way for the policy making on the other hand given more current studies on lid optimization layout strategy huang et al 2022 wang et al 2020b we can make further lid combination and layout analysis combing the machine learning in future works credit authorship

2329,evaporation can be a major component of a reservoir s water balance in arid populated regions such as the western united states yet accurate measurements are scarce in an effort to fill this observation gap direct measurements of evaporation from standley lake a water supply reservoir in the colorado front range were collected via the eddy covariance method from march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 evaporation followed a seasonal pattern with the spring summer and early fall experiencing daily cycles that peaked just after midday with measurable evaporation occurring each day for approximately 4 6 h in the late fall and winter the daily cycles decayed and episodic enhancements in evaporation were common most often lasting between 18 and 36 h some longer evaporation peaked in june aligning with peak net radiation and summertime evaporation was predominantly driven by diurnal variations in wind speed and the vapor pressure gradient interestingly fall and winter saw multiple periods of negative downward sensible heat transfer which helped drive wintertime evaporation the study period evaporation totaled 1377 mm with 35 of that occurring in summer 27 in fall 21 in spring and 17 in winter this study shows that evaporation is a significant part of the energy balance of standley lake and with continued observations enables a better understanding of the impacts a changing climate and increased water demands have on water resources keywords evaporation reservoir eddy covariance modeling energy budget water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the twenty first century has already seen rapid changes in natural ecosystems and human societies with water scarcity being one of the most threatening challenges seckler et al 1999 in the western united states spring runoff from the melting of the mountain snowpack is the main water source and is diverted to reservoirs to provide water throughout the rest of the year especially in the summer when demands are greatest however decreases in water supplied by the mountain snowpack rhoades et al 2018 has led to reductions in storable water coupled with rising regional populations in the western united states water demands are exceeding reservoir supplies furthermore a warmer drier and potentially windier atmosphere places additional strains on surface water storage in reservoirs by likely increasing summer and winter evaporation rates as ice cover decreases despite the importance of accurate reservoir evaporation estimates to ensuring a reliable water supply they are few and far between in the western united states reasons for this include the cost of instrumentation complexity of calculations limited observation periods and challenges of incorporating new measurements into existing complex water policies for example of the 860 reservoirs in upper colorado river basin only 11 have known evaporation measurements friedrich et al 2018 in the absence of direct evaporation measurements widely used alternatives include using historical or regional class a evaporation pan estimates farnsworth et al 1982 farnsworth thompson 1982 mass transfer based or other empirically based estimates and physically based models that are currently in development hence still requiring calibration and validation in the field of water resources management the class a evaporation pan is one of the most often used in situ methods lowe et al 2009 but since it is only operable in the warmer months usually may october and its volume and location are almost always not representative of a reservoir a correction a pan coefficient k ideally based on independent more accurate reservoir evaporation measurements is required globally there have been multiple lake evaporation studies that employed techniques ranging from energy budget methods such as the bowen ratio energy budget method used in lenters et al 2005 mass transfer approaches spence hedstrom 2015 the penman model penman 1948 and its many variations the priestly taylor method priestley taylor 1972 combination methods rosenberry et al 2007 tanny et al 2008 pérez et al 2020 to the eddy covariance technique foken et al 2012 eddy covariance has been widely used in terrestrial studies baldocchi et al 2001 but the use in over lake studies is relatively sparce and has generally been focused on temperate low elevation lakes see table 2 for related eddy covariance studies however in arid high elevation regions the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is higher brutsaert 1982 leading to the need for direct evaporation measurements at reservoirs in these regions as elevation increases both barometric pressure and air temperature decrease causing evaporation as a function of barometric pressure air temperature to increase decrease if the other term is held constant blaney 1960 the balance between the effects of pressure and air temperature on evaporation is dependent on location as solar radiation and wind conditions also have the potential to influence evaporation blanken et al 2000 rosenberry et al 2007 wang et al 2017 and both conditions experience high spatial variability at high elevations and in complex topography so reservoir evaporation studies are needed in multiple arid high elevation regions a handful of lake evaporation and energy budget studies have successfully been conducted over arid high elevation lakes such as lake titicaca plateau altiplano andean plateau peru and bolivia zolá et al 2019 erhai lake yunnan province china liu et al 2015 and lakes on the qinghai tibet tibetan plateau china biermann et al 2014 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 but similar studies of lakes and reservoirs in other higher elevation arid and semi arid regions around the world are relatively underrepresented in the literature for example of the 39 lakes studied in woolway et al 2017 only one was located in the western united states and at an elevation greater than 1 500 m asl lake tahoe the need for arid high elevation evaporation studies is further exacerbated by the fact that many watersheds in the western united states are snow melt dominated in turn many reservoirs are located at higher elevations and in complex topography to better capture the snow melt due to the geographic locations of these reservoirs evaporation is impacted not only by the climatic conditions arid semi arid but also the effects of elevation and topography the passage of warm dry air over a lake has the potential to enhance evaporation blanken et al 2003 which due to the interaction between synoptic scale flow and the complex topography of the western united states is a relatively common occurrence on the lee of the rocky mountains known as chinooks or the north american foehn wind even though chinooks themselves are well known in this region ives 1950 their influences on surface energy and water budgets are not as well known save a handful of studies in alberta canada macdonald et al 2018 nkemdirim 1991 but are just as important having a better understanding of the effects of the interaction between synoptic flow and complex terrain is especially important in the lee of the colorado rocky mountains since this is where a large portion of the state s water supply reservoirs are located to address the spatial gaps in direct measurements of reservoir evaporation in the western united states and to better understand how the interaction between synoptic scale flow and complex topography affects reservoir evaporation we used the eddy covariance method to measure evaporation from standley lake a large water supply reservoir in the colorado front range to help guide this research and fill this knowledge gap the following overarching questions were addressed 1 what is the surface energy balance of standley lake 2 what are the evaporation rates across varying timescales and 3 what are the local physical controls on evaporation the work presented here is unique since it provides to our knowledge the first analyzed year long direct measurements of reservoir evaporation in the colorado front range the eddy covariance instruments are still in use to date thus far accumulating roughly three years of continuous reservoir evaporation data additionally these data are useful for the calibration and validation of small lake reservoir physical models as they are developed as well as for water resources management since in colorado reservoir managers are required by the state office of the engineer to account for evaporative losses from the reservoir in their allocations 2 methodology 2 1 study site evaporation measurements based on the eddy covariance ec method were collected and analyzed at standley lake reservoir fig 1 in westminster colorado from march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 built between 1909 and 1919 standley lake is an off river reservoir and is the third largest reservoir in the denver metropolitan area standley lake history 2020 standley lake was originally built for agricultural irrigation purposes for the farmers reservoir and irrigation company frico but was expanded in the early 1960 s to providing drinking and domestic water for three neighboring cities westminster thornton and northglenn now home to nearly 300 000 citizens the 2 km long earthen dam runs along the northeast side of the reservoir and is 34 4 m tall from base to top standley lake has a maximum surface area of 4 9 km2 when full an average depth of 11 m maximum depth of 29 m along the face of the dam and a maximum water capacity of roughly 52 million m3 42 000 acre feet natural lakes of similar surface area 1 10 km2 make up 0 3 of the total number of lakes globally 117 million and are larger than the most abundant lake sizes 0 02 1 km2 99 of global total verpoorter et al 2014 making standley lake comparatively large the reservoir often fills to capacity each spring with snowpack meltwater channeled through diversions from the upper clear creek basin due to water withdrawals throughout the year water levels drop by roughly 3 m to their lowest levels in winter 2 2 instruments and measurement instruments were located on the southeast side of the reservoir fig 1 for practical safety reasons and to best capture the prevailing over water wind directions from a small 4 m tall mast instruments were positioned 9 m above the high water level measurements of the vertical w horizontal u and crosswind v wind speeds m s 1 and sonic air temperature t s c were measured at 10 hz with a sonic anemometer campbell scientific csat 3b a co located hygrometer campbell scientific kh2o krypton hygrometer measured the atmospheric water vapor density ρ v kg m 3 also at 10 hz measured data were collected by a campbell scientific cr3000 datalogger slower 1 sec samples of ancillary meteorological conditions were also measured at the same height as the flux measurements 4 m above ground 9 m above the high water level and 10 minute statistics were collected by the same cr3000 datalogger air temperature t a c and relative humidity rh were measured with a shielded vaisala hmp155a from t a and rh the dewpoint temperature t d c was calculated lake surface water temperature t w c was measured with an everest interscience inc infrared thermometer aimed at the water surface air pressure kpa was measured by a vaisala ptb110 barometer located in the same enclosure as the cr3000 incident solar sw in w m 2 and longwave radiation lw in w m 2 were measured at the top of the tower with an apogee sp 510 pyranometer and sl 510 pyrgeometer respectively power was provided by a 50 w solar panel and two 12 v marine deep cycle batteries connected in parallel t a t d rh sw in and lw in were missing from may 8 21 2020 due to the failure of a voltage regulator for this period of missing data t a t d and rh were filled with hourly data from nearby 5 km north rocky mountain regional airport hourly lw in was calculated with the stefan boltzmann law using filled hourly t d and calculated clear sky emissivity berdahl martin 1984 clear sky emissivity was adjusted to account for the effects of clouds with an empirical fractional cloud cover value following the steps in crawford and duchon 1999 which are further described in the supplementary materials nearby sw in data were not available for gap filling for this time period additional data provided by standley lake operating committee sloc included the water levels measured with a staff gauge located at the reservoir spillway west of the north end of the dam and water temperature profiles recorded by a string of temperature sensors affixed to a floating raft n 39 86792 w 105 116631 water temperature profile data were available from april 9 november 10 2020 and were collected at 6 hr time intervals and at 23 levels with approximately 1 m intervals as water was released from the reservoir and the water level dropped profile measurements were only taken at 20 levels by the end of the measurement period 2 3 data processing the 10 hz measurements of atmospheric water vapor density kg m 3 vertical wind speed m s 1 and sonic temperature c were used to calculate 10 minute reynolds averaged latent λ e w m 2 and sensible h w m 2 turbulent heat fluxes respectively as 1 λ e λ w ρ v 2 h ρ a c p w t where w is the variation in the instantaneous vertical wind speed m s 1 from the time averaged mean overbar λ is the latent heat of vaporization approximately 2 45x106 j kg 1 ρ v is the variation in the instantaneous atmospheric water vapor density kg m 3 from the time averaged mean ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of moist air j kg 1 c 1 and t is the variation of the instantaneous sonic measured air temperature c from the time averaged mean both ρ a and c p were calculated for each 10 minute flux measurement using ta rh and air pressure measurements positive flux values indicate turbulent transfer away from the surface upward while negative values indicate turbulent transfer toward the surface downward an ogive for a typical summer daytime period was created using the ogive function for turbulent flux characterization in matlab r2022a cheynet 2022 the latent heat ogive had an inflection point between f h z 10 2 10 3 or 100 1000 s and the cumulative percent of turbulence captured at a 10 minute averaging periods was 99 5 indicating that the 10 minute averaging period is sufficient to capture turbulence at standley lake a 2 dimensional coordinate rotation was performed making the mean vertical w and cross wind components v zero before covariances were calculated baldocchi et al 1988 the wpl correction for moisture and density effects webb et al 1980 was applied to the latent heat flux estimates and sensible heat flux estimates were corrected for humidity effects flux data quality flags based on foken et al 2012 were applied on a scale of 1 highest quality to 9 lowest only data with flags less than or equal to 6 were used resulting in 42 of the direct measurements from any wind direction being useable since the tower was located on the earthen dam on the eastern shore ec data were filtered to remove land fetch measurements according to wind rose analysis fig 2 wind directions between 210 and 330 were considered water fetch while the rest 331 209 were considered land fetch after data quality and fetch filtering as well as the removal of data due to the failure of the voltage regulator may 8 21 2020 37 of the 10 minute latent and sensible heat flux measurements were deemed usable though a large amount of the direct measurements were removed our data availability after strict quality control is comparable to other shore based ec lake studies e g 25 in nordbo et al 2011 to gap fill the missing turbulent flux data we applied the neural network fitting tool in the deep learning toolbox in matlab r2022a we trained the model based on water fetch measurements and then used the final neural network fitting function to estimate λe and h during periods when the wind did not originate over the water surface following the approach used by xiao et al 2018 in a similar setting water fetch measurements were randomly divided into 70 training 15 validating and 15 testing and we set 500 hidden nodes and applied the levenberg marquardt algorithm training and fitting input values for h were the 10 minute means of 1 sec sampled t a t d horizontal wind speed u m s 1 t w sw in and the lake surface temperature gradient δ t t w t a c for λe input variables used for training and fitting were the meteorological variables t a u friction velocity u m s 1 and actual atmospheric vapor pressure at measurement height e 9 kpa lake water variables t w and saturation vapor pressure at water surface e 0 kpa and energy terms sw in and the gap filled h the lake surface vapor pressure gradient δ e e 0 e 9 kpa δ t and the non linear products of u and δ e u δ e were also included as input variables since related studies have found that local humidity and temperature gradients as well as local winds serve as important drivers for moisture and heat exchange blanken et al 2000 xiao et al 2018 and a principal component analysis at this site corroborates these findings since sw in was not able to be gap filled when the voltage regulator failed may 8 21 2020 λe and h measurements for this period were not estimated by the neural network leaving 3 missing data for 10 minute estimates it is also important to note that water releases from the reservoir resulted in low water levels and exposed the shore extending roughly 10 m from the tower therefore t w measurements as well as e 0 and lw out calculations for the period of august 7 2020 october 24 2020 are suspect on october 24 the infrared thermometer was repositioned higher from 1 9 m to 2 4 m above ground on the tower to ensure that the sensor was better aimed at the water surface even during periods of low water levels based on the basic trigonometric calculations using the height and field of view of the infrared thermometer the measurement area was always within the water surface area additionally after repositioning the infrared thermometer lake surface temperature readings were verified during each site visit once per month with a handheld infrared thermometer to ensure that the infrared thermometer on the tower was reading lake surface temperature measurements not the surrounding land to ensure a temporally uniform analysis eddy covariance and meteorological measurements were averaged up to 1 hour timescales and then used in all of the following analyses except for the assessment of the random measurement uncertainty of the 10 minute fluxes which was conducted at the 10 minute timescale the evaporation rate e was calculated by dividing λe by λ and the density of water then multiplying by the appropriate length of time negative e values were assumed to be 0 since we are only looking at evaporative losses not possible additions through condensation to determine timescales of evaporation cycles and events flux fingerprints were created from average hourly λ e and h calculations for each day of the year and were then interpolated at 1 hr intervals and plotted specific periods of increased evaporation were analyzed in relation to meso and synoptic scale weather conditions to determine their influence on daily evaporation rates for the meso and synoptic scale analysis we used surface maps from the national weather service weather prediction center https www wpc ncep noaa gov archives web pages sfc sfc archive php 2 4 flux errors and uncertainty the quality of the flux measurements was determined by quantifying the energy balance closure ebc based on the lake surface energy balance defined as 3 r net j w h λ e j b j f j p where r net is the hourly net radiation w m 2 calculated using hourly water surface albedo α estimated from the fresnel reflection equation with daytime values ranging between 0 03 and 0 12 depending on measured solar zenith angle for each hour nunez et al 1972 daily average albedo was also found to be 0 06 which compares well with nunez et al s reported daily average of 0 07 in eq 3 j b j f j p are respectively the sediment heat flux the net heat flux from runoff and through lake outflows and the heat flux due to precipitation nordbo et al 2011 the 6 hour lake heat storage j w w m 2 was calculated as j w ρ w c w δ t w δ t δ z where ρ w and c w are the density 1000 kg m 3 and specific heat of water 4186 j kg 1 c 1 respectively δ t w is the change in water temperature over a set time period δ t and δ z is the depth intervals between temperature measurements blanken et al 2000 positive j w values indicate an increase in standley lake heat storage warming while negative values indicate heat losses cooling the last three terms on the right hand side of eq 3 were considered negligible for the following reasons first the presence of a thermocline during the summer stratification period effectively decoupled the hypolimnion from the atmosphere nordbo et al 2011 and in turn minimized j b and δ j f since standley lake outflows are located at the bottom of the reservoir second precipitation accounts for only 2 of total water input to standley lake making j p negligible therefore eq 3 can be written as 4 r net j w h λ e and the error in the ebc can be quantified as the absolute residual of the eq 4 or as the ratio h λ e r net j w nordbo et al 2011 random measurement uncertainty of the 10 minute reynold s averaged turbulent fluxes was statistically determined following a successive day approach as described in hollinger and richardson 2005 and knowles et al 2012 equivalent meteorological conditions were defined as when successive measurements of t a were within 3 c u were within 1 m s 1 hollinger richardson 2005 and r net were within 75 w m 2 knowles et al 2012 regardless of time of day random uncertainty was assessed as the standard deviation of the difference between the measurement pairs 5 σ s q 1 2 σ x 1 x 2 where sq is the measurement uncertainty and x 1 and x 2 are the successive flux measurements the requirements for equivalent conditions were met 20 of the time giving a sample size of approximately 10 000 10 minute mean fluxes 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions prevailing winds at standley lake were west northwesterly averaging 2 8 m s 1 fig 2 but increased variability in wind direction associated with terrain modified fig 1 early morning upslope easterlies and afternoon evening downslope westerlies flows were observed especially in the spring march april and may winter december january and february experienced a higher average wind speed of 3 4 m s 1 with eleven distinct high wind events surpassing an hourly average of 10 m s 1 the lowest hourly average wind speed was measured in the summer june july and august at 2 3 m s 1 calculations of the flux footprint kljun et al 2015 or upwind distance contributing to turbulent flux measurements fetch indicated that the mean distance of maximum contribution to the turbulent flux measurements was 112 m upwind of the tower during unstable z l 0 where z is measurement height m and l is the obukhov length m atmospheric conditions 154 m upwind during stable z l greater than 0 conditions and 90 of all flux measurements were sampled over a median upwind distance of 447 m with favorable over lake fetch these distances of flux contribution were well within the area of standley lake fig 1 the study period was relatively warm and dry when compared to 1991 2020 climate normal fig 3 measured in boulder co noaa physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov boulder the mean study period air temperature was 1 2 c higher than the climate normal 11 0 c and total precipitation was 106 mm less than normal 540 mm liquid precipitation accumulated most in late winter and throughout the spring in february 2021 the front range experienced well below normal air temperatures and above normal snowfall the lower air temperatures in january and february 2021 led to a 3 day longer 2020 2021 ice season than 2019 2020 the 2020 thermal stratification period began in mid may and lasted through late september with the thermocline reaching a maximum depth of roughly 16 m in august ice on first date with 100 ice cover and ice off first date with no detectable ice cover dates were approximated from visual estimates recorded in the dam tender s daily log provided by sloc as well as from modis imagery from nasa s terra satellite obtained at https worldview earthdata nasa gov the 2019 2020 ice on period lasted just over a month with 100 ice cover first observed on february 5 2020 until completely ice free on march 9 2020 for 2020 2021 the ice on date was february 4 2021 and ice cover persisted until the ice off date of march 11 2021 3 2 artificial neural network modeled fluxes the artificial neural network model forced with local meteorological conditions predicted sensible and latent heat fluxes well we found that the water fetch h neural network output explained 73 of the variance in actual 10 minute water fetch h measurements fig 4 and the slope and intercept of the linear fit were 0 93 and 3 96 w m 2 respectively further indicating strong agreement between measurements and model output for λ e an r2 of 0 75 was found between the water fetch λ e neural network output and actual 10 minute water fetch λ e measurements fig 4 and the slope 0 93 and intercept 2 50 w m 2 of the linear fit showed good agreement between water fetch measurements and model outputs this is a promising finding since in many water resources management applications shore based measurements are the most accessible these artificial neural network findings show potential for being a reliable method for gap filling large portions of a flux time series but also the potential to be used on its own to model fluxes if local meteorological conditions are available 3 3 flux uncertainty a shapiro wilk s test indicated that the distributions of the random turbulent flux measurement uncertainty were not normal p 0 01 but were leptokurtic with large tails central peaks and were slightly skewed negative for λ e positive for h better fitting a laplace or double exponential distribution rather than a gaussian fig 5 because of this distribution we used 2 β the double exponential equivalent to σ where β i 1 n x i x n as our uncertainty measure the uncertainty analysis was broken into three parts 1 all of the measurements that fit the successive day criteria 2 just the direct water fetch flux measurements and 3 just the artificial neural network model flux estimates this allowed us to quantify the amount of error introduced from the eddy flux measurements separately from any additional error introduced by the neural network model estimates as expected the modeled flux estimates had greater uncertainty than the direct measurements e g 228 compared to 106 w m 2 for λ e table 1 but the modeled flux values were still acceptable in the context of model performance and relative flux uncertainty 13 and 19 for λ e and h respectively random measurement uncertainty for the entire dataset was 153 w m 2 for λ e and 65 w m 2 for h table 1 or about 8 and 11 of total midday summertime fluxes summed fluxes between 1200 and 1600 lt during the summer months for λ e and h respectively uncertainty was smallest in the fall and summer for λ e and h means 133 and 52 w m 2 respectively and largest in the winter and spring for λ e and h means 186 and 90 w m 2 respectively far fewer similar flux uncertainty analyses have been conducted over lakes than terrestrial sites however our mean percent error estimates of turbulent flux uncertainty aligns well with those reported by hollinger richardson 2005 or knowles et al 2012 3 4 lake surface energy budget closure for the period where water temperature profile measurements were available for heat storage calculations the cumulative λ e h underestimated the cumulative available energy rnet jw by 24 daily average of 44 w m 2 mean monthly energy balance closure based on daily calculations of λ e h rnet jw ranged from 54 in october to 98 in july with the other two summer months experiencing closure greater than 80 may experienced large overestimates by the flux measurements 130 which could be attributed to the failure of the voltage regulator combined with times of erroneous heat storage estimates only 30 of days had reliable estimates of all four energy budget components may also experienced two well defined periods of vertical mixing on may 4 5 and 24 25 2020 both accompanied by high wind speeds hourly average u greater than 10 m s 1 and low maximum net radiation values 498 706 w m 2 the mixing of the water column likely introduced random noise and errors into the heat storage calculation nordbo et al 2011 therefore the energy budget closure fig 6 shows the hourly ensemble means of energy balance components depicting an average day for each month that lake heat storage data were available ensemble means were only calculated from direct water fetch measurements to avoid any errors introduced by the neural network model and best explain the temporal patterns and disparities in the energy budget closure since heat storage was only available at 6 hour intervals we used a simplified hourly ensemble mean residual res r net λ e h for fig 6 and then compared it to the heat storage 6 hr ensemble mean in all months except october a 4 6 hour time lag between peak rnet and peak λ e was present contributing to temporal imbalances in the energy balance closure in general jw aligned well with res e g august panel in fig 6 indicating that most of the energy balance residual can be explained by lake heat storage effects in september and october when the thermal stratification period ended and the lake began to turn over large releases of stored energy negative jw in fig 6 occurred and help further explain the imbalance during the day in september and october the residual is large and positive but jw stays negative this discrepancy is likely attributed to the large rnet and the turbulent flux measurements not adequately capturing the stored heat release from the reservoir nearly all terrestrial studies show that the ec method underestimates the available energy by roughly 20 foken 2008 wilson et al 2002 lakes studies that used the ec method are much fewer than terrestrial studies table 2 but those lake studies that do report energy balance closure found both over and underestimates in the energy balance our cumulative energy balance closure of 76 aligns well with other relevant over lake eddy covariance studies as shown in table 2 and underestimates here could be attributed to many factors including but not limited to the following first the difference in locations between flux and temperature profile jw measurements fig 1 since ec measurements represent turbulent fluxes from a large changing footprint area while jw was calculated from point measurements approximately 1 2 km away additionally the lack of water temperature measurements above 1 m available to calculate jw could cause inaccuracies in jw and inaccuracies in neural network estimation of turbulent fluxes and how radiation components were estimated could also be present however the ensemble means presented in fig 6 were calculated from only the direct water fetch measurements and they show acceptable monthly energy balance closures furthermore the ec system s inability to detect energy transport in large eddies foken 2008 nordbo et al 2011 is another possible reason for the unclosed energy balance standley lake s close proximity to the front range could lead to orographic influences on the local thermal characteristics and wind fields in turn creating large eddies that are not normally measured by ec instruments 3 5 turbulent fluxes diurnal cycles in the latent and sensible heat turbulent fluxes were present throughout the study period the hourly averaged λ e was usually small and positive except in late spring through fall afternoons usually between 1200 and 1800 lt when average hourly values increased and were consistently around or above 300 w m 2 fig 7 in the fall daily λ e decreased in magnitude and duration with hourly average values around 100 w m 2 between 1200 and 1500 lt until the daily cycles broke down into fewer but relatively larger magnitude events the h was often small but stronger positive h values were observed around midday a few hours ahead of λ e throughout the spring summer and fall in the late fall and winter h was often negative i e directed downwards for extended periods of time the larger summertime λ e values coincided with daily peaks in vapor pressure gradient and wind speed fig 8 based on the ensemble hourly means for all days in june july or august the hourly vapor pressure gradient reached or surpassed 2 kpa in mid afternoon and at the same time the hourly average horizontal wind speed reached its peak between 3 and 5 m s 1 the consistent summertime diurnal patterns in wind speed and vapor pressure gradients led to consistent daily evaporation cycles equivalent to roughly 5 mm d 1 throughout the summer months the importance of the vapor pressure gradient and horizontal wind speeds to λ e is further supported by the linear relationships between hourly λ e and hourly δ e u and u δ e fig 9 all three months show strong positive relationships between λ e and the vapor pressure gradient horizontal wind speed and the function of the two in june and august hourly average horizontal wind speed explains most of the variation in hourly latent heat fluxes while in july the function of hourly horizontal wind speed and the vapor pressure gradient explains most of the variation in hourly latent heat fluxes as fall and winter progressed the diurnal patterns in λ e and h were replaced by longer episodic events usually lasting 18 36 h corresponding to periods of increased winds and air temperature and decreased humidity indicating the influences of advection an evaporation event occurred over the course of roughly 30 h beginning in the afternoon of october 16 2020 fig 10 and persisted until the evening of october 17 resulting in 14 mm of water loss through evaporation driven by a strong west to east surface air pressure gradient see supplementary materials for synoptic chart hourly average winds rapidly increased from 2 to 14 m s 1 and with the strong winds came an increase in air temperatures 15 c a negative lake surface temperature gradient 4 6 c and increased vapor pressure gradient 2 kpa these conditions were indicative of a chinook windstorm and helped enhance evaporation through the increased vapor pressure gradient increased horizontal wind speed and additional energy supplied by the negative downward h during this period based on a linear regression analysis between λ e and h δ e and u all three played important roles in enhancing evaporation as when combined they explained 80 of the variance in λ e p 0 01 when considered individually h δ e and u explained respectively 42 29 and 55 of variation in λ e p 0 01 for each evaporation events such as shown in fig 10 associated with chinooks winds and a negative sensible heat flux occurred five times in october each lasting on average 30 h the high frequency of these large evaporation events in october led to consistently high daily evaporation rates for the month these periods of negative h continued into the winter months and often aligned with chinook windstorms which in the colorado rocky mountains occur on average 40 times per year most often in january ives 1950 eight chinook related evaporation events occurred during the winter resulting in 77 mm of water loss or 32 to total winter evaporation in nordbo et al 2011 increased lake evaporation was also coincident with negative h while other related evaporation studies in locations without foehn winds h remained positive in fall and winter blanken et al 2011 liu et al 2011 moreo swancar 2013 xiao et al 2018 these unique cold season chinooks provide adequate atmospheric conditions and significant energy through the downward directed h likely play a large role in reservoir evaporation processes along the front range the possible effects of chinooks are also important to consider in relation to water management and allocations decisions since they occur during times when many reservoir managers assume evaporation to be minimal 3 6 reservoir evaporative water loss for water balance and water management purposes expressing evaporation not as a latent heat flux but as the equivalent loss of water as a depth per time is informative with this in mind fig 11 shows the daily e totals as well as the 14 day moving mean to show longer term patterns spring evaporation was highly variable with daily average rates ranging from 2 5 mm d 1 in march to 3 9 mm d 1 in may to account for the may over power period when we did not have reliable measurement the daily average evaporation from the rest of the month was applied to those 13 days summer evaporation was consistent with daily averages varying by only 0 5 mm d 1 where june experienced the highest daily average e at 5 5 mm d 1 with july and august close behind with 5 1 and 5 0 mm d 1 with the onset of fall daily averages began to decrease with the exception of october where daily average reached back up to 5 0 mm d 1 in october there were 16 days with evaporation rates greater than 4 0 mm d 1 and the largest daily evaporation rate of the study period 11 7 mm d 1 was observed on october 11 2020 similar to spring winter saw overall low evaporation with the exception of the eight chinook related enhanced evaporation events daily evaporation rates as presented in fig 11 are extremely valuable for water resources managers as they allow the managers to make informed allocations decisions especially in the cold season in the cold season managers often assume evaporation is not occurring or minimal even though fig 11 shows that is not the case as 14 day moving averages rarely go below 2 mm d 1 annual and seasonal evaporation totals as well as the daily means for each timescale are shown in table 3 the consistent daily cycles in evaporation that were explored in section 3 5 proved to be important as the majority of the evaporative water losses from the reservoir occurred during the summer months contributing 35 of the total evaporation followed by the fall at 27 and winter and spring seasons contributed 17 and 28 respectively when combined fall and winter contributed 44 of total evaporation with 20 of that evaporation occurring during chinook windstorms daily average e peaked in the summer at 5 2 mm d 1 and was lowest in the winter at 2 7 mm d 1 overall daily evaporation rates averaged at 3 7 mm d 1 and the annual total was 1377 mm assumed over the full surface area of the reservoir this amount of water loss is comparable to the annual water use of 5 500 typical 3 4 member households or 2 standley lake s service area the study period s annual evaporative water loss is comparable to historic annual class a pan measurements of 1311 mm collected in nearby fort collins co between 1938 and 1941 horton 1943 at lake hefner in oklahoma a reservoir similar in shape and climate region and roughly double the size of standley lake four class a pans were used and the average annual evaporation was 1403 mm harbeck 1954 after a 0 7 pan coefficient adjustment was applied our annual e total is almost double that of white bear lake in minnesota double the surface area in a temperate climate where ec and model based estimates determined annual evaporation for 2014 2016 to be between 559 and 779 mm xiao et al 2018 other ec based lake evaporation studies have been conducted on relatively larger and colder climate lakes such as great slave lake in canada blanken et al 2000 lake superior in the united states blanken et al 2011 and lake qinghai in china li et al 2016 and found annual evaporation rates of 386 485 464 645 and 828 mm respectively our relatively large evaporation estimates compared to these other lakes that vary in size type and locations demonstrates the need for direct evaporation measurements at multiple lakes and reservoirs throughout the western united states 4 conclusions this 12 month study demonstrated the temporal variations in evaporation and its local drivers from a water supply reservoir in the colorado front range daily total evaporation rates ranged up to 11 7 mm d 1 and in general evaporation from standley lake followed a diurnal pattern peaking in mid to late afternoon lasting around 4 6 h and decreasing into the nighttime hours this cycle was most pronounced in late spring through early fall when low atmospheric moisture and diurnal wind patterns were consistent the diurnal cycles broke down in the late fall and winter when evaporation was mostly driven by high winds and episodic advection of relatively warm dry air over standley lake as occurred during the chinook windstorm on october 16 18 2020 and 14 other similar events these events were interesting in the fact that cold season negative h has been observed in only a few lake evaporation studies and at standley lake the events contributed 77 mm or nearly a third 32 of wintertime evaporation chinook climatology in the western united states should continue to be studied in relation to turbulent fluxes to see if chinook frequency will increase in the future and possibly lead to more enhanced evaporation events annual evaporation from standley lake totaled to 1377 mm consistent with annual totals from historical evaporation studies in similar semiarid regions these measurements at standley lake are the first step towards a long term evaporation monitoring network in the western united states livneh et al 2016 continued observations at standley lake as well as at other reservoirs are needed to improve our understanding of spatial evaporation patterns variability among years and the impacts of terrain

2329,evaporation can be a major component of a reservoir s water balance in arid populated regions such as the western united states yet accurate measurements are scarce in an effort to fill this observation gap direct measurements of evaporation from standley lake a water supply reservoir in the colorado front range were collected via the eddy covariance method from march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 evaporation followed a seasonal pattern with the spring summer and early fall experiencing daily cycles that peaked just after midday with measurable evaporation occurring each day for approximately 4 6 h in the late fall and winter the daily cycles decayed and episodic enhancements in evaporation were common most often lasting between 18 and 36 h some longer evaporation peaked in june aligning with peak net radiation and summertime evaporation was predominantly driven by diurnal variations in wind speed and the vapor pressure gradient interestingly fall and winter saw multiple periods of negative downward sensible heat transfer which helped drive wintertime evaporation the study period evaporation totaled 1377 mm with 35 of that occurring in summer 27 in fall 21 in spring and 17 in winter this study shows that evaporation is a significant part of the energy balance of standley lake and with continued observations enables a better understanding of the impacts a changing climate and increased water demands have on water resources keywords evaporation reservoir eddy covariance modeling energy budget water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the twenty first century has already seen rapid changes in natural ecosystems and human societies with water scarcity being one of the most threatening challenges seckler et al 1999 in the western united states spring runoff from the melting of the mountain snowpack is the main water source and is diverted to reservoirs to provide water throughout the rest of the year especially in the summer when demands are greatest however decreases in water supplied by the mountain snowpack rhoades et al 2018 has led to reductions in storable water coupled with rising regional populations in the western united states water demands are exceeding reservoir supplies furthermore a warmer drier and potentially windier atmosphere places additional strains on surface water storage in reservoirs by likely increasing summer and winter evaporation rates as ice cover decreases despite the importance of accurate reservoir evaporation estimates to ensuring a reliable water supply they are few and far between in the western united states reasons for this include the cost of instrumentation complexity of calculations limited observation periods and challenges of incorporating new measurements into existing complex water policies for example of the 860 reservoirs in upper colorado river basin only 11 have known evaporation measurements friedrich et al 2018 in the absence of direct evaporation measurements widely used alternatives include using historical or regional class a evaporation pan estimates farnsworth et al 1982 farnsworth thompson 1982 mass transfer based or other empirically based estimates and physically based models that are currently in development hence still requiring calibration and validation in the field of water resources management the class a evaporation pan is one of the most often used in situ methods lowe et al 2009 but since it is only operable in the warmer months usually may october and its volume and location are almost always not representative of a reservoir a correction a pan coefficient k ideally based on independent more accurate reservoir evaporation measurements is required globally there have been multiple lake evaporation studies that employed techniques ranging from energy budget methods such as the bowen ratio energy budget method used in lenters et al 2005 mass transfer approaches spence hedstrom 2015 the penman model penman 1948 and its many variations the priestly taylor method priestley taylor 1972 combination methods rosenberry et al 2007 tanny et al 2008 pérez et al 2020 to the eddy covariance technique foken et al 2012 eddy covariance has been widely used in terrestrial studies baldocchi et al 2001 but the use in over lake studies is relatively sparce and has generally been focused on temperate low elevation lakes see table 2 for related eddy covariance studies however in arid high elevation regions the evaporative demand of the atmosphere is higher brutsaert 1982 leading to the need for direct evaporation measurements at reservoirs in these regions as elevation increases both barometric pressure and air temperature decrease causing evaporation as a function of barometric pressure air temperature to increase decrease if the other term is held constant blaney 1960 the balance between the effects of pressure and air temperature on evaporation is dependent on location as solar radiation and wind conditions also have the potential to influence evaporation blanken et al 2000 rosenberry et al 2007 wang et al 2017 and both conditions experience high spatial variability at high elevations and in complex topography so reservoir evaporation studies are needed in multiple arid high elevation regions a handful of lake evaporation and energy budget studies have successfully been conducted over arid high elevation lakes such as lake titicaca plateau altiplano andean plateau peru and bolivia zolá et al 2019 erhai lake yunnan province china liu et al 2015 and lakes on the qinghai tibet tibetan plateau china biermann et al 2014 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 but similar studies of lakes and reservoirs in other higher elevation arid and semi arid regions around the world are relatively underrepresented in the literature for example of the 39 lakes studied in woolway et al 2017 only one was located in the western united states and at an elevation greater than 1 500 m asl lake tahoe the need for arid high elevation evaporation studies is further exacerbated by the fact that many watersheds in the western united states are snow melt dominated in turn many reservoirs are located at higher elevations and in complex topography to better capture the snow melt due to the geographic locations of these reservoirs evaporation is impacted not only by the climatic conditions arid semi arid but also the effects of elevation and topography the passage of warm dry air over a lake has the potential to enhance evaporation blanken et al 2003 which due to the interaction between synoptic scale flow and the complex topography of the western united states is a relatively common occurrence on the lee of the rocky mountains known as chinooks or the north american foehn wind even though chinooks themselves are well known in this region ives 1950 their influences on surface energy and water budgets are not as well known save a handful of studies in alberta canada macdonald et al 2018 nkemdirim 1991 but are just as important having a better understanding of the effects of the interaction between synoptic flow and complex terrain is especially important in the lee of the colorado rocky mountains since this is where a large portion of the state s water supply reservoirs are located to address the spatial gaps in direct measurements of reservoir evaporation in the western united states and to better understand how the interaction between synoptic scale flow and complex topography affects reservoir evaporation we used the eddy covariance method to measure evaporation from standley lake a large water supply reservoir in the colorado front range to help guide this research and fill this knowledge gap the following overarching questions were addressed 1 what is the surface energy balance of standley lake 2 what are the evaporation rates across varying timescales and 3 what are the local physical controls on evaporation the work presented here is unique since it provides to our knowledge the first analyzed year long direct measurements of reservoir evaporation in the colorado front range the eddy covariance instruments are still in use to date thus far accumulating roughly three years of continuous reservoir evaporation data additionally these data are useful for the calibration and validation of small lake reservoir physical models as they are developed as well as for water resources management since in colorado reservoir managers are required by the state office of the engineer to account for evaporative losses from the reservoir in their allocations 2 methodology 2 1 study site evaporation measurements based on the eddy covariance ec method were collected and analyzed at standley lake reservoir fig 1 in westminster colorado from march 1 2020 through february 28 2021 built between 1909 and 1919 standley lake is an off river reservoir and is the third largest reservoir in the denver metropolitan area standley lake history 2020 standley lake was originally built for agricultural irrigation purposes for the farmers reservoir and irrigation company frico but was expanded in the early 1960 s to providing drinking and domestic water for three neighboring cities westminster thornton and northglenn now home to nearly 300 000 citizens the 2 km long earthen dam runs along the northeast side of the reservoir and is 34 4 m tall from base to top standley lake has a maximum surface area of 4 9 km2 when full an average depth of 11 m maximum depth of 29 m along the face of the dam and a maximum water capacity of roughly 52 million m3 42 000 acre feet natural lakes of similar surface area 1 10 km2 make up 0 3 of the total number of lakes globally 117 million and are larger than the most abundant lake sizes 0 02 1 km2 99 of global total verpoorter et al 2014 making standley lake comparatively large the reservoir often fills to capacity each spring with snowpack meltwater channeled through diversions from the upper clear creek basin due to water withdrawals throughout the year water levels drop by roughly 3 m to their lowest levels in winter 2 2 instruments and measurement instruments were located on the southeast side of the reservoir fig 1 for practical safety reasons and to best capture the prevailing over water wind directions from a small 4 m tall mast instruments were positioned 9 m above the high water level measurements of the vertical w horizontal u and crosswind v wind speeds m s 1 and sonic air temperature t s c were measured at 10 hz with a sonic anemometer campbell scientific csat 3b a co located hygrometer campbell scientific kh2o krypton hygrometer measured the atmospheric water vapor density ρ v kg m 3 also at 10 hz measured data were collected by a campbell scientific cr3000 datalogger slower 1 sec samples of ancillary meteorological conditions were also measured at the same height as the flux measurements 4 m above ground 9 m above the high water level and 10 minute statistics were collected by the same cr3000 datalogger air temperature t a c and relative humidity rh were measured with a shielded vaisala hmp155a from t a and rh the dewpoint temperature t d c was calculated lake surface water temperature t w c was measured with an everest interscience inc infrared thermometer aimed at the water surface air pressure kpa was measured by a vaisala ptb110 barometer located in the same enclosure as the cr3000 incident solar sw in w m 2 and longwave radiation lw in w m 2 were measured at the top of the tower with an apogee sp 510 pyranometer and sl 510 pyrgeometer respectively power was provided by a 50 w solar panel and two 12 v marine deep cycle batteries connected in parallel t a t d rh sw in and lw in were missing from may 8 21 2020 due to the failure of a voltage regulator for this period of missing data t a t d and rh were filled with hourly data from nearby 5 km north rocky mountain regional airport hourly lw in was calculated with the stefan boltzmann law using filled hourly t d and calculated clear sky emissivity berdahl martin 1984 clear sky emissivity was adjusted to account for the effects of clouds with an empirical fractional cloud cover value following the steps in crawford and duchon 1999 which are further described in the supplementary materials nearby sw in data were not available for gap filling for this time period additional data provided by standley lake operating committee sloc included the water levels measured with a staff gauge located at the reservoir spillway west of the north end of the dam and water temperature profiles recorded by a string of temperature sensors affixed to a floating raft n 39 86792 w 105 116631 water temperature profile data were available from april 9 november 10 2020 and were collected at 6 hr time intervals and at 23 levels with approximately 1 m intervals as water was released from the reservoir and the water level dropped profile measurements were only taken at 20 levels by the end of the measurement period 2 3 data processing the 10 hz measurements of atmospheric water vapor density kg m 3 vertical wind speed m s 1 and sonic temperature c were used to calculate 10 minute reynolds averaged latent λ e w m 2 and sensible h w m 2 turbulent heat fluxes respectively as 1 λ e λ w ρ v 2 h ρ a c p w t where w is the variation in the instantaneous vertical wind speed m s 1 from the time averaged mean overbar λ is the latent heat of vaporization approximately 2 45x106 j kg 1 ρ v is the variation in the instantaneous atmospheric water vapor density kg m 3 from the time averaged mean ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of moist air j kg 1 c 1 and t is the variation of the instantaneous sonic measured air temperature c from the time averaged mean both ρ a and c p were calculated for each 10 minute flux measurement using ta rh and air pressure measurements positive flux values indicate turbulent transfer away from the surface upward while negative values indicate turbulent transfer toward the surface downward an ogive for a typical summer daytime period was created using the ogive function for turbulent flux characterization in matlab r2022a cheynet 2022 the latent heat ogive had an inflection point between f h z 10 2 10 3 or 100 1000 s and the cumulative percent of turbulence captured at a 10 minute averaging periods was 99 5 indicating that the 10 minute averaging period is sufficient to capture turbulence at standley lake a 2 dimensional coordinate rotation was performed making the mean vertical w and cross wind components v zero before covariances were calculated baldocchi et al 1988 the wpl correction for moisture and density effects webb et al 1980 was applied to the latent heat flux estimates and sensible heat flux estimates were corrected for humidity effects flux data quality flags based on foken et al 2012 were applied on a scale of 1 highest quality to 9 lowest only data with flags less than or equal to 6 were used resulting in 42 of the direct measurements from any wind direction being useable since the tower was located on the earthen dam on the eastern shore ec data were filtered to remove land fetch measurements according to wind rose analysis fig 2 wind directions between 210 and 330 were considered water fetch while the rest 331 209 were considered land fetch after data quality and fetch filtering as well as the removal of data due to the failure of the voltage regulator may 8 21 2020 37 of the 10 minute latent and sensible heat flux measurements were deemed usable though a large amount of the direct measurements were removed our data availability after strict quality control is comparable to other shore based ec lake studies e g 25 in nordbo et al 2011 to gap fill the missing turbulent flux data we applied the neural network fitting tool in the deep learning toolbox in matlab r2022a we trained the model based on water fetch measurements and then used the final neural network fitting function to estimate λe and h during periods when the wind did not originate over the water surface following the approach used by xiao et al 2018 in a similar setting water fetch measurements were randomly divided into 70 training 15 validating and 15 testing and we set 500 hidden nodes and applied the levenberg marquardt algorithm training and fitting input values for h were the 10 minute means of 1 sec sampled t a t d horizontal wind speed u m s 1 t w sw in and the lake surface temperature gradient δ t t w t a c for λe input variables used for training and fitting were the meteorological variables t a u friction velocity u m s 1 and actual atmospheric vapor pressure at measurement height e 9 kpa lake water variables t w and saturation vapor pressure at water surface e 0 kpa and energy terms sw in and the gap filled h the lake surface vapor pressure gradient δ e e 0 e 9 kpa δ t and the non linear products of u and δ e u δ e were also included as input variables since related studies have found that local humidity and temperature gradients as well as local winds serve as important drivers for moisture and heat exchange blanken et al 2000 xiao et al 2018 and a principal component analysis at this site corroborates these findings since sw in was not able to be gap filled when the voltage regulator failed may 8 21 2020 λe and h measurements for this period were not estimated by the neural network leaving 3 missing data for 10 minute estimates it is also important to note that water releases from the reservoir resulted in low water levels and exposed the shore extending roughly 10 m from the tower therefore t w measurements as well as e 0 and lw out calculations for the period of august 7 2020 october 24 2020 are suspect on october 24 the infrared thermometer was repositioned higher from 1 9 m to 2 4 m above ground on the tower to ensure that the sensor was better aimed at the water surface even during periods of low water levels based on the basic trigonometric calculations using the height and field of view of the infrared thermometer the measurement area was always within the water surface area additionally after repositioning the infrared thermometer lake surface temperature readings were verified during each site visit once per month with a handheld infrared thermometer to ensure that the infrared thermometer on the tower was reading lake surface temperature measurements not the surrounding land to ensure a temporally uniform analysis eddy covariance and meteorological measurements were averaged up to 1 hour timescales and then used in all of the following analyses except for the assessment of the random measurement uncertainty of the 10 minute fluxes which was conducted at the 10 minute timescale the evaporation rate e was calculated by dividing λe by λ and the density of water then multiplying by the appropriate length of time negative e values were assumed to be 0 since we are only looking at evaporative losses not possible additions through condensation to determine timescales of evaporation cycles and events flux fingerprints were created from average hourly λ e and h calculations for each day of the year and were then interpolated at 1 hr intervals and plotted specific periods of increased evaporation were analyzed in relation to meso and synoptic scale weather conditions to determine their influence on daily evaporation rates for the meso and synoptic scale analysis we used surface maps from the national weather service weather prediction center https www wpc ncep noaa gov archives web pages sfc sfc archive php 2 4 flux errors and uncertainty the quality of the flux measurements was determined by quantifying the energy balance closure ebc based on the lake surface energy balance defined as 3 r net j w h λ e j b j f j p where r net is the hourly net radiation w m 2 calculated using hourly water surface albedo α estimated from the fresnel reflection equation with daytime values ranging between 0 03 and 0 12 depending on measured solar zenith angle for each hour nunez et al 1972 daily average albedo was also found to be 0 06 which compares well with nunez et al s reported daily average of 0 07 in eq 3 j b j f j p are respectively the sediment heat flux the net heat flux from runoff and through lake outflows and the heat flux due to precipitation nordbo et al 2011 the 6 hour lake heat storage j w w m 2 was calculated as j w ρ w c w δ t w δ t δ z where ρ w and c w are the density 1000 kg m 3 and specific heat of water 4186 j kg 1 c 1 respectively δ t w is the change in water temperature over a set time period δ t and δ z is the depth intervals between temperature measurements blanken et al 2000 positive j w values indicate an increase in standley lake heat storage warming while negative values indicate heat losses cooling the last three terms on the right hand side of eq 3 were considered negligible for the following reasons first the presence of a thermocline during the summer stratification period effectively decoupled the hypolimnion from the atmosphere nordbo et al 2011 and in turn minimized j b and δ j f since standley lake outflows are located at the bottom of the reservoir second precipitation accounts for only 2 of total water input to standley lake making j p negligible therefore eq 3 can be written as 4 r net j w h λ e and the error in the ebc can be quantified as the absolute residual of the eq 4 or as the ratio h λ e r net j w nordbo et al 2011 random measurement uncertainty of the 10 minute reynold s averaged turbulent fluxes was statistically determined following a successive day approach as described in hollinger and richardson 2005 and knowles et al 2012 equivalent meteorological conditions were defined as when successive measurements of t a were within 3 c u were within 1 m s 1 hollinger richardson 2005 and r net were within 75 w m 2 knowles et al 2012 regardless of time of day random uncertainty was assessed as the standard deviation of the difference between the measurement pairs 5 σ s q 1 2 σ x 1 x 2 where sq is the measurement uncertainty and x 1 and x 2 are the successive flux measurements the requirements for equivalent conditions were met 20 of the time giving a sample size of approximately 10 000 10 minute mean fluxes 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions prevailing winds at standley lake were west northwesterly averaging 2 8 m s 1 fig 2 but increased variability in wind direction associated with terrain modified fig 1 early morning upslope easterlies and afternoon evening downslope westerlies flows were observed especially in the spring march april and may winter december january and february experienced a higher average wind speed of 3 4 m s 1 with eleven distinct high wind events surpassing an hourly average of 10 m s 1 the lowest hourly average wind speed was measured in the summer june july and august at 2 3 m s 1 calculations of the flux footprint kljun et al 2015 or upwind distance contributing to turbulent flux measurements fetch indicated that the mean distance of maximum contribution to the turbulent flux measurements was 112 m upwind of the tower during unstable z l 0 where z is measurement height m and l is the obukhov length m atmospheric conditions 154 m upwind during stable z l greater than 0 conditions and 90 of all flux measurements were sampled over a median upwind distance of 447 m with favorable over lake fetch these distances of flux contribution were well within the area of standley lake fig 1 the study period was relatively warm and dry when compared to 1991 2020 climate normal fig 3 measured in boulder co noaa physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov boulder the mean study period air temperature was 1 2 c higher than the climate normal 11 0 c and total precipitation was 106 mm less than normal 540 mm liquid precipitation accumulated most in late winter and throughout the spring in february 2021 the front range experienced well below normal air temperatures and above normal snowfall the lower air temperatures in january and february 2021 led to a 3 day longer 2020 2021 ice season than 2019 2020 the 2020 thermal stratification period began in mid may and lasted through late september with the thermocline reaching a maximum depth of roughly 16 m in august ice on first date with 100 ice cover and ice off first date with no detectable ice cover dates were approximated from visual estimates recorded in the dam tender s daily log provided by sloc as well as from modis imagery from nasa s terra satellite obtained at https worldview earthdata nasa gov the 2019 2020 ice on period lasted just over a month with 100 ice cover first observed on february 5 2020 until completely ice free on march 9 2020 for 2020 2021 the ice on date was february 4 2021 and ice cover persisted until the ice off date of march 11 2021 3 2 artificial neural network modeled fluxes the artificial neural network model forced with local meteorological conditions predicted sensible and latent heat fluxes well we found that the water fetch h neural network output explained 73 of the variance in actual 10 minute water fetch h measurements fig 4 and the slope and intercept of the linear fit were 0 93 and 3 96 w m 2 respectively further indicating strong agreement between measurements and model output for λ e an r2 of 0 75 was found between the water fetch λ e neural network output and actual 10 minute water fetch λ e measurements fig 4 and the slope 0 93 and intercept 2 50 w m 2 of the linear fit showed good agreement between water fetch measurements and model outputs this is a promising finding since in many water resources management applications shore based measurements are the most accessible these artificial neural network findings show potential for being a reliable method for gap filling large portions of a flux time series but also the potential to be used on its own to model fluxes if local meteorological conditions are available 3 3 flux uncertainty a shapiro wilk s test indicated that the distributions of the random turbulent flux measurement uncertainty were not normal p 0 01 but were leptokurtic with large tails central peaks and were slightly skewed negative for λ e positive for h better fitting a laplace or double exponential distribution rather than a gaussian fig 5 because of this distribution we used 2 β the double exponential equivalent to σ where β i 1 n x i x n as our uncertainty measure the uncertainty analysis was broken into three parts 1 all of the measurements that fit the successive day criteria 2 just the direct water fetch flux measurements and 3 just the artificial neural network model flux estimates this allowed us to quantify the amount of error introduced from the eddy flux measurements separately from any additional error introduced by the neural network model estimates as expected the modeled flux estimates had greater uncertainty than the direct measurements e g 228 compared to 106 w m 2 for λ e table 1 but the modeled flux values were still acceptable in the context of model performance and relative flux uncertainty 13 and 19 for λ e and h respectively random measurement uncertainty for the entire dataset was 153 w m 2 for λ e and 65 w m 2 for h table 1 or about 8 and 11 of total midday summertime fluxes summed fluxes between 1200 and 1600 lt during the summer months for λ e and h respectively uncertainty was smallest in the fall and summer for λ e and h means 133 and 52 w m 2 respectively and largest in the winter and spring for λ e and h means 186 and 90 w m 2 respectively far fewer similar flux uncertainty analyses have been conducted over lakes than terrestrial sites however our mean percent error estimates of turbulent flux uncertainty aligns well with those reported by hollinger richardson 2005 or knowles et al 2012 3 4 lake surface energy budget closure for the period where water temperature profile measurements were available for heat storage calculations the cumulative λ e h underestimated the cumulative available energy rnet jw by 24 daily average of 44 w m 2 mean monthly energy balance closure based on daily calculations of λ e h rnet jw ranged from 54 in october to 98 in july with the other two summer months experiencing closure greater than 80 may experienced large overestimates by the flux measurements 130 which could be attributed to the failure of the voltage regulator combined with times of erroneous heat storage estimates only 30 of days had reliable estimates of all four energy budget components may also experienced two well defined periods of vertical mixing on may 4 5 and 24 25 2020 both accompanied by high wind speeds hourly average u greater than 10 m s 1 and low maximum net radiation values 498 706 w m 2 the mixing of the water column likely introduced random noise and errors into the heat storage calculation nordbo et al 2011 therefore the energy budget closure fig 6 shows the hourly ensemble means of energy balance components depicting an average day for each month that lake heat storage data were available ensemble means were only calculated from direct water fetch measurements to avoid any errors introduced by the neural network model and best explain the temporal patterns and disparities in the energy budget closure since heat storage was only available at 6 hour intervals we used a simplified hourly ensemble mean residual res r net λ e h for fig 6 and then compared it to the heat storage 6 hr ensemble mean in all months except october a 4 6 hour time lag between peak rnet and peak λ e was present contributing to temporal imbalances in the energy balance closure in general jw aligned well with res e g august panel in fig 6 indicating that most of the energy balance residual can be explained by lake heat storage effects in september and october when the thermal stratification period ended and the lake began to turn over large releases of stored energy negative jw in fig 6 occurred and help further explain the imbalance during the day in september and october the residual is large and positive but jw stays negative this discrepancy is likely attributed to the large rnet and the turbulent flux measurements not adequately capturing the stored heat release from the reservoir nearly all terrestrial studies show that the ec method underestimates the available energy by roughly 20 foken 2008 wilson et al 2002 lakes studies that used the ec method are much fewer than terrestrial studies table 2 but those lake studies that do report energy balance closure found both over and underestimates in the energy balance our cumulative energy balance closure of 76 aligns well with other relevant over lake eddy covariance studies as shown in table 2 and underestimates here could be attributed to many factors including but not limited to the following first the difference in locations between flux and temperature profile jw measurements fig 1 since ec measurements represent turbulent fluxes from a large changing footprint area while jw was calculated from point measurements approximately 1 2 km away additionally the lack of water temperature measurements above 1 m available to calculate jw could cause inaccuracies in jw and inaccuracies in neural network estimation of turbulent fluxes and how radiation components were estimated could also be present however the ensemble means presented in fig 6 were calculated from only the direct water fetch measurements and they show acceptable monthly energy balance closures furthermore the ec system s inability to detect energy transport in large eddies foken 2008 nordbo et al 2011 is another possible reason for the unclosed energy balance standley lake s close proximity to the front range could lead to orographic influences on the local thermal characteristics and wind fields in turn creating large eddies that are not normally measured by ec instruments 3 5 turbulent fluxes diurnal cycles in the latent and sensible heat turbulent fluxes were present throughout the study period the hourly averaged λ e was usually small and positive except in late spring through fall afternoons usually between 1200 and 1800 lt when average hourly values increased and were consistently around or above 300 w m 2 fig 7 in the fall daily λ e decreased in magnitude and duration with hourly average values around 100 w m 2 between 1200 and 1500 lt until the daily cycles broke down into fewer but relatively larger magnitude events the h was often small but stronger positive h values were observed around midday a few hours ahead of λ e throughout the spring summer and fall in the late fall and winter h was often negative i e directed downwards for extended periods of time the larger summertime λ e values coincided with daily peaks in vapor pressure gradient and wind speed fig 8 based on the ensemble hourly means for all days in june july or august the hourly vapor pressure gradient reached or surpassed 2 kpa in mid afternoon and at the same time the hourly average horizontal wind speed reached its peak between 3 and 5 m s 1 the consistent summertime diurnal patterns in wind speed and vapor pressure gradients led to consistent daily evaporation cycles equivalent to roughly 5 mm d 1 throughout the summer months the importance of the vapor pressure gradient and horizontal wind speeds to λ e is further supported by the linear relationships between hourly λ e and hourly δ e u and u δ e fig 9 all three months show strong positive relationships between λ e and the vapor pressure gradient horizontal wind speed and the function of the two in june and august hourly average horizontal wind speed explains most of the variation in hourly latent heat fluxes while in july the function of hourly horizontal wind speed and the vapor pressure gradient explains most of the variation in hourly latent heat fluxes as fall and winter progressed the diurnal patterns in λ e and h were replaced by longer episodic events usually lasting 18 36 h corresponding to periods of increased winds and air temperature and decreased humidity indicating the influences of advection an evaporation event occurred over the course of roughly 30 h beginning in the afternoon of october 16 2020 fig 10 and persisted until the evening of october 17 resulting in 14 mm of water loss through evaporation driven by a strong west to east surface air pressure gradient see supplementary materials for synoptic chart hourly average winds rapidly increased from 2 to 14 m s 1 and with the strong winds came an increase in air temperatures 15 c a negative lake surface temperature gradient 4 6 c and increased vapor pressure gradient 2 kpa these conditions were indicative of a chinook windstorm and helped enhance evaporation through the increased vapor pressure gradient increased horizontal wind speed and additional energy supplied by the negative downward h during this period based on a linear regression analysis between λ e and h δ e and u all three played important roles in enhancing evaporation as when combined they explained 80 of the variance in λ e p 0 01 when considered individually h δ e and u explained respectively 42 29 and 55 of variation in λ e p 0 01 for each evaporation events such as shown in fig 10 associated with chinooks winds and a negative sensible heat flux occurred five times in october each lasting on average 30 h the high frequency of these large evaporation events in october led to consistently high daily evaporation rates for the month these periods of negative h continued into the winter months and often aligned with chinook windstorms which in the colorado rocky mountains occur on average 40 times per year most often in january ives 1950 eight chinook related evaporation events occurred during the winter resulting in 77 mm of water loss or 32 to total winter evaporation in nordbo et al 2011 increased lake evaporation was also coincident with negative h while other related evaporation studies in locations without foehn winds h remained positive in fall and winter blanken et al 2011 liu et al 2011 moreo swancar 2013 xiao et al 2018 these unique cold season chinooks provide adequate atmospheric conditions and significant energy through the downward directed h likely play a large role in reservoir evaporation processes along the front range the possible effects of chinooks are also important to consider in relation to water management and allocations decisions since they occur during times when many reservoir managers assume evaporation to be minimal 3 6 reservoir evaporative water loss for water balance and water management purposes expressing evaporation not as a latent heat flux but as the equivalent loss of water as a depth per time is informative with this in mind fig 11 shows the daily e totals as well as the 14 day moving mean to show longer term patterns spring evaporation was highly variable with daily average rates ranging from 2 5 mm d 1 in march to 3 9 mm d 1 in may to account for the may over power period when we did not have reliable measurement the daily average evaporation from the rest of the month was applied to those 13 days summer evaporation was consistent with daily averages varying by only 0 5 mm d 1 where june experienced the highest daily average e at 5 5 mm d 1 with july and august close behind with 5 1 and 5 0 mm d 1 with the onset of fall daily averages began to decrease with the exception of october where daily average reached back up to 5 0 mm d 1 in october there were 16 days with evaporation rates greater than 4 0 mm d 1 and the largest daily evaporation rate of the study period 11 7 mm d 1 was observed on october 11 2020 similar to spring winter saw overall low evaporation with the exception of the eight chinook related enhanced evaporation events daily evaporation rates as presented in fig 11 are extremely valuable for water resources managers as they allow the managers to make informed allocations decisions especially in the cold season in the cold season managers often assume evaporation is not occurring or minimal even though fig 11 shows that is not the case as 14 day moving averages rarely go below 2 mm d 1 annual and seasonal evaporation totals as well as the daily means for each timescale are shown in table 3 the consistent daily cycles in evaporation that were explored in section 3 5 proved to be important as the majority of the evaporative water losses from the reservoir occurred during the summer months contributing 35 of the total evaporation followed by the fall at 27 and winter and spring seasons contributed 17 and 28 respectively when combined fall and winter contributed 44 of total evaporation with 20 of that evaporation occurring during chinook windstorms daily average e peaked in the summer at 5 2 mm d 1 and was lowest in the winter at 2 7 mm d 1 overall daily evaporation rates averaged at 3 7 mm d 1 and the annual total was 1377 mm assumed over the full surface area of the reservoir this amount of water loss is comparable to the annual water use of 5 500 typical 3 4 member households or 2 standley lake s service area the study period s annual evaporative water loss is comparable to historic annual class a pan measurements of 1311 mm collected in nearby fort collins co between 1938 and 1941 horton 1943 at lake hefner in oklahoma a reservoir similar in shape and climate region and roughly double the size of standley lake four class a pans were used and the average annual evaporation was 1403 mm harbeck 1954 after a 0 7 pan coefficient adjustment was applied our annual e total is almost double that of white bear lake in minnesota double the surface area in a temperate climate where ec and model based estimates determined annual evaporation for 2014 2016 to be between 559 and 779 mm xiao et al 2018 other ec based lake evaporation studies have been conducted on relatively larger and colder climate lakes such as great slave lake in canada blanken et al 2000 lake superior in the united states blanken et al 2011 and lake qinghai in china li et al 2016 and found annual evaporation rates of 386 485 464 645 and 828 mm respectively our relatively large evaporation estimates compared to these other lakes that vary in size type and locations demonstrates the need for direct evaporation measurements at multiple lakes and reservoirs throughout the western united states 4 conclusions this 12 month study demonstrated the temporal variations in evaporation and its local drivers from a water supply reservoir in the colorado front range daily total evaporation rates ranged up to 11 7 mm d 1 and in general evaporation from standley lake followed a diurnal pattern peaking in mid to late afternoon lasting around 4 6 h and decreasing into the nighttime hours this cycle was most pronounced in late spring through early fall when low atmospheric moisture and diurnal wind patterns were consistent the diurnal cycles broke down in the late fall and winter when evaporation was mostly driven by high winds and episodic advection of relatively warm dry air over standley lake as occurred during the chinook windstorm on october 16 18 2020 and 14 other similar events these events were interesting in the fact that cold season negative h has been observed in only a few lake evaporation studies and at standley lake the events contributed 77 mm or nearly a third 32 of wintertime evaporation chinook climatology in the western united states should continue to be studied in relation to turbulent fluxes to see if chinook frequency will increase in the future and possibly lead to more enhanced evaporation events annual evaporation from standley lake totaled to 1377 mm consistent with annual totals from historical evaporation studies in similar semiarid regions these measurements at standley lake are the first step towards a long term evaporation monitoring network in the western united states livneh et al 2016 continued observations at standley lake as well as at other reservoirs are needed to improve our understanding of spatial evaporation patterns variability among years and the impacts of terrain modified flow on reservoir evaporation the data presented here along with the continued measurements at standley lake will be instrumental in the modeling and forecasting of evaporation from more
