8465,study region the upper niger and bani river basins in west africa study focus the growing demand for food water and energy led mali and guinea to develop ambitious hydropower and irrigation plans including the construction of a new dam and the extension of irrigation schemes these two developments will take place upstream of sensible ecosystem hotspots while the feasibility of development plans in terms of water availability and sustainability is questionable where agricultural development in past decades focused mainly on intensifying dry season crops cultivation future plans include extension in both the dry and wet seasons new hydrological insights for the region today s irrigation demand corresponds to 7 of the average annual niger discharge and could account to one third in 2045 an extension of irrigated agriculture is possible in the wet season while extending dry season cropping would be largely compromised with the one major existing sélingué dam an additional large fomi or moussako dam would not completely satisfy dry season irrigation demands in the 2045 scenario but would reduce the estimated supply gap from 36 to 14 however discharge peaks may decrease by 40 reducing the inundated area in the inner niger delta by 21 while average annual discharge decreases by 30 sustainable development should therefore consider investments in water saving irrigation and management practices to enhance the feasibility of the envisaged irrigation plans instead of completely relying on the construction of a flow regime altering dam keywords reservoir and irrigation management hydrological modelling fomi moussako dam upper niger and bani river basin inner niger delta 1 introduction the fast growing population and socio economic development in the case study area of the upper niger and bani river basins unbb in west africa add more and more pressure on natural resources ogilvie et al 2010 the unbb is no exception but rather represents various cases of water stressed river systems in semi arid and arid regions worldwide sudan for instance uses the blue and white nile rivers to irrigate one of the largest irrigation schemes worldwide with almost 900 000 ha abdelhadi et al 2000 in pakistan about 73 of the average indus flows are abstracted to a vast irrigation scheme archer et al 2010 in the são francisco river basin in brazil the agricultural water demand in the year 2010 corresponded to 77 of the total water demand koch et al 2018c worldwide the agricultural sector is by far the largest water user consuming on average about 70 of freshwater resources fao 2011 in the african context irrigation does not play a significant role where only 6 of the total cultivated area is irrigated which is lower than in other world regions like 14 in latin america and 37 in asia you et al 2010 possible reasons for this low share of irrigated agriculture are the undeveloped state of institutions for irrigation and the prevalence of subsistence farming you et al 2010 however in the case study area of the unbb irrigation plays a role to meet the growing food demands plans to utilise the available land and water resources that have been developed brl ingéniérie brl 2007a meme 2007 rh et al 2007 are continuously revised to account for development pathways not considered in previous plans brl and gef 2012 coyne and bellier 2009 but the current expansion plans have not adequately included possible implications in terms of water availability distribution and allocation hertzog et al 2012 the office du niger odn a semi autonomous government agency in mali is one of the key actors with regard to food production responsible for the administration and development of a number of irrigation schemes hertzog et al 2012 that are by far the largest in the unbb the major odn irrigation scheme is located just upstream of the inner niger delta ind and is supplied with water from the niger river via a system of canals diverting water from the markala dam the markala dam is operational since 1947 and was actually supposed to supply an irrigated area of 960 000 ha zwarts et al 2005 however in the year 2005 only 113 303 ha were cultivated brl and betico 2016 according to recent development plans it is envisaged to expand the area to 460 000 ha until the year 2045 and to intensify agricultural production particularly in the dry season brl and betico 2016 up to now it is not clear how realistic this endeavour is with regard to availability of water resources and sustainable development as a consequence of the unimodal rainfall regime in the unbb the discharge regime of the niger and bani rivers entering the ind is characterised by a low flow season between december and may and a high flow season from june to november the natural water availability in the dry season puts a clear limit to agricultural water supply already today an extension of irrigation schemes would therefore either require improved water use efficiency or the construction of new dams to satisfy the required water demands dams and reservoirs have always played and will play an important role for the implementation of agricultural development and hydropower production in the unbb generally reservoir operations alter the natural flow regime by increasing flows during the dry season and reducing the flows and flood peaks during the rainy wet season liersch et al 2013 beside numerous small dams a total of five medium to large dams are currently in operation in the unbb the sotuba dam was the first dam in the upper niger river it was built in 1929 and produces a small amount of hydroelectric power and continuously diverts 8 m3 s to irrigation schemes but its impact on the water balance and the niger flow regime is negligible zwarts et al 2005 35 years after the construction of the markala dam in 1947 the sélingué dam was built in 1982 to impound the sankarani river a tributary to the niger river in mali with a storage volume of 2 35 billion m3 bm3 it serves the purpose to generate hydroelectric power and to supply agricultural areas nearby with water for irrigation kuper et al 2002 in the bani river basin two comparably small dams were recently built the talo dam operational since 2007 0 18 bm3 and the djenné dam 2014 under rehabilitation 0 36 bm3 zwarts 2010 zwarts et al 2005 their main purpose is to supply adjacent irrigation schemes more reliably with required water volumes the effect of the existing dams and irrigation schemes in the unbb is already observable downstream at the inlets to the ind marie et al 2007 water volumes are reduced by withdrawals for irrigation and evaporation and seepage from reservoirs a noticeable share of 55 70 of water withdrawals can be attributed to low water use efficiency including high transmission losses in the irrigation canal network hertzog et al 2012 schüttrumpf and bökkers 2008 keita et al 2002 however the combined effect of existing dam infrastructure is relatively small compared to the impacts on downstream discharge expected to be caused by the planned dam in the niandan river in the niger headwaters in guinea since decades it is planned to construct the so called fomi dam with an envisaged storage volume of 5 3 bm3 this is more than twice as large as the currently existing storages in the unbb together and the dam is expected to amplify the already observed impacts on the flow regime recently it is considered to build the dam approximately 20 km upstream where it would be called moussako dam with comparable storage properties and therefore comparable expected impacts tractebel 2017a b for convenience the dam is henceforth called fomi dam in this study although it might be constructed at the moussako location with its large storage capacity the fomi dam has the potential to substantially alter the flow regime by further increasing the flows during the dry season and decreasing the high flows and flood peaks during the reservoir refilling period indirectly the fomi dam may also lead to long term reduced discharge entering the ind by enabling or supporting higher water withdrawals for agricultural consumption in the odn irrigation scheme in the dry season the increasing demand for food and energy in mali and guinea may justify such plans but depending on the level of implementation they are expected to affect downstream ecosystems and associated livelihoods of local communities the ind is an important seasonally inundated wetland providing natural resources and livelihoods for more than 10 of mali s population inhabiting the delta about 40 of malian cattle depend on the fodder production and grazing grounds in the ind while 80 of malian fish production comes from the ind rh et al 2010 livestock and fisheries contribute respectively with 10 and 4 to malian gdp rh et al 2010 dolo et al 2005 and form an essential component of malian food consumption not only quantitatively but also qualitatively as it increases nutritional diversity and gastronomic variety the upper niger and bani rivers constitute the inflows into the ind altering their flow regime towards generally lower average annual inflows and a changed annual cycle is expected to challenge the integrity of the ind ecosystem this ecosystem has evolved in and has adapted to the natural variability of the hydro climatic conditions prevalent in the last centuries including extremely wet e g 1950s and 1960s and dry e g 1970s and 1980s decades in very wet periods like in the 1950s the inundated area can expand up to 36 000 km2 in the flooding season zwarts et al 2005 over the period 2000 to 2011 ogilvie et al 2015 estimate the variation of the annual maximum flooded surface area between 10 300 km2 and 20 000 km2 receding progressively to a magnitude of 3800 km2 on average in the dry season in extraordinary dry years the inundated area can be much smaller the seasonal flood dynamics are vitally important for its integrity the inundated area directly relates to ecosystem services that are provided by the ind for example fish rejuvenation is dependent on the availability of various habitats suitable for spawning and nursing of the young fish that will only form under particular flood dynamics similarly the large amounts of submerged grasses like bourgou used as cattle fodder will only develop when favorable habitats exist during germination and early plant growth stages as a rule of thumb one can say that the larger the inundated area the higher the productivity of the ind zwarts et al 2005 the altered flow regime and the general reduction of inflows and flood peaks entering the ind caused by intensified activities in the unbb upstream the ind like agricultural and hydropower production constitute clear trade offs with the ind s ecosystem integrity and the services it provides the first objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the plans to expand irrigated agriculture in the scheme operated by odn considering different reservoir operation scenarios the gap between the estimated irrigation water demand and supply in the years 2025 2035 and 2045 determines the feasibility three reservoir settings are analysed where the first scenario represents the current state with only the sélingué dam operational in the sankarani river in the other two scenarios it is assumed that the fomi dam is operational in the niandan river in the niger headwaters and either operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime or to optimise hydropower production the second objective is to assess the combined impacts of increasing agricultural water demands and reservoir operations on the discharges of the niger and bani rivers and the average maximal inundated area in the ind however the impacts on the ind s ecosystem services are not covered in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the upper niger and bani river basins unbb in west africa are defined in this study as the catchments upstream the ind at the gauges ké macina niger and sofara bani see fig 1 the unbb covers an area of 273 700 km2 the following countries have a decreasing share in the basin area mali guinea ivory coast and burkina faso according to ciesin 2016 the basin was populated by 9 8 million people in 2005 and increased by 42 to 13 9 million inhabitants in 2015 and thus belongs to a region with one of the fastest growing population worldwide corresponding to an annual growth rate of about 4 following the köppen geiger climate classification the unbb is located in a climatic transition zone fig 1 about three quarters of the area are characterised by the tropical savanna climate and the northern quarter is dominated by a warm semi arid climate in the very north the basin is influenced by the warm desert climate and in the south by the monsoon climate 2 2 data following data sources were used to set up the hydrological model described in section 2 3 the srtm digital elevation model in 90 m horizontal resolution jarvis et al 2008 was used to delineate the unbb and its sub basins soil properties were derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao 2009 and information on land use cover was taken from glc2000 bartholomé and belward 2005 the source of daily weather variables in the period 1960 2000 such as daily precipitation minimum mean and maximum temperatures are the gridded watch forcing data wfd with a spatial resolution of 0 5 weedon et al 2011 wfd are based on ecmwf re analysis era40 uppala et al 2005 assimilating surface observations it was found that wfd radiation data are consistently lower than observations in the unbb and radiation was therefore calculated based on minimum and maximum temperature and the respective sub basin s latitude according to hargreaves et al 1985 simulated radiation data were adjusted to fit values estimated by solargis info discharge data of 10 gauges provided by the global runoff data centre grdc were used to calibrate and validate discharge simulations data and information from various reports brl and betico 2016 brl ingéniérie brl 2007a brl ingéniérie brl 2007b brl and dhi 2007 zwarts et al 2005 were used to parameterise the reservoirs and to develop land and water management scenarios the rating curves relating reservoir water level volume and area for the fomi dam were derived from the srtm dem using the grass gis module r lake which computes the water volume and flooded surface area at given water levels values in between the given water levels are linearly interpolated corresponding values and other relevant reservoir data are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplement 2 2 1 climate projection uncertainties hulme 2001 states that there is no such thing as normal rainfall in the sahel instead rainfall fluctuates erratically and the normal is rather the variability of rainfall in space as well as from year to year and from decade to decade hulme 2001 an adequate spatio temporal representation of weather variables in such climatic transition zones governed by the west african monsoon system is challenging for climate models turner et al 2011 cook and vizy 2006 moreover rainfall projections of global circulation models gcms diverge in future scenarios where some models project a wetter and others a drier future in the unbb monerie et al 2017 rowell et al 2015 aich et al 2014 biasutti 2013 giannini 2010 cook and vizy 2006 see also figs s1 and s2 in the supplement according to giannini 2010 there is no way to discern whether the future climate in the sahel will be different from that experienced over the 20th century according to rowell et al 2015 the projection uncertainties of climate models in the sahel are not reduced if only the best performing models are selected vetter et al 2015 and hattermann et al 2018 found that gcms are the main source of uncertainty in climate impact assessment in the unbb while hydrological models contribute only a small part to uncertainty vetter et al 2017 confirms this finding for the entire niger basin 2 2 2 dealing with climate projection uncertainties as discussed in liersch et al 2018 the value of climate projection data for quantitative application oriented studies where a certain degree of accuracy in input data is required is still rather limited even bias corrected climate simulations do not always provide input that is of adequate quality for regional impact studies liersch et al 2018 therefore we use a historical gridded weather dataset weedon et al 2011 representing the variable hydro climatic conditions observed in the period 1960 2000 to investigate the feasibility of irrigation extension in odn and to assess the impacts of combined irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios on river discharges and the inundated area in the ind fig 2 shows that the years 1960 2000 represent a large range of natural rainfall variability and consist of a wet period the 1960s with rainfall anomalies above the 20th century average and an extremely dry period in the 1980s where all years are below the 20th century average it is also the period with the highest density of meteorological stations in the unbb schneider et al 2015 and therefore the uncertainties are expected to be the lowest decision makers may have experienced these extreme conditions themselves and will remember what consequences consecutive wet or dry years have had on e g high and low flows in the niger and bani rivers agricultural and fishery production or the extent of the inundated area in the ind climate simulations for the 21st century show that the cyclic behaviour with consecutive wet and dry years that was observed and is simulated by gcms in the past will continue in future independently if a gcm projects a dryer wetter or no trend in annual rainfall at all figs s3 and s4 in the supplement communicating the uncertainties related to climate change projections and their consequences for future water availability is difficult and does usually not satisfy stakeholders and decision makers because they do not know or understand how to prepare or adapt to these diverging trends and may thus be reluctant to trust in the presented results in addition to this following arguments justify the application of historical meteorological data in this study instead of applying climate scenarios are a water resources management studies require a certain degree of meteorological input data accuracy which is particular with regard to rainfall patterns and volumes in the unbb not provided by climate models and b the 40 years observational meteorological data show a high variability allowing the analysis of current and future water management activities under a range from extremely dry to wet hydro climatic conditions a deficiency with this approach is that the projected temperature increase of 1 5 1 7 c between 2030 2049 and 1986 2005 is neglected fig s2b which would result in higher potential evapotranspiration rates of approximately 2 reducing water availability 2 3 hydrological modelling the soil and water integrated model swim is an eco hydrological model developed by krysanova et al 2005 it operates at the daily time step and is a semi distributed and process based catchment model which is continuously developed and adapted to meet new or specific challenges and requirements krysanova et al 2015 swim was already applied to the upper and entire niger river basin in several studies aich et al 2016 aich et al 2015 aich et al 2014 liersch et al 2013 liersch et al 2012 the model was used in this study because it contains sophisticated features to account for various reservoir operation options and irrigation management which are required to address the research questions at hand in this study swim was calibrated and validated to observed discharges provided by the global runoff data centre grdc at 10 selected gauges in the unbb fig 1 available during the period 1960 2000 where the first year is omitted in the analysis in a first step a manual sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the model behaviour and to define reasonable parameter ranges based on these parameter ranges the sub catchments were finally calibrated using a multi objective evolutionary automatic algorithm the performance of the simulations of the annual cycle is exemplarily shown for the most important gauges used in this study baro sankarani and ké macina corresponding figures at the daily time step are presented in the supplement in fig s5 the model results show a very good fit for the gauge baro the closest downstream gauge from the location where the fomi dam may be built see fig 3 a and b a rather large volumetric error pbias is simulated in the calibration period at gauge sankarani before the sélingué dam was built see fig 3c however in the period where the sélingué dam was operational the results can be judged as very good in terms of volumetric error and seasonality r2 see fig 3d r2 values of 1 are achieved in both the calibration and validation periods at gauge ké macina downstream the markala dam where average discharge is underestimated by 8 4 in the calibration period and overestimated by 17 4 in the validation period see fig 3e and f following model performance in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse were achieved at the daily time step in the calibration and validation periods baro 0 77 and 0 77 sankarani 0 78 and 0 26 ké macina 0 93 and 0 86 however the results are reasonable enough at all 10 gauges to answer the questions addressed in this study 2 3 1 reservoir module a reservoir module developed by koch et al 2013 was implemented in swim to account for the effects of dam infrastructures in river basins that may depending on their capacities and operation rules substantially alter the natural flow regime and reduce downstream water availability by evaporation and seepage the actual reservoir area volume and water levels are changing on a daily time step depending on inflows reservoir release and losses due to evapotranspiration seepage and withdrawals actual evapotranspiration from the reservoir area etres is determined by the area weighted sums of the lake s open water surface evaporation etp and actual evapotranspiration eta from the land area i e the reservoir area not inundated at the respective day both etp and eta rates depend on the actual volume of the reservoir the daily seepage rate is computed as a user defined fraction of the actual total storage volume the module was already applied to investigate reservoir filling strategies and their downstream impacts which is especially relevant for dam projects in the planning phase liersch et al 2017 to analyse the impacts of various operation rules on downstream discharges koch et al 2018a liersch et al 2017 lobanova et al 2017 lobanova et al 2016 aich et al 2016 to account for storage effects of natural lakes liersch et al 2018 and to simulate hydropower production koch et al 2018b liersch et al 2017 lobanova et al 2016 koch et al 2013 2 3 2 water allocation module the water allocation module in swim allows the withdrawal of water volumes from river sections or reservoirs water demand data can be included at the daily monthly or average monthly time step abstracted volumes can either be allocated to water users such as irrigation schemes or cities outside the system river basin or to water users inside the system in this study the module was used to account for reported water uptakes in the past during the calibration and validation periods and to investigate scenarios of planned developments of several irrigation schemes in the unbb since the main irrigation scheme odn is located outside the unbb groundwater return flows are neglected here 2 4 scenarios the coupled irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios developed in this study consider different assumptions of reservoir settings and withdrawals for irrigation schemes at several locations in the unbb details are described in the following sections to analyse the reservoir operation impacts on irrigation water supply river discharge and inundated area under past hydro climatic conditions the scenario settings are constant over the entire simulation period even if dams were built during sélingué in 1982 or after talo 2007 djenné 2014 fomi planned the scenario period land use was also not considered to change over the scenario period 2 4 1 reservoir scenarios reservoir settings comprise the number of active reservoirs in each scenario as well as their operation rules following dams are considered in this study fomi niandan river guinea planned sélingué sankarani river mali talo bani river mali and djenné bani river mali the sotuba dam and the markala dam in mali along the niger river are not implemented as reservoirs in the model because their storage volume is very small these dams solely serve the purpose of diverting water to irrigation schemes however water withdrawals at the markala dam are considered by the water allocation module withdrawals at the sotuba dam account for only 0 2 of niger river discharge and were thus neglected in this study the sélingué dam and the fomi dam planned are both impounding tributaries of the niger river they are therefore relevant for the assessment of the feasibility of irrigation expansion plans in the odn irrigation scheme and for the investigation of inflows and inundated area in the ind the talo and djenné dams in the bani river basin are not relevant for the odn irrigation scheme but for the inflows and inundated area in the ind however due to their small storage capacities they play only a minor role in this study operation of the sélingué dam was parameterised in the model to represent realistic dam management in the period between 1982 and 2000 koch et al 2013 the planned fomi dam was parameterised to represent two different operation rules one rule was developed to assess the impacts of the fomi dam when operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario with a dam height of 388 m a s l the simulated operation is aimed at generating a firm yield of 35 mw which corresponds to about 80 of the potential mean production of 43 mw coyne and bellier 2009 these settings represent the state of the planning process in march 2017 fomi directorate 2017 where the total storage would have a volume of 5 279 billion cubic metres bm3 with a dead storage of 1 212 bm3 23 of total storage however a recent environmental impact study aecom 2017 suggests a lower dam height and consequently a smaller storage capacity 2 415 bm3 to be an alternative in the latter the active storage has due to the large dead storage an active capacity of only 1 203 bm3 50 of total storage this latter dam setting is represented by the fomi env scenario where released discharge largely preserves the natural flow regime downstream the dam in general the minimum discharge from the dam in the env scenario is based on the monthly q95 values derived from swim simulations in the period 1961 2000 the minimum discharge in the low flow season is set to 10 m3 s in the high flow season the capacity of the hydropower plant 421 m3 s is set as the maximum discharge in the env scenario the release from the reservoir does not change the natural flow regime noticeably during the dry season between january and june in the wet season however discharge is reduced by the reservoir management in the env scenario to a certain extent in both scenarios the dead storage head is assumed to be at an elevation of 370 m a s l water level surface area and storage volume relationships are shown in the tables s1 and s2 in the supplement the seepage rates in all implemented dams are assumed to be in the order of the rate in the sélingué dam where zwarts et al 2005 assumes losses of 0 83 bm3 a 2 4 2 irrigation scenarios monthly irrigation water demands dimon in m3 s employed in the irrigation scenarios in odn were simulated with the model used by the hydro agricultural improvement programme brl and betico 2016 the monthly water demand in odn is estimated based on monthly crop demand dcmon in millimetre per day corrected by a monthly irrigation network efficiency coefficient coefmon and multiplied with the irrigated area a in hectare for a given target year eq 1a the irrigated area for eight different crops and the crop calendar is shown in tables s4 and s5 in the supplement the monthly irrigation demand for the other irrigation schemes was estimated based on the annual irrigation scheme water demand dsyr corrected by a monthly coefficient coefmon see eq 1b as was estimated for the action plan for the sustainable development of the niger basin of the niger river basin authority brl ingéniérie brl 2007a changes in water use efficiency as expressed by coefmon were not taken into account in the scenarios vandersypen et al 2006 found for instance that the water use efficiency has not improved between 1995 and 2005 1a dimon odn scheme a dcmon coefmon 8640 1b dimon other schemes a dsyr coefmon 8640 the baseline for all sites refers to estimated irrigation demands in the year 2005 brl and betico 2016 brl ingéniérie brl 2007a based on these documents irrigation scenarios were derived for the year 2025 for all sites additionally water demands were estimated for the periods around 2035 and 2045 in the irrigation scheme operated by odn brl and betico 2016 corresponding data used in the simulation is shown in table 1 and monthly withdrawals are listed in table s3 in the supplement based on our simulations the long term average natural discharge at the markala dam was about 1140 m3 s in the period 1961 2000 the current irrigation demand 79 3 m3 s equivalent to 2000 mm a corresponds to 7 of long term average natural niger discharge and will according to the development plans increase to 14 in 2025 to 20 in 2035 and to 27 in 2045 table 1 remarkable is the range of irrigation demands in relation to annual discharges indicating a high variability of water availability in the 2045 irrigation scenario the irrigation water demand would correspond to 50 of discharge in the year with lowest discharges and to 19 in the year with highest discharge in the entire simulation period table 1 withdrawals for irrigation are considered in the model as water volumes diverted to irrigation schemes from reservoirs at the sites

released at the markala dam is 50 m3 s brl and dhi 2007 hence water uptake for irrigation can be restricted during the low flow season by that threshold however the sélingué and markala dams commission in mali aim to meet a minimum of only 40 m3 s in reality even this agreement is not always respected odn mentions that in 2015 2016 and 2017 the minimum of 40 m3 s was not met for 105 100 and 109 days respectively while the 50 m3 s threshold is applied in simulations to analyse the feasibility of irrigation expansion it is not applied in simulations used to analyse the impacts on ind inflows and the inundated area because of the non compliance issue 2 5 performance criteria and definitions to analyse the feasibility of the irrigation scenarios in the irrigation scheme operated by odn the simulated daily supply gaps sg in percent were aggregated to monthly deficits for each year see eq 4 the relative supply gap or deficit is the share of the actual monthly withdrawals w in relation to the irrigation demand di 4 sgmon 100 wmon dimon 100 the impacts of irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios on the inflows into the ind are analysed by considering changes in average annual discharge and high and low flows compared to natural flows at baro just downstream of the fomi dam and at ké macina just before the niger river enters the ind the natural flows were simulated by the swim model not considering irrigation and reservoir management high flows are represented by the q10 and low flows by the q90 indicator the q90 value represents the discharge value that is exceeded in 90 of the time and the q10 value is the discharge value that is exceeded in 10 of the time the indicators are calculated for each year and are averaged over the entire simulation period zwarts et al 2005 and observatoire 2018 found that the sum of water volumes v in km3 entering the ind from the niger and bani rivers in the period between 1st of june and 15th november correlates to water levels wl in cm at gauge akka in the ind eq 5 5 wl 0 044 v 2 8 7075 v 226 5 the maximal water levels in a year at akka in turn allow an estimation of the maximal inundated area of the ind aind in km2 see eq 6 by applying eqs 5 and 6 the simulated maximal inundated area achieves an r2 value of 0 85 see also fig s6 in the supplement 6 aind 2040 148 exp 0 0040674 wl the dry or low flow season refers to the months from december to may and the wet or high flow season to the months between june and november the term period is used in the context of a period of years like the 1980s to indicate a dry period for instance 3 results 3 1 fomi operation scenarios in this section the two scenarios to operate the planned fomi dam are analysed considering reservoir release hydropower production water levels in the reservoir and water losses from the storage under the hpp scenario reservoir operation changes the natural flow regime at baro considerably where average dry season discharge increases by 316 or 102 m3 s on average where the range is between 280 in january and 1215 in april the average wet season discharge decreases by 46 or 185 m3 s and the highest reduction occurs in september with 67 or 440 m3 s fig 4 a the impact of the env scenario on the natural flow regime is much lower where the average dry season discharge experiences a reduction of 35 or 11 m3 s where the values are between 33 or 3 7 m3 s in april and 52 or 50 m3 s in december average wet season discharge decreases by 12 or 47 m3 s where the lowest impact is in august with only 0 4 m3 s the highest increase in september with 5 or 32 m3 s and the maximal impact in november is a decrease of 39 or 120 m3 s fig 4a from an economic perspective reliable hydropower production with a high firm yield is probably the most important feature of the fomi dam such a scenario would also be optimal from an irrigation perspective in odn because it supports dry season cropping by increasing the discharge in the low flow season under the hpp scenario the fomi dam can generate 28 mw on average and the firm yield with an exceedance probability of 90 ep90 corresponds to 16 mw and the ep95 value is 13 mw the firm yields have been calculated based on the daily production time series the average production under the env scenario is 18 4 mw and the firm yield ep90 is only 1 mw the lower average production in the env scenario may not be a major issue but the fact that either no or only very little electricity could be produced between january and june is a clear limitation fig 4b the reason for the low production in the dry season in the env scenario is that the water level in the daily time series frequently drops below the head of the dead storage at 370 m a s l where electricity generation becomes impossible fig 4c it should be noted that the firm yield of 35 mw which represents 80 of the average production of 43 mw as assumed by coyne and bellier 2009 are not achieved in both scenarios the reason is that the estimation of coyne and bellier 2009 were based on a larger fomi dam with a dam height of 390 m a s l and a storage capacity of 6 1 bm3 instead of 388 m a s l and 5 3 bm3 as assumed in the study at hand compared to the hpp scenario the losses via evaporation and seepage are about 20 lower in the env scenario fig 4d in total the long term average discharge released in the env scenario is 6 higher than in the hpp scenario 3 2 feasibility of irrigation management in office du niger 3 2 1 the role of the sélingué dam in this section it is demonstrated how the sélingué dam contributes to the realisation of dry season irrigation referring to the year 2005 in the area operated by odn fig 5 shows simulated withdrawals supplied to the odn irrigation scheme as percentage of the demand white patches represent months without deficits and coloured areas indicate supply gaps in the scenario without any dam fig 5a current irrigation practices would suffer deficits based on the natural availability of the niger river in the low flow season in most of the years except in extraordinary wet years comparable to conditions at the end of the 1960s averaged over the entire period 83 of the demand would be supplied leaving a gap of 17 looking at the low and high flow seasons separately reveals that the deficits are negligible from june to november but are with 33 5 considerable in the low flow season see table 2 particularly between february and may the gap between demand and supply would amount to 80 in many years making current agricultural practices in the dry season impossible in fig 5b the sélingué dam is operational during the entire simulation period due to increased discharge in the dry season the deficits are reduced to a minimum and occur only in extremely dry years the dam reduces the average supply gap from 17 to 1 3 2 2 the effects of an additional fomi dam if the fomi dam would be operational in addition to the sélingué dam and assuming the same simulation settings as depicted in the previous section there would be no visible change for dry season irrigation supply if the fomi dam is operated to preserve a natural flow regime downstream env scenario this is due to the fact that discharge in the low flow season is not substantially affected by the env reservoir management as is shown in fig 4a hence a corresponding figure showing irrigation deficits would be very similar to fig 5b where only the sélingué dam is operational therefore the env scenario simulations are omitted in the analysis of irrigation feasibility in case the fomi dam is operated to prioritise hydropower production hpp scenario discharge in the low flow season would be much higher than in the env scenario fig 4a the supply gaps in the odn irrigation scheme would be nullified even in extraordinary dry years while respecting minimal flows of 50 m3 s released at markala a corresponding figure for recent irrigation practices like fig 5b would show no coloured patches at all 3 3 feasibility of envisaged irrigation scenarios in office du niger this section analyses the feasibility of the development plans to increase the irrigated area considering two reservoir scenarios in one scenario it is assumed that only the sélingué dam is operational left column in fig 6 and in the other scenario the fomi dam hpp scenario is operational in addition to the sélingué dam right column in fig 6 table 2 shows average supply gaps for dry season and wet season irrigation in dry periods comparable to conditions prevailing in the late 1970s and 1980s only 40 of the water demand could be supplied in february and march in the 2025 irrigation scenario fig 6a the fomi dam would almost eradicate those gaps see fig 6b only in extraordinary dry years irrigation deficits of about 20 can be expected in february while the supply gaps averaged over the entire simulation period are 1 irrigation practices would be compromised in the 2035 irrigation scenario between january and april if only the sélingué dam is operational fig 6c only in wet periods comparable to some years in the 1960s the demand may be fully met in the dry season in very dry periods comparable to the 1980s only 20 of the irrigation demand would be supplied if the fomi dam hpp scenario is operational in addition dry season irrigation would be feasible in wet and average years with an average supply gap of 5 over the entire period in the 2045 irrigation scenario average deficits in the low flow season were simulated to be 36 5 and in almost half of the years only 20 of the demand would be supplied if only the sélingué dam is operational fig 6e noticeable is also that in the wet 1960s an average supply gap of about 40 would occur between january and march even with an additional fomi dam the increased dry season discharge would not satisfy the high irrigation demands in most of the years fig 6f however the fomi dam would reduce the supply gap averaged over the entire simulation period from 19 sélingué only to 7 irrigation demands in the high flow season could theoretically be satisfied in all scenarios 3 4 impacts of management scenarios on inflows into the inner niger delta 3 4 1 niger river gauge ké macina fig 7 shows the individual impact of single management components irrigation only sélingué only and fomi hpp only on discharge at ké macina figs 8 and 9 illustrate their combined impacts note that the changes in figs 7 and 8 are expressed in relative terms and the values are therefore higher in the low flow season although absolute changes would be smaller than in the high flow season fig 9 shows absolute changes all scenarios show that reservoir operations reduce annual inflows and peak discharge into the ind and alter the natural flow regime depending on the water demand of the irrigation scenario average annual discharge at ké macina is reduced substantially on a long term annual average the irrigation withdrawals in odn in 2005 reduces the discharge at ké macina by 7 fig 7a the highest relative changes are simulated between january and june where discharge is reduced by at least 50 in most of the years in the high flow season discharge is reduced by 5 10 on average where in very dry years the irrigation demand can correspond to about 20 both dams show a similar impact by decreasing discharge in the high flow season up to 10 and increasing discharge in the low flow season on average by 10 and more than 200 as maximum values figs 7b and c only in the low flow season the larger storage capacity of fomi is visible by releasing larger volumes than the sélingué dam and therefore increasing low flows to a greater extent due to evaporative and seepage losses from the reservoirs average annual discharge at ké macina decreases by 3 sélingué and 4 fomi table s7 shows the simulated water balance variables of the reservoirs assuming irrigation withdrawals corresponding to the year 2005 the managed discharge is higher than natural flows in the low flow season between february and june and lower in the rest of the year fig 8a and e both dams compensate the current irrigation withdrawals which is not the case in the 2025 irrigation scenario with only the sélingué dam operating fig 8b in the 2035 and 2045 irrigation scenarios there is not a single month where discharge is higher than under natural flow conditions figs 8c and d the scenarios including the fomi dam show basically a similar behaviour except there is always a short period around may where the discharge is relatively higher compared to natural flows fig 8g and h as is shown in fig 9a land and water management has a large impact on peak discharge in september under current management practices irrigation scenario 2005 and sélingué only the average discharge at ké macina in september is reduced by 540 m3 s which corresponds to a reduction of 14 an additional fomi dam hpp would reduce september discharge by another 390 m3 s leading to a total reduction of 24 the latter is comparable to a situation where irrigation demands correspond to the 2045 irrigation scenario with the sélingué dam in operation fig 9b with an additional fomi dam hpp the september discharge would be reduced by 1300 m3 s or by 34 on average if one subtracts the 1300 m3 s from average september discharge the flood peaks would be reduced to a level of the second driest year in the period 1961 2000 compared to simulated natural flows the current water management irrigation scenario 2005 and sélingué dam reduces the long term annual average discharge at ké macina by 10 an additional fomi dam would lead to a total reduction of 14 table s6 which also shows the impacts on high flow q10 and low flow q90 indicators 3 4 2 bani river downstream djenné the long term average annual discharge of the bani river 300 m3 s contributes approximately 21 to the total inflows into the ind compared to the sélingué and fomi dams in the niger river the storage capacities of the talo and djenné dams are with 0 1 bm3 and 0 36 bm3 relatively small their simulated evaporative and seepage losses are also rather small and amount to 1 8 talo and 5 2 djenné of their total inflows table s7 the talo dam is not far upstream of the djenné dam and since both dams are either switched on or off in the simulations the talo dam is slightly impacting the results of the djenné dam the relative total losses of 5 2 of the djenné dam represent therefore the combined losses of both dams land and water management impacts in the bani river basin may although reducing peak discharge play a subordinate role regarding the ind inflows in contrast to the odn irrigation scheme where irrigated agriculture is practised throughout the year irrigation schemes at the talo and djenné dams are only supplied from the reservoirs in the high flow season between august and november however this period is relevant for the flooding in the ind since peak flows determine the size of the inundated area the irrigation demand estimated for 2025 in the talo and djenné irrigation schemes would account for a reduction of 13 of the bani river discharge on the long term annual average where the low flows are not impacted at all high flows q10 would be reduced by about 15 the combined impact of irrigation withdrawals in 2025 and the losses from the talo and djenné dams would reduce the long term average annual inflows from the bani river into the ind by 18 reducing the total inflows into the ind by another 4 the major impact by a decreased discharge from the bani river occurs in the high flow season between september and november where a reduction of 23 is simulated 3 5 trade offs and win win fig 10 summarises the win win situation between hydropower production of the two fomi operation scenarios including the sélingué dam and the irrigation scenarios in odn while considering the trade offs with the inundated area in the ind as was discussed in section 3 2 about 99 of the irrigation demands referring to the year 2005 are supplied with only the sélingué dam operational an additional fomi dam operated to preserve the natural flows env scenario would not change this situation but the supply gaps are nullified with a fomi dam operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario as is shown in fig 10a apart from additional hydropower production there is therefore no real win win with irrigation supply a clear win win situation can be observed in the future irrigation scenarios fig 10b d and the fomi hpp scenario in the 2045 irrigation scenario the average annual irrigation supply increases from about 80 in the env scenario to 93 in the hpp scenario while the average hydropower production is with 240 gw h a 151 357 gw h a also much higher and more reliable than in the env scenario with an average production of 157 gw h a 113 218 gw h a this win win situation would be even more pronounced if hydropower production would be plotted against dry season irrigation supply instead of average annual supply the corresponding irrigation supply gap values are shown in table 2 even though the win win between irrigation supply and hydropower production in the hpp scenario is obvious and would be a clear benefit in the context of the unbb the impact on downstream ecosystem services and water users has to be considered according to the simulations under natural flow conditions the ind s average maximal inundated area in the period 1961 2000 would be about 15 200 km2 both irrigation withdrawals referring to the year 2005 and reservoir storage by the sélingué dam have decreased the average maximal inundated area by about 7 14 144 km2 an additional fomi dam hpp scenario would shrink the inundated area by another 5 to a total reduction of 12 13 434 km2 the irrigation scenarios would contribute to a total reduction of 16 in 2025 18 in 2035 and 21 in 2045 see table 3 the level of reduction of the maximal inundated area per year is qualitatively indicated by the circle sizes in fig 10 where the larger the circles the higher the reduction and therefore the higher the trade off between management scenario and inundated area in the ind the circles in the hpp scenario are generally larger than in the env scenario denoting a larger impact on the inundated area and thus on ecosystem services provided by the ind the impacts in dry years are relatively higher than in wet years it is important to mention that the ind s ecosystem integrity does not only rely on discharge peaks which are important for the maximal flood extent it also depends on the general dynamics of the flow regime like the timing of the discharge peak as well as on a distinctive low flow season 4 discussion and conclusions countries in the unbb rank very low on the worldwide scale in terms of the human development index undp 2016 and food security gfsi 2017 while the population is projected to double by mid century un desa 2017 hence socio economic development is crucial and requires the utilisation of natural resources the management of natural resources aiming at sustainable intensification in the unbb needs to consider various aspects related to transboundary as well as upstream downstream issues or the cross sectoral trade offs along the climate water food energy nexus therefore trade offs between developments in the unbb and food production and ecosystem service based livelihoods in the ind deserve special attention ecosystem integrity of the ind relies on the seasonal flood pulse with certain thresholds for discharge in the dry season and flood peaks and flood duration in the wet season both are jeopardised by current and planned upstream land and water management activities as well as by the drying trend in the sahel observed since the late 1960s 4 1 uncertainties dai et al 2004 state that the decreased rainfall in the last three decades of the 20th century represents the largest recent observed climate change of any region according to biasutti 2013 cmip5 gcms do not reproduce the amplitude of observed oscillations at multidecadal timescales and rainfall projections for the sahel are less robust than the 20th century hindcast thus rainfall change signals projected by global and regional climate models in the sahel are highly uncertain which is underlined by the figs s2 s3 and s4 in the supplement where held et al 2005 states that a dramatic 21st century drying trend should be considered seriously as a possible future scenario schewe and levermann 2017 argue that there is a possibility of an abrupt intensification of rainfall under future climate change due to the above mentioned uncertainties and the need for accurate precipitation input the irrigation and reservoir operation scenario simulations were based on 40 years of historical weather data from the years 1961 to 2000 this period captures the recent rainfall variability quite well with periods above 1960s and below 1980s the 20th century average rainfall the last occurrence of an extremely wet decade was in the 1950s about 70 years ago this period has not been considered in this study because an important basis of the gridded climate dataset weedon et al 2011 is the era40 reanalysis product that starts in september 1957 only uppala et al 2005 a limitation of not applying climate change scenarios is that increasing air temperature and its impact on water demand for irrigation and water availability due to higher evapotranspiration rates from land and water surfaces is neglected we are aware that this would put additional pressure on e g crop productivity human health or the feasibility of irrigation expansion a simple analysis revealed that simulated discharge at ké macina would decrease by 1 5 and 2 8 if 1 c or 2 c are added to the daily temperature time series respectively this gives an indication how changes in temperature only may influence actual evapotranspiration the assessment of the feasibility of plans to expand irrigated agriculture in the unbb and its impacts on the downstream flow regime is based on globally available data such as daily climate data from a gridded dataset observed discharges land use and soil maps and on published data to parameterise irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios e g reports development plans environmental impact assessments we found contradicting information on water use efficiency crop rotations reservoir properties etc therefore management data used in this study have to be treated with caution as the data vary from one reference to another such inconsistencies are a source of uncertainties in application oriented impact assessment studies other unknown variables are related to the management itself as it is not clear how the dams will be managed how fast the irrigated area will increase or if the minimal flow threshold at markala will be respected or not employing scenarios is therefore a useful approach to capture the range of possible future pathways based on uncertain input data 4 2 hydropower production a small fomi dam with a storage capacity of 2 4 bm3 operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime env scenario could produce 40 5 mw hydro electric power on average between july and november but either no or only very little in the dry season the average production corresponds to 18 4 mw 157 gw h a to guarantee electricity production throughout the year such an electricity system could be complemented by hybrid solar and or wind power generators contributing to a more sustainable and stable energy mix a large fomi dam with a storage capacity of 5 3 bm3 operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario could produce 28 mw 240 gw h a on an annual average with a firm yield of 16 mw with an exceedance probability of 90 4 3 feasibility of agricultural development and impacts on inflows into the inner niger delta the high seasonality of the niger and bani river discharges requires separate assessments of the feasibility of development plans for the dry december to may and the wet season june to november assuming hydro climatic conditions comparable to the period 1961 2000 the niger river provides naturally enough water to theoretically supply the demands in the wet season even in the 2045 irrigation scenario with an area of 460 000 ha hertzog et al 2012 assume for instance that the niger river provides theoretically enough water to irrigate one million hectares however water withdrawals for dry season cropping are already at a limit today particularly in dry years it should be noted that current dry season water demands in odn would not sufficiently be supplied without the existing sélingué dam which increases the discharge between january and june under dry hydro climatic conditions comparable to the late 1970s or 1980s supply gaps would amount up to 80 without this dam hence a further extension in the dry season can only be achieved by either reducing the water demands per area or by increasing river discharge a provision of higher dry season discharge can only be realised by the construction of a new dam in the niger headwaters which is already planned since decades and was prioritised as a key infrastructure in the shared vision and sustainable development plan for the niger nba 2007 according to hertzog et al 2012 and vandersypen et al 2006 the gravity based irrigation system over dimensioned tertiary canals minimal efforts in managing the odn irrigation scheme and the abundance of water in the wet season lead to low efficiencies in water use vandersypen et al 2006 state that the operation of the irrigation network is inadequate and water use is unsustainable because guidelines and procedures for operation are not followed in practice this leads to avoidable losses due to excess water delivery and a permanent filling of secondary canals where crop demands in odn are estimated to be about 1000 mm a the supply is in the order of 2000 2500 mm a hertzog et al 2012 in theory under an optimised water management the same amount of water would either reduce the estimated supply gaps in the irrigation scenarios or may contribute to an extension of the irrigated area in practice this would involve costly investments e g for advanced irrigation techniques maintenance of irrigation canals or water pumping to achieve equality in water supply over the whole irrigation scheme a realistic quantification of the impact of improved water use efficiency is difficult and requires local knowledge and detailed data on the irrigation canal network water control practices crop calendar etc and was therefore beyond the scope of this study the expected impacts of a new dam depend primarily on its storage volume and operation rules for impoundment and release it was found that a smaller dam with a storage capacity of 2 4 bm3 operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime env scenario does not support an extension of dry season cropping in odn because dry season discharges would be comparable to those today harvest losses could be substantial in dry years already in the 2025 irrigation scenario where supply gaps of up to 60 are simulated in february and march such a dam would result in rather low trade offs with downstream ecosystems while supporting irrigation in adjacent areas the impact on the discharge peak arriving at ké macina before entering the ind in september would be negligible provided that withdrawals for irrigation are on a today level the reduction of the average maximal inundated area in the ind caused by an additional dam env scenario and current withdrawals is only 1 compared to the current state an additional large dam with a storage capacity of 5 3 bm3 operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario is expected to have a substantial impact on the flow regime such a dam would have the potential to increase the low flows in the dry season from about 20 m3 s to about 100 200 m3 s at its outlet thereby enabling the irrigation extension plans in odn envisaged for the years 2025 and 2035 however in 2035 supply gaps between 20 40 can be expected in dry years which would certainly lead to considerable yield losses an extension of the odn irrigation scheme as is planned for the year 2045 would be compromised in many years during the dry season where the average supply gap over the entire simulation period between january and march is 30 and can be as large as 60 in extraordinary dry years where current irrigation and reservoir operations reduce the average annual niger discharge by about 10 the 2045 irrigation scenario in combination with the large dam may reduce the average discharge by a third compared to natural flows current management practices reduce the peak discharge essential for inundation processes in the ind already by 500 m3 s in september in the 2045 irrigation scenario the average discharge peak may decrease by about 1300 m3 s thereby reducing september discharge of an average year to the level of the second driest year observed in the period 1961 2000 it is not surprising but noticeable that the impact of irrigation and reservoir operations are relatively lower in wet decades like in the 1960s than in dry decades like in the 1980s likewise is the decrease of flood dynamics and its associated impacts much higher in dry years in the 2045 irrigation scenario for instance the water demand would correspond to 50 of discharge in the year with lowest discharge and to 19 in the year with highest discharge in the entire simulation period in addition to the reduction of niger river discharge the recently built talo and djenné dams and adjacent irrigation schemes in the bani river basin are further shortening the water resources in the ind by another 4 on average the reduction between september and november amounts to about 23 compared to natural flows adding this share to the reduction of peak inflows from the niger river in 2045 34 in september a total reduction of the discharge peak of about 40 can be expected a strongly altered hydrological regime would have large negative impacts on the inundated area in the ind not only leading to severe shrinking of the wetland ecosystem but also jeopardising its integrity discharge reductions like in the 2045 irrigation scenario would compromise the ind s potential to yield fish fodder and rice and hence reduce livelihood options for many inhabitants the year 1984 the driest year in the simulation period is often used to illustrate the destructive forces of such conditions which led to mass animal deaths and famines situations comparable to the year 1984 with an inundated area below 9000 km2 occurred once between 1961 and 2000 but may occur twice under the 2035 and 2045 irrigation and hpp scenarios the threshold of 10 000 km2 was undercut twice in the simulation of the past but in seven years in the 2045 irrigation and hpp scenario the large dam hpp scenario under current irrigation management would reduce the average maximal inundated area by 5 compared to current conditions together with irrigation withdrawals in 2045 the inundated area would experience an average reduction of 14 compared to the current situation which corresponds to a total reduction of 21 compared to natural conditions coyne and bellier 2009 assume that the large dam would reduce the area by 10 brl and dhi 2007 estimate a reduction of 14 and aecom 2017 a reduction between 8 12 a direct comparison among these studies is extremely difficult because different time periods modelling approaches and assumptions on dam characteristics have been used which are not always transparently reported however compared to the other studies it seems that our estimations underestimate the impact of the fomi dam on the average maximal inundated area minimising or even losing the ind s ecosystem services would create tremendous costs not only from a monetary perspective which have to be taken into consideration in the development of management plans in the unbb not investing in improved water use efficiency today but relying on increased dry season discharge from a new dam would only postpone several issues that have to be tackled in the long term anyway such as meeting sustainable development goals meeting the food production for the growing population in future etc studies investigating trade offs and synergies from an economic and or ecosystem service perspective considering the different

8465,study region the upper niger and bani river basins in west africa study focus the growing demand for food water and energy led mali and guinea to develop ambitious hydropower and irrigation plans including the construction of a new dam and the extension of irrigation schemes these two developments will take place upstream of sensible ecosystem hotspots while the feasibility of development plans in terms of water availability and sustainability is questionable where agricultural development in past decades focused mainly on intensifying dry season crops cultivation future plans include extension in both the dry and wet seasons new hydrological insights for the region today s irrigation demand corresponds to 7 of the average annual niger discharge and could account to one third in 2045 an extension of irrigated agriculture is possible in the wet season while extending dry season cropping would be largely compromised with the one major existing sélingué dam an additional large fomi or moussako dam would not completely satisfy dry season irrigation demands in the 2045 scenario but would reduce the estimated supply gap from 36 to 14 however discharge peaks may decrease by 40 reducing the inundated area in the inner niger delta by 21 while average annual discharge decreases by 30 sustainable development should therefore consider investments in water saving irrigation and management practices to enhance the feasibility of the envisaged irrigation plans instead of completely relying on the construction of a flow regime altering dam keywords reservoir and irrigation management hydrological modelling fomi moussako dam upper niger and bani river basin inner niger delta 1 introduction the fast growing population and socio economic development in the case study area of the upper niger and bani river basins unbb in west africa add more and more pressure on natural resources ogilvie et al 2010 the unbb is no exception but rather represents various cases of water stressed river systems in semi arid and arid regions worldwide sudan for instance uses the blue and white nile rivers to irrigate one of the largest irrigation schemes worldwide with almost 900 000 ha abdelhadi et al 2000 in pakistan about 73 of the average indus flows are abstracted to a vast irrigation scheme archer et al 2010 in the são francisco river basin in brazil the agricultural water demand in the year 2010 corresponded to 77 of the total water demand koch et al 2018c worldwide the agricultural sector is by far the largest water user consuming on average about 70 of freshwater resources fao 2011 in the african context irrigation does not play a significant role where only 6 of the total cultivated area is irrigated which is lower than in other world regions like 14 in latin america and 37 in asia you et al 2010 possible reasons for this low share of irrigated agriculture are the undeveloped state of institutions for irrigation and the prevalence of subsistence farming you et al 2010 however in the case study area of the unbb irrigation plays a role to meet the growing food demands plans to utilise the available land and water resources that have been developed brl ingéniérie brl 2007a meme 2007 rh et al 2007 are continuously revised to account for development pathways not considered in previous plans brl and gef 2012 coyne and bellier 2009 but the current expansion plans have not adequately included possible implications in terms of water availability distribution and allocation hertzog et al 2012 the office du niger odn a semi autonomous government agency in mali is one of the key actors with regard to food production responsible for the administration and development of a number of irrigation schemes hertzog et al 2012 that are by far the largest in the unbb the major odn irrigation scheme is located just upstream of the inner niger delta ind and is supplied with water from the niger river via a system of canals diverting water from the markala dam the markala dam is operational since 1947 and was actually supposed to supply an irrigated area of 960 000 ha zwarts et al 2005 however in the year 2005 only 113 303 ha were cultivated brl and betico 2016 according to recent development plans it is envisaged to expand the area to 460 000 ha until the year 2045 and to intensify agricultural production particularly in the dry season brl and betico 2016 up to now it is not clear how realistic this endeavour is with regard to availability of water resources and sustainable development as a consequence of the unimodal rainfall regime in the unbb the discharge regime of the niger and bani rivers entering the ind is characterised by a low flow season between december and may and a high flow season from june to november the natural water availability in the dry season puts a clear limit to agricultural water supply already today an extension of irrigation schemes would therefore either require improved water use efficiency or the construction of new dams to satisfy the required water demands dams and reservoirs have always played and will play an important role for the implementation of agricultural development and hydropower production in the unbb generally reservoir operations alter the natural flow regime by increasing flows during the dry season and reducing the flows and flood peaks during the rainy wet season liersch et al 2013 beside numerous small dams a total of five medium to large dams are currently in operation in the unbb the sotuba dam was the first dam in the upper niger river it was built in 1929 and produces a small amount of hydroelectric power and continuously diverts 8 m3 s to irrigation schemes but its impact on the water balance and the niger flow regime is negligible zwarts et al 2005 35 years after the construction of the markala dam in 1947 the sélingué dam was built in 1982 to impound the sankarani river a tributary to the niger river in mali with a storage volume of 2 35 billion m3 bm3 it serves the purpose to generate hydroelectric power and to supply agricultural areas nearby with water for irrigation kuper et al 2002 in the bani river basin two comparably small dams were recently built the talo dam operational since 2007 0 18 bm3 and the djenné dam 2014 under rehabilitation 0 36 bm3 zwarts 2010 zwarts et al 2005 their main purpose is to supply adjacent irrigation schemes more reliably with required water volumes the effect of the existing dams and irrigation schemes in the unbb is already observable downstream at the inlets to the ind marie et al 2007 water volumes are reduced by withdrawals for irrigation and evaporation and seepage from reservoirs a noticeable share of 55 70 of water withdrawals can be attributed to low water use efficiency including high transmission losses in the irrigation canal network hertzog et al 2012 schüttrumpf and bökkers 2008 keita et al 2002 however the combined effect of existing dam infrastructure is relatively small compared to the impacts on downstream discharge expected to be caused by the planned dam in the niandan river in the niger headwaters in guinea since decades it is planned to construct the so called fomi dam with an envisaged storage volume of 5 3 bm3 this is more than twice as large as the currently existing storages in the unbb together and the dam is expected to amplify the already observed impacts on the flow regime recently it is considered to build the dam approximately 20 km upstream where it would be called moussako dam with comparable storage properties and therefore comparable expected impacts tractebel 2017a b for convenience the dam is henceforth called fomi dam in this study although it might be constructed at the moussako location with its large storage capacity the fomi dam has the potential to substantially alter the flow regime by further increasing the flows during the dry season and decreasing the high flows and flood peaks during the reservoir refilling period indirectly the fomi dam may also lead to long term reduced discharge entering the ind by enabling or supporting higher water withdrawals for agricultural consumption in the odn irrigation scheme in the dry season the increasing demand for food and energy in mali and guinea may justify such plans but depending on the level of implementation they are expected to affect downstream ecosystems and associated livelihoods of local communities the ind is an important seasonally inundated wetland providing natural resources and livelihoods for more than 10 of mali s population inhabiting the delta about 40 of malian cattle depend on the fodder production and grazing grounds in the ind while 80 of malian fish production comes from the ind rh et al 2010 livestock and fisheries contribute respectively with 10 and 4 to malian gdp rh et al 2010 dolo et al 2005 and form an essential component of malian food consumption not only quantitatively but also qualitatively as it increases nutritional diversity and gastronomic variety the upper niger and bani rivers constitute the inflows into the ind altering their flow regime towards generally lower average annual inflows and a changed annual cycle is expected to challenge the integrity of the ind ecosystem this ecosystem has evolved in and has adapted to the natural variability of the hydro climatic conditions prevalent in the last centuries including extremely wet e g 1950s and 1960s and dry e g 1970s and 1980s decades in very wet periods like in the 1950s the inundated area can expand up to 36 000 km2 in the flooding season zwarts et al 2005 over the period 2000 to 2011 ogilvie et al 2015 estimate the variation of the annual maximum flooded surface area between 10 300 km2 and 20 000 km2 receding progressively to a magnitude of 3800 km2 on average in the dry season in extraordinary dry years the inundated area can be much smaller the seasonal flood dynamics are vitally important for its integrity the inundated area directly relates to ecosystem services that are provided by the ind for example fish rejuvenation is dependent on the availability of various habitats suitable for spawning and nursing of the young fish that will only form under particular flood dynamics similarly the large amounts of submerged grasses like bourgou used as cattle fodder will only develop when favorable habitats exist during germination and early plant growth stages as a rule of thumb one can say that the larger the inundated area the higher the productivity of the ind zwarts et al 2005 the altered flow regime and the general reduction of inflows and flood peaks entering the ind caused by intensified activities in the unbb upstream the ind like agricultural and hydropower production constitute clear trade offs with the ind s ecosystem integrity and the services it provides the first objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the plans to expand irrigated agriculture in the scheme operated by odn considering different reservoir operation scenarios the gap between the estimated irrigation water demand and supply in the years 2025 2035 and 2045 determines the feasibility three reservoir settings are analysed where the first scenario represents the current state with only the sélingué dam operational in the sankarani river in the other two scenarios it is assumed that the fomi dam is operational in the niandan river in the niger headwaters and either operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime or to optimise hydropower production the second objective is to assess the combined impacts of increasing agricultural water demands and reservoir operations on the discharges of the niger and bani rivers and the average maximal inundated area in the ind however the impacts on the ind s ecosystem services are not covered in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the upper niger and bani river basins unbb in west africa are defined in this study as the catchments upstream the ind at the gauges ké macina niger and sofara bani see fig 1 the unbb covers an area of 273 700 km2 the following countries have a decreasing share in the basin area mali guinea ivory coast and burkina faso according to ciesin 2016 the basin was populated by 9 8 million people in 2005 and increased by 42 to 13 9 million inhabitants in 2015 and thus belongs to a region with one of the fastest growing population worldwide corresponding to an annual growth rate of about 4 following the köppen geiger climate classification the unbb is located in a climatic transition zone fig 1 about three quarters of the area are characterised by the tropical savanna climate and the northern quarter is dominated by a warm semi arid climate in the very north the basin is influenced by the warm desert climate and in the south by the monsoon climate 2 2 data following data sources were used to set up the hydrological model described in section 2 3 the srtm digital elevation model in 90 m horizontal resolution jarvis et al 2008 was used to delineate the unbb and its sub basins soil properties were derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao 2009 and information on land use cover was taken from glc2000 bartholomé and belward 2005 the source of daily weather variables in the period 1960 2000 such as daily precipitation minimum mean and maximum temperatures are the gridded watch forcing data wfd with a spatial resolution of 0 5 weedon et al 2011 wfd are based on ecmwf re analysis era40 uppala et al 2005 assimilating surface observations it was found that wfd radiation data are consistently lower than observations in the unbb and radiation was therefore calculated based on minimum and maximum temperature and the respective sub basin s latitude according to hargreaves et al 1985 simulated radiation data were adjusted to fit values estimated by solargis info discharge data of 10 gauges provided by the global runoff data centre grdc were used to calibrate and validate discharge simulations data and information from various reports brl and betico 2016 brl ingéniérie brl 2007a brl ingéniérie brl 2007b brl and dhi 2007 zwarts et al 2005 were used to parameterise the reservoirs and to develop land and water management scenarios the rating curves relating reservoir water level volume and area for the fomi dam were derived from the srtm dem using the grass gis module r lake which computes the water volume and flooded surface area at given water levels values in between the given water levels are linearly interpolated corresponding values and other relevant reservoir data are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplement 2 2 1 climate projection uncertainties hulme 2001 states that there is no such thing as normal rainfall in the sahel instead rainfall fluctuates erratically and the normal is rather the variability of rainfall in space as well as from year to year and from decade to decade hulme 2001 an adequate spatio temporal representation of weather variables in such climatic transition zones governed by the west african monsoon system is challenging for climate models turner et al 2011 cook and vizy 2006 moreover rainfall projections of global circulation models gcms diverge in future scenarios where some models project a wetter and others a drier future in the unbb monerie et al 2017 rowell et al 2015 aich et al 2014 biasutti 2013 giannini 2010 cook and vizy 2006 see also figs s1 and s2 in the supplement according to giannini 2010 there is no way to discern whether the future climate in the sahel will be different from that experienced over the 20th century according to rowell et al 2015 the projection uncertainties of climate models in the sahel are not reduced if only the best performing models are selected vetter et al 2015 and hattermann et al 2018 found that gcms are the main source of uncertainty in climate impact assessment in the unbb while hydrological models contribute only a small part to uncertainty vetter et al 2017 confirms this finding for the entire niger basin 2 2 2 dealing with climate projection uncertainties as discussed in liersch et al 2018 the value of climate projection data for quantitative application oriented studies where a certain degree of accuracy in input data is required is still rather limited even bias corrected climate simulations do not always provide input that is of adequate quality for regional impact studies liersch et al 2018 therefore we use a historical gridded weather dataset weedon et al 2011 representing the variable hydro climatic conditions observed in the period 1960 2000 to investigate the feasibility of irrigation extension in odn and to assess the impacts of combined irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios on river discharges and the inundated area in the ind fig 2 shows that the years 1960 2000 represent a large range of natural rainfall variability and consist of a wet period the 1960s with rainfall anomalies above the 20th century average and an extremely dry period in the 1980s where all years are below the 20th century average it is also the period with the highest density of meteorological stations in the unbb schneider et al 2015 and therefore the uncertainties are expected to be the lowest decision makers may have experienced these extreme conditions themselves and will remember what consequences consecutive wet or dry years have had on e g high and low flows in the niger and bani rivers agricultural and fishery production or the extent of the inundated area in the ind climate simulations for the 21st century show that the cyclic behaviour with consecutive wet and dry years that was observed and is simulated by gcms in the past will continue in future independently if a gcm projects a dryer wetter or no trend in annual rainfall at all figs s3 and s4 in the supplement communicating the uncertainties related to climate change projections and their consequences for future water availability is difficult and does usually not satisfy stakeholders and decision makers because they do not know or understand how to prepare or adapt to these diverging trends and may thus be reluctant to trust in the presented results in addition to this following arguments justify the application of historical meteorological data in this study instead of applying climate scenarios are a water resources management studies require a certain degree of meteorological input data accuracy which is particular with regard to rainfall patterns and volumes in the unbb not provided by climate models and b the 40 years observational meteorological data show a high variability allowing the analysis of current and future water management activities under a range from extremely dry to wet hydro climatic conditions a deficiency with this approach is that the projected temperature increase of 1 5 1 7 c between 2030 2049 and 1986 2005 is neglected fig s2b which would result in higher potential evapotranspiration rates of approximately 2 reducing water availability 2 3 hydrological modelling the soil and water integrated model swim is an eco hydrological model developed by krysanova et al 2005 it operates at the daily time step and is a semi distributed and process based catchment model which is continuously developed and adapted to meet new or specific challenges and requirements krysanova et al 2015 swim was already applied to the upper and entire niger river basin in several studies aich et al 2016 aich et al 2015 aich et al 2014 liersch et al 2013 liersch et al 2012 the model was used in this study because it contains sophisticated features to account for various reservoir operation options and irrigation management which are required to address the research questions at hand in this study swim was calibrated and validated to observed discharges provided by the global runoff data centre grdc at 10 selected gauges in the unbb fig 1 available during the period 1960 2000 where the first year is omitted in the analysis in a first step a manual sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the model behaviour and to define reasonable parameter ranges based on these parameter ranges the sub catchments were finally calibrated using a multi objective evolutionary automatic algorithm the performance of the simulations of the annual cycle is exemplarily shown for the most important gauges used in this study baro sankarani and ké macina corresponding figures at the daily time step are presented in the supplement in fig s5 the model results show a very good fit for the gauge baro the closest downstream gauge from the location where the fomi dam may be built see fig 3 a and b a rather large volumetric error pbias is simulated in the calibration period at gauge sankarani before the sélingué dam was built see fig 3c however in the period where the sélingué dam was operational the results can be judged as very good in terms of volumetric error and seasonality r2 see fig 3d r2 values of 1 are achieved in both the calibration and validation periods at gauge ké macina downstream the markala dam where average discharge is underestimated by 8 4 in the calibration period and overestimated by 17 4 in the validation period see fig 3e and f following model performance in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse were achieved at the daily time step in the calibration and validation periods baro 0 77 and 0 77 sankarani 0 78 and 0 26 ké macina 0 93 and 0 86 however the results are reasonable enough at all 10 gauges to answer the questions addressed in this study 2 3 1 reservoir module a reservoir module developed by koch et al 2013 was implemented in swim to account for the effects of dam infrastructures in river basins that may depending on their capacities and operation rules substantially alter the natural flow regime and reduce downstream water availability by evaporation and seepage the actual reservoir area volume and water levels are changing on a daily time step depending on inflows reservoir release and losses due to evapotranspiration seepage and withdrawals actual evapotranspiration from the reservoir area etres is determined by the area weighted sums of the lake s open water surface evaporation etp and actual evapotranspiration eta from the land area i e the reservoir area not inundated at the respective day both etp and eta rates depend on the actual volume of the reservoir the daily seepage rate is computed as a user defined fraction of the actual total storage volume the module was already applied to investigate reservoir filling strategies and their downstream impacts which is especially relevant for dam projects in the planning phase liersch et al 2017 to analyse the impacts of various operation rules on downstream discharges koch et al 2018a liersch et al 2017 lobanova et al 2017 lobanova et al 2016 aich et al 2016 to account for storage effects of natural lakes liersch et al 2018 and to simulate hydropower production koch et al 2018b liersch et al 2017 lobanova et al 2016 koch et al 2013 2 3 2 water allocation module the water allocation module in swim allows the withdrawal of water volumes from river sections or reservoirs water demand data can be included at the daily monthly or average monthly time step abstracted volumes can either be allocated to water users such as irrigation schemes or cities outside the system river basin or to water users inside the system in this study the module was used to account for reported water uptakes in the past during the calibration and validation periods and to investigate scenarios of planned developments of several irrigation schemes in the unbb since the main irrigation scheme odn is located outside the unbb groundwater return flows are neglected here 2 4 scenarios the coupled irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios developed in this study consider different assumptions of reservoir settings and withdrawals for irrigation schemes at several locations in the unbb details are described in the following sections to analyse the reservoir operation impacts on irrigation water supply river discharge and inundated area under past hydro climatic conditions the scenario settings are constant over the entire simulation period even if dams were built during sélingué in 1982 or after talo 2007 djenné 2014 fomi planned the scenario period land use was also not considered to change over the scenario period 2 4 1 reservoir scenarios reservoir settings comprise the number of active reservoirs in each scenario as well as their operation rules following dams are considered in this study fomi niandan river guinea planned sélingué sankarani river mali talo bani river mali and djenné bani river mali the sotuba dam and the markala dam in mali along the niger river are not implemented as reservoirs in the model because their storage volume is very small these dams solely serve the purpose of diverting water to irrigation schemes however water withdrawals at the markala dam are considered by the water allocation module withdrawals at the sotuba dam account for only 0 2 of niger river discharge and were thus neglected in this study the sélingué dam and the fomi dam planned are both impounding tributaries of the niger river they are therefore relevant for the assessment of the feasibility of irrigation expansion plans in the odn irrigation scheme and for the investigation of inflows and inundated area in the ind the talo and djenné dams in the bani river basin are not relevant for the odn irrigation scheme but for the inflows and inundated area in the ind however due to their small storage capacities they play only a minor role in this study operation of the sélingué dam was parameterised in the model to represent realistic dam management in the period between 1982 and 2000 koch et al 2013 the planned fomi dam was parameterised to represent two different operation rules one rule was developed to assess the impacts of the fomi dam when operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario with a dam height of 388 m a s l the simulated operation is aimed at generating a firm yield of 35 mw which corresponds to about 80 of the potential mean production of 43 mw coyne and bellier 2009 these settings represent the state of the planning process in march 2017 fomi directorate 2017 where the total storage would have a volume of 5 279 billion cubic metres bm3 with a dead storage of 1 212 bm3 23 of total storage however a recent environmental impact study aecom 2017 suggests a lower dam height and consequently a smaller storage capacity 2 415 bm3 to be an alternative in the latter the active storage has due to the large dead storage an active capacity of only 1 203 bm3 50 of total storage this latter dam setting is represented by the fomi env scenario where released discharge largely preserves the natural flow regime downstream the dam in general the minimum discharge from the dam in the env scenario is based on the monthly q95 values derived from swim simulations in the period 1961 2000 the minimum discharge in the low flow season is set to 10 m3 s in the high flow season the capacity of the hydropower plant 421 m3 s is set as the maximum discharge in the env scenario the release from the reservoir does not change the natural flow regime noticeably during the dry season between january and june in the wet season however discharge is reduced by the reservoir management in the env scenario to a certain extent in both scenarios the dead storage head is assumed to be at an elevation of 370 m a s l water level surface area and storage volume relationships are shown in the tables s1 and s2 in the supplement the seepage rates in all implemented dams are assumed to be in the order of the rate in the sélingué dam where zwarts et al 2005 assumes losses of 0 83 bm3 a 2 4 2 irrigation scenarios monthly irrigation water demands dimon in m3 s employed in the irrigation scenarios in odn were simulated with the model used by the hydro agricultural improvement programme brl and betico 2016 the monthly water demand in odn is estimated based on monthly crop demand dcmon in millimetre per day corrected by a monthly irrigation network efficiency coefficient coefmon and multiplied with the irrigated area a in hectare for a given target year eq 1a the irrigated area for eight different crops and the crop calendar is shown in tables s4 and s5 in the supplement the monthly irrigation demand for the other irrigation schemes was estimated based on the annual irrigation scheme water demand dsyr corrected by a monthly coefficient coefmon see eq 1b as was estimated for the action plan for the sustainable development of the niger basin of the niger river basin authority brl ingéniérie brl 2007a changes in water use efficiency as expressed by coefmon were not taken into account in the scenarios vandersypen et al 2006 found for instance that the water use efficiency has not improved between 1995 and 2005 1a dimon odn scheme a dcmon coefmon 8640 1b dimon other schemes a dsyr coefmon 8640 the baseline for all sites refers to estimated irrigation demands in the year 2005 brl and betico 2016 brl ingéniérie brl 2007a based on these documents irrigation scenarios were derived for the year 2025 for all sites additionally water demands were estimated for the periods around 2035 and 2045 in the irrigation scheme operated by odn brl and betico 2016 corresponding data used in the simulation is shown in table 1 and monthly withdrawals are listed in table s3 in the supplement based on our simulations the long term average natural discharge at the markala dam was about 1140 m3 s in the period 1961 2000 the current irrigation demand 79 3 m3 s equivalent to 2000 mm a corresponds to 7 of long term average natural niger discharge and will according to the development plans increase to 14 in 2025 to 20 in 2035 and to 27 in 2045 table 1 remarkable is the range of irrigation demands in relation to annual discharges indicating a high variability of water availability in the 2045 irrigation scenario the irrigation water demand would correspond to 50 of discharge in the year with lowest discharges and to 19 in the year with highest discharge in the entire simulation period table 1 withdrawals for irrigation are considered in the model as water volumes diverted to irrigation schemes from reservoirs at the sites

released at the markala dam is 50 m3 s brl and dhi 2007 hence water uptake for irrigation can be restricted during the low flow season by that threshold however the sélingué and markala dams commission in mali aim to meet a minimum of only 40 m3 s in reality even this agreement is not always respected odn mentions that in 2015 2016 and 2017 the minimum of 40 m3 s was not met for 105 100 and 109 days respectively while the 50 m3 s threshold is applied in simulations to analyse the feasibility of irrigation expansion it is not applied in simulations used to analyse the impacts on ind inflows and the inundated area because of the non compliance issue 2 5 performance criteria and definitions to analyse the feasibility of the irrigation scenarios in the irrigation scheme operated by odn the simulated daily supply gaps sg in percent were aggregated to monthly deficits for each year see eq 4 the relative supply gap or deficit is the share of the actual monthly withdrawals w in relation to the irrigation demand di 4 sgmon 100 wmon dimon 100 the impacts of irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios on the inflows into the ind are analysed by considering changes in average annual discharge and high and low flows compared to natural flows at baro just downstream of the fomi dam and at ké macina just before the niger river enters the ind the natural flows were simulated by the swim model not considering irrigation and reservoir management high flows are represented by the q10 and low flows by the q90 indicator the q90 value represents the discharge value that is exceeded in 90 of the time and the q10 value is the discharge value that is exceeded in 10 of the time the indicators are calculated for each year and are averaged over the entire simulation period zwarts et al 2005 and observatoire 2018 found that the sum of water volumes v in km3 entering the ind from the niger and bani rivers in the period between 1st of june and 15th november correlates to water levels wl in cm at gauge akka in the ind eq 5 5 wl 0 044 v 2 8 7075 v 226 5 the maximal water levels in a year at akka in turn allow an estimation of the maximal inundated area of the ind aind in km2 see eq 6 by applying eqs 5 and 6 the simulated maximal inundated area achieves an r2 value of 0 85 see also fig s6 in the supplement 6 aind 2040 148 exp 0 0040674 wl the dry or low flow season refers to the months from december to may and the wet or high flow season to the months between june and november the term period is used in the context of a period of years like the 1980s to indicate a dry period for instance 3 results 3 1 fomi operation scenarios in this section the two scenarios to operate the planned fomi dam are analysed considering reservoir release hydropower production water levels in the reservoir and water losses from the storage under the hpp scenario reservoir operation changes the natural flow regime at baro considerably where average dry season discharge increases by 316 or 102 m3 s on average where the range is between 280 in january and 1215 in april the average wet season discharge decreases by 46 or 185 m3 s and the highest reduction occurs in september with 67 or 440 m3 s fig 4 a the impact of the env scenario on the natural flow regime is much lower where the average dry season discharge experiences a reduction of 35 or 11 m3 s where the values are between 33 or 3 7 m3 s in april and 52 or 50 m3 s in december average wet season discharge decreases by 12 or 47 m3 s where the lowest impact is in august with only 0 4 m3 s the highest increase in september with 5 or 32 m3 s and the maximal impact in november is a decrease of 39 or 120 m3 s fig 4a from an economic perspective reliable hydropower production with a high firm yield is probably the most important feature of the fomi dam such a scenario would also be optimal from an irrigation perspective in odn because it supports dry season cropping by increasing the discharge in the low flow season under the hpp scenario the fomi dam can generate 28 mw on average and the firm yield with an exceedance probability of 90 ep90 corresponds to 16 mw and the ep95 value is 13 mw the firm yields have been calculated based on the daily production time series the average production under the env scenario is 18 4 mw and the firm yield ep90 is only 1 mw the lower average production in the env scenario may not be a major issue but the fact that either no or only very little electricity could be produced between january and june is a clear limitation fig 4b the reason for the low production in the dry season in the env scenario is that the water level in the daily time series frequently drops below the head of the dead storage at 370 m a s l where electricity generation becomes impossible fig 4c it should be noted that the firm yield of 35 mw which represents 80 of the average production of 43 mw as assumed by coyne and bellier 2009 are not achieved in both scenarios the reason is that the estimation of coyne and bellier 2009 were based on a larger fomi dam with a dam height of 390 m a s l and a storage capacity of 6 1 bm3 instead of 388 m a s l and 5 3 bm3 as assumed in the study at hand compared to the hpp scenario the losses via evaporation and seepage are about 20 lower in the env scenario fig 4d in total the long term average discharge released in the env scenario is 6 higher than in the hpp scenario 3 2 feasibility of irrigation management in office du niger 3 2 1 the role of the sélingué dam in this section it is demonstrated how the sélingué dam contributes to the realisation of dry season irrigation referring to the year 2005 in the area operated by odn fig 5 shows simulated withdrawals supplied to the odn irrigation scheme as percentage of the demand white patches represent months without deficits and coloured areas indicate supply gaps in the scenario without any dam fig 5a current irrigation practices would suffer deficits based on the natural availability of the niger river in the low flow season in most of the years except in extraordinary wet years comparable to conditions at the end of the 1960s averaged over the entire period 83 of the demand would be supplied leaving a gap of 17 looking at the low and high flow seasons separately reveals that the deficits are negligible from june to november but are with 33 5 considerable in the low flow season see table 2 particularly between february and may the gap between demand and supply would amount to 80 in many years making current agricultural practices in the dry season impossible in fig 5b the sélingué dam is operational during the entire simulation period due to increased discharge in the dry season the deficits are reduced to a minimum and occur only in extremely dry years the dam reduces the average supply gap from 17 to 1 3 2 2 the effects of an additional fomi dam if the fomi dam would be operational in addition to the sélingué dam and assuming the same simulation settings as depicted in the previous section there would be no visible change for dry season irrigation supply if the fomi dam is operated to preserve a natural flow regime downstream env scenario this is due to the fact that discharge in the low flow season is not substantially affected by the env reservoir management as is shown in fig 4a hence a corresponding figure showing irrigation deficits would be very similar to fig 5b where only the sélingué dam is operational therefore the env scenario simulations are omitted in the analysis of irrigation feasibility in case the fomi dam is operated to prioritise hydropower production hpp scenario discharge in the low flow season would be much higher than in the env scenario fig 4a the supply gaps in the odn irrigation scheme would be nullified even in extraordinary dry years while respecting minimal flows of 50 m3 s released at markala a corresponding figure for recent irrigation practices like fig 5b would show no coloured patches at all 3 3 feasibility of envisaged irrigation scenarios in office du niger this section analyses the feasibility of the development plans to increase the irrigated area considering two reservoir scenarios in one scenario it is assumed that only the sélingué dam is operational left column in fig 6 and in the other scenario the fomi dam hpp scenario is operational in addition to the sélingué dam right column in fig 6 table 2 shows average supply gaps for dry season and wet season irrigation in dry periods comparable to conditions prevailing in the late 1970s and 1980s only 40 of the water demand could be supplied in february and march in the 2025 irrigation scenario fig 6a the fomi dam would almost eradicate those gaps see fig 6b only in extraordinary dry years irrigation deficits of about 20 can be expected in february while the supply gaps averaged over the entire simulation period are 1 irrigation practices would be compromised in the 2035 irrigation scenario between january and april if only the sélingué dam is operational fig 6c only in wet periods comparable to some years in the 1960s the demand may be fully met in the dry season in very dry periods comparable to the 1980s only 20 of the irrigation demand would be supplied if the fomi dam hpp scenario is operational in addition dry season irrigation would be feasible in wet and average years with an average supply gap of 5 over the entire period in the 2045 irrigation scenario average deficits in the low flow season were simulated to be 36 5 and in almost half of the years only 20 of the demand would be supplied if only the sélingué dam is operational fig 6e noticeable is also that in the wet 1960s an average supply gap of about 40 would occur between january and march even with an additional fomi dam the increased dry season discharge would not satisfy the high irrigation demands in most of the years fig 6f however the fomi dam would reduce the supply gap averaged over the entire simulation period from 19 sélingué only to 7 irrigation demands in the high flow season could theoretically be satisfied in all scenarios 3 4 impacts of management scenarios on inflows into the inner niger delta 3 4 1 niger river gauge ké macina fig 7 shows the individual impact of single management components irrigation only sélingué only and fomi hpp only on discharge at ké macina figs 8 and 9 illustrate their combined impacts note that the changes in figs 7 and 8 are expressed in relative terms and the values are therefore higher in the low flow season although absolute changes would be smaller than in the high flow season fig 9 shows absolute changes all scenarios show that reservoir operations reduce annual inflows and peak discharge into the ind and alter the natural flow regime depending on the water demand of the irrigation scenario average annual discharge at ké macina is reduced substantially on a long term annual average the irrigation withdrawals in odn in 2005 reduces the discharge at ké macina by 7 fig 7a the highest relative changes are simulated between january and june where discharge is reduced by at least 50 in most of the years in the high flow season discharge is reduced by 5 10 on average where in very dry years the irrigation demand can correspond to about 20 both dams show a similar impact by decreasing discharge in the high flow season up to 10 and increasing discharge in the low flow season on average by 10 and more than 200 as maximum values figs 7b and c only in the low flow season the larger storage capacity of fomi is visible by releasing larger volumes than the sélingué dam and therefore increasing low flows to a greater extent due to evaporative and seepage losses from the reservoirs average annual discharge at ké macina decreases by 3 sélingué and 4 fomi table s7 shows the simulated water balance variables of the reservoirs assuming irrigation withdrawals corresponding to the year 2005 the managed discharge is higher than natural flows in the low flow season between february and june and lower in the rest of the year fig 8a and e both dams compensate the current irrigation withdrawals which is not the case in the 2025 irrigation scenario with only the sélingué dam operating fig 8b in the 2035 and 2045 irrigation scenarios there is not a single month where discharge is higher than under natural flow conditions figs 8c and d the scenarios including the fomi dam show basically a similar behaviour except there is always a short period around may where the discharge is relatively higher compared to natural flows fig 8g and h as is shown in fig 9a land and water management has a large impact on peak discharge in september under current management practices irrigation scenario 2005 and sélingué only the average discharge at ké macina in september is reduced by 540 m3 s which corresponds to a reduction of 14 an additional fomi dam hpp would reduce september discharge by another 390 m3 s leading to a total reduction of 24 the latter is comparable to a situation where irrigation demands correspond to the 2045 irrigation scenario with the sélingué dam in operation fig 9b with an additional fomi dam hpp the september discharge would be reduced by 1300 m3 s or by 34 on average if one subtracts the 1300 m3 s from average september discharge the flood peaks would be reduced to a level of the second driest year in the period 1961 2000 compared to simulated natural flows the current water management irrigation scenario 2005 and sélingué dam reduces the long term annual average discharge at ké macina by 10 an additional fomi dam would lead to a total reduction of 14 table s6 which also shows the impacts on high flow q10 and low flow q90 indicators 3 4 2 bani river downstream djenné the long term average annual discharge of the bani river 300 m3 s contributes approximately 21 to the total inflows into the ind compared to the sélingué and fomi dams in the niger river the storage capacities of the talo and djenné dams are with 0 1 bm3 and 0 36 bm3 relatively small their simulated evaporative and seepage losses are also rather small and amount to 1 8 talo and 5 2 djenné of their total inflows table s7 the talo dam is not far upstream of the djenné dam and since both dams are either switched on or off in the simulations the talo dam is slightly impacting the results of the djenné dam the relative total losses of 5 2 of the djenné dam represent therefore the combined losses of both dams land and water management impacts in the bani river basin may although reducing peak discharge play a subordinate role regarding the ind inflows in contrast to the odn irrigation scheme where irrigated agriculture is practised throughout the year irrigation schemes at the talo and djenné dams are only supplied from the reservoirs in the high flow season between august and november however this period is relevant for the flooding in the ind since peak flows determine the size of the inundated area the irrigation demand estimated for 2025 in the talo and djenné irrigation schemes would account for a reduction of 13 of the bani river discharge on the long term annual average where the low flows are not impacted at all high flows q10 would be reduced by about 15 the combined impact of irrigation withdrawals in 2025 and the losses from the talo and djenné dams would reduce the long term average annual inflows from the bani river into the ind by 18 reducing the total inflows into the ind by another 4 the major impact by a decreased discharge from the bani river occurs in the high flow season between september and november where a reduction of 23 is simulated 3 5 trade offs and win win fig 10 summarises the win win situation between hydropower production of the two fomi operation scenarios including the sélingué dam and the irrigation scenarios in odn while considering the trade offs with the inundated area in the ind as was discussed in section 3 2 about 99 of the irrigation demands referring to the year 2005 are supplied with only the sélingué dam operational an additional fomi dam operated to preserve the natural flows env scenario would not change this situation but the supply gaps are nullified with a fomi dam operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario as is shown in fig 10a apart from additional hydropower production there is therefore no real win win with irrigation supply a clear win win situation can be observed in the future irrigation scenarios fig 10b d and the fomi hpp scenario in the 2045 irrigation scenario the average annual irrigation supply increases from about 80 in the env scenario to 93 in the hpp scenario while the average hydropower production is with 240 gw h a 151 357 gw h a also much higher and more reliable than in the env scenario with an average production of 157 gw h a 113 218 gw h a this win win situation would be even more pronounced if hydropower production would be plotted against dry season irrigation supply instead of average annual supply the corresponding irrigation supply gap values are shown in table 2 even though the win win between irrigation supply and hydropower production in the hpp scenario is obvious and would be a clear benefit in the context of the unbb the impact on downstream ecosystem services and water users has to be considered according to the simulations under natural flow conditions the ind s average maximal inundated area in the period 1961 2000 would be about 15 200 km2 both irrigation withdrawals referring to the year 2005 and reservoir storage by the sélingué dam have decreased the average maximal inundated area by about 7 14 144 km2 an additional fomi dam hpp scenario would shrink the inundated area by another 5 to a total reduction of 12 13 434 km2 the irrigation scenarios would contribute to a total reduction of 16 in 2025 18 in 2035 and 21 in 2045 see table 3 the level of reduction of the maximal inundated area per year is qualitatively indicated by the circle sizes in fig 10 where the larger the circles the higher the reduction and therefore the higher the trade off between management scenario and inundated area in the ind the circles in the hpp scenario are generally larger than in the env scenario denoting a larger impact on the inundated area and thus on ecosystem services provided by the ind the impacts in dry years are relatively higher than in wet years it is important to mention that the ind s ecosystem integrity does not only rely on discharge peaks which are important for the maximal flood extent it also depends on the general dynamics of the flow regime like the timing of the discharge peak as well as on a distinctive low flow season 4 discussion and conclusions countries in the unbb rank very low on the worldwide scale in terms of the human development index undp 2016 and food security gfsi 2017 while the population is projected to double by mid century un desa 2017 hence socio economic development is crucial and requires the utilisation of natural resources the management of natural resources aiming at sustainable intensification in the unbb needs to consider various aspects related to transboundary as well as upstream downstream issues or the cross sectoral trade offs along the climate water food energy nexus therefore trade offs between developments in the unbb and food production and ecosystem service based livelihoods in the ind deserve special attention ecosystem integrity of the ind relies on the seasonal flood pulse with certain thresholds for discharge in the dry season and flood peaks and flood duration in the wet season both are jeopardised by current and planned upstream land and water management activities as well as by the drying trend in the sahel observed since the late 1960s 4 1 uncertainties dai et al 2004 state that the decreased rainfall in the last three decades of the 20th century represents the largest recent observed climate change of any region according to biasutti 2013 cmip5 gcms do not reproduce the amplitude of observed oscillations at multidecadal timescales and rainfall projections for the sahel are less robust than the 20th century hindcast thus rainfall change signals projected by global and regional climate models in the sahel are highly uncertain which is underlined by the figs s2 s3 and s4 in the supplement where held et al 2005 states that a dramatic 21st century drying trend should be considered seriously as a possible future scenario schewe and levermann 2017 argue that there is a possibility of an abrupt intensification of rainfall under future climate change due to the above mentioned uncertainties and the need for accurate precipitation input the irrigation and reservoir operation scenario simulations were based on 40 years of historical weather data from the years 1961 to 2000 this period captures the recent rainfall variability quite well with periods above 1960s and below 1980s the 20th century average rainfall the last occurrence of an extremely wet decade was in the 1950s about 70 years ago this period has not been considered in this study because an important basis of the gridded climate dataset weedon et al 2011 is the era40 reanalysis product that starts in september 1957 only uppala et al 2005 a limitation of not applying climate change scenarios is that increasing air temperature and its impact on water demand for irrigation and water availability due to higher evapotranspiration rates from land and water surfaces is neglected we are aware that this would put additional pressure on e g crop productivity human health or the feasibility of irrigation expansion a simple analysis revealed that simulated discharge at ké macina would decrease by 1 5 and 2 8 if 1 c or 2 c are added to the daily temperature time series respectively this gives an indication how changes in temperature only may influence actual evapotranspiration the assessment of the feasibility of plans to expand irrigated agriculture in the unbb and its impacts on the downstream flow regime is based on globally available data such as daily climate data from a gridded dataset observed discharges land use and soil maps and on published data to parameterise irrigation and reservoir operation scenarios e g reports development plans environmental impact assessments we found contradicting information on water use efficiency crop rotations reservoir properties etc therefore management data used in this study have to be treated with caution as the data vary from one reference to another such inconsistencies are a source of uncertainties in application oriented impact assessment studies other unknown variables are related to the management itself as it is not clear how the dams will be managed how fast the irrigated area will increase or if the minimal flow threshold at markala will be respected or not employing scenarios is therefore a useful approach to capture the range of possible future pathways based on uncertain input data 4 2 hydropower production a small fomi dam with a storage capacity of 2 4 bm3 operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime env scenario could produce 40 5 mw hydro electric power on average between july and november but either no or only very little in the dry season the average production corresponds to 18 4 mw 157 gw h a to guarantee electricity production throughout the year such an electricity system could be complemented by hybrid solar and or wind power generators contributing to a more sustainable and stable energy mix a large fomi dam with a storage capacity of 5 3 bm3 operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario could produce 28 mw 240 gw h a on an annual average with a firm yield of 16 mw with an exceedance probability of 90 4 3 feasibility of agricultural development and impacts on inflows into the inner niger delta the high seasonality of the niger and bani river discharges requires separate assessments of the feasibility of development plans for the dry december to may and the wet season june to november assuming hydro climatic conditions comparable to the period 1961 2000 the niger river provides naturally enough water to theoretically supply the demands in the wet season even in the 2045 irrigation scenario with an area of 460 000 ha hertzog et al 2012 assume for instance that the niger river provides theoretically enough water to irrigate one million hectares however water withdrawals for dry season cropping are already at a limit today particularly in dry years it should be noted that current dry season water demands in odn would not sufficiently be supplied without the existing sélingué dam which increases the discharge between january and june under dry hydro climatic conditions comparable to the late 1970s or 1980s supply gaps would amount up to 80 without this dam hence a further extension in the dry season can only be achieved by either reducing the water demands per area or by increasing river discharge a provision of higher dry season discharge can only be realised by the construction of a new dam in the niger headwaters which is already planned since decades and was prioritised as a key infrastructure in the shared vision and sustainable development plan for the niger nba 2007 according to hertzog et al 2012 and vandersypen et al 2006 the gravity based irrigation system over dimensioned tertiary canals minimal efforts in managing the odn irrigation scheme and the abundance of water in the wet season lead to low efficiencies in water use vandersypen et al 2006 state that the operation of the irrigation network is inadequate and water use is unsustainable because guidelines and procedures for operation are not followed in practice this leads to avoidable losses due to excess water delivery and a permanent filling of secondary canals where crop demands in odn are estimated to be about 1000 mm a the supply is in the order of 2000 2500 mm a hertzog et al 2012 in theory under an optimised water management the same amount of water would either reduce the estimated supply gaps in the irrigation scenarios or may contribute to an extension of the irrigated area in practice this would involve costly investments e g for advanced irrigation techniques maintenance of irrigation canals or water pumping to achieve equality in water supply over the whole irrigation scheme a realistic quantification of the impact of improved water use efficiency is difficult and requires local knowledge and detailed data on the irrigation canal network water control practices crop calendar etc and was therefore beyond the scope of this study the expected impacts of a new dam depend primarily on its storage volume and operation rules for impoundment and release it was found that a smaller dam with a storage capacity of 2 4 bm3 operated to largely preserve the natural flow regime env scenario does not support an extension of dry season cropping in odn because dry season discharges would be comparable to those today harvest losses could be substantial in dry years already in the 2025 irrigation scenario where supply gaps of up to 60 are simulated in february and march such a dam would result in rather low trade offs with downstream ecosystems while supporting irrigation in adjacent areas the impact on the discharge peak arriving at ké macina before entering the ind in september would be negligible provided that withdrawals for irrigation are on a today level the reduction of the average maximal inundated area in the ind caused by an additional dam env scenario and current withdrawals is only 1 compared to the current state an additional large dam with a storage capacity of 5 3 bm3 operated to optimise hydropower production hpp scenario is expected to have a substantial impact on the flow regime such a dam would have the potential to increase the low flows in the dry season from about 20 m3 s to about 100 200 m3 s at its outlet thereby enabling the irrigation extension plans in odn envisaged for the years 2025 and 2035 however in 2035 supply gaps between 20 40 can be expected in dry years which would certainly lead to considerable yield losses an extension of the odn irrigation scheme as is planned for the year 2045 would be compromised in many years during the dry season where the average supply gap over the entire simulation period between january and march is 30 and can be as large as 60 in extraordinary dry years where current irrigation and reservoir operations reduce the average annual niger discharge by about 10 the 2045 irrigation scenario in combination with the large dam may reduce the average discharge by a third compared to natural flows current management practices reduce the peak discharge essential for inundation processes in the ind already by 500 m3 s in september in the 2045 irrigation scenario the average discharge peak may decrease by about 1300 m3 s thereby reducing september discharge of an average year to the level of the second driest year observed in the period 1961 2000 it is not surprising but noticeable that the impact of irrigation and reservoir operations are relatively lower in wet decades like in the 1960s than in dry decades like in the 1980s likewise is the decrease of flood dynamics and its associated impacts much higher in dry years in the 2045 irrigation scenario for instance the water demand would correspond to 50 of discharge in the year with lowest discharge and to 19 in the year with highest discharge in the entire simulation period in addition to the reduction of niger river discharge the recently built talo and djenné dams and adjacent irrigation schemes in the bani river basin are further shortening the water resources in the ind by another 4 on average the reduction between september and november amounts to about 23 compared to natural flows adding this share to the reduction of peak inflows from the niger river in 2045 34 in september a total reduction of the discharge peak of about 40 can be expected a strongly altered hydrological regime would have large negative impacts on the inundated area in the ind not only leading to severe shrinking of the wetland ecosystem but also jeopardising its integrity discharge reductions like in the 2045 irrigation scenario would compromise the ind s potential to yield fish fodder and rice and hence reduce livelihood options for many inhabitants the year 1984 the driest year in the simulation period is often used to illustrate the destructive forces of such conditions which led to mass animal deaths and famines situations comparable to the year 1984 with an inundated area below 9000 km2 occurred once between 1961 and 2000 but may occur twice under the 2035 and 2045 irrigation and hpp scenarios the threshold of 10 000 km2 was undercut twice in the simulation of the past but in seven years in the 2045 irrigation and hpp scenario the large dam hpp scenario under current irrigation management would reduce the average maximal inundated area by 5 compared to current conditions together with irrigation withdrawals in 2045 the inundated area would experience an average reduction of 14 compared to the current situation which corresponds to a total reduction of 21 compared to natural conditions coyne and bellier 2009 assume that the large dam would reduce the area by 10 brl and dhi 2007 estimate a reduction of 14 and aecom 2017 a reduction between 8 12 a direct comparison among these studies is extremely difficult because different time periods modelling approaches and assumptions on dam characteristics have been used which are not always transparently reported however compared to the other studies it seems that our estimations underestimate the impact of the fomi dam on the average maximal inundated area minimising or even losing the ind s ecosystem services would create tremendous costs not only from a monetary perspective which have to be taken into consideration in the development of management plans in the unbb not investing in improved water use efficiency today but relying on increased dry season discharge from a new dam would only postpone several issues that have to be tackled in the long term anyway such as meeting sustainable development goals meeting the food production for the growing population in future etc studies investigating trade offs and synergies from an economic and or ecosystem service perspective considering the different

8466,study region global scale study focus this paper highlights the main outputs and outcomes of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm 2000 2015 of unesco on the global scale we discuss the lessons learned what is still relevant in isarm and what we consider irrelevant and why we follow with discussion on the looming scenarios and the next steps following the awareness on transboundary aquifers tbas as identified by isarm new insights for the region this analysis emphasizes the need for more scientific data widespread education and training and a more clearly defined role for governments to manage groundwater at the international level it describes the links approach and relevance of studies on tbas to the un law of transboundary aquifers and on how they might fit regional strategies to assess and manage tbas the study discusses an important lesson learned on whether groundwater science can solve transboundary issues alone it has become clear that science should interact with policy makers and social entities to have meaningful impacts on tbas bringing together science society law policy making and harmonising information would be important drivers and the best guidance for further assessments isarm can still make contributions but it could be redesigned to support resolving tbas issues which in addition to science hydrogeology require considering social political economic and environmental factors isarm can increase its international dimension in the continents that still lag behind the assessment and shared management of tbas such as asia and africa keywords aquifer transboundary global cooperation isarm 1 introduction transboundary river basins have been extensively studied worldwide since the 1970s wolf et al 1999 however transboundary aquifers tbas have received less attention despite their scientific environmental institutional and socio economic importance since 2000 when the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm was established by the international hydrological programme ihp of unesco substantial efforts have been made to identify transboundary aquifers or aquifer systems tbas in world regions and to raise awareness of their societal and environmental importance unesco 2001 a few tbas agreements that existed before isarm or were prepared following isarm and or the united nations resolution on tbas un a res 63 124 as they may be applied to tbas are summarised in the paper by burchi 2018 after the unesco ihp transboundary aquifer programme was launched puri and aureli 2005 a number of initiatives contributions and programmes that focused on different aspects of this water resource including agreements have taken place on the global scale wada and heinrich 2013 among the initiatives the second assessment of transboundary rivers lakes and groundwater unece 2011 whymap 2006 the twap transboundary aquifers of the world update 2012 twap 2012 or the taap transboundary aquifer assessment program taap 2013 can be cited this contribution focuses on transboundary aquifers outputs on their management and on policy and social issues worldwide after more than 15 years of experience one important aspect covered herein refers to several aspects agreements on tbas as a result of isarm or existing agreements prior isarm whether they fit the isarm philosophy and the un resolution on tbas where agreements are missing burchi 2018 existing legislation on groundwater and aquifers whether transboundary or not suggest how it may be applied or not and why not to transboundary aquifers a summary of perspectives and a discussion on the next steps per country or per continent and wherever common strategies exist americas europe is presented where they do not exist we make a case of promoting them following international good practices it is also worth mentioning the sustainable development goals towards the 2030 un agenda where sdg6 is intended exclusively for water to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all however for sdg6 to be successful it will require reliable management systems in be put in place which may prove even more difficult to achieve when dealing with transboundary waters our second aim is to synthesise the philosophy behind the management assessment of tbas per continent or large continental regions the idea behind this approach is to assess the context scope and perception of the isarm methodology by different legislations and their associated issues and concerns to that end the paper presents real outputs and outcomes since isarm was launched in 2000 by underlining the science policy and social issues and what has been learned what is still in as per 2017 what is not working and what the next possible steps are 2 isarm outputs and outcomes a number of important outputs and outcomes have emerged around the globe as a result of isarm the most important direct outputs across four continents are described below four regional isarm networks of experts were created to identify map and manage transboundary aquifers isarm europe isarm americas isarm asia and isarm africa a global inventory and a global map of tbas with 592 tbas identified until 2015 of these however more than 50 are defined as groundwater bodies not necessarily tbas as defined by isarm in eu member states this was decided to comply with their water framework directive 2000 60 ec 2000 world financial agencies global environment facility or gef world bank supported isarm activities most notably on studies about some tbas e g guarani nubian novel scientific practices to define transboundary groundwater resources availability e g milk river novel tools and instruments e g grace of the analysis to be done for large scale transboundary aquifers e g northern great plains judith river edwards trinity the drafting of the adoption of the un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers the most relevant direct outcomes are some regional strategies to assess and manage tbas have been prepared worldwide machard de gramont et al 2010 unep 2011 wwap 2012 riob 2013 when preparing their regional strategy of tbas in the americas rivera ed 2015 the isarm americas network was inspired by the un draft articles namely in relation to adopting science based norms for neighboring engagement promoting knowledge protecting groundwater resources in the optimal sustainable development context establishing shared management practices promoting international cooperation and good neighborliness and encouraging the equitable and reasonable utilization of resources alliances among science policy making and society networks to build trust nine years after the draft articles were adopted by unga 2008 there has been no ratification or affirmative vote on the draft articles there is a perception that there is no political will to establish international laws that may prove stronger than multilateral or bilateral agreements and there are concerns about having to cede some riparian rights 3 lessons learned many important lessons were learned during the 15 years of isarm in more than 130 countries 24 for the americas 27 for europe 38 for asia and 45 for africa on four continents 3 1 information one of the most important lessons learned overall was that background information on transboundary aquifers as a key obstacle was missing to establish clear and quantifiable objectives to monitor and manage the groundwater and aquifers that cross international boundaries e g north american countries a recurring theme throughout most transboundary water relationships is the reality and slow realization that we cannot separate waters groundwater from surface water raw from waste quality from quantity or shortage from adequate supply issues 3 2 communication there are important lessons to be learned by hydrogeologists and water managers alike the primary lesson is that as long as hydrogeologists only talk to themselves key elements of the natural and built environment will remain beyond decision makers understanding in general scientists and managers lack sufficient communication a dissemination communication strategy is generally lacking secondly while good cooperation exists among the hydrogeologists who work across their own borders this is insufficient and it is only through relevant cross disciplinary dialogue that essential water resources and everything that follows on from them can be managed for social economic and environmental security this is particularly true for transboundary aquifers 3 3 legal instruments a key lesson that may be drawn from isarm activities relates to the un s adoption of the law of transboundary aquifers which is also a direct outcome of the isarm initiative this is a clear outcome of how hydrogeological science transforms into a global legal instrument this instrument was drafted with the direct involvement of hydrogeologists who had to undertake significant intellectual efforts to establish a solid definition of the key hydrogeological terminology for it to be scientifically correct but legally consistent and to be made legally binding i e direct solid and very fruitful cooperation between hydrogeologists and lawyers the result is a well developed science based legal tool to be used by the world un member states burchi 2018 since then more work is being done to help and support member states in adopting these guidelines some of these new activities involve hydrogeologists supported by the international association of hydrogeologists iah other member states are applying and undertaking the principles of the law of transboundary aquifers independently for more on this aspect readers are referred to the paper by burchi 2018 3 4 non legally binding regional treaties protocols conventions agreements and strategies as for agreements at the world level the scope or meaning has different interpretations for the sharing countries in different regions europe africa and asia some refer to the signed water directives in force e g wfd eu or the signing of international conventions there are very few tbas for which signed agreements exist and these generally take a bilateral form with institutions having quite variable scope and mandates given the concerns and fears of some countries to cede riparian rights there have been many other multilateral or bilateral non binding agreements for cooperation which in some cases are considered to have more strength than legally binding international laws science cooperation between canada and the usa the usa and mexico mali niger and nigeria and others see burchi 2018 the isarm americas group has moved its activities a step further in designing a strategy for the american hemisphere regional strategy for the assessment and management of the transboundary aquifer systems in the americas rivera ed 2015 this regional strategy for the americas is contained in the 4th book of the isarm americas series it is the result of more than 10 years of successful and fruitful collaboration of unesco ihp and the organization of american states oas with members of 24 participating countries in the america hemisphere the strategy adopted the vision of achieving improved sustainable management and protection of transboundary aquifer that goes beyond the boundaries of the participating countries and the mission to increase the generation and exchange of knowledge concerning the transboundary aquifers developing communication pathways cooperation and joint work between participating isarm americas countries the strategy arises from the achievements made through the work by 24 countries within the isarm americas framework which takes into account the information collected in the three previous publications of the isarm americas network where a total of 73 tbas were inventoried as per 2009 unesco 2010 the strategy for the americas was also inspired by the draft articles of the un resolution on the law of transboundary aquifers 3 5 time scale and space scale factors during the 15 years that isarm activities took place the sustainable management of transboundary aquifers concept has been extensively discussed isarm participants and stakeholders discussed various concepts in an effort to reach a consensus on the way forward one of the most acceptable ideas was the fair and equitable sharing of the groundwater resource concept which is also described in the un law of tbas but how effective may that concept be as previously mentioned it is recommended that tbas are used in a sustainable manner however joint management can be complex especially with large tbas e g guarani milk river chad basin thus as has been suggested in the tbas assessment stage the joint management of tbas can also be oriented in principle to their portions of the international border in order to adopt a management plan which aims to prevent or mitigate cross border conflicts a very complex aspect refers to the approach of distributing the available groundwater resources among the countries that share a tba when it comes to distributing a common good it is natural to immediately think about fair equitable distribution but how can one understand this concept when it comes to natural systems which often present wide inequalities or asymmetries in all the involved factors although there is no single answer to that question the following aspects can be considered the area of the tba that corresponds to each country each country s contribution to the total aquifer system recharge the aquifer s hydrogeological characteristics the magnitude of current and future water demands the spatial distribution of their reserves groundwater storage the legal framework for water parties and stakeholders economic and technological ability etc for example can one of the countries that share the tba claim a bigger fraction of the available water resources because it occupies a larger portion of the tba because their water needs are greater because it began uptaking and using water before because it brings a bigger recharge fraction although it may seem logical the solution is not as simple as distributing the available volume equally or proportionally to the surface that corresponds to the tba obviously no general distribution criterion exists which enables each case to be the subject of negotiations among the involved parties which must necessarily rely on technical and scientific knowledge about the system in this context extensive efforts to recognize and accommodate asymmetries in the underlying legal and regulatory frameworks for water management are essential to meet the objectives of the countries that share the aquifer there have been a few cases in which binational research works have addressed institutional asymmetries and established the foundation of genuinely collaborative efforts to acquire share and analyze data information megdal and scott 2011 this brings us to the importance of science data information numerical tools and general scientific knowledge that transboundary aquifers must have for informed based decision making purposes by way of example we briefly discuss the case of the milk river transboundary aquifer shared by canada and the usa the milk river transboundary aquifer mrta forms part of the isarm americas inventory with the official tag isarm 20n the mrta straddles southern alberta canada and northern montana usa and lies in a semi arid region with well documented water shortages pétré et al 2016 the mrta is a confined sandstone aquifer that is a source for municipal water supply and agricultural uses on the canadian side it is also used for water supply to enhance the secondary oil recovery work on the us side of the border it is a transboundary aquifer shared by multi stakeholders in six jurisdictions federal state and municipal usa and federal provincial and municipal canada application of numerical models for aquifer management is not a new undertaking but it is being increasingly applied to tbas szöcs this issue and milk river tba scientific studies of the mrta have developed three models to better understand the nature scales and hydrodynamics of groundwater fluxes of the transboundary aquifer a geological 3d unified model pétré et al 2015 a unified hydrogeological conceptual model pétré et al 2016 and an integrated groundwater flow numerical model pétré et al 2018 these studies allowed a very detailed transboundary delineation of the aquifer with a continuous representation of its hydrostratigraphy across the canada us border as well as a better understanding of the aquifer s regional transboundary dynamics the conceptual model allowed a detailed quantitative understanding of the aquifer system and dynamics with detailed water balances as well as the identification of areas with water deficits furthermore clear regions for internationally shared management strategies were identified as discussed above not all the aquifer s areas have the same dynamics nor the same interests or impacts a map of the aquifer s space and time scale factors for the different mrta stakeholders interests is shown in fig 1 the issue of scale is one of the reasons why some scientists are considering defining groundwater flow systems rather than aquifers as a future quantitative analysis to define groundwater availability which was learned from the guarani and the milk river tbas among others rivera 2017 rivera et al 2017 3 6 global issues 3 6 1 north america two drivers threaten most borderland shared waters the demographic momentum driven by migration and climate change for instance these drivers may increase further floods and more intense droughts to the us mexican border and canada us borders the international boundary and water commission ibwc us mexico has already issued warnings about the eventual impacts of drought on water supplies moreover the international joint commission ijc canada us has issued its triennial assessment report that recommends activities to improve the understanding of groundwater and its connectivity to surface waters in the shared waters of the great lakes basin ijc 2017 the current binational efforts made between the u s and mexico on transboundary aquifers have been limited to the aquifers designated as priority by the u s mexico transboundary aquifer assessment act public law 109 448 centers and institutes in both countries are working to develop joint strategic plans for future work based on lessons learned and relationships built see callegary et al this special issue inspired by the isarm approach and the un resolution on law of transboundary aquifers some of the tabs in these countries have strengthened cooperation along their borders this has been critical to ensure cooperative mechanisms such as new agreements and protocols for information exchange and data sharing and to enhance the development of accurate water policies and water conservation plans for managing aquifers sustainably according to population requirements these efforts establish the basis to apply international water law principles the cooperative process for tbas efforts along the us mx border are well described in callegary et al this issue however studies for some priority aquifers along the us mx border did not form part of isarm because they began after most isarm americas efforts had been made thus in this regional case one of the lessons that can be emphasized is the potential to learn from other studies beyond the isarm process several meetings and workshops across north america have brought together water analysts and officials from the three countries to compare approaches to binational water cooperation these meetings have proved quite useful in scientific water resources assessment with a particular focus on transboundary aquifers on canada us and us mexico borders transboundary water resources policies including legal frameworks mechanisms for cooperation and water rights administration have also been discussed with less tangible outcomes however engaging high level policy makers and government officials in discussions has proved most helpful as they provide a vision for future collaboration including binational water management prospects minute 319 2000 rivera et al 2017 taap 2013 it should be noted however that the tba assessment efforts along the us mx border explicitly specify that the results of scientific studies do not imply anything about binational groundwater management 3 6 2 south america as in other areas of the world two of the most important lessons learned in south america are related with space scales and socio political issues for instance the large guarani aquifer system isarm 21s shared by brazil paraguay uruguay and argentina has undergone extensive hydrogeological assessments in more than a decade of intended shared management by the four countries sharing the same aquifer system being a world reference as to how to manage a tba the guarani aquifer has passed from an inspiration and hope for other tbas to a question mark due to the non entry into force of the guarani aquifer agreement see sindico et al this issue indeed a management agreement for the guarani aquifer system was signed by the four presidents of those countries in 2010 as a joint declaration san juan argentina august 2 2010 agreement on the guarani aquifer argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay acuerdo 2010 for socio political and other reasons explained in sindico et al this issue after 7 years this agreement has not been ratified by brazil and paraguay nonetheless management has continued in some specific areas of the aquifer system in past year despite the non entry of the agreement into force in particular the cities located along the borders of the countries that share the aquifer have continued to jointly manage the natural resource this also reflects the space issue of potential impacts closer to international borders another issue is the precise delineation of a transboundary aquifer that is even larger than the guarani the amazonas transboundary aquifer isarm 28s which is shared by six countries and covers an estimated area of 3 950 000 km2 is this one transboundary aquifer or is it an integration of several aquifers that are located mostly in amazon plains the isarm americas group defined it as a transboundary aquifer system based mostly on the geology of the central and eastern parts of amazon plains and the orinoco province with a unique ecosystem however no hydrogeological studies have been conducted to precisely define whether the whole system can be considered transboundary according to the isarm definition and contex so like other very large tbas the space scale likely is defined on whether or not these are indeed a one transboundary system 3 6 3 europe in europe the extension and size of tbas are generally limited compared to aquifer systems in other parts of the world the complexity of the geology in the region means that some small aquifers have no hydraulic connection and fragmented information which has led to previous inconsistent methodological approaches to map transboundary aquifers unesco ihp 2011 diktas 2012 igrac 2012 bgr unesco 2013 an added difficulty is information collection compiling available information is no easy task most reports come in national languages and internationally available information is very limited about 75 of the population depends on groundwater for water supply but major industrial development takes place for geothermal exploitation purposes transenergy project szőcs this issue countries across the region experience water scarcities to varying degrees mainly those in the dry and irrigation intensive river basins in southern europe and hot spots around urban centers water scarcity often happens in areas with low rainfall which opens a gap between demand and supply particularly in areas with a high population density tourist inflow and intensive agriculture and water demanding industries industrial development large scale mining thermal exploitation and groundwater pollution by agriculture may also deteriorate aquifer quality in terminology terms in eu countries only the water framework directive wfd of groundwater bodies applies 2000 60 ec 2000 the wfd establishes a legal framework and harmonises other eu related legislation eu policy implementation foresees river basin management plans and the definition of groundwater bodies in the rivers district in line with integrated water resources management iwrm according to the eu definition a groundwater body is a coherent subunit in the river basin district to which the environmental objectives of the directive must apply as part of the twap gef groundwater component project the european region was assessed for better harmonization in 2012 unesco ihp 2011 igrac 2012 wwap 2012 in the 27 eu member countries the wfd groundwater bodies have been mainly assessed for eu member states accession countries currently eight countries or within efta four countries the wfd establishes a legal framework and harmonises other eu related legislation eu policy implementation foresees river basin management plans and the definition of groundwater bodies in the rivers district in line with the integrated water resources management approach iwrm to harmonise the implementation of the wfd between member states and accession countries the european water directors have developed a common implementation strategy at the transboundary level the wfd also contemplates establishing transboundary river basin commissions like the international commission for the protection of the rhine river icpdr which also includes groundwater resources governance and management of european tbas are complicated by the fact that limited information on the scope of the agreements exists and whether a common implementation strategy to cover the management plan and measures to be taken have been adopted and if they are available as for agreements 33 of countries have reported ratified agreements the scope or meaning has different interpretations for the countries that share tbas as reported information has indicated some refer to the signed water directives in force e g wfd eu twap or the signing of international conventions very few tbas have prepared signed or ratified agreements the few that exist are generally of a bilateral form the management agreement for upper pannonian thermal aquifer eu24 belgian dutch german lowland aquifer 3 6 4 africa work on tbas in africa has proven to create an impetus for cooperation on groundwater related activities of aquifer sharing countries and can even be a driver for national groundwater management in order to manage issues of transboundary impacts very large units that comprise for example a complete sedimentary basin of more than 100 000 km2 may however not be that useful for management purposes it is practical to define zones of potential transboundary impacts within the tbas based on sound hydrogeological and scientific methods such zoning scale factor will provide a focus to allocate limited resources for groundwater related activities more efficiently seventy two transboundary aquifers have been mapped in africa and are of much importance as they cover about 40 of the continent and also because about 33 of the african population lives on top of these tbas see nijsten et al this issue tba mapping in africa has steadily progressed since the beginning of this century but is far from conclusive the same is true for assessments as information is fragmented and only about 11 tbas have been assessed in detail the joint monitoring and management of tbas are still in their early stages notable exceptions include some six tbas with formalised cooperation mostly in north africa the recent transboundary waters assessment programme twap 2012 has compiled a lot of information that was not previously available nationally which allows tbas to be described in terms of indicators however discrepancies between reported governance arrangements and the formal status of such arrangements indicate that agreements may not be fully internalised increased awareness and the activity of international organisations is noticeable but remains challenging to convert international cooperation into positive impacts locally 3 6 5 asia lack of expertise experience and institutional support in many parts of asia has restricted the cooperation and sustainable management of shared aquifer resources considerable progress has been made but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems of asia is limited reliable tbas data are still lacking particularly for developing countries which suggests that continuous efforts are needed to improve knowledge about tbas and to facilitate informant sharing and access to tbas data several countries such as china have endeavoured to cooperate internationally towards shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with neighboring countries these are significant milestones and clear outcomes of isarm a more detailed description is provided in lee et al this issue 4 legislation governance and shared management currently there are two main frameworks or guiding documents that can be used for the shared management and governance of transboundary aquifers the un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers unga 2008 and the un convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes water convention completed in 1999 unwc 2014 a detailed description of the development application relevance and comparison of the two frameworks is provided in lipponen this issue and is not repeated here however legislation is not enough for groundwater governance of transboundary aquifers the application of legislation to tbas is a very complex issue given the many stakeholders involved the level of knowledge and the level of cooperation among stakeholders transboundary water management presents many special challenges to politicians planners administrators and scientists problems that affect water management and water policy implementation include strong cooperation on data information about economic political cultural and social issues and also on geographical issues joint efforts are needed to achieve a common implementation strategy to monitor networks definition standardised data collection information exchange through networking activities guidance documents to assist in implementation and technical reports at the transboundary level furthermore for joint efforts to be practical and efficient all types of data e g socio economic need to be harmonised and joint databases have to be set up for joint information management groundwater governance presents challenges that require many different sets of skills from different fields hydrogeologists lawyers economists water managers anthropologists just to name a few all of these speak very different languages in their own way and often do not make the necessary effort to communicate among others some of these challenges are discussed in the fao global framework for action fao 2015a it has been found that groundwater governance almost everywhere is insufficient with the various key deficiencies as identified in the global diagnostic on groundwater governance fao 2015b to achieve the shared vision 2030 goals the framework for action describes in detail the main urgent actions needed which are 1 creating an adequate basis for governance 2 building effective institutions 3 making essential linkages 4 redirecting finances 5 starting the planning and management process these are described in detail in the global framework for action document fao 2015a in all eu regions legal agreements on cooperation in transboundary water issues have been concluded and operational components in the form of joint commissions have been established while some other agreements are still being prepared the geneva aquifer de los cobos this issue is an example of a full governance and management agreement while a more specific agreement that focuses mainly on geothermal aspects of the tba is the objective of the upper pannonian transboundary aquifer szöcs this issue although the legal basis for cooperation in managing transboundary waters in the pan european region is well developed most existing agreements do not explicitly refer to groundwater or their application to groundwater remains limited thus it is necessary to improve legal frameworks for cooperation and to strengthen institutions for the management and protection of groundwater establishing shared transboundary resource management should imply defining common approaches for data collection and information requirements requirements should focus on meeting the proposed objectives towards a common implementation strategy 5 sustainable development goal 6 towards the 2030 un agenda the un seeks to transform the world with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the adopted 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets will stimulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet of the 17 sustainable development goals of the un for 2030 the sixth sustainable development goal sdg6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is exclusively designed for water and covers a 15 year time span to achieve and maintain universal access to water however reliable management systems need to be put into place for sdg6 to be successful an sdg subcategory sdg6 5 may even be more difficult to achieve as it deals with transboundary waters while isarm has been underway for 15 years tba related institutions that work on managing transboundary aquifers have been even scarcer than any other water related institutions in the next 15 years sdgs are expected to act as a major target for the efforts of the practitioners who deal with transboundary waters and national aquifers it is anticipated that some consultation mechanisms will become operational and will provide a new paradigm for bi and multi lateral engagement between countries whose outcome would improve socio economic development and if not a reversal of aquifer degradation then at least a stabilization the goal on water and sanitation for the 2030 agenda has recognized that the sector at large would require a coherent monitoring framework with improved data collection and analysis to cover the whole water cycle to meet this need seven un agencies joined forces under the un water umbrella to develop the integrated monitoring of water and sanitation related sdg targets initiative by integrating and extending existing monitoring efforts draft methodologies for all the global sdg 6 indicators have been developed starting in april 2016 methodologies were introduced into six countries for in depth pilot testing purposes based on learning from pilot testing and the broader review the methodologies were revised by the end of 2016 and will follow a global implementation that started in 2017 by 2018 a global baseline for sdg 6 target 6 5 indicator 6 5 2 should be available this indicator is designed by unesco ihp for transboundary aquifers unece and unesco 2017 6 summary and conclusions what is next this paper synthesizes more than 15 years of experiences of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm from 2000 to 2015 outputs and outcomes we discuss the lessons learned from isarm as well as the status and perspectives for the future the conclusions and recommendations are based mainly on the chapters on the special issue but themes issues are laid out from other stories of transboundary aquifers tbas in the world that are not presented in the special issue many analyses have indicated a future of the institutionalized transboundary aquifer cooperation distilled from analyzing experience so far as also indicated by some of the other contributions made to this special issue bringing together science society law and policy making and harmonising information important drivers and impacts will act as guidance for further tbas assessments sharing a common groundwater resource requires all the parties involved to collaborate in a coordinated and excellent way to ensure the sustainable use and protection of the resource the best way to protect and manage transboundary aquifers is through close international cooperation among all the countries involved in tbas by bringing together all interests one of the most important lessons learned with tbas is that related with the scale issue as a result of assessing some of the largest transboundary aquifers guarani milk river some scientists are considering parsing out groundwater flow systems rather than aquifers boundaries as a future quantitative analysis to define groundwater availability along the borderlines of tbas this is a very important outcome of isarm it is a matter of scales to accommodate tba related issues other than only science tbas require social political economic and environmental factors in addition to science hydrogeology other relevant conclusions open questions and recommendations are in the pan european region a long standing history of inventories and documentation of evolution demonstrates the gradual refinement of information and also the interplay of scientific knowledge advancement and fluctuating political recognition on tbas should we re direct isarm driven by policy social environmental economic issues what can science do can groundwater science do it alone how can science interact with policy makers and social impacts how should a science policy interface be implemented is isarm still needed these and many other similar questions were asked from stakeholders around the world during the isarm continental surveys clearly a paradigm shift is emerging from the science for science sake towards more integrated issue driven science based socio political partnerships groundwater science and technology for tbas should be embedded in a larger socio economic and political system for international stability trust among the countries that share tbas is essential to promote effective cooperation and to exchange information for shared management in this sense the process developed by isarm americas for over 15 years has successfully obtained tangible results four books plus a strong network of national experts the international legal instruments in the americas are still incipient the only agreement on integrated transboundary aquifers in south america is about the management of the guarani aquifer system joint declaration san juan argentina august 2 2010 agreement on the guarani aquifer argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay acuerdo 2010 the isarm process is slow and difficult but stakeholders across continents are reducing and balancing the cooperative gap among science society and policy making a very positive and perhaps a model to follow is the genevese transboundary aquifer switzerland france of 40 years of peaceful and successful shared management the unesco ihp isarm remains one of the key dedicated global drivers for the continued understanding assessment and strengthening of inter country collaboration of transboundary aquifers acknowledgement of their efforts is mentioned in puri and aureli s paper this special issue as discussed in detailed by puri and aureli and by burchi 2018 the most critical part of the whole equation is the institutionalization of the process this part remains a conundrum since there is no ideal single format for such a body and their design has to be adopted on a case by case basis nine years after adopting the first draft articles there is a perception that there is no will to establish international laws that may have be stronger than multilateral or bilateral agreements and there are concerns about having to cede some riparian rights recently during the adoption of the third round of discussions on the law of tbas at the united nations general assembly unga 2016 a speaker told the sixth committee that while management of transboundary aquifers is critical for the success of the un 2030 agenda the draft articles must be tailored to each state detailed studies of tbas have high costs most developing countries face other basic priorities as their society have bare any public investment capacity in general there are no conflicts among the countries that share tbas however some conflicts have arisen which could increase in the tbas of north america where competition for groundwater resources is much more obvious and prominent e g mexico u s knowledge cooperation and exchange has been crucial to prevent conflicts regular tbas assessments are needed building a sustainable coalition within regions may require building a community platform to establish links among the researchers practitioners policy makers and stakeholders involved with tbas initiatives regular assessments will ensure up to date aquifer information which is implied by the concept of integrated water resources management at the transboundary level and the assessments of possible trends and the definition of new information needs by taking into account the needs of the interest groups involved in the process building a participatory infrastructure is considered a very important condition for successful future assessments policy responses reflect times of global change and uncertainties which depend on a good information b a good information dissemination c a good understanding of that information political legal agreements are issue driven and environmental concerns are low down in political agendas but social pressures and science push are changing this scenario the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers have become a reference for tbas and are still relevant but are perceived only as guidelines and for influence as a final remark we should wonder why we continue to pay attention to transboundary aquifers fifteen years of isarm clearly show that this is mainly to build trust and to avoid conflict any conflict social political economic environmental even human confrontations conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the ongoing support of unesco and the corresponding isarm teams from the americas and europe the geological survey of canada and the technical university of catalonia upc spain provided technical support this is a lands and minerals sector contribution 20170318 for the first author and ministerio de economía y competitividad of spain cgl2013 48802 c3 3 r for the second author this paper has benefited from the generous comments of three anonymous reviewers 
8466,study region global scale study focus this paper highlights the main outputs and outcomes of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm 2000 2015 of unesco on the global scale we discuss the lessons learned what is still relevant in isarm and what we consider irrelevant and why we follow with discussion on the looming scenarios and the next steps following the awareness on transboundary aquifers tbas as identified by isarm new insights for the region this analysis emphasizes the need for more scientific data widespread education and training and a more clearly defined role for governments to manage groundwater at the international level it describes the links approach and relevance of studies on tbas to the un law of transboundary aquifers and on how they might fit regional strategies to assess and manage tbas the study discusses an important lesson learned on whether groundwater science can solve transboundary issues alone it has become clear that science should interact with policy makers and social entities to have meaningful impacts on tbas bringing together science society law policy making and harmonising information would be important drivers and the best guidance for further assessments isarm can still make contributions but it could be redesigned to support resolving tbas issues which in addition to science hydrogeology require considering social political economic and environmental factors isarm can increase its international dimension in the continents that still lag behind the assessment and shared management of tbas such as asia and africa keywords aquifer transboundary global cooperation isarm 1 introduction transboundary river basins have been extensively studied worldwide since the 1970s wolf et al 1999 however transboundary aquifers tbas have received less attention despite their scientific environmental institutional and socio economic importance since 2000 when the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm was established by the international hydrological programme ihp of unesco substantial efforts have been made to identify transboundary aquifers or aquifer systems tbas in world regions and to raise awareness of their societal and environmental importance unesco 2001 a few tbas agreements that existed before isarm or were prepared following isarm and or the united nations resolution on tbas un a res 63 124 as they may be applied to tbas are summarised in the paper by burchi 2018 after the unesco ihp transboundary aquifer programme was launched puri and aureli 2005 a number of initiatives contributions and programmes that focused on different aspects of this water resource including agreements have taken place on the global scale wada and heinrich 2013 among the initiatives the second assessment of transboundary rivers lakes and groundwater unece 2011 whymap 2006 the twap transboundary aquifers of the world update 2012 twap 2012 or the taap transboundary aquifer assessment program taap 2013 can be cited this contribution focuses on transboundary aquifers outputs on their management and on policy and social issues worldwide after more than 15 years of experience one important aspect covered herein refers to several aspects agreements on tbas as a result of isarm or existing agreements prior isarm whether they fit the isarm philosophy and the un resolution on tbas where agreements are missing burchi 2018 existing legislation on groundwater and aquifers whether transboundary or not suggest how it may be applied or not and why not to transboundary aquifers a summary of perspectives and a discussion on the next steps per country or per continent and wherever common strategies exist americas europe is presented where they do not exist we make a case of promoting them following international good practices it is also worth mentioning the sustainable development goals towards the 2030 un agenda where sdg6 is intended exclusively for water to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all however for sdg6 to be successful it will require reliable management systems in be put in place which may prove even more difficult to achieve when dealing with transboundary waters our second aim is to synthesise the philosophy behind the management assessment of tbas per continent or large continental regions the idea behind this approach is to assess the context scope and perception of the isarm methodology by different legislations and their associated issues and concerns to that end the paper presents real outputs and outcomes since isarm was launched in 2000 by underlining the science policy and social issues and what has been learned what is still in as per 2017 what is not working and what the next possible steps are 2 isarm outputs and outcomes a number of important outputs and outcomes have emerged around the globe as a result of isarm the most important direct outputs across four continents are described below four regional isarm networks of experts were created to identify map and manage transboundary aquifers isarm europe isarm americas isarm asia and isarm africa a global inventory and a global map of tbas with 592 tbas identified until 2015 of these however more than 50 are defined as groundwater bodies not necessarily tbas as defined by isarm in eu member states this was decided to comply with their water framework directive 2000 60 ec 2000 world financial agencies global environment facility or gef world bank supported isarm activities most notably on studies about some tbas e g guarani nubian novel scientific practices to define transboundary groundwater resources availability e g milk river novel tools and instruments e g grace of the analysis to be done for large scale transboundary aquifers e g northern great plains judith river edwards trinity the drafting of the adoption of the un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers the most relevant direct outcomes are some regional strategies to assess and manage tbas have been prepared worldwide machard de gramont et al 2010 unep 2011 wwap 2012 riob 2013 when preparing their regional strategy of tbas in the americas rivera ed 2015 the isarm americas network was inspired by the un draft articles namely in relation to adopting science based norms for neighboring engagement promoting knowledge protecting groundwater resources in the optimal sustainable development context establishing shared management practices promoting international cooperation and good neighborliness and encouraging the equitable and reasonable utilization of resources alliances among science policy making and society networks to build trust nine years after the draft articles were adopted by unga 2008 there has been no ratification or affirmative vote on the draft articles there is a perception that there is no political will to establish international laws that may prove stronger than multilateral or bilateral agreements and there are concerns about having to cede some riparian rights 3 lessons learned many important lessons were learned during the 15 years of isarm in more than 130 countries 24 for the americas 27 for europe 38 for asia and 45 for africa on four continents 3 1 information one of the most important lessons learned overall was that background information on transboundary aquifers as a key obstacle was missing to establish clear and quantifiable objectives to monitor and manage the groundwater and aquifers that cross international boundaries e g north american countries a recurring theme throughout most transboundary water relationships is the reality and slow realization that we cannot separate waters groundwater from surface water raw from waste quality from quantity or shortage from adequate supply issues 3 2 communication there are important lessons to be learned by hydrogeologists and water managers alike the primary lesson is that as long as hydrogeologists only talk to themselves key elements of the natural and built environment will remain beyond decision makers understanding in general scientists and managers lack sufficient communication a dissemination communication strategy is generally lacking secondly while good cooperation exists among the hydrogeologists who work across their own borders this is insufficient and it is only through relevant cross disciplinary dialogue that essential water resources and everything that follows on from them can be managed for social economic and environmental security this is particularly true for transboundary aquifers 3 3 legal instruments a key lesson that may be drawn from isarm activities relates to the un s adoption of the law of transboundary aquifers which is also a direct outcome of the isarm initiative this is a clear outcome of how hydrogeological science transforms into a global legal instrument this instrument was drafted with the direct involvement of hydrogeologists who had to undertake significant intellectual efforts to establish a solid definition of the key hydrogeological terminology for it to be scientifically correct but legally consistent and to be made legally binding i e direct solid and very fruitful cooperation between hydrogeologists and lawyers the result is a well developed science based legal tool to be used by the world un member states burchi 2018 since then more work is being done to help and support member states in adopting these guidelines some of these new activities involve hydrogeologists supported by the international association of hydrogeologists iah other member states are applying and undertaking the principles of the law of transboundary aquifers independently for more on this aspect readers are referred to the paper by burchi 2018 3 4 non legally binding regional treaties protocols conventions agreements and strategies as for agreements at the world level the scope or meaning has different interpretations for the sharing countries in different regions europe africa and asia some refer to the signed water directives in force e g wfd eu or the signing of international conventions there are very few tbas for which signed agreements exist and these generally take a bilateral form with institutions having quite variable scope and mandates given the concerns and fears of some countries to cede riparian rights there have been many other multilateral or bilateral non binding agreements for cooperation which in some cases are considered to have more strength than legally binding international laws science cooperation between canada and the usa the usa and mexico mali niger and nigeria and others see burchi 2018 the isarm americas group has moved its activities a step further in designing a strategy for the american hemisphere regional strategy for the assessment and management of the transboundary aquifer systems in the americas rivera ed 2015 this regional strategy for the americas is contained in the 4th book of the isarm americas series it is the result of more than 10 years of successful and fruitful collaboration of unesco ihp and the organization of american states oas with members of 24 participating countries in the america hemisphere the strategy adopted the vision of achieving improved sustainable management and protection of transboundary aquifer that goes beyond the boundaries of the participating countries and the mission to increase the generation and exchange of knowledge concerning the transboundary aquifers developing communication pathways cooperation and joint work between participating isarm americas countries the strategy arises from the achievements made through the work by 24 countries within the isarm americas framework which takes into account the information collected in the three previous publications of the isarm americas network where a total of 73 tbas were inventoried as per 2009 unesco 2010 the strategy for the americas was also inspired by the draft articles of the un resolution on the law of transboundary aquifers 3 5 time scale and space scale factors during the 15 years that isarm activities took place the sustainable management of transboundary aquifers concept has been extensively discussed isarm participants and stakeholders discussed various concepts in an effort to reach a consensus on the way forward one of the most acceptable ideas was the fair and equitable sharing of the groundwater resource concept which is also described in the un law of tbas but how effective may that concept be as previously mentioned it is recommended that tbas are used in a sustainable manner however joint management can be complex especially with large tbas e g guarani milk river chad basin thus as has been suggested in the tbas assessment stage the joint management of tbas can also be oriented in principle to their portions of the international border in order to adopt a management plan which aims to prevent or mitigate cross border conflicts a very complex aspect refers to the approach of distributing the available groundwater resources among the countries that share a tba when it comes to distributing a common good it is natural to immediately think about fair equitable distribution but how can one understand this concept when it comes to natural systems which often present wide inequalities or asymmetries in all the involved factors although there is no single answer to that question the following aspects can be considered the area of the tba that corresponds to each country each country s contribution to the total aquifer system recharge the aquifer s hydrogeological characteristics the magnitude of current and future water demands the spatial distribution of their reserves groundwater storage the legal framework for water parties and stakeholders economic and technological ability etc for example can one of the countries that share the tba claim a bigger fraction of the available water resources because it occupies a larger portion of the tba because their water needs are greater because it began uptaking and using water before because it brings a bigger recharge fraction although it may seem logical the solution is not as simple as distributing the available volume equally or proportionally to the surface that corresponds to the tba obviously no general distribution criterion exists which enables each case to be the subject of negotiations among the involved parties which must necessarily rely on technical and scientific knowledge about the system in this context extensive efforts to recognize and accommodate asymmetries in the underlying legal and regulatory frameworks for water management are essential to meet the objectives of the countries that share the aquifer there have been a few cases in which binational research works have addressed institutional asymmetries and established the foundation of genuinely collaborative efforts to acquire share and analyze data information megdal and scott 2011 this brings us to the importance of science data information numerical tools and general scientific knowledge that transboundary aquifers must have for informed based decision making purposes by way of example we briefly discuss the case of the milk river transboundary aquifer shared by canada and the usa the milk river transboundary aquifer mrta forms part of the isarm americas inventory with the official tag isarm 20n the mrta straddles southern alberta canada and northern montana usa and lies in a semi arid region with well documented water shortages pétré et al 2016 the mrta is a confined sandstone aquifer that is a source for municipal water supply and agricultural uses on the canadian side it is also used for water supply to enhance the secondary oil recovery work on the us side of the border it is a transboundary aquifer shared by multi stakeholders in six jurisdictions federal state and municipal usa and federal provincial and municipal canada application of numerical models for aquifer management is not a new undertaking but it is being increasingly applied to tbas szöcs this issue and milk river tba scientific studies of the mrta have developed three models to better understand the nature scales and hydrodynamics of groundwater fluxes of the transboundary aquifer a geological 3d unified model pétré et al 2015 a unified hydrogeological conceptual model pétré et al 2016 and an integrated groundwater flow numerical model pétré et al 2018 these studies allowed a very detailed transboundary delineation of the aquifer with a continuous representation of its hydrostratigraphy across the canada us border as well as a better understanding of the aquifer s regional transboundary dynamics the conceptual model allowed a detailed quantitative understanding of the aquifer system and dynamics with detailed water balances as well as the identification of areas with water deficits furthermore clear regions for internationally shared management strategies were identified as discussed above not all the aquifer s areas have the same dynamics nor the same interests or impacts a map of the aquifer s space and time scale factors for the different mrta stakeholders interests is shown in fig 1 the issue of scale is one of the reasons why some scientists are considering defining groundwater flow systems rather than aquifers as a future quantitative analysis to define groundwater availability which was learned from the guarani and the milk river tbas among others rivera 2017 rivera et al 2017 3 6 global issues 3 6 1 north america two drivers threaten most borderland shared waters the demographic momentum driven by migration and climate change for instance these drivers may increase further floods and more intense droughts to the us mexican border and canada us borders the international boundary and water commission ibwc us mexico has already issued warnings about the eventual impacts of drought on water supplies moreover the international joint commission ijc canada us has issued its triennial assessment report that recommends activities to improve the understanding of groundwater and its connectivity to surface waters in the shared waters of the great lakes basin ijc 2017 the current binational efforts made between the u s and mexico on transboundary aquifers have been limited to the aquifers designated as priority by the u s mexico transboundary aquifer assessment act public law 109 448 centers and institutes in both countries are working to develop joint strategic plans for future work based on lessons learned and relationships built see callegary et al this special issue inspired by the isarm approach and the un resolution on law of transboundary aquifers some of the tabs in these countries have strengthened cooperation along their borders this has been critical to ensure cooperative mechanisms such as new agreements and protocols for information exchange and data sharing and to enhance the development of accurate water policies and water conservation plans for managing aquifers sustainably according to population requirements these efforts establish the basis to apply international water law principles the cooperative process for tbas efforts along the us mx border are well described in callegary et al this issue however studies for some priority aquifers along the us mx border did not form part of isarm because they began after most isarm americas efforts had been made thus in this regional case one of the lessons that can be emphasized is the potential to learn from other studies beyond the isarm process several meetings and workshops across north america have brought together water analysts and officials from the three countries to compare approaches to binational water cooperation these meetings have proved quite useful in scientific water resources assessment with a particular focus on transboundary aquifers on canada us and us mexico borders transboundary water resources policies including legal frameworks mechanisms for cooperation and water rights administration have also been discussed with less tangible outcomes however engaging high level policy makers and government officials in discussions has proved most helpful as they provide a vision for future collaboration including binational water management prospects minute 319 2000 rivera et al 2017 taap 2013 it should be noted however that the tba assessment efforts along the us mx border explicitly specify that the results of scientific studies do not imply anything about binational groundwater management 3 6 2 south america as in other areas of the world two of the most important lessons learned in south america are related with space scales and socio political issues for instance the large guarani aquifer system isarm 21s shared by brazil paraguay uruguay and argentina has undergone extensive hydrogeological assessments in more than a decade of intended shared management by the four countries sharing the same aquifer system being a world reference as to how to manage a tba the guarani aquifer has passed from an inspiration and hope for other tbas to a question mark due to the non entry into force of the guarani aquifer agreement see sindico et al this issue indeed a management agreement for the guarani aquifer system was signed by the four presidents of those countries in 2010 as a joint declaration san juan argentina august 2 2010 agreement on the guarani aquifer argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay acuerdo 2010 for socio political and other reasons explained in sindico et al this issue after 7 years this agreement has not been ratified by brazil and paraguay nonetheless management has continued in some specific areas of the aquifer system in past year despite the non entry of the agreement into force in particular the cities located along the borders of the countries that share the aquifer have continued to jointly manage the natural resource this also reflects the space issue of potential impacts closer to international borders another issue is the precise delineation of a transboundary aquifer that is even larger than the guarani the amazonas transboundary aquifer isarm 28s which is shared by six countries and covers an estimated area of 3 950 000 km2 is this one transboundary aquifer or is it an integration of several aquifers that are located mostly in amazon plains the isarm americas group defined it as a transboundary aquifer system based mostly on the geology of the central and eastern parts of amazon plains and the orinoco province with a unique ecosystem however no hydrogeological studies have been conducted to precisely define whether the whole system can be considered transboundary according to the isarm definition and contex so like other very large tbas the space scale likely is defined on whether or not these are indeed a one transboundary system 3 6 3 europe in europe the extension and size of tbas are generally limited compared to aquifer systems in other parts of the world the complexity of the geology in the region means that some small aquifers have no hydraulic connection and fragmented information which has led to previous inconsistent methodological approaches to map transboundary aquifers unesco ihp 2011 diktas 2012 igrac 2012 bgr unesco 2013 an added difficulty is information collection compiling available information is no easy task most reports come in national languages and internationally available information is very limited about 75 of the population depends on groundwater for water supply but major industrial development takes place for geothermal exploitation purposes transenergy project szőcs this issue countries across the region experience water scarcities to varying degrees mainly those in the dry and irrigation intensive river basins in southern europe and hot spots around urban centers water scarcity often happens in areas with low rainfall which opens a gap between demand and supply particularly in areas with a high population density tourist inflow and intensive agriculture and water demanding industries industrial development large scale mining thermal exploitation and groundwater pollution by agriculture may also deteriorate aquifer quality in terminology terms in eu countries only the water framework directive wfd of groundwater bodies applies 2000 60 ec 2000 the wfd establishes a legal framework and harmonises other eu related legislation eu policy implementation foresees river basin management plans and the definition of groundwater bodies in the rivers district in line with integrated water resources management iwrm according to the eu definition a groundwater body is a coherent subunit in the river basin district to which the environmental objectives of the directive must apply as part of the twap gef groundwater component project the european region was assessed for better harmonization in 2012 unesco ihp 2011 igrac 2012 wwap 2012 in the 27 eu member countries the wfd groundwater bodies have been mainly assessed for eu member states accession countries currently eight countries or within efta four countries the wfd establishes a legal framework and harmonises other eu related legislation eu policy implementation foresees river basin management plans and the definition of groundwater bodies in the rivers district in line with the integrated water resources management approach iwrm to harmonise the implementation of the wfd between member states and accession countries the european water directors have developed a common implementation strategy at the transboundary level the wfd also contemplates establishing transboundary river basin commissions like the international commission for the protection of the rhine river icpdr which also includes groundwater resources governance and management of european tbas are complicated by the fact that limited information on the scope of the agreements exists and whether a common implementation strategy to cover the management plan and measures to be taken have been adopted and if they are available as for agreements 33 of countries have reported ratified agreements the scope or meaning has different interpretations for the countries that share tbas as reported information has indicated some refer to the signed water directives in force e g wfd eu twap or the signing of international conventions very few tbas have prepared signed or ratified agreements the few that exist are generally of a bilateral form the management agreement for upper pannonian thermal aquifer eu24 belgian dutch german lowland aquifer 3 6 4 africa work on tbas in africa has proven to create an impetus for cooperation on groundwater related activities of aquifer sharing countries and can even be a driver for national groundwater management in order to manage issues of transboundary impacts very large units that comprise for example a complete sedimentary basin of more than 100 000 km2 may however not be that useful for management purposes it is practical to define zones of potential transboundary impacts within the tbas based on sound hydrogeological and scientific methods such zoning scale factor will provide a focus to allocate limited resources for groundwater related activities more efficiently seventy two transboundary aquifers have been mapped in africa and are of much importance as they cover about 40 of the continent and also because about 33 of the african population lives on top of these tbas see nijsten et al this issue tba mapping in africa has steadily progressed since the beginning of this century but is far from conclusive the same is true for assessments as information is fragmented and only about 11 tbas have been assessed in detail the joint monitoring and management of tbas are still in their early stages notable exceptions include some six tbas with formalised cooperation mostly in north africa the recent transboundary waters assessment programme twap 2012 has compiled a lot of information that was not previously available nationally which allows tbas to be described in terms of indicators however discrepancies between reported governance arrangements and the formal status of such arrangements indicate that agreements may not be fully internalised increased awareness and the activity of international organisations is noticeable but remains challenging to convert international cooperation into positive impacts locally 3 6 5 asia lack of expertise experience and institutional support in many parts of asia has restricted the cooperation and sustainable management of shared aquifer resources considerable progress has been made but the level of understanding of the shared aquifer systems of asia is limited reliable tbas data are still lacking particularly for developing countries which suggests that continuous efforts are needed to improve knowledge about tbas and to facilitate informant sharing and access to tbas data several countries such as china have endeavoured to cooperate internationally towards shared water resource management by establishing tba institutes as well as creating mutual agreements with neighboring countries these are significant milestones and clear outcomes of isarm a more detailed description is provided in lee et al this issue 4 legislation governance and shared management currently there are two main frameworks or guiding documents that can be used for the shared management and governance of transboundary aquifers the un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers unga 2008 and the un convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes water convention completed in 1999 unwc 2014 a detailed description of the development application relevance and comparison of the two frameworks is provided in lipponen this issue and is not repeated here however legislation is not enough for groundwater governance of transboundary aquifers the application of legislation to tbas is a very complex issue given the many stakeholders involved the level of knowledge and the level of cooperation among stakeholders transboundary water management presents many special challenges to politicians planners administrators and scientists problems that affect water management and water policy implementation include strong cooperation on data information about economic political cultural and social issues and also on geographical issues joint efforts are needed to achieve a common implementation strategy to monitor networks definition standardised data collection information exchange through networking activities guidance documents to assist in implementation and technical reports at the transboundary level furthermore for joint efforts to be practical and efficient all types of data e g socio economic need to be harmonised and joint databases have to be set up for joint information management groundwater governance presents challenges that require many different sets of skills from different fields hydrogeologists lawyers economists water managers anthropologists just to name a few all of these speak very different languages in their own way and often do not make the necessary effort to communicate among others some of these challenges are discussed in the fao global framework for action fao 2015a it has been found that groundwater governance almost everywhere is insufficient with the various key deficiencies as identified in the global diagnostic on groundwater governance fao 2015b to achieve the shared vision 2030 goals the framework for action describes in detail the main urgent actions needed which are 1 creating an adequate basis for governance 2 building effective institutions 3 making essential linkages 4 redirecting finances 5 starting the planning and management process these are described in detail in the global framework for action document fao 2015a in all eu regions legal agreements on cooperation in transboundary water issues have been concluded and operational components in the form of joint commissions have been established while some other agreements are still being prepared the geneva aquifer de los cobos this issue is an example of a full governance and management agreement while a more specific agreement that focuses mainly on geothermal aspects of the tba is the objective of the upper pannonian transboundary aquifer szöcs this issue although the legal basis for cooperation in managing transboundary waters in the pan european region is well developed most existing agreements do not explicitly refer to groundwater or their application to groundwater remains limited thus it is necessary to improve legal frameworks for cooperation and to strengthen institutions for the management and protection of groundwater establishing shared transboundary resource management should imply defining common approaches for data collection and information requirements requirements should focus on meeting the proposed objectives towards a common implementation strategy 5 sustainable development goal 6 towards the 2030 un agenda the un seeks to transform the world with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the adopted 17 sustainable development goals and 169 targets will stimulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet of the 17 sustainable development goals of the un for 2030 the sixth sustainable development goal sdg6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is exclusively designed for water and covers a 15 year time span to achieve and maintain universal access to water however reliable management systems need to be put into place for sdg6 to be successful an sdg subcategory sdg6 5 may even be more difficult to achieve as it deals with transboundary waters while isarm has been underway for 15 years tba related institutions that work on managing transboundary aquifers have been even scarcer than any other water related institutions in the next 15 years sdgs are expected to act as a major target for the efforts of the practitioners who deal with transboundary waters and national aquifers it is anticipated that some consultation mechanisms will become operational and will provide a new paradigm for bi and multi lateral engagement between countries whose outcome would improve socio economic development and if not a reversal of aquifer degradation then at least a stabilization the goal on water and sanitation for the 2030 agenda has recognized that the sector at large would require a coherent monitoring framework with improved data collection and analysis to cover the whole water cycle to meet this need seven un agencies joined forces under the un water umbrella to develop the integrated monitoring of water and sanitation related sdg targets initiative by integrating and extending existing monitoring efforts draft methodologies for all the global sdg 6 indicators have been developed starting in april 2016 methodologies were introduced into six countries for in depth pilot testing purposes based on learning from pilot testing and the broader review the methodologies were revised by the end of 2016 and will follow a global implementation that started in 2017 by 2018 a global baseline for sdg 6 target 6 5 indicator 6 5 2 should be available this indicator is designed by unesco ihp for transboundary aquifers unece and unesco 2017 6 summary and conclusions what is next this paper synthesizes more than 15 years of experiences of the internationally shared aquifer resources management initiative isarm from 2000 to 2015 outputs and outcomes we discuss the lessons learned from isarm as well as the status and perspectives for the future the conclusions and recommendations are based mainly on the chapters on the special issue but themes issues are laid out from other stories of transboundary aquifers tbas in the world that are not presented in the special issue many analyses have indicated a future of the institutionalized transboundary aquifer cooperation distilled from analyzing experience so far as also indicated by some of the other contributions made to this special issue bringing together science society law and policy making and harmonising information important drivers and impacts will act as guidance for further tbas assessments sharing a common groundwater resource requires all the parties involved to collaborate in a coordinated and excellent way to ensure the sustainable use and protection of the resource the best way to protect and manage transboundary aquifers is through close international cooperation among all the countries involved in tbas by bringing together all interests one of the most important lessons learned with tbas is that related with the scale issue as a result of assessing some of the largest transboundary aquifers guarani milk river some scientists are considering parsing out groundwater flow systems rather than aquifers boundaries as a future quantitative analysis to define groundwater availability along the borderlines of tbas this is a very important outcome of isarm it is a matter of scales to accommodate tba related issues other than only science tbas require social political economic and environmental factors in addition to science hydrogeology other relevant conclusions open questions and recommendations are in the pan european region a long standing history of inventories and documentation of evolution demonstrates the gradual refinement of information and also the interplay of scientific knowledge advancement and fluctuating political recognition on tbas should we re direct isarm driven by policy social environmental economic issues what can science do can groundwater science do it alone how can science interact with policy makers and social impacts how should a science policy interface be implemented is isarm still needed these and many other similar questions were asked from stakeholders around the world during the isarm continental surveys clearly a paradigm shift is emerging from the science for science sake towards more integrated issue driven science based socio political partnerships groundwater science and technology for tbas should be embedded in a larger socio economic and political system for international stability trust among the countries that share tbas is essential to promote effective cooperation and to exchange information for shared management in this sense the process developed by isarm americas for over 15 years has successfully obtained tangible results four books plus a strong network of national experts the international legal instruments in the americas are still incipient the only agreement on integrated transboundary aquifers in south america is about the management of the guarani aquifer system joint declaration san juan argentina august 2 2010 agreement on the guarani aquifer argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay acuerdo 2010 the isarm process is slow and difficult but stakeholders across continents are reducing and balancing the cooperative gap among science society and policy making a very positive and perhaps a model to follow is the genevese transboundary aquifer switzerland france of 40 years of peaceful and successful shared management the unesco ihp isarm remains one of the key dedicated global drivers for the continued understanding assessment and strengthening of inter country collaboration of transboundary aquifers acknowledgement of their efforts is mentioned in puri and aureli s paper this special issue as discussed in detailed by puri and aureli and by burchi 2018 the most critical part of the whole equation is the institutionalization of the process this part remains a conundrum since there is no ideal single format for such a body and their design has to be adopted on a case by case basis nine years after adopting the first draft articles there is a perception that there is no will to establish international laws that may have be stronger than multilateral or bilateral agreements and there are concerns about having to cede some riparian rights recently during the adoption of the third round of discussions on the law of tbas at the united nations general assembly unga 2016 a speaker told the sixth committee that while management of transboundary aquifers is critical for the success of the un 2030 agenda the draft articles must be tailored to each state detailed studies of tbas have high costs most developing countries face other basic priorities as their society have bare any public investment capacity in general there are no conflicts among the countries that share tbas however some conflicts have arisen which could increase in the tbas of north america where competition for groundwater resources is much more obvious and prominent e g mexico u s knowledge cooperation and exchange has been crucial to prevent conflicts regular tbas assessments are needed building a sustainable coalition within regions may require building a community platform to establish links among the researchers practitioners policy makers and stakeholders involved with tbas initiatives regular assessments will ensure up to date aquifer information which is implied by the concept of integrated water resources management at the transboundary level and the assessments of possible trends and the definition of new information needs by taking into account the needs of the interest groups involved in the process building a participatory infrastructure is considered a very important condition for successful future assessments policy responses reflect times of global change and uncertainties which depend on a good information b a good information dissemination c a good understanding of that information political legal agreements are issue driven and environmental concerns are low down in political agendas but social pressures and science push are changing this scenario the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers have become a reference for tbas and are still relevant but are perceived only as guidelines and for influence as a final remark we should wonder why we continue to pay attention to transboundary aquifers fifteen years of isarm clearly show that this is mainly to build trust and to avoid conflict any conflict social political economic environmental even human confrontations conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the ongoing support of unesco and the corresponding isarm teams from the americas and europe the geological survey of canada and

8467,study region africa latin america europe study focus through the extensive study and mapping of the world s aquifers that lie astride the international boundary lines of sovereign states isarm has awakened concerned states to the existence of aquifers stretching beyond their borders and precipitated cooperation in generating a body of knowledge that facilitated cooperation in governance arrangements for such aquifers in parallel isarm influenced the shape and direction of the united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers appended to un resolution 63 124 of 2008 both stimulated cooperation among concerned states and provided a frame of reference for the legal grounding of such cooperation in aquifer specific agreements new hydrological insights through this synergistic paradigm isarm has made an impact on the shape and direction of cooperation in the guaraní aquifer in south america and in the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas in the sahel region of africa it is having an influence on the shape and direction of cooperation being negotiated on the stampriet aquifer system in southern africa and on the ocotepeque citalá aquifer in central america the link of isarm to other international aquifer agreements on record is tenuous and isarm s influence on their generation speculative the visibility of isarm has faded since 2012 however its legacy is lasting keywords international aquifers international aquifers agreements international groundwater law un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers 1 introduction the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm joint initiative of unesco ihp un fao and the international association of hydrogeologists iah traces its origins back to the ministerial declaration of the hague on water security in the 21 st century march 2000 it has had from inception a multidisciplinary and multidimensional breadth of scope mirroring the multi faceted dimensions of the management of transboundary aquifers also from the start the governance cum legal dimension has featured prominently on isarm s radar screen and scope of activities aimed at generating policy relevant pointers for countries to stimulate cooperation in the governance of transboundary aquifers unesco ihp et al 2001 in this particular respect isarm which had become a steady feature of unesco ihp s programme from 2000 to 2012 1 1 see council resolutions xiv 12 2000 xix 9 2010 and xx 3 2012 all of which are dedicated to isarm no further unesco ihp council resolution on isarm is on record the knowledge generation and aquifer mapping thrust of isarm continued through the groundwater component of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap funded by the global environment facility and executed as regards groundwater by unesco ihp twap was active from 2010 through 2016 has yielded a mix of one discrete normative result at the global level and diffuse results at the ground level of specific countries in the area of the governance of transboundary aquifers shared by sovereign states across international boundary lines arguably this has been a direct spinoff of the extensive and successful knowledge generation and mapping of the internationally shared transboundary aquifers of the world conducted under isarm auspices over the years 2001 2010 and after that under the umbrella of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap with the support technical and financial of the international community puri and villholth 2018 rivera and candela 2018 starting from a brief overview of the admittedly few international transboundary aquifer agreements on record from the analysis of the chief global scale normative instrument also on record in the matter and taking also on board the role of groundwater in international river lake basin governance arrangements this chapter will seek to un pack the influence isarm may have had in all three respects some final considerations will be made regarding the foreseeable future direction if isarm in relation to the governance dimension of inter state cooperation in regard to international transboundary aquifers it bears emphasizing at the outset that only agreements and other comparable legal instruments made by sovereign states regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride an international boundary line are canvassed in this chapter agreements and other comparable legal instruments made by a sub national entities regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride an international boundary line and b states or provinces of federal countries regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride inter state or inter provincial boundary lines are outside the reach of this chapter as neither kind of transboundary aquifers has been embraced by isarm as implied by its very name of internationally shared aquifer resources management emphasis added isarm has consistently addressed itself to sovereign states and to the transboundary aquifers they have in common across international boundary lines to the exclusion of the other two transboundary aquifer types mentioned earlier 2 agreements regarding international aquifers the agreements on record regarding aquifers which straddle the international boundary lines of states are the following in chronological order the agreement first made in 1977 then re negotiated in 2007 by france and switzerland on the genevese aquifer three agreements on the nubian sandstone aquifer system made in 1992 and 2000 by chad egypt libya and sudan the agreement technically minutes of meetings and joint ministerial declarations for the establishment of a tri lateral consultative arrangement for the north western sahara aquifer system made by algeria libya and tunisia in the period 2002 2008 the agreement technically a memorandum of understanding made in 2009 by mali niger and nigeria for the establishment of a tri lateral consultative arrangement for the iullemeden aquifer system ias the agreement is not in force yet however it is due for replacement by a later agreement also technically a memorandum of understanding made in 2014 by algeria benin burkina faso mali mauritania niger and nigeria for the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas for the establishment of a comparable multi partite consultative mechanism for the itas this later agreement however is not yet in effect pending the signature of three of the parties the agreement on the guarani aquifer made in 2010 by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay and the agreement on the al sag al disi aquifer made in 2015 by jordan and saudi arabia the genevese aquifer agreement made in 1977 and re negotiated in 2007 for a period of thirty years is a complex instrument covering controlled groundwater extractions controlled artificial aquifer recharge operations pollution control and the apportionment of all relevant costs the permanent bi lateral commission in place since 1978 for the administration and implementation of the obligations of the parties has been confirmed by the 2007 agreement de los cobos 2018 the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas agreements provide for a joint authority of country representatives 1992 agreement and rules for monitoring and exchange of groundwater information and for monitoring and data sharing respectively 2000 agreements the joint authority is mandated to collaborate and develop co operative activities for the sustainable and mutually beneficial development of the aquifer including monitoring groundwater withdrawals and levels by the other two agreements the nsas countries undertook to monitor and share among them certain data and to feed them to a shared regional information system naris with a view to keeping the latter up to date mechlem 2012 the north western sahara aquifer system known as sass after its acronym in french shared by algeria libya and tunisia is governed by a tri lateral consultative mechanism mécanisme de concertation made up initially of country focal points and a coordination unit headed by a coordinator the mechanism was contemplated in minutes of a meeting of the three countries held in rome italy in december 2002 and became operational gradually in 2006 a council of water ministers and a permanent technical committee were added to the initial structure of the mechanism and national committees replaced the original national focal points by a joint declaration of the water ministers of the three countries the mechanism is tasked with managing the aquifer model monitoring the aquifer promoting and conducting joint studies and reporting to the member governments on the state of the aquifer a protocol was drafted in 2015 with a view to grounding on a definitive legal basis the member countries commitment to cooperation taibi 2017 the 2009 iullemeden aquifer system ias agreement not in force provides for a consultative mechanism to promote cooperation among mali niger and nigeria with a view to in particular jointly identifying the risks to which the aquifer system and its resources are exposed facilitating the cooperative management of such risks and the sustainable development of the ias resources and promoting the integrated management of groundwater resources in the aquifer in contrast to the lean consultative mechanism for the sass that for the ias has an elaborate internal structure consisting of a council of ministers an ad hoc technical committee of experts a national technical and scientific committee for each member country and an executive secretariat in addition and as a complement the ias parties have also committed to taking into consideration a number of substantive and procedural principles i e the equitable and reasonable use of the water resources of the aquifer the duty not to cause significant cross border damage public participation in the development and implementation of decisions precaution polluter pays user pays prior notification of planned measures likely to have adverse effects on other member states and data and information exchange mechlem 2012 the 2009 agreement is due for replacement by a subsequent agreement made in 2014 by virtue of which a coverage of the prior agreement is expanded from the ias to the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas with the consequential increase in the number of states party from the original three to seven and b the environment support function of groundwater comes within sharper focus the new agreement also c adds a coordination unit and a permanent scientific and technical committee of country representatives to the structure of the consultative mechanism and d re casts and elaborates on the substantive and procedural obligations of the parties to the 2009 ias agreement to date the 2014 agreement is awaiting the endorsement of a few of the seven states party eckstein 2017 the agreement on the guarani aquifer made in 2010 by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay is a fremework type instrument setting forth a number of general obligations patterned after the basic principles of customary international water law i e the reasonable and equitable utilization of the aquifer resources the duty not to cause significant transboundary harm the duty of prior notification of planned activities and projects and the correlated duty to exchange information and data a commission of country representatives is provided for to coordinate cooperation concerning the aquifer sindico 2017 sindico et al 2018 amore 2018 the agreement has been ratified by all four countries last by paraguay in april 2018 and is due to come into effect in the course of 2018 by the 2015 al sag al disi aquifer agreement jordan and saudi arabia have agreed to place a five year moratorium on all extractions of groundwater from a restricted protected area and to regulate well drilling and the injection of pollutants in a permitted management area the parties also agreed on the dedication of extracted groundwater from the management area to domestic use to the exclusion of all other uses a joint technical committee of country representatives oversees the implementation of the agreement eckstein 2015 reportedly however the committee has never met to date personal communication 3 international standards and norms of inter state behaviour regarding transboundary aquifers lying astride international boundary lines to one degree or another all the international transboundary groundwater agreements reviewed above substantially adhere to and bear evidence of some basic international standards of state behaviour as regards transboundary aquifers that lie astride international boundary lines these standards are cast in a handful soft law instruments i e non binding documents crystallizing the practice of states the most notable such aquifer specific instruments are the united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers appended to un resolution 63 124 of 11 december 2008 unga 2008 and the model provisions on transboundary groundwaters 2012 made under the umbrella of the 1992 un economic commission for europe unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece 2012 although neither is legally binding both carry a few core rules of state behaviour commonly known as rules of customary international water law which are legally binding and can be traced if only by implication in all the agreements reviewed earlier these core legally binding rules of state behaviour as regards international transboundary aquifers crystallized in the two above mentioned instruments are the right of states to a reasonable and equitable share in the uses of transboundary groundwater and aquifers the duty of states not to inflict significant harm across the international border through its own actions or through those of its subjects the duty of states to exchange information and data the duty of states to provide prior notification of planned measures likely to have a cross border impact on neighbouring aquifer states these rights and obligations all fall under a more general obligation of cooperation also crystallized in the two instruments above mentioned as a separate obligation in the draft articles as well as in the model provisions mentioned earlier these core legally binding rules of state behaviour are complemented by norms about the recharge and discharge areas of aquifers uses of aquifers other than the extraction of groundwater the interface and interactions of land and the sub surface space with groundwater and aquifers the ecosystem support function of aquifers and joint institutional arrangements non recharging also known as fossil aquifers receive indirect attention in the draft articles through equitable and reasonable utilization norms aimed at maximizing the useful lifespan of aquifers in general arguably maximization resonates with in particular the peculiar circumstances of non recharging aquifers and with concern for their exposure to being mined to the detriment of the aquifers useful lifespan it bears re emphasizing however that these norms of state behaviour are not binding and as a result have an aspirational value and a moral weight only nonetheless the authoritativeness of the source of the two instruments lends such moral weight a persuasiveness not to be under estimated unesco ihp 2009 stephan 2011 eckstein 2017 4 groundwater in river lake basin agreements and organizations another modality of inter state engagement regarding aquifers that lie astride international boundary lines is though the inclusion of groundwater in agreements on transboundary surface waters or river lake basins whereby the commitments made in regard to surface waters or river lake basins automatically extend to linked transboundary groundwater aquifers examples abound ranging from the river danube convention 1994 to the rhine protection convention 1998 in europe and from the lake tanganyika convention 2003 to the lake victoria protocol 2003 in africa among others invariably however groundwater generally features in all surfacewater treaties almost as an afterthought and has junior status to surfacewater lately purposeful attention is being directed to groundwater underlying international transboundary river or lake basins within the existing framework of treaties agreements and joint commissions established for such transboundary surfacewater basins notable examples are the senegal river and lake chad in africa where with assistance from the international donor community the relevant basin organizations are casting their net wider by looking to the aquifers underlying the respective basins 2 2 the senegal river basin development organization omvs and the lake chad basin commission will be beneficiaries of the project strengthening the institutional capacity of the african network of basin organizations anbo contributing to the transboundary water governance in africa funded by the global environment facility gef and executed by unesco personal communication the relevant project document was signed in october 2017 the chief goal of the project is to improve transboundary water governance in africa a related goal is to build the capacity of selected river lake basin organizations to deal with transboundary groundwater project document para 50 on p 22 another notable example is the stampriet aquifer system shared by botswana namibia and south africa under the auspices of unesco ihp attention to the specific management challenges the aquifer will face has made its way and found a home in an existing river basin organization i e the orange senqu river commission orasecom formed under a 2000 agreement by the three stampriet states plus lesotho nesting of the stampriet aquifer in orasecom has been anchored legally in orasecom s implied mandate for transboundary groundwater in the basin in general and has been effected by homing the stampriet aquifer in the internal structure of orasecom and in particular in the groundwater hydrology committee of the technical task team which is one of four standing task teams operating under the council orasecom 2017 a similar story may unfold in central america also under unesco ihp auspices regarding in particular the ocotepeque citalá aquifer shared by el salvador and honduras there under the influence of a strong tradition of locally based water governance in general leveraging the existing local level governance arrangement for the overlying lempa river basin i e the tri national lempa river assocation of municipalities mancomunidid tri nacional río lempa grouping a number of contiguous municipalities in el salvador and honduras in addition also to guatemala as a co basin state of the lempa river basin is a course of action available to anchor governance arrangements for the shared bi national aquifer unesco ihp 2016 the a symmetry in the number of states overlying the two aquifers relative to the larger number of states sharing the overlying river basin is a noteworthy feature of transboundary governance arrangements for both the stampriet and the ocotepeque citalá aquifers whereas such a symmetry appears not to have played a role in the orasecom s council decisison to accommodate the tri party stampriet aquifer in the fold of the four party orange senqu river basin commission the effect of such a symmentry on the further course of governance arrangements being negotiated for the ocotepeque citalá aquifer in central america remains to be seen 5 links between contemporary state practice regarding international transboundary aquifers and isarm while it is difficult if not impossible to trace specific agreements on record to isarm s legal thinking and approach to the issue of transboundary aquifer cooperation among sovereign states it is plausible that the extensive and successful knowledge generation and mapping exercise of the world s international transboundary aquifers carried out under isarm auspices has awakened states to a the existence of aquifers under their territory that stretch beyond the international boundary lines with neighbouring states and b the desirability of and opportunities for institutionalized forms of cooperation across such lines the conceptualization and crafting by the un international law commission with the help of isarm see further on in this section of the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers that went on in parallel to the knowledge generation cum mapping exercise of international transboundary aquifers of the world showed the way forward regarding the legal grounding of cooperation the two processes global scale mapping and delineating a global scale legal framework for cooperation both driven by isarm s philosophy have acted as a fuse igniting cooperation in at least two instances this paradigm of mutually re inforcing synergies has clearly been at work in the guaraní aquifer where cooperation among the four aquifer countries was informed and inspired by the scientific investigations and mapping of the aquifer and its characteristics initiated under isarm auspices and subsequently refined with the assistance of the international donor community the knowledge and awareness thus generated inspired and informed the negotiations that eventually resulted in the crafting and signing of the guaraní aquifer agreement in 2010 in turn this was strongly inspired by the work of the un international law commission and the draft articles sindico 2017 a similar paradigm has been at work in the iullemeden and taoudeni

premble as a source of inspiration for the respective agreement a similar story is unfolding in the stampriet and the ocotepeque citalá aquifers where the initial world scale aquifer mapping carried out by unesco ihp under the auspices of isarm prompted the attention of the relevant countries and the detailed aquifer studies which ensued with the assistance of unesco ihp and the swiss government have paved the way for the transboundary governance arrangements being negotiated described earlier while by contrast to the guaraní and the itas instruments the transboundary governance arrangements for the stampriet and the ocotepeque citalá aquifers bear no visible connection to the un draft articles still both kinds of arrangements can be traced back to the spirit of the draft articles it is

8467,study region africa latin america europe study focus through the extensive study and mapping of the world s aquifers that lie astride the international boundary lines of sovereign states isarm has awakened concerned states to the existence of aquifers stretching beyond their borders and precipitated cooperation in generating a body of knowledge that facilitated cooperation in governance arrangements for such aquifers in parallel isarm influenced the shape and direction of the united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers appended to un resolution 63 124 of 2008 both stimulated cooperation among concerned states and provided a frame of reference for the legal grounding of such cooperation in aquifer specific agreements new hydrological insights through this synergistic paradigm isarm has made an impact on the shape and direction of cooperation in the guaraní aquifer in south america and in the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas in the sahel region of africa it is having an influence on the shape and direction of cooperation being negotiated on the stampriet aquifer system in southern africa and on the ocotepeque citalá aquifer in central america the link of isarm to other international aquifer agreements on record is tenuous and isarm s influence on their generation speculative the visibility of isarm has faded since 2012 however its legacy is lasting keywords international aquifers international aquifers agreements international groundwater law un draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers 1 introduction the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm joint initiative of unesco ihp un fao and the international association of hydrogeologists iah traces its origins back to the ministerial declaration of the hague on water security in the 21 st century march 2000 it has had from inception a multidisciplinary and multidimensional breadth of scope mirroring the multi faceted dimensions of the management of transboundary aquifers also from the start the governance cum legal dimension has featured prominently on isarm s radar screen and scope of activities aimed at generating policy relevant pointers for countries to stimulate cooperation in the governance of transboundary aquifers unesco ihp et al 2001 in this particular respect isarm which had become a steady feature of unesco ihp s programme from 2000 to 2012 1 1 see council resolutions xiv 12 2000 xix 9 2010 and xx 3 2012 all of which are dedicated to isarm no further unesco ihp council resolution on isarm is on record the knowledge generation and aquifer mapping thrust of isarm continued through the groundwater component of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap funded by the global environment facility and executed as regards groundwater by unesco ihp twap was active from 2010 through 2016 has yielded a mix of one discrete normative result at the global level and diffuse results at the ground level of specific countries in the area of the governance of transboundary aquifers shared by sovereign states across international boundary lines arguably this has been a direct spinoff of the extensive and successful knowledge generation and mapping of the internationally shared transboundary aquifers of the world conducted under isarm auspices over the years 2001 2010 and after that under the umbrella of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap with the support technical and financial of the international community puri and villholth 2018 rivera and candela 2018 starting from a brief overview of the admittedly few international transboundary aquifer agreements on record from the analysis of the chief global scale normative instrument also on record in the matter and taking also on board the role of groundwater in international river lake basin governance arrangements this chapter will seek to un pack the influence isarm may have had in all three respects some final considerations will be made regarding the foreseeable future direction if isarm in relation to the governance dimension of inter state cooperation in regard to international transboundary aquifers it bears emphasizing at the outset that only agreements and other comparable legal instruments made by sovereign states regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride an international boundary line are canvassed in this chapter agreements and other comparable legal instruments made by a sub national entities regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride an international boundary line and b states or provinces of federal countries regarding transboundary aquifers that lie astride inter state or inter provincial boundary lines are outside the reach of this chapter as neither kind of transboundary aquifers has been embraced by isarm as implied by its very name of internationally shared aquifer resources management emphasis added isarm has consistently addressed itself to sovereign states and to the transboundary aquifers they have in common across international boundary lines to the exclusion of the other two transboundary aquifer types mentioned earlier 2 agreements regarding international aquifers the agreements on record regarding aquifers which straddle the international boundary lines of states are the following in chronological order the agreement first made in 1977 then re negotiated in 2007 by france and switzerland on the genevese aquifer three agreements on the nubian sandstone aquifer system made in 1992 and 2000 by chad egypt libya and sudan the agreement technically minutes of meetings and joint ministerial declarations for the establishment of a tri lateral consultative arrangement for the north western sahara aquifer system made by algeria libya and tunisia in the period 2002 2008 the agreement technically a memorandum of understanding made in 2009 by mali niger and nigeria for the establishment of a tri lateral consultative arrangement for the iullemeden aquifer system ias the agreement is not in force yet however it is due for replacement by a later agreement also technically a memorandum of understanding made in 2014 by algeria benin burkina faso mali mauritania niger and nigeria for the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas for the establishment of a comparable multi partite consultative mechanism for the itas this later agreement however is not yet in effect pending the signature of three of the parties the agreement on the guarani aquifer made in 2010 by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay and the agreement on the al sag al disi aquifer made in 2015 by jordan and saudi arabia the genevese aquifer agreement made in 1977 and re negotiated in 2007 for a period of thirty years is a complex instrument covering controlled groundwater extractions controlled artificial aquifer recharge operations pollution control and the apportionment of all relevant costs the permanent bi lateral commission in place since 1978 for the administration and implementation of the obligations of the parties has been confirmed by the 2007 agreement de los cobos 2018 the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas agreements provide for a joint authority of country representatives 1992 agreement and rules for monitoring and exchange of groundwater information and for monitoring and data sharing respectively 2000 agreements the joint authority is mandated to collaborate and develop co operative activities for the sustainable and mutually beneficial development of the aquifer including monitoring groundwater withdrawals and levels by the other two agreements the nsas countries undertook to monitor and share among them certain data and to feed them to a shared regional information system naris with a view to keeping the latter up to date mechlem 2012 the north western sahara aquifer system known as sass after its acronym in french shared by algeria libya and tunisia is governed by a tri lateral consultative mechanism mécanisme de concertation made up initially of country focal points and a coordination unit headed by a coordinator the mechanism was contemplated in minutes of a meeting of the three countries held in rome italy in december 2002 and became operational gradually in 2006 a council of water ministers and a permanent technical committee were added to the initial structure of the mechanism and national committees replaced the original national focal points by a joint declaration of the water ministers of the three countries the mechanism is tasked with managing the aquifer model monitoring the aquifer promoting and conducting joint studies and reporting to the member governments on the state of the aquifer a protocol was drafted in 2015 with a view to grounding on a definitive legal basis the member countries commitment to cooperation taibi 2017 the 2009 iullemeden aquifer system ias agreement not in force provides for a consultative mechanism to promote cooperation among mali niger and nigeria with a view to in particular jointly identifying the risks to which the aquifer system and its resources are exposed facilitating the cooperative management of such risks and the sustainable development of the ias resources and promoting the integrated management of groundwater resources in the aquifer in contrast to the lean consultative mechanism for the sass that for the ias has an elaborate internal structure consisting of a council of ministers an ad hoc technical committee of experts a national technical and scientific committee for each member country and an executive secretariat in addition and as a complement the ias parties have also committed to taking into consideration a number of substantive and procedural principles i e the equitable and reasonable use of the water resources of the aquifer the duty not to cause significant cross border damage public participation in the development and implementation of decisions precaution polluter pays user pays prior notification of planned measures likely to have adverse effects on other member states and data and information exchange mechlem 2012 the 2009 agreement is due for replacement by a subsequent agreement made in 2014 by virtue of which a coverage of the prior agreement is expanded from the ias to the iullemeden and taoudeni tanezrouft aquifer systems itas with the consequential increase in the number of states party from the original three to seven and b the environment support function of groundwater comes within sharper focus the new agreement also c adds a coordination unit and a permanent scientific and technical committee of country representatives to the structure of the consultative mechanism and d re casts and elaborates on the substantive and procedural obligations of the parties to the 2009 ias agreement to date the 2014 agreement is awaiting the endorsement of a few of the seven states party eckstein 2017 the agreement on the guarani aquifer made in 2010 by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay is a fremework type instrument setting forth a number of general obligations patterned after the basic principles of customary international water law i e the reasonable and equitable utilization of the aquifer resources the duty not to cause significant transboundary harm the duty of prior notification of planned activities and projects and the correlated duty to exchange information and data a commission of country representatives is provided for to coordinate cooperation concerning the aquifer sindico 2017 sindico et al 2018 amore 2018 the agreement has been ratified by all four countries last by paraguay in april 2018 and is due to come into effect in the course of 2018 by the 2015 al sag al disi aquifer agreement jordan and saudi arabia have agreed to place a five year moratorium on all extractions of groundwater from a restricted protected area and to regulate well drilling and the injection of pollutants in a permitted management area the parties also agreed on the dedication of extracted groundwater from the management area to domestic use to the exclusion of all other uses a joint technical committee of country representatives oversees the implementation of the agreement eckstein 2015 reportedly however the committee has never met to date personal communication 3 international standards and norms of inter state behaviour regarding transboundary aquifers lying astride international boundary lines to one degree or another all the international transboundary groundwater agreements reviewed above substantially adhere to and bear evidence of some basic international standards of state behaviour as regards transboundary aquifers that lie astride international boundary lines these standards are cast in a handful soft law instruments i e non binding documents crystallizing the practice of states the most notable such aquifer specific instruments are the united nations draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers appended to un resolution 63 124 of 11 december 2008 unga 2008 and the model provisions on transboundary groundwaters 2012 made under the umbrella of the 1992 un economic commission for europe unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece 2012 although neither is legally binding both carry a few core rules of state behaviour commonly known as rules of customary international water law which are legally binding and can be traced if only by implication in all the agreements reviewed earlier these core legally binding rules of state behaviour as regards international transboundary aquifers crystallized in the two above mentioned instruments are the right of states to a reasonable and equitable share in the uses of transboundary groundwater and aquifers the duty of states not to inflict significant harm across the international border through its own actions or through those of its subjects the duty of states to exchange information and data the duty of states to provide prior notification of planned measures likely to have a cross border impact on neighbouring aquifer states these rights and obligations all fall under a more general obligation of cooperation also crystallized in the two instruments above mentioned as a separate obligation in the draft articles as well as in the model provisions mentioned earlier these core legally binding rules of state behaviour are complemented by norms about the recharge and discharge areas of aquifers uses of aquifers other than the extraction of groundwater the interface and interactions of land and the sub surface space with groundwater and aquifers the ecosystem support function of aquifers and joint institutional arrangements non recharging also known as fossil aquifers receive indirect attention in the draft articles through equitable and reasonable utilization norms aimed at maximizing the useful lifespan of aquifers in general arguably maximization resonates with in particular the peculiar circumstances of non recharging aquifers and with concern for their exposure to being mined to the detriment of the aquifers useful lifespan it bears re emphasizing however that these norms of state behaviour are not binding and as a result have an aspirational value and a moral weight only nonetheless the authoritativeness of the source of the two instruments lends such moral weight a persuasiveness not to be under estimated unesco ihp 2009 stephan 2011 eckstein 2017 4 groundwater in river lake basin agreements and organizations another modality of inter state engagement regarding aquifers that lie astride international boundary lines is though the inclusion of groundwater in agreements on transboundary surface waters or river lake basins whereby the commitments made in regard to surface waters or river lake basins automatically extend to linked transboundary groundwater aquifers examples abound ranging from the river danube convention 1994 to the rhine protection convention 1998 in europe and from the lake tanganyika convention 2003 to the lake victoria protocol 2003 in africa among others invariably however groundwater generally features in all surfacewater treaties almost as an afterthought and has junior status to surfacewater lately purposeful attention is being directed to groundwater underlying international transboundary river or lake basins within the existing framework of treaties agreements and joint commissions established for such transboundary surfacewater basins notable examples are the senegal river and lake chad in africa where with assistance from the international donor community the relevant basin organizations are casting their net wider by looking to the aquifers underlying the respective basins 2 2 the senegal river basin development organization omvs and the lake chad basin commission will be beneficiaries of the project strengthening the institutional capacity of the african network of basin organizations anbo contributing to the transboundary water governance in africa funded by the global environment facility gef and executed by unesco personal communication the relevant project document was signed in october 2017 the chief goal of the project is to improve transboundary water governance in africa a related goal is to build the capacity of selected river lake basin organizations to deal with transboundary groundwater project document para 50 on p 22 another notable example is the stampriet aquifer system shared by botswana namibia and south africa under the auspices of unesco ihp attention to the specific management challenges the aquifer will face has made its way and found a home in an existing river basin organization i e the orange senqu river commission orasecom formed under a 2000 agreement by the three stampriet states plus lesotho nesting of the stampriet aquifer in orasecom has been anchored legally in orasecom s implied mandate for transboundary groundwater in the basin in general and has been effected by homing the stampriet aquifer in the internal structure of orasecom and in particular in the groundwater hydrology committee of the technical task team which is one of four standing task teams operating under the council orasecom 2017 a similar story may unfold in central america also under unesco ihp auspices regarding in particular the ocotepeque citalá aquifer shared by el salvador and honduras there under the influence of a strong tradition of locally based water governance in general leveraging the existing local level governance arrangement for the overlying lempa river basin i e the tri national lempa river assocation of municipalities mancomunidid tri nacional río lempa grouping a number of contiguous municipalities in el salvador and honduras in addition also to guatemala as a co basin state of the lempa river basin is a course of action available to anchor governance arrangements for the shared bi national aquifer unesco ihp 2016 the a symmetry in the number of states overlying the two aquifers relative to the larger number of states sharing the overlying river basin is a noteworthy feature of transboundary governance arrangements for both the stampriet and the ocotepeque citalá aquifers whereas such a symmetry appears not to have played a role in the orasecom s council decisison to accommodate the tri party stampriet aquifer in the fold of the four party orange senqu river basin commission the effect of such a symmentry on the further course of governance arrangements being negotiated for the ocotepeque citalá aquifer in central america remains to be seen 5 links between contemporary state practice regarding international transboundary aquifers and isarm while it is difficult if not impossible to trace specific agreements on record to isarm s legal thinking and approach to the issue of transboundary aquifer cooperation among sovereign states it is plausible that the extensive and successful knowledge generation and mapping exercise of the world s international transboundary aquifers carried out under isarm auspices has awakened states to a the existence of aquifers under their territory that stretch beyond the international boundary lines with neighbouring states and b the desirability of and opportunities for institutionalized forms of cooperation across such lines the conceptualization and crafting by the un international law commission with the help of isarm see further on in this section of the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers that went on in parallel to the knowledge generation cum mapping exercise of international transboundary aquifers of the world showed the way forward regarding the legal grounding of cooperation the two processes global scale mapping and delineating a global scale legal framework for cooperation both driven by isarm s philosophy have acted as a fuse igniting cooperation in at least two instances this paradigm of mutually re inforcing synergies has clearly been at work in the guaraní aquifer where cooperation among the four aquifer countries was informed and inspired by the scientific investigations and mapping of the aquifer and its characteristics initiated under isarm auspices and subsequently refined with the assistance of the

provides a buffer in times of drought that can be developed for local use at relatively low cost masiyandima and giordano 2007 in many parts of africa groundwater is the only reliable source of water up to 75 of the population of africa uses groundwater as the main drinking water source uneca et al 2000 and groundwater is important for rural livelihoods livestock rearing and urban water supply villholth 2013 foster et al 2008 as pressures on groundwater resources increase with economic development population growth and climate change it is increasingly important to understand the potential and management practices of transboundary aquifer resources cooperation for the development and management of transboundary aquifer tba resources started in the 1970s in northern africa presently seventy two tbas have been identified on mainland africa igrac and unesco ihp 2015a the island states of africa have no tbas of the forty seven mainland african countries only sierra leone and equatorial guinea have no known tbas tbas underlie 40 of the continent and 33 of the population 381 million live on tbas 1 1 calculations for 2015 based on data from ciesin and ciat 2005 fao 2014 igrac and unesco ihp 2015a undesa 2017 by combining maps of aquifer storage and yield produced by bgs et al 2017 and the tbas map it appears that most of tbas are in areas of high storage and higher yielding aquifers fig 1 the groundwater stored within these tbas is thus of importance for the development of africa yet after nearly half a century of tba activities in africa only eleven tbas have been studied in detail in an international context table a1 in appendix a tbas may be subject to conflicts of interests because of unequal resource partitioning and different management capacities within the social economic and environmental contexts of sharing countries yet tba cooperation provides opportunity for cross border dialogue and data sharing for better evaluation of the shared resource and more equitable and sustainable use of those resources braune and christelis 2014 nonetheless only seven aquifers are subject to specific agreements on joint research monitoring or governance table a1 in appendix a this paper aims to describe the current state of the tba resources in africa and progress in their management and governance starting with a brief history of early international initiatives on tbas the study describes developments in mapping assessment and monitoring of tba s and provides an overview of the progress in terms of management and governance of these potentially important shared resources the paper concludes with a discussion presenting priorities contributing to the sustainable management and development of transboundary groundwater resources in

arid countries north african states started studying their tbas especially the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas af63 and the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas af69 relatively early in the 1970 s cooperation agreements were established in 1992 for nsas quadri 2017 and in 1997 for nwsas abuzeid et al 2015 studies of the nwsas and nsas were led by the sahara and sahel observatory oss and the international atomic energy agency iaea africa wide tba studies began around 2000 following concerns over the lack of systematic assessment and governance of transboundary groundwater by member states of unesco and wmo the regional aquifer systems in arid zones conference held in tripoli in 1999 established the concept of regional aquifers this conference was instrumental in shaping the international initiative on shared aquifers launched by unesco fao and iah in 2000 this later became the unesco led internationally shared aquifer resource management isarm programme unesco et al 2000 unesco ihp 2009 the african ministers council on water amcow established in 2002 supported tba management within the continent in 2002 an isarm workshop produced an inventory of 38 african tbas with a map of their approximate locations appelgren 2004 in 2005 igrac produced a map of 20 tbas in the southern african development community sadc region with boundaries based on hydrogeological information and developed a web based system for storage and display of the tba information for the sadc region vasak and kukuric 2006 world maps of tbas have since been published each update providing more detailed information for africa igrac 2017 since 2007 eleven mostly isarm international conferences relevant to africa have enhanced international networks to exchange information and share knowledge on tbas fig 2 such conferences raised awareness on transboundary groundwater resources and triggered tba specific activities between neighbouring countries isarm in line with integrated water resources management iwrm paradigms recognised that tba assessment should include hydrogeological characterisation environmental and socio economic aspects of the aquifer area as well as national legal and institutional contexts to facilitate integrated assessments guidelines for the multi disciplinary assessment of tbas have been compiled based on previous isarm experience igrac and unesco ihp 2015b the isarm programme also resulted in the indicator based assessment of tbas worldwide as part of twap groundwater unesco ihp and unep 2016 4 mapping of tbas since the first map of african tbas in 2004 appelgren 2004 additional tbas have been identified the 72 tbas identified today fig 3 and table a1 in appendix a may increase with additional hydrogeological knowledge as indicated by the increased numbers on consecutive tba maps fig 4 although local hydrogeologists may have had more detailed knowledge on tbas in their country the ovals on the 2006 map are indicative of the limited international awareness on tbas at that time for 64 of the 72 tbas 89 boundaries are based on hydrogeological knowledge the other 8 tbas are known by approximate location only the twap groundwater project improved mapping of tbas nine new tbas were recognised in africa ten tbas which were previously only known by approximate location were mapped more accurately for fifteen tbas significant boundary changes were made change in surface area 10 for three tbas minor changes were made change 10 and five tbas were removed as having no transboundary significance because of limited regional hydraulic continuity from this it may be concluded that if management of potential issues is the only reason for cooperation it may be efficient to define zones of transboundary impact within the larger tbas as transboundary groundwater issues will normally manifest locally in the border areas for aquifer states also seeking cooperation to jointly deal with non transboundary issues this will be less relevant continued hydrogeological research and assessment will further refine tba boundaries and definitions but guidelines on defining tbas including consequences of different approaches would be instrumental 5 assessment of tbas throughout africa especially in drought prone rural areas some hydrogeological characterisation has been conducted usually for groundwater resource assessment development and less so for groundwater management tba assessment only benefits from this research if countries are willing to share information accessibility of information is however often hampered by a lack of functioning databases and information management structures 5 1 aquifer specific assessment to date eleven tbas have been studied to a substantial degree in the sahara sahel region and in southern africa table a1 in appendix a the international atomic energy agency iaea in cooperation with unesco the global environment facility gef and the united nations development programme undp supported investigation of tbas in northern africa isotope hydrology methods aided the characterization of tbas such as the nwsas af69 the nsas af63 and the iullemeden aquifer system af56 and paved the way for cooperation frameworks brittain et al 2015 pioneering efforts were also made by the sahel and sahara observatory oss when they conducted the aquifers of the major basins program starting in 1992 with focus on the iullemeden aquifer aiming to identify transboundary risks formulate management policies and adopt a legal and institutional framework conti 2017 from 2012 2017 further investigations have been carried out in five tba systems within the sahel region the iullemeden aquifer system af56 the liptako gourma upper volta system af54 the senegalo mauritanian af58 the lake chad af52 and taoudeni basins af64 the studies resulted in recommendations for governments to draw up plans to save water and protect it from pollution iaea 2017 the findings will be integrated at regional level and common priorities and recommendations to enhance the sustainable management and rational use of these shared aquifer systems will be identified in more recent years studies have also been initiated in the southern drought prone parts of africa on the stampriet transboundary aquifer system af5 unesco ihp and igrac 2016 and the ramotswa transboundary aquifer af7 altchenko et al 2017 these studies aim to initiate coordinated monitoring and management of shared resources through joint research and assessment to build trust for further cooperation 5 2 results from twap groundwater comparative assessment for africa twap groundwater considered 64 of the 72 tbas in africa mostly those larger than 5000 km2 in area shared by in total 45 countries table a1 in appendix a and consisting of 178 national segments 2 2 the twap programme considered national or country segments of the transboundary aquifers as the primary reporting unit unesco ihp et al 2012 a country segment is the part of the tba located within one country the model calculations were limited to the 34 larger tbas involving 112 national segments table 1 shows the distribution of national segments per core indicator category compiled from igrac and unesco ihp 2016 using the limited data yield from the questionnaires indicators could only be calculated for a small number of country segments indicated by non zero values in table a1 in appendix a 5 2 1 groundwater quantity indicators for sixty four national tba segments estimates of mean annual recharge rates were provided table 1 these range from highs of 300 mm year in four tba country segments in humid areas to lows between 2 and 20 mm year for 20 tba segments in drier regions twenty four country segments have reported recharge rates 2 mm year as in arid areas of the nsas af63 the northern parts of the lake chad basin aquifer af52 the taoudeni basin aquifer af64 and the irhazer illuemeden basin aquifer af56 in areas of major irrigation the model indicated return flows from irrigation for the nsas af63 of 44 of total groundwater recharge in egypt and 38 in sudan riedel and döll 2015 unesco ihp and unep 2016 mean annual groundwater recharge is a crucial quantity in a country s water balance because it indicates the amount of groundwater that is utilizable on a sustainable basis in general countries provided information on this parameter but only 5 countries indicated that dedicated recharge studies had been undertaken groundwater depletion rates mm year averaged over a tba total area are mainly low high to very high depletion rates are reported for 10 of the 30 country segments that supplied data via the questionnaires these include tbas in north and west africa in arid areas with high abstraction rates and tba segments in zambia malawi and south africa where long term abstraction from low replenishment aquifers can have detrimental impacts 5 2 2 groundwater quality data on the natural background groundwater quality defined as the percentage of aquifer area where natural groundwater quality satisfies local drinking water standards were obtained for only 38 country segments table 1 the tba country segment with reported very low quality water is in the nsas in egypt where 20 of the area contains water suitable for human consumption data on groundwater pollution defined as polluted zones as a percentage of the total aquifer segment area are available for only 21 country segments 12 nearly all of those 20 report low pollution levels table 1 5 2 3 socio economic aspects population density defined as the number of people living within a tba area divided by the areal extent of the aquifer varies from very high in 39 country segments to very low in 38 country segments tbas with very high population density are found in nigeria most of west africa s coastal aquifers and along the rift valley human dependence on groundwater for domestic agricultural and industrial water use is defined as groundwater abstraction as a percentage of total water use useable data were obtained only for 27 country segments of which data from 17 indicate a dependence on groundwater of more than 60 high dependence on groundwater is as expected in the fossil tbas across mainly arid north africa and the arid parts of southern africa high dependence on groundwater from tbas is also reported for the more humid rural parts of malawi and tanzania surprisingly the model calculated dependence for tbas in malawi and tanzania is low contradicting the information from the questionnaires highlighting the need for further research the model study indicates a high dependence on groundwater for agriculture irrigation on tba groundwater in libya and algeria the mauritanian part of the taoudeni basin af64 and the kalahari karoo basin stampriet artesian aquifer system af5 in namibia the questionnaire survey yielded no information for comparison riedel and döll 2015 unesco ihp and unep 2016 groundwater development stress is defined as annual groundwater abstraction divided by annual recharge country segments with groundwater withdrawals exceeding renewable groundwater resources are in the sahara and sahel zone where groundwater recharge to exploited aquifers is extremely low or non existent country segment with groundwater development stress values of 50 100 are reported for senegal malawi south africa and swaziland unesco ihp and unep 2016 groundwater development stress estimated from model results is mostly very low to low even in the semi arid and arid zones of africa except for the algerian segment of the taoudeni af64 and the libyan part of the lake chad basin af52 riedel and döll 2015 identified tba hotspots where at least one country segment is experiencing medium to very high development stress and medium to very high human dependence on groundwater in 2010 and or in the future 2020 2050 ten of the nine teen tba hotspots identified are in africa table 2 the need for improved management including joint monitoring is obviously more acute here 5 2 4 completeness and quality of the assessment data were provided for 43 of the national segments of tbas and as such the twap groundwater project managed to collect a lot of data previously only available in grey literature or at the national level data however are often incomplete so that not all indicators can be estimated table a1 in appendix a the chronic lack of available systematic data both on static aquifer characteristics such as aquifer thickness and on time dependent trends such as groundwater abstraction indicate that african countries require further hydrogeological characterisations as well as systematic monitoring of groundwater in tbas because questionnaire responses were obtained separately from the individual countries a complete and harmonized response per aquifer was seldom achieved hampering assessment of aquifers as a whole the importance of groundwater in various tbas and in africa as a whole as well as the state of the resource is not obvious from the data collected there are considerable differences between the outcomes of the questionnaire survey and the model results which may question the validity of the indicators used in the analyses it is not evident which method provides the most reliable results and there is a clear need for ground truthing using additional monitoring data and site specific research harmonization of aquifer information across country boundaries is fundamental for joint management the current lack of information can be taken as an indicator that joint aquifer management still has some way to go 6 monitoring tbas long term monitoring of groundwater levels borehole abstractions and groundwater chemistry are essential inputs required for assessments and developing sustainable groundwater resources management policies at national level some states have systems in place for monitoring their groundwater resources unfortunately most states display a near absence of active monitoring systems or monitoring archives with historic time series the fragmentary nature of monitoring data and other information makes effective management of groundwater resources difficult particularly at tba level recent cooperation on the stampriet tba shared between botswana namibia and south africa and the ramotswa tba shared by botswana and south africa may result in the first joint groundwater monitoring programmes for southern africa altchenko et al 2017 unesco ihp and igrac 2016 deficiencies in monitoring of shared aquifers in central african states are the result of poor institutional capacity due to the low importance given to groundwater resources and less donor attention this has resulted in a lack of hydrogeological data in benin and togo and other more humid regions water resource programs have focused on surface water rather than groundwater as a result there are no long term time series of groundwater monitoring data nor a thorough conceptual understanding of aquifer characteristics such as structure groundwater flow and chemical water quality west african countries of the sahel region have focused upon groundwater so that hydrogeological systems are well studied and institutions responsible for the management and monitoring of aquifer systems e g the water resources management and planning directorate in senegal and the sahara and sahel observatory oss in mali are well established however even in the arid sahel region not all tba segments are covered within the senegalo mauritanian basin af58 there may be good information for the senegalese segment but little data are available from the mauritania gambia and guinea bissau segments unesco ihp and unep 2016 in general the joint monitoring of transboundary groundwater is still largely absent and imbalance in efforts across borders exists within the iullemeden aquifer af56 shared by mali niger and nigeria a transboundary diagnostic analysis has been completed and a joint groundwater database and information system has been set up oss 2011 but no joint monitoring has been initiated to date a major challenge in transboundary cooperation and joint monitoring is the harmonisation of systems methods and data formats across aquifer boundaries such harmonisation was not apparent from the twap inventory at all tba management levels i e at regional river basin and tba level there needs to be increased focus on standardized data collection and harmonisation across borders tba states should be encouraged to commence joint monitoring of representative groundwater levels and water quality and promote data exchange as an early part of transboundary groundwater management and development the database and portal developed by igrac and unesco ihp 2016 can aid such cooperation 7 managing and governing tbas africa is fortunate to have governance structures at both the continental level through amcow and at the regional level in the form of the eight regional economic communities recs of the african union in addition the continent has several functioning river and lake basin organisations critical for groundwater in africa is amcow s commitment to the continent wide strategic groundwater initiative through the africa groundwater commission established in 2007 amcow 2008 the major river lake basins have been identified as units for water management this is challenging for the management of those tbas which underlie several river lake basins or those tbas located in areas not covered by international river or lake basin organisations such as the nwsas af69 or nsas af63 7 1 progress in tba governance the nsas af63 shared between egypt libya chad and sudan has an agreement with full scope for tba management signed by all parties conti 2017 tujchneider and van der gun 2012 although national institutions are in place some are not fully operational the nile basin initiative nbi established in 1999 includes burundi dr congo egypt ethiopia kenya rwanda south sudan sudan tanzania and uganda with eritrea as an observer from 2008 2011 a collaborative study mainstreaming groundwater considerations into the integrated management of the nile river basin was undertaken to raise the profile of groundwater in the nbi and initiate joint actions on groundwater issues braune and christelis 2014 this could potentially be relevant for the tbas in or intersecting the basin approx 10 tbas the nwsas af69 shared between algeria libya and tunisia has an agreement with full scope for tba management signed by all parties conti 2017 tujchneider and van der gun 2012 an institutional arrangement for the assessment and consultative management of this tba has been developed consisting of a nwsas coordinating unit a nwsas steering committee the three countries with each their institutions research centres and an ad hoc scientific committee by mid 2008 the tri partite institutional arrangement had been inaugurated and continues to function the irhazer iullemeden basin af56 shared between algeria mali niger and nigeria has an agreement on joint policy implementation through a joint legal and institutional consultative mechanism adopted by the aquifer states tujchneider and van der gun 2012 it also contains a joint risk mitigation and data sharing policy in the twap groundwater assessment the national reporting on the status of the institutional arrangements varied between tba countries this indicates that the agreement is not yet fully operational within relevant national institutions and departments dealing with groundwater management sadc region the sadc region is an example of a regional economic community rec which has relatively advanced tba management the sadc protocol on shared watercourses sadc 1995 and sadc 2000 was instrumental in getting groundwater added into the programme of activities of the african network of basin organizations anbo in 2008 some of the river basin organisations in the sadc region are starting to play a role in transboundary groundwater management the orange senqu river commission orasecom was the first river basin commission in sadc to establish a groundwater hydrology committee in 2007 to facilitate dialogue between the basin states on tba management the orasecom agreement orasecom 2000 specifically mentions hydrogeological data among the data that the countries are obligated to exchange orasecom was one of the parties suggesting to pilot tba management principles in sadc focussing on the stampriet transboundary aquifer system this became a case study in the unesco ihp executed project on governance of groundwater resources governance in transboundary aquifers unesco ihp and igrac 2016 in 2017 orasecom decided that the stampriet tba multi country cooperation mechanism be housed within the orasecom groundwater hydrology committee with the aim to coordinate further joint study and assessment of the tba orasecom 2017 7 2 twap groundwater comparative assessment for africa seven tba specific agreements exist in africa table a1 in appendix a as reported by conti 2017 and orasecom 2017 in twap groundwater national experts from other tbas have also reported that agreements scoping tba management exist table 1 these findings indicate that management of tbas may be dealt with within existing framework agreements on international river lake basins as such river and lake basin organisations may play an increasingly important role in tba management although at present there is little evidence of concrete activities related to tba assessment monitoring or management as long as most of the tbas have no agreement in place the domestic legal and institutional frameworks for sustainable water resources management continue to play a key role in the coordinated cross border management 8 case studies this section describes three case studies of transboundary aquifers ranging from a very large well studied transboundary aquifer with a long history of cooperation nubian sandstone aquifer system to a small tba which is currently under investigation by the states sharing the resource ramotswa tba and a tba which is potentially at risk of pollution and population pressure and which is in need of joint assessment monitoring and management coastal sedimentary basin 1 8 1 the nubian sandstone aquifer system the heavyweight of tbas in africa the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas af63 forms one of the largest aquifers in the world underlying some 2 500 000 km2 of egypt libya chad and sudan dominated by desert and arid to semi arid climate cedare 2001 to the countries that share this tba it is important as a source for drinking water and irrigation the aquifer is confined in places and semi confined in others isotopic studies reveal that groundwater was recharged during several humid phases during the pleistocene sturchio et al 2004 and holocene periods edmunds et al 2004 edmunds and wright 1979 wallin et al 2005 within the unconfined nubian sediments of southwestern egypt although present day groundwater recharge may also occur the estimated groundwater storage is about 500 000 km3 with the recoverable amount estimated at around 3 iaea et al 2013 water quality varies from excellent in the south to saline in the north of libya alker 2008 exploitation of this enormous freshwater reserve has increased during the past forty years with large abstractions by egypt and libya for irrigation and public water supply the nsas states cooperate through agreements made from 1992 to date these agreements confirm increased cooperation with the aquifer states being prepared to engage at increased levels and intensity of cooperation quadri 2017 the agreement of the joint authority for the study and development joint authority of the nsas signed in 1992 was the first step in the process of cooperation the only instrument on record regarding the joint authority is an internal regulation of the authority setting out the internal structure functions decision making process and funding of the authority the agreement carries no provisions regarding the management of the aquifer or groundwater stored in it two agreements made in 2000 mark an advance in the process of cooperation among the nsas states these agreements require that regular monitoring and updating and sharing of data and information from the nsas are needed for the sustainable use of the aquifer s groundwater resources regarding monitoring and information exchange the four nsas countries agreed to share data collected and analysed through the programme for the development of a regional strategy for the utilization of the nsas a further step in the process of cooperation between the nsas countries is the regional action programme for the integrated nsas management funded by gef and implemented by undp iaea and unesco ihp iaea et al 2013 this project supports the development of a regional strategy for the integrated nsas management aimed at the equitable long term exploitation of the aquifer the project fosters a better understanding of aquifer issues and responses while laying the basis of a regional strategic action plan sap the sap agreement signed by the nsas countries and the joint authority in 2013 binds the parties to agree at a later stage on actions for the sustainable management of the aquifer 8 2 the ramotswa transboundary aquifer an example of recent joint efforts the ramotswa tba af7 shared between botswana and south africa is a tba hotspot in sadc impacted by increased water insecurity due to population growth and urbanisation in botswana and from economic water scarcity in south africa cobbing et al 2008 davies et al 2013 groundwater scarcity on the botswana side is exacerbated by nitrate and faecal pollution of the aquifer due to onsite sanitation beger 2001 staudt 2003 the tba of small 300 km2 extent is part of a segmented karstic dolomite formation within central southern africa that is locally intensively used in south africa meyer 2014 a joint project involving botswana and south africa initiated in 2015 and funded by usaid aims to better understand the aquifer characteristics and issues around its use and to improve water security through conjunctive use the tba was surveyed using a targeted airborne electromagnetic survey to improve the 3 d visualisation of the transboundary part of the dolomite aquifer which is compartmentalised by fracture zones and dolerite dikes altchenko et al 2017 results from joint research based on national monitoring data identified groundwater flow directions and water quality issues indicating potential cross border issues of nitrate pollution and significant surface water groundwater interconnections altchenko et al 2017 geo data and information generated by this project are shared between the tba countries and made available to stakeholders through a web based system igrac and iwmi 2017 information forms the basis for development of a strategic action plan identifying joint priorities the bilateral joint permanent technical committee functions as an interim forum and precursor for taking forward a formal institutional arrangement for the long term joint management of the aquifer 8 3 coastal sedimentary basin 1 an example of a high priority aquifer the coastal sedimentary basin1 af31 shared by kenya south coast and tanzania north coast it is a multi layered sedimentary system with limestone horizons and the groundwater is an important resource for the population the sequence is characterized by a high primary porosity with secondary porosity resulting from karst dissolution as described in tba information sheet af31 in igrac and unesco ihp 2016 the population density in the tba is high 195 persons km2 with a population of 2 9 million people within an aquifer area of 15 000 km2 the main aquifer recharge mechanism is percolation of rainfall with natural discharge of groundwater to river base flow and the sea the average depth to the water table is shallow from ground surface to 10 m below ground level up to 50 of the natural water quality does not meet drinking quality standards due to elevated levels of salinity in some areas high levels of pollution occur due to mining agriculture and urban development unesco ihp and unep 2016 the shallow groundwater levels are important in maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems across the tba the observed polluted zones combined with the issues of salinization and its location along the african east coast with high population pressure makes this tba a hotspot for future groundwater stress joint assessment and monitoring initiatives must be undertaken to develop effective management strategies and action plans to curb potential threats 9 discussion conclusion and forward look many tbas exist in africa relative to other continents igrac and unesco ihp 2015a and those are underlying about 40 of the surface area of the continent this provides rationale for focus on their management as a critical component of water resources management to improve water security and international cooperation tbas are diverse in size climate hydrogeology human pressure and present levels of management and therefore require in depth studies two historic phases of tba management are discerned the first occurred in north africa from the 1970 s driven by the need to further develop and manage the large sedimentary aquifers predominantly in arid regions the second phase began in the early 2000s with the isarm programme systematically identifying and mapping tbas africa wide and initiating widespread cross border discussions defining issues and developing optimum ways to manage tbas some mainstreaming and best practise in tba management are emerging from these studies achieving mature approaches requires time and each tba requires different levels of study and cooperation due to the uniqueness of each tba international support has facilitated management approaches related to technical assessments and development of legal and institutional frameworks international support tends to push for short term solutions while critical trust building processes have proven to take time to develop aquifer impacts from corrective tba management in terms of reversal of negative trends are slow in manifesting requiring long term planning horizons and long term monitoring that cannot be achieved by short term projects similarly inertia towards formalizing expanded legal frameworks and identifying the best bases for overseeing institutions for example in existing river basin organisations takes time and careful negotiation these processes must be nurtured by international development support but not driven in a desire to see rapid results as this could lead to non sustainable outcomes amcow s increased commitment to groundwater along with the regional economic committees could play an over arching role in supporting coordination lesson harnessing and sharing for the benefit of africa as a whole mapping of tbas has progressed steadily through international initiatives even though tbas contain important resources for the development of africa only 11 of the currently known 72 tbas have been studied in detail since tba activities started nearly 50 years ago these tbas are mostly located in the semi arid and arid regions of africa indicating that assessment of tbas seems to be primarily driven by potential water scarcity issues international organisations prove to be key in initiating tba work twap groundwater has shown that assessment of tbas can hardly build on data and information from national studies as in many cases this information is either lacking not accessible in a structured manner or requires harmonisation between countries sharing a tba because of this it is not possible even with an indicator based assessment which requires little data to assess the importance and state of these important groundwater resources of africa global water use models may be able to fill the data gaps but comparing indicators determined using questionnaire surveys with results from a global water use model showed variable levels of agreement calling for further in depth research on both methods the argument that transboundary groundwater issues manifest locally in the border area in zones of transboundary impact at a scale smaller than the whole aquifer and potentially only require involvement of a subset of aquifer states and stakeholders must be further explored similarly nested and scale dependent approaches to tba management with various degrees and levels of formal or informal arrangements need further consideration in particular for large tbas of which there are many in africa such nesting or zoning based on sound hydrogeological and scientific methods will justify the allocation of limited resources for groundwater related activities while making them more efficient and effective this approach also has the potential to focus cooperation at the bilateral level which according to puri and aureli 2005 is more effective than multi lateral cooperation tba work in africa has leveraged cooperation on groundwater more broadly between aquifer sharing countries and at regional levels creating incipient frameworks for broader collaboration on aquifer management the transboundary nature of the shared resources which receives augmented international attention potentially increase national emphasis on groundwater resource management which could improve the overall management of groundwater in africa acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sector this research made use of publicly available data from twap

8468,study region transboundary aquifers tbas of africa study focus review of work on tbas in africa including an overview of assessments and management efforts that have taken place over the last half century new hydrological insights seventy two tbas have been mapped in africa they underlie 40 of the continent where 33 of the population lives often in arid or semi arid regions tba inventories have progressed since 2000 and remain work in progress despite their importance only eleven tbas have been subjected to more detailed studies cooperation has been formalised for seven tbas most of these tbas are in north africa and the sahel the recent global transboundary waters assessment programme compiled information at the national level to describe tbas in terms of key indicators related to the water resource socio economic and legal and institutional conditions availability of data at national level is low hampering regional assessment comparing indicators from questionnaire surveys with those from a global water use model showed variable levels of agreement calling for further research reports on agreements scoping tba management indicate that this may be dealt with within international river lake agreements but reported inconsistencies between tba sharing countries also indicate that implementation is limited increasing awareness and support to joint tba management is

transboundary aquifers africa assessment governance indicators 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of supply for basic human needs and development as a perennial source of water it provides a buffer in times of drought that can be developed for local use at relatively low cost masiyandima and giordano 2007 in many parts of africa groundwater is the only reliable source of water up to 75 of the population of africa uses groundwater as the main drinking water source uneca et al 2000 and groundwater is important for rural livelihoods livestock rearing and urban water supply villholth 2013 foster et al 2008 as pressures on groundwater resources increase with economic development population growth and climate change it is increasingly important to understand the potential and management practices of transboundary aquifer resources cooperation for the development and management of transboundary aquifer tba resources started in the 1970s in northern africa presently seventy two tbas have been identified on mainland africa igrac and unesco ihp 2015a the island states of africa have no tbas of the forty seven mainland african countries only sierra leone and equatorial guinea have no known tbas tbas underlie 40 of the continent and 33 of the population 381 million live on tbas 1 1 calculations for 2015 based on data from ciesin and ciat 2005 fao 2014 igrac and unesco ihp 2015a undesa 2017 by combining maps of aquifer storage and yield produced by bgs et al 2017 and the tbas map it appears that most of tbas are in areas of high storage and higher yielding aquifers fig 1 the groundwater stored within these tbas is thus of importance for the development of africa yet after nearly half a century of tba activities in africa only eleven tbas have been studied in detail in an international context table a1 in appendix a tbas may be subject to conflicts of interests because of unequal resource partitioning and different management capacities within the social economic and environmental contexts of sharing countries yet tba cooperation provides opportunity for cross border dialogue and data sharing for better evaluation of the shared resource and more equitable and sustainable use of those resources braune and christelis 2014 nonetheless only seven aquifers are subject to specific agreements on joint research monitoring or governance table a1 in appendix a this paper aims to describe the current state of the tba resources in africa and progress in their management and governance starting with a brief history of early international initiatives on tbas the study describes developments in mapping assessment and monitoring of tba s and provides an overview of the progress in terms of management and governance of these potentially important shared resources the paper concludes with a discussion presenting priorities contributing to the sustainable management and development of transboundary groundwater resources in africa 2 method this research combines insights from literature on tbas in africa and experiences from ongoing studies with results from the groundwater component of the transboundary waters assessment programme twap groundwater twap groundwater was a worldwide indicator based assessment of 199 tbas also including 64 of the 72 tbas in africa unesco ihp and unep 2016 ten core and ten

and projected trends of transboundary aquifers allow global or regional comparisons and make it possible to monitor the effectiveness of management interventions through repeated assessments unesco ihp et al 2012 indicator values were derived from the results of a questionnaire survey and from regional workshops both involving experts from the tba countries in parallel six of the core and three of the additional indicators related to e g recharge groundwater development stress and population were calculated using the global water use model watergap this enabled assessment of projections for 2030 and 2050 for particular indicators riedel and döll 2015 unesco ihp and unep 2016 presented overviews and conclusions at the global scale but did not discuss specific regions in depth data from twap groundwater are available via an on line data and information portal igrac and unesco ihp 2016 the data for africa are analysed in combination with results from the literature survey to compile an overview of the state of transboundary groundwater resources in africa in terms of groundwater resource quantity and quality the socio economic importance and their management and governance three case study reports are included to illustrate different levels of maturity in tba research and cooperation 3 early history of tba works in africa due to their strategic importance in semi arid and arid countries north african states started studying their tbas especially the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas af63 and the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas af69 relatively early in the 1970 s cooperation agreements were established in 1992 for nsas quadri 2017 and in 1997 for nwsas abuzeid et al 2015 studies of the nwsas and nsas were led by the sahara and sahel observatory oss and the international atomic energy agency iaea africa wide tba studies began around 2000 following concerns over the lack of systematic assessment and governance of transboundary groundwater by member states of unesco and wmo the regional aquifer systems in arid zones conference held in tripoli in 1999 established the concept of regional aquifers this conference was instrumental in shaping the international initiative on shared aquifers launched by unesco fao and iah in 2000 this later became the unesco led internationally shared aquifer resource management isarm programme unesco et al 2000 unesco ihp 2009 the african ministers council on water amcow established in 2002 supported tba management within the continent in 2002 an isarm workshop produced an inventory of 38 african tbas with a map of their approximate locations appelgren 2004 in 2005 igrac produced a map of 20 tbas in the southern african development community sadc region with boundaries based on hydrogeological information and developed a web based system for storage and display of the tba information for the sadc region vasak and kukuric 2006 world maps of tbas have since been published each update providing more detailed information for africa igrac 2017 since 2007 eleven mostly isarm international conferences relevant to africa have enhanced international networks to exchange information and share knowledge on tbas fig 2 such conferences raised awareness on transboundary groundwater resources and triggered tba specific activities between neighbouring countries isarm in line with integrated water resources management iwrm paradigms recognised that tba assessment should include hydrogeological characterisation environmental and socio economic aspects of the aquifer area as well as national legal and institutional contexts to facilitate integrated assessments guidelines for the multi disciplinary assessment of tbas have been compiled based on previous isarm experience igrac and unesco ihp 2015b the isarm programme also resulted in the indicator based assessment of tbas worldwide as part of twap groundwater unesco ihp and unep 2016 4 mapping of tbas since the first map of african tbas in 2004 appelgren 2004 additional tbas have been identified the 72 tbas identified today fig 3 and table a1 in appendix a may increase with additional hydrogeological knowledge as indicated by the increased numbers on consecutive tba maps fig 4 although local hydrogeologists may have had more detailed knowledge on tbas in their country the ovals on the 2006 map are indicative of the limited international awareness on tbas at that time for 64 of the 72 tbas 89 boundaries are based on hydrogeological knowledge the other 8 tbas are known by approximate location only the twap groundwater project improved mapping of tbas nine new tbas were recognised in africa ten tbas which were previously only known by approximate location were mapped more accurately for fifteen tbas significant boundary changes were made change in surface area 10 for three tbas minor changes were made change 10 and five tbas were removed as having no transboundary significance because of limited regional hydraulic continuity from this it may be concluded that if management of potential issues is the only reason for cooperation it may be efficient to define zones of transboundary impact within the larger tbas as transboundary groundwater issues will normally manifest locally in the border areas for aquifer states also seeking cooperation to jointly deal with non transboundary issues this will be less relevant continued hydrogeological research and assessment will further refine tba boundaries and definitions but guidelines on defining tbas including consequences of different approaches would be instrumental 5 assessment of tbas throughout africa especially in drought prone rural areas some hydrogeological characterisation has been conducted usually for groundwater resource assessment development and less so for groundwater management tba assessment only benefits from this research if countries are willing to share information accessibility of information is however often hampered by a lack of functioning databases and information management structures 5 1 aquifer specific assessment to date eleven tbas have been studied to a substantial degree in the sahara sahel region and in southern africa table a1 in appendix a the international atomic energy agency iaea in cooperation with unesco the global environment facility gef and the united nations development programme undp supported investigation of tbas in northern africa isotope hydrology methods aided the characterization of tbas such as the nwsas af69 the nsas af63 and the iullemeden aquifer system af56 and paved the way for cooperation frameworks brittain et al 2015 pioneering efforts were also made by the sahel and sahara observatory oss when they conducted the aquifers of the major basins program starting in 1992 with focus on the iullemeden aquifer aiming to identify transboundary risks formulate management policies and adopt a legal and institutional framework conti 2017 from 2012 2017 further investigations have been carried out in five tba systems within the sahel region the iullemeden aquifer system af56 the liptako gourma upper volta system af54 the senegalo mauritanian af58 the lake chad af52 and taoudeni basins af64 the studies resulted in recommendations for governments to draw up plans to save water and protect it from pollution iaea 2017 the findings will be integrated at regional level and common priorities and recommendations to enhance the sustainable management and rational use of these shared aquifer systems will be identified in more recent years studies have also been initiated in the southern drought prone parts of africa on the stampriet transboundary aquifer system af5 unesco ihp and igrac 2016 and the ramotswa transboundary aquifer af7 altchenko et al 2017 these studies aim to initiate coordinated monitoring and management of shared resources through joint research and assessment to build trust for further cooperation 5 2 results from twap groundwater comparative assessment for africa twap groundwater considered 64 of the 72 tbas in africa mostly those larger than 5000 km2 in area shared by in total 45 countries table a1 in appendix a and consisting of 178 national segments 2 2 the twap programme considered national or country segments of the transboundary aquifers as the primary reporting unit unesco ihp et al 2012 a country segment is the part of the tba located within one country the model calculations were limited to the 34 larger tbas involving 112 national segments table 1 shows the distribution of national segments per core indicator category compiled from igrac and unesco ihp 2016 using the limited data yield from the questionnaires indicators could only be calculated for a small number of country segments indicated by non zero values in table a1 in appendix a 5 2 1 groundwater quantity indicators for sixty four national tba segments estimates of mean annual recharge rates were provided table 1 these range from highs of 300 mm year in four tba country segments in humid areas to lows between 2 and 20 mm year for 20 tba segments in drier regions twenty four country segments have reported recharge rates 2 mm year as in arid areas of the nsas af63 the northern parts of the lake chad basin aquifer af52 the taoudeni basin aquifer af64 and the irhazer illuemeden basin aquifer af56 in areas of major irrigation the model indicated return flows from irrigation for the nsas af63 of 44 of total groundwater recharge in egypt and 38 in sudan riedel and döll 2015 unesco ihp and unep 2016 mean annual groundwater recharge is a crucial quantity in a country s water balance because it indicates the amount of groundwater that is utilizable on a sustainable basis in general countries provided information on this parameter but only 5 countries indicated that dedicated recharge studies had been undertaken groundwater depletion rates mm year averaged over a tba total area are mainly low high to very high depletion rates are reported for 10 of the 30 country segments that supplied data via the questionnaires these include tbas in north and west africa in arid areas with high abstraction rates and tba segments in zambia malawi and south africa where long term abstraction from low replenishment aquifers can have detrimental impacts 5 2 2 groundwater quality data on the natural background groundwater quality defined as the percentage of aquifer area where natural groundwater quality satisfies local drinking water standards were obtained for only 38 country segments table 1 the tba country segment with reported very low quality water is in the nsas in egypt where 20 of the area contains water suitable for human consumption data on groundwater pollution defined as polluted zones as a percentage of the total aquifer segment area are available for only 21 country segments 12 nearly all of those 20 report low pollution levels table 1 5 2 3 socio economic aspects population density defined as the number of people living within a tba area divided by the areal extent of the aquifer varies from very high in 39 country segments to very low in 38 country segments tbas with very high population density are found in nigeria most of west africa s coastal aquifers and along the rift valley human dependence on groundwater for domestic agricultural and industrial water use is defined as groundwater abstraction as a percentage of total water use useable data were obtained only for 27 country segments of which data from 17 indicate a dependence on groundwater of more than 60 high dependence on groundwater is as expected in the fossil tbas across mainly arid north africa and the arid parts of southern africa high dependence on groundwater from tbas is also reported for the more humid rural parts of malawi and tanzania surprisingly the model calculated dependence for tbas in malawi and tanzania is low contradicting the information from the questionnaires highlighting the need for further research the model study indicates a high dependence on groundwater for agriculture irrigation on tba groundwater in libya and algeria the mauritanian part of the taoudeni basin af64 and the kalahari karoo basin stampriet artesian aquifer system af5 in namibia the questionnaire survey yielded no information for comparison riedel and döll 2015 unesco ihp and unep 2016 groundwater development stress is defined as annual groundwater abstraction divided by annual recharge country segments with groundwater withdrawals exceeding renewable groundwater resources are in the sahara and sahel zone where groundwater recharge to exploited aquifers is extremely low or non existent country segment with groundwater development stress values of 50 100 are reported for senegal malawi south africa and swaziland unesco ihp and unep 2016 groundwater development stress estimated from model results is mostly very low to low even in the semi arid and arid zones of africa except for the algerian segment of the taoudeni af64 and the libyan part of the lake chad basin af52 riedel and döll 2015 identified tba hotspots where at least one country segment is experiencing medium to very high development stress and medium to very high human dependence on groundwater in 2010 and or in the future 2020 2050 ten of the nine teen tba hotspots identified are in africa table 2 the need for improved management including joint monitoring is obviously more acute here 5 2 4 completeness and quality of the assessment data were provided for 43 of the national segments of tbas and as such the twap groundwater project managed to collect a lot of data previously only available in grey literature or at the national level data however are often incomplete so that not all indicators can be estimated table a1 in appendix a the chronic lack of available systematic data both on static aquifer characteristics such as aquifer thickness and on time dependent trends such as groundwater abstraction indicate that african countries require further hydrogeological characterisations as well as systematic monitoring of groundwater in tbas because questionnaire responses were obtained separately from the individual countries a complete and harmonized response per aquifer was seldom achieved hampering assessment of aquifers as a whole the importance of groundwater in various tbas and in africa as a whole as well as the state of the resource is not obvious from the data collected there are considerable differences between the outcomes of the questionnaire survey and the model results which may question the validity of the indicators used in the analyses it is not evident which method provides the most reliable results and there is a clear need for ground truthing using additional monitoring data and site specific research harmonization of aquifer information across country boundaries is fundamental for joint management the current lack of information can be taken as an indicator that joint aquifer management still has some way to go 6 monitoring tbas long term monitoring of groundwater levels borehole abstractions and groundwater chemistry are essential inputs required for assessments and developing sustainable groundwater resources management policies at national level some states have systems in place for monitoring their groundwater resources unfortunately most states display a near absence of active monitoring systems or monitoring archives with historic time series the fragmentary nature of monitoring data and other information makes effective management of groundwater resources difficult particularly at tba level recent cooperation on the stampriet tba shared between botswana namibia and south africa and the ramotswa tba shared by botswana and south africa may result in the first joint groundwater monitoring programmes for southern africa altchenko et al 2017 unesco ihp and igrac 2016 deficiencies in monitoring of shared aquifers in central african states are the result of poor institutional capacity due to the low importance given to groundwater resources and less donor attention this has resulted in a lack of hydrogeological data in benin and togo and other more humid regions water resource programs have focused on surface water rather than groundwater as a result there are no long term time series of groundwater monitoring data nor a thorough conceptual understanding of aquifer characteristics such as structure groundwater flow and chemical water quality west african countries of the sahel region have focused upon groundwater so that hydrogeological systems are well studied and institutions responsible for the management and monitoring of aquifer systems e g the water resources management and planning directorate in senegal and the sahara and sahel observatory oss in mali are well established however even in the arid sahel region not all tba segments are covered within the senegalo mauritanian basin af58 there may be good information for the senegalese segment but little data are available from the mauritania gambia and guinea bissau segments unesco ihp and unep 2016 in general the joint monitoring of transboundary groundwater is still largely absent and imbalance in efforts across borders exists within the iullemeden aquifer af56 shared by mali niger and nigeria a transboundary diagnostic analysis has been completed and a joint groundwater database and information system has been set up oss 2011 but no joint monitoring has been initiated to date a major challenge in transboundary cooperation and joint monitoring is the harmonisation of systems methods and data formats across aquifer boundaries such harmonisation was not apparent from the twap inventory at all tba management levels i e at regional river basin and tba level there needs to be increased focus on standardized data collection and harmonisation across borders tba states should be encouraged to commence joint monitoring of representative groundwater levels and water quality and promote data exchange as an early part of transboundary groundwater management and development the database and portal developed by igrac and unesco ihp 2016 can aid such cooperation 7 managing and governing tbas africa is fortunate to have governance structures at both the continental level through amcow and at the regional level in the form of the eight regional economic communities recs of the african union in addition the continent has several functioning river and lake basin organisations critical for groundwater in africa is amcow s commitment to the continent wide strategic groundwater initiative through the africa groundwater commission established in 2007 amcow 2008 the major river lake basins have been identified as units for water management this is challenging for the management of those tbas which underlie several river lake basins or those tbas located in areas not covered by international river or lake basin organisations such as the nwsas af69 or nsas af63 7 1 progress in tba governance the nsas af63 shared between egypt libya chad and sudan has an agreement with full scope for tba management signed by all parties conti 2017 tujchneider and van der gun 2012 although national institutions are in place some are not fully operational the nile basin initiative nbi established in 1999 includes burundi dr congo egypt ethiopia kenya rwanda south sudan sudan tanzania and uganda with eritrea as an observer from 2008 2011 a collaborative study mainstreaming groundwater considerations into the integrated management of the nile river basin was undertaken to raise the profile of groundwater in the nbi and initiate joint actions on groundwater issues braune and christelis 2014 this could potentially be relevant for the tbas in or intersecting the basin approx 10 tbas the nwsas af69 shared between algeria libya and tunisia has an agreement with full scope for tba management signed by all parties conti 2017 tujchneider and van der gun 2012 an institutional arrangement for the assessment and consultative management of this tba has been developed consisting of a nwsas coordinating unit a nwsas steering committee the three countries with each their institutions research centres and an ad hoc scientific committee by mid 2008 the tri partite institutional arrangement had been inaugurated and continues to function the irhazer iullemeden basin af56 shared between algeria mali niger and nigeria has an agreement on joint policy implementation through a joint legal and institutional consultative mechanism adopted by the aquifer states tujchneider and van der gun 2012 it also contains a joint risk mitigation and data sharing policy in the twap groundwater assessment the national reporting on the status of the institutional arrangements varied between tba countries this indicates that the agreement is not yet fully operational within relevant national institutions and departments dealing with groundwater management sadc region the sadc region is an example of a regional economic community rec which has relatively advanced tba management the sadc protocol on shared watercourses sadc 1995 and sadc 2000 was instrumental in getting groundwater added into the programme of activities of the african network of basin organizations anbo in 2008 some of the river basin organisations in the sadc region are starting to play a role in transboundary groundwater management the orange senqu river commission orasecom was the first river basin commission in sadc to establish a groundwater hydrology committee in 2007 to facilitate dialogue between the basin states on tba management the orasecom agreement orasecom 2000 specifically mentions hydrogeological data among the data that the countries are obligated to exchange orasecom was one of the parties suggesting to pilot tba management principles in sadc focussing on the stampriet transboundary aquifer system this became a case study in the unesco ihp executed project on governance of groundwater resources governance in transboundary aquifers unesco ihp and igrac 2016 in 2017 orasecom decided that the stampriet tba multi country cooperation mechanism be housed within the orasecom groundwater hydrology committee with the aim to coordinate further joint study and assessment of the tba orasecom 2017 7 2 twap groundwater comparative assessment for africa seven tba specific agreements exist in africa table a1 in appendix a as reported by conti 2017 and orasecom 2017 in twap groundwater national experts from other tbas have also reported that agreements scoping tba management exist table 1 these findings indicate that management of tbas may be dealt with within existing framework agreements on international river lake basins as such river and lake basin organisations may play an increasingly important role in tba management although at present there is little evidence of concrete activities related to tba assessment monitoring or management as long as most of the tbas have no agreement in place the domestic legal and institutional frameworks for sustainable water resources management continue to play a key role in the coordinated cross border management 8 case studies this section describes three case studies of transboundary aquifers ranging from a very large well studied transboundary aquifer with a long history of cooperation nubian sandstone aquifer system to a small tba which is currently under investigation by the states sharing the resource ramotswa tba and a tba which is potentially at risk of pollution and population pressure and which is in need of joint assessment monitoring and management coastal sedimentary basin 1 8 1 the nubian sandstone aquifer system the heavyweight of tbas in africa the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas af63 forms one of the largest aquifers in the world underlying some 2 500 000 km2 of egypt libya chad and sudan dominated by desert and arid to semi arid climate cedare 2001 to the countries that share this tba it is important as a source for drinking water and irrigation the aquifer is confined in places and semi confined in others isotopic studies reveal that groundwater was recharged during several humid phases during the pleistocene sturchio et al 2004 and holocene periods edmunds et al 2004 edmunds and wright 1979 wallin et al 2005 within the unconfined nubian sediments of southwestern egypt although present day groundwater recharge may also occur the estimated groundwater storage is about 500 000 km3 with the recoverable amount estimated at around 3 iaea et al 2013 water quality varies from excellent in the south to saline in the north of libya alker 2008 exploitation of this enormous freshwater reserve has increased during the past forty years with large abstractions by egypt and libya for irrigation and public water supply the nsas states cooperate through agreements made from 1992 to date these agreements confirm increased cooperation with the aquifer states being prepared to engage at increased levels and intensity of cooperation quadri 2017 the agreement of the joint authority for the study and development joint authority of the nsas signed in 1992 was the first step in the process of cooperation the only instrument on record regarding the joint authority is an internal regulation of the authority setting out the internal structure functions decision making process and funding of the authority the agreement carries no provisions regarding the management of the aquifer or groundwater stored in it two agreements made in 2000 mark an advance in the process of cooperation among the nsas states these agreements require that regular monitoring and updating and sharing of data and information from the nsas are needed for the sustainable use of the aquifer s groundwater resources regarding monitoring and information exchange the four nsas countries agreed to share data collected and analysed through the programme for the development of a regional strategy for the utilization of the nsas a further step in the process of cooperation between the nsas countries is the regional action programme for the integrated nsas management funded by gef and implemented by undp iaea and unesco ihp iaea et al 2013 this project supports the development of a regional strategy for the integrated nsas management aimed at the equitable long term exploitation of the aquifer the project fosters a better understanding of aquifer issues and responses while laying the basis of a regional strategic action plan sap the sap agreement signed by the nsas countries and the joint authority in 2013 binds the parties to agree at a later stage on actions for the sustainable management of the aquifer 8 2 the ramotswa transboundary aquifer an example of recent joint efforts the ramotswa tba af7 shared between botswana and south africa is a tba hotspot in sadc impacted by increased water insecurity due to population growth and urbanisation in botswana and from economic water scarcity in south africa cobbing et al 2008 davies et al 2013 groundwater scarcity on the botswana side is exacerbated by nitrate and faecal pollution of the aquifer due to onsite sanitation beger 2001 staudt 2003 the tba of small 300 km2 extent is part of a segmented karstic dolomite formation within central southern africa that is locally intensively used in south africa meyer 2014 a joint project involving botswana and south africa initiated in 2015 and funded by usaid aims to better understand the aquifer characteristics and issues around its use and to improve water security through conjunctive use the tba was surveyed using a targeted airborne electromagnetic survey to improve the 3 d visualisation of the transboundary part of the dolomite aquifer which is compartmentalised by fracture zones and dolerite dikes altchenko et al 2017 results from joint research based on national monitoring data identified groundwater flow directions and water quality issues indicating potential cross border issues of nitrate pollution and significant surface water groundwater interconnections altchenko et al 2017 geo data and information generated by this project are shared between the tba countries and made available to stakeholders through a web based system igrac and iwmi 2017 information forms the basis for development of a strategic action plan identifying joint priorities the bilateral joint permanent technical committee functions as an interim forum and precursor for taking forward a formal institutional arrangement for the long term joint management of the aquifer 8 3 coastal sedimentary basin 1 an example of a high priority aquifer the coastal sedimentary basin1 af31 shared by kenya south coast and tanzania north coast it is a multi layered sedimentary system with limestone horizons and the groundwater is an important resource for the population the sequence is characterized by a high primary porosity with secondary porosity resulting from karst dissolution as described in tba information sheet af31 in igrac and unesco ihp 2016 the population density in the tba is high 195 persons km2 with a population of 2 9 million people within an aquifer area of 15 000 km2 the main aquifer recharge mechanism is percolation of rainfall with natural discharge of groundwater to river base flow and the sea the average depth to the water table is shallow from ground surface to 10 m below ground level up to 50 of the natural water quality does not meet drinking quality standards due to elevated levels of salinity in some areas high levels of pollution occur due to mining agriculture and urban development unesco ihp and unep 2016 the shallow groundwater levels are important in maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems across the tba the observed polluted zones combined with the issues of salinization and its location along the african east coast with high population pressure makes this tba a hotspot for future groundwater stress joint assessment and monitoring initiatives must be undertaken to develop effective management strategies and action plans to curb potential threats 9 discussion conclusion and forward look many tbas exist in africa relative to other continents igrac and unesco ihp 2015a and those are underlying about 40 of the surface area of the continent this provides rationale for focus on their management as a critical component of water resources management to improve water security and international cooperation tbas are diverse in size climate hydrogeology human pressure and present levels of management and therefore require in depth studies two historic phases of tba management are discerned the first occurred in north africa from the 1970 s driven by the need to further develop and manage the large sedimentary aquifers predominantly in arid regions the second phase began in the early 2000s with the isarm programme systematically identifying and mapping tbas africa wide and initiating widespread cross border discussions defining issues and developing optimum ways to manage tbas some mainstreaming and best practise in tba management are emerging from these studies achieving mature approaches requires time and each tba requires different levels of study and cooperation due to the uniqueness of each tba international support has facilitated management approaches related to technical assessments and development of legal and institutional frameworks international support tends to push for short term solutions while critical trust building processes have proven to take time to develop aquifer impacts from corrective tba management in terms of reversal of negative trends are slow in manifesting requiring long term planning horizons and long term monitoring that cannot be achieved by short term projects similarly inertia towards formalizing expanded legal frameworks and identifying the best bases for overseeing institutions for example in existing river basin organisations takes time and careful negotiation these processes must be nurtured by international development support but not driven in a desire to see rapid results as this could lead to non sustainable outcomes amcow s increased commitment to groundwater along with the regional economic committees could play an over arching role in supporting coordination lesson harnessing and sharing for the benefit of africa as a whole mapping of tbas has progressed steadily through international initiatives even though tbas contain important resources for the development of africa only 11 of the currently known 72 tbas have been studied in detail since tba activities started nearly 50 years ago these tbas are mostly located in the semi arid and arid regions of africa indicating that assessment of tbas seems to be primarily driven by potential water scarcity issues international organisations prove to be key in initiating tba work twap groundwater has shown that assessment of tbas can hardly build on data and information from national studies as in many cases this information is either lacking not accessible in a structured manner or requires harmonisation between countries sharing a tba because of this it is not possible even with an indicator based assessment which requires little data to assess the importance and state of these important groundwater resources of africa global water use models may be able to fill the data gaps but comparing indicators determined using questionnaire surveys with results from a global water use model showed variable levels of agreement calling for further in depth research on both methods the argument that transboundary groundwater issues manifest locally in the border area in zones of transboundary impact at a scale smaller than the whole aquifer and potentially only require involvement of a subset of aquifer states and stakeholders must be further explored similarly nested and scale dependent approaches to tba management with various degrees and levels of formal or informal arrangements need further consideration in particular for large tbas of which there are many in africa such nesting or zoning based on sound hydrogeological and scientific methods will justify the allocation of limited resources for groundwater related activities while making them more efficient and effective this approach also has the potential to focus cooperation at the bilateral level which according to puri and aureli 2005 is more effective than multi lateral cooperation tba work in africa has leveraged cooperation on groundwater more broadly between aquifer sharing countries and at regional levels creating incipient frameworks for broader collaboration on aquifer management the transboundary nature of the shared resources which receives augmented international attention potentially increase national emphasis on groundwater resource management which could improve the overall management of groundwater in africa

8469,study region malawi study focus integrated water resource management iwrm of transboundary aquifers tba s is becoming increasingly important without adequate and accurate scientific knowledge of their extent and characteristics uninformed policy creation could lead to unsustainable management of these vital resources this is particularly important within the southern african development community sadc where up to 85 of domestic water is supplied by groundwater in this paper malawi is used as a case study to critically evaluate the current transboundary aquifer assessment frameworks within the region and their value in promoting iwrm a series of illustrative conceptual models of tba interactions pertinent to the malawian national border are presented and we consider how tba assessments may be integrated to national iwrm and strategic policy development new hydrological insights for the region current tba assessments of malawi and the wider sadc neglect multiple aspects needed for a national scale management plan this includes full border tba system identification alongside given the geology of the region consideration of the discontinuous nature of basement complex aquifers and localised alluvial deposits that both result in smaller scale aquifer units conceptualising such local scale complexity and encouraging countries to develop a strategy that systematically examines tba systems along their national border at relevant scales will allow for more focused conjunctive policy creation and sustainable management of tba s keywords transboundary groundwater hydrogeology integrated water resources management africa malawi 1 introduction groundwater has often been described as an invisible resource yet it is important to recognise that almost 98 of the world s available freshwater resources is groundwater integrated water resources management iwrm acknowledges the important role of groundwater within frameworks that can sometimes be unduly surface water focused the importance of iwrm is recognised in sustainable development goal sdg 6 to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all united nations 2017 groundwater development is central to meeting sdg 6 a pressing need though iwrm is to recognise that many aquifers identified for resource use may cross national borders it is then critical that transboundary cooperation comes into play to allow sustainable and equitable groundwater use by stakeholder nations involved worldwide water use is increasing due to growing water sanitation and hygiene wash demands africa is heavily reliant upon groundwater including transboundary groundwater with an estimated 75 of its population dependent on this resource for basic water supplies altchenko and villholth 2013 investment in reliable water supplies will continue to depend on the development of groundwater resources this may include the exploitation of transboundary aquifers tba s giordano 2009 macdonald and calow 2009 this paper will focus primarily on malawi one of the 15 countries within the southern african development community sadc a sub continental region of africa where widespread groundwater development is needed to address sdg 6 effective groundwater management by some sadc member nations is faced by multiple challenges these include little or no adherence to abstraction licensing legislation low annual natural recharge in arid to semi arid localities low aquifer storage and vulnerability to climate change all of which provide critical impetus to the development of a science based strategy for groundwater management smith carrington and chilton 1983 the term transboundary water is used to describe a water body that crosses two or more international country borders this can be in the form of rivers lakes and groundwater un water 2014 an aquifer is a hydrostratographic unit that stores and transmits groundwater an aquifer becomes transboundary when it crosses one or more international political border and thus has the potential for groundwater exchange between neighbouring countries wada and heinrich 2013 the challenge faced by countries is to reliably define aquifer connectivity and groundwater movement at their borders often this is with limited data available or data not shared this knowledge then needs to be translated to accessible conceptual models that can underpin science based policy implementation clearly and accurately we propose that in order to meet sdg 6 there is a need for countries to develop strategies that systematically identifies and screens tba units along its national border this will allow countries to characterise tba connectivity and transmission of groundwater over their entire national border length this includes conceptualising how abstraction on one side of a border may influence groundwater and surface water availability on the opposing side where influence is judged to be significant this should trigger development of joint data collation efforts to underpin tba policy and agreements we further advocate that systematic tba screening along a national border should not only examine major aquifer systems where connectivity is already known but also include minor aquifer systems whilst not as geographically extensive individual minor aquifer tba s may be locally significance especially where relatively short distances separate neighbouring country communities furthermore tba connectivity of more major aquifer systems should not be assumed whilst extensive over tens of km scales or more aquifers may still be locally discontinuous e g due to structural faulting and weathering differences and their local connectivity should be assessed within the developing world context technical data and financial resources are often limited here desk based screening using available data to conceptualise tba connectivity is critical development of conceptual models of tba interaction within a wider system both generic and locally bespoke is fundamental consideration of the tba status of malawi a low income developing country bordered by mozambique tanzania and zambia is made here as an example a critical assessment of the current status of tba s in malawi is presented with the overarching goal to contribute to the development of a malawian national approach to systems based tba assessment and conceptualisation at relevant local scales the aims are to critically review malawi s current status of tba assessments that focus on more obvious major aquifer systems make a case for systematic tba assessment along its national border length addressing minor local aquifer systems and groundwater surface water interactions develop conceptual models of tba interactions relevant to its national border but of generic value across the sadc consider how tba assessments might be integrated to national implementation strategic policy development

europe cooperation over the management of africa s transboundary rivers lakes and tba systems is significantly less developed scheumann and alker 2009 the sadc fig 1 was established in 2004 to bring together countries within the south eastern african continent to improve living situations for large populations of people malawi one of the 15 countries within the sadc lies between 9 s and 17 s latitude and 33 e and 36 e longitude it extends across an area of 118 484 km2 stretching 853 km n s and 257 km e w chavula 2012 lake malawi covers 23 6 of the country the third largest freshwater lake in africa malawi s population is estimated to be 18 3 million worldometers 2017 of which 90 live in rural areas its main economic income is generated from agriculture with subsistence farming common amongst the rural population government of malawi 2012 with less than 1400 m3 year person of available total renewable water resources malawi is one of the most water stressed countries in the world government of malawi 2012 this is largely due to the lack of infrastructure within the country to support large scale management of water resources and much of its rural population accessing groundwater through hand dug wells or low capacity boreholes fitted with hand pumps tens of thousands of water points now exist across malawi pavelic et al 2012 and added to daily under the sdg 6 agenda efforts with the population of malawi set to rise to 26 5 million by 2030 and renewable water resources likely to decline due to deforestation and climate change impact malawi could become water scarce with available total renewable water falling below 1000 m3 year person in the next 13 years these valuable groundwater resources are vulnerable to pollution threats that may be poorly constrained back et al 2018 sparse monitoring of both groundwater quality and level can also lead to a poor knowledge base for management rivett et al 2018a such factors and others indirectly influence the strategic development of tba assessment and management rivett et al 2018b 2 1 1 regional geology and hydrogeology the geology of the sadc is varied it is composed of a combination of crystalline basin complex rock units interconnected with younger orogenic belts of metamorphic rocks and large sedimentary basins underlain by basement the east of the region is heavily influenced by structural tectonics creating a complex geological history ramoeli et al 2009 the east african rift system ears runs 2100 km from uganda to malawi and formed during the onset of the miocene it can be seen at the surface as aligned tectonic basins forming rift valleys separated by uplifted continental blocks chorowicz 2005 that extend from mozambique to ethiopia the rifts of the western branch of the ears where malawi resides fig 2 are often filled with sediments or water specht and rosendahl 1989 2 1 2 malawi geology and hydrogeology the ears large scale rifting heavily influenced the topography and morphology of malawi monjerezi and ngongondo 2012 this is through the creation of four main physiographic areas the plateau the uplands the rift valley escarpment and rift valley plains the plateau area represents the largest proportion of the topography of malawi and is comprised of highly faulted basement gneiss smith carrington and chilton 1983 the rift valley where the shire river basin is located forms the most significant structural feature of malawi it comprises a series of half grabens that section into 60 100 km long extensional basins formed by faulting offset from the ears this is bordered on one side by steep normal faults and by en echelon step faults with minor vertical offset on the other side of the valley ebinger et al 1987 ring and betzler 1995 fig 2 these rift events have played a significant role in the distribution of the aquifer lithologies within malawi and the sadc smith carrington and chilton 1983 differing lithologies in malawi provide varying productive water bearing units theoretically allowing a large proportion of malawi access to groundwater accurate knowledge of the geology and hydrogeology is important to determine the aquifers that may be transboundary the main water bearing geological units in malawi are summarised below in order of increasing importance bradford 1973 1 precambrian to lower palaeozoic weathered and or fractured basement rocks composed of metamorphic rocks of varying lithology but primarily gneiss and granulites these are malawi s most abundant geological units and account for 96 of the total land cover these are low storage and low transmissivity aquifers with borehole yields between 0 5 and 0 8l s government of malawi 2006 upton et al 2016 2 permian to triassic karoo sedimentary rocks units exhibit low porosity and intergranular permeability due to calcite cementation groundwater flows through fractures and thus aquifers have low to moderate productivity although this may be increased in the south of malawi where more heavily faulted smith carrington and chilton 1983 upton et al 2016 3 cretaceous sedimentary rocks outcrops tend to be limited and of infrequent occurrence across malawi the units tend to exhibit good storage and high permeability and tend to be highly fractured there are extensive deposits across the southern extent of the sadc that are significant sources of water government of malawi 2006 upton et al 2016 4 lower jurassic weathered karoo basalts outcrops are limited to small regions within malawi these can form a valuable localised resource due to spaces at contacts between lava flows and vesicular cavities providing a flow path for water alongside jointing and faulting of the lava permeability within the units is hence high which provides a high quality and low mineralized water source smith carrington and chilton 1983 5 quaternary unconsolidated alluvial deposits found across the flood plains of rivers these form malawi s most productive aquifers they are spatially variable across the country with highest quality water being available within gravel beds where permeability is high smith carrington and chilton 1983 malawi s groundwater resources are representative of the east of the sadc and parts of the south of the sadc where the basement complex is exposed similarities can also be seen throughout the world where large proportions of the groundwater come from basement rocks that tend to support only low yielding boreholes and provide only local water supplies parallel cases of large scale basement complex aquifers can be seen in south asia south america and australia wright and burgess 1992 3 review of malawi s current status of tba identification 3 1 regional context the main driving force for international tba assessments is the unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme through the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative and the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac igrac publishes a transboundary aquifers of the world map with all known tbas displayed based on the most recent inventory results from many projects globally this compilation of all international data constitutes a valuable starting point for governments there are 592 tba s currently identified worldwide 80 of these are located within africa fig 3 igrac 2015a b accounting for 43 of the continental land surface altchenko and villholth 2013 a large proportion of tba s within africa were identified through the global environment facility transboundary waters assessment program gef twap regional assessments ilec et al 2016 the aim of the gef twap was to provide the first global scale assessment of all transboundary waters gef twap regional assessments were carried out by an appropriate representative from each country and then collected and streamlined by the project 3 2 malawi context the gef twap and the most recent transboundary aquifers of the world map of the world map identify three tba s shared between malawi and its bordering neighbours table 1 fig 3 ilec et al 2016 igrac 2015a b malawi and its surrounding neighbours possess geological and hydrogeological maps geological survey of malawi 1970 government of malawi 1987 these data were used via the gef twap in 2014 ilec et al 2016 to assist in the reinterpretation of the extent of a tba previously identified as crossing the malawi tanzania and malawi zambia border further information was also collected on two other identified tba s shared between malawi and zambia and malawi and mozambique 3 3 tba assessment gaps a number of gaps have been identified that must be addressed in order for malawi to manage their aquifers on a local scale as well as nationally firstly the shire valley alluvial aquifer table 1 is not the only potential alluvial transboundary unit within malawi other small scale unconsolidated alluvial deposits can be found across the flood plains of other rivers throughout the country some of which are likely to be transboundary these have not been recognised on a regional scale most likely due to their limited extent and thickness although these smaller minor aquifers may not contribute large quantities of water to malawi and its neighbours small communities situated relatively close to the national border may rely exclusively upon them for local drinking water irrigation and other agricultural supply use the identification of small scale aquifers is also important in countries like malawi as they may provide baseflow to hydraulically connected river systems kingdon et al 1999 karoo sedimentary units and basalts also outcrop in malawi most of these units lie on the south west border of malawi and are transboundary with mozambique in many other parts of the southern african region the karoo super group has been seen to yield excellent quality and quantities of groundwater woodford and chevallier 2002 cheney et al 2006 this is potentially another tba shared between malawi and mozambique that could be a valuable groundwater resource locally within the twap regional assessment the complexity of the basement complex that underlies the sand and gravel tba table 1 is not considered ilec et al 2016 it is composed of multiple complex non uniform lithologies that are important when considering water storage and flow particularly close to the border these different lithological units are discontinuous and subject to fracturing by faults groundwater units of limited size are formed along these fracture zones which vary locally in their yield potential depending on lithology wright and burgess 1992 fractured basement aquifers often exhibit low transmissivity values and thus cross border groundwater flow may not be that significant still the extent of local flow regimes should be considered and in particular the potential for cross border flow and influence of abstraction from one border side upon the opposing side where local flow systems are more restrictive than previously thought limited groundwater present may be supplying larger populations than it can realistically support local assessments at national borders of the hydrogeological unit are hence needed to ensure that communities either side of a border sustainably and equitably use the local groundwater available storage within the basement complex is dependent on secondary porosity available due to weathering and fracturing which is also spatially variable upton et al 2016 weathering usually declines with depth and therefore higher yielding units occur nearer the surface smith carrington and chilton 1983 fracturing however forms along fault zones primarily within the rift valley of the southern limbs of the extensive ears given the local differences between the degree of weathering and fracturing within the basement complex lithologies these units cannot be considered as a single aquifer system and instead must be recognised to constitute multiple smaller systems dependent on the local conditions where local fracturing or weathering is significant enough so that groundwater can be stored there are therefore large non aquifer areas of the basement complex not capable of groundwater storage and other small local areas with intensive fractures or significant weathering providing sufficient yields upton et al 2016 these aquifers are hence more discontinuous in nature than the alluvial or sand and gravel systems making them less of a transboundary issue in some places again these factors point to the need for more local driven assessments of tba systems at national borders 3 4 legal provisions though transboundary surface water governance is regularly practiced nowadays transboundary groundwater governance has received comparatively little attention to date eckstein 2015 globally only six tba s have a governing agreement in place compared to over 3600 treaties relating to the use of transboundary surface waters unep 2002 cited by eckstein and sindico 2014 this deficiency has prompted our work under the climate justice fund water futures programme to support a country wide evaluation of all groundwater resources within malawi including tba potential scottish government 2017 there are currently no legally binding agreements between malawi and its neighbouring countries relating to the management of shared groundwater resources there is however some cooperation between malawi and mozambique concerning the management of the shire river basin in 2003 a treaty was signed by both parties on the agreement on the establishment of a joint water commission to improve responses to flooding in the basin iwmi 2015 a world bank funded project focused on the shire river basin is also on going but is primarily focused on the malawi side of the border it does not assess potential tba issues the world bank 2010 there are multiple protocols and policy instruments within the sadc that include groundwater and transboundary management within their scope these include the regional water policy adopted in 2005 the regional water strategy adopted in 2006 and the regional strategic action plan on integrated water resources and development management the most relevant to tba management is the revised protocol on shared watercourses sadc 2000 this protocol recognises that many watercourses within the sadc are shared among several member states it aims to foster closer cooperation amongst these states for the protection management and use of these shared watercourses within the region e g article 2 a article 3 8 a member states agree to cooperate on projects and exchange information on shared watercourses consulting with each other and collaborating on initiatives within malawi s own water resource act government of malawi 2013 a provision states that malawi must consider its obligations relating to shared waters part 4 section 41 e ii when granting an abstraction licence and issuing a permit to discharge effluent into a watercourse clarity is required in the forthcoming policy on how this provision binds malawi to uphold the sadc revised protocol on shared watercourses 2000 and customary international water law principles such as no significant harm or whether the provision is just a placeholder for any future obligation regarding shared waters that malawi might legally accept to be binding on it within international water law the unilc draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers 2008 ilc 2008 and the convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses 1997 unwc 2014 are two instruments available to countries looking to foster agreement over the management of their transboundary resources the watercourses convention is limited by its narrow and restricted definition of a watercourse which suggests that not all types of aquifers come under the regulations of the watercourse convention including fossil groundwater martin nagle 2016 furthermore the watercourse convention does not have a standard definition of what constitutes a tba alongside suggested criteria for the management of these resources the unilc draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers in contrast facilitate an international legal framework that focuses on all shared groundwater resources and conjunctive management of both groundwater and surface waters sanchez et al 2016 it does this by including both natural recharging and non recharging i e fossil tba s within its scope and recognising that tba s can be hydraulically linked to surface waters however they do have limitations of their own particularly within the exact definition of an aquifer and the exclusion of recharging only states i e those states from which recharge comes from but who hold not proportion of the aquifer within its border from the scope eckstein 2007 as draft articles they can only provide direction for member states and consequently only hold legal obligations if all involved states agree to utilize them if localised and regional tba management is to be supported by international law adopted instruments will need to recognise the complexity of the hydrogeological systems governed 4 discussion 4 1 a case for systematic national border based assessments many countries are now recognising the importance of tba identification as a contribution to iwrm they are assessing key tbas most often identified through regional initiatives such as the gef twap as previously described this includes western europe kazakhstan russia and the united states of america european commission 2015 puri and aureli 2005 zektser 2010 sanchez et al 2016 describe known tbas along the mexico usa border with a significant collation of available hydrogeological data the aquifer systems are laterally extensive and this mode of assessment may fail to resolve the potentially more local transboundary issues where more local minor aquifer assessments become more valid this need for greater resolution is alluded to by rivera 2015 who reviews the ten main identified tba systems along the canada usa border but acknowledges that more tbas likely remain to be resolved individual tba system assessments are more common for example the detailed assessment of the milk river formation between canada and the united states pétré et al 2016 pétré et al 2015 the study establishes a geological and hydrogeological conceptual model of the tba system characterising flow directions recharge zones and abstraction rates the conceptualisation underpins the development of effective strategies to sustainably manage the resource such dedicated aquifer system focused assessments whilst critical do not represent the whole transboundary circumstances of a country such detailed assessments also require extensive data and financial resources that may not be available to many developing countries our premise is that there is a need for countries to develop a tba assessment strategy that systematically screens its entire national border at relevant scales for some countries this may include local scales where more minor aquifers may form important resources that are relied upon by rural communities overall abstraction volumes may not be that large but still could be significant locally especially in sadc arid semi arid environments where recharge may be low this drives the need for relatively local tba assessment albeit within the context of the wider geological hydrogeological systems a flow diagram is developed in fig 4 to illustrate the fit of such a national border based tba assessment within an overall tba assessment framework the transboundary connectivity of the more major aquifer systems should not be assumed and requires consideration within the strategic approach fig 4 their potential locally discontinuous nature due to faulting and lithology variation heterogeneity needs to be understood detailed hydraulic functioning at local scales in the vicinity of national borders should be assessed with particular emphasis on assessing evidence for barriers to groundwater flow this may be aided by improved recording archiving and computer access to geological log water level and geophysical monitoring data than is often not practiced in the developing world for both minor and major aquifer systems the potential complicating influence of surface water flows hydraulically connected to these aquifer systems also needs to be explicitly recognised at relevant scales fig 4 groundwater surface water interactions may result in groundwater flow to surface water and vice versa these may alter seasonally and groundwater abstraction variation conditions may likewise vary upstream and downstream of a country border the aim of national border based assessments will be to allow for identification of a country s groundwater resources that are most vulnerable to tba influence and cross border flows whilst a desk based study may frequently lack data and resources to make a complete assessment it should enable some prioritisation and selection of higher risk tba scenarios that warrant further analysis and targeted field data collection fig 4 contributing metrics to evaluating the at risk status may include not only tba hydraulic connectivity but also consideration of near border population levels and relative water abstraction rates either side of a border such an approach helps to address sdg 6 target 6 5 requiring iwrm with transboundary cooperation where necessary united nations 2017 our on going tba assessment work in malawi seeks to account for the expected discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from lithologies and will consider the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex to evaluate the significance of transboundary groundwater exchange the first results of the reinterpretation of the hydro stratigraphic units shared with mozambique in the southern extent of malawi fig 5 illustrate the complexity that can be lost in a regional scale assessment whereas the twap ilec et al 2016 southern and eastern africa sub region recognises only one tba system the shire valley alluvial aquifer in reality exists a multilayer sedimentary aquifer and a discontinuous basement complex system that dominates a large proportion of the border 4 2 conceptual models for tba interactions a series of illustrative conceptual models of tba interactions applicable to the malawian national border are developed below they are anticipated to be of generic value elsewhere particularly across the sadc these models assume low thickness alluvial or basement complex aquifers with low to moderate transmissivity hydraulic conductivity at or near the border fig 6 portrays an idealised low thickness symmetric i e the national border lies in the middle of the aquifer fig 6 a illustrates the aquifer s natural conditions and fig 6 b shows the addition of a sustainable abstractions either side of the border the flow divide remains central with the resource equally shared increased groundwater abstraction may still result in an equal resource share either side of the border but a non sustainable use and ultimately a loss of groundwater and negative impacts on surface water losing rivers on both sides of the border fig 6d illustrates unequal abstraction which shifts the groundwater flow divide resulting in the share of groundwater becoming unequal and considerable surface water impact due to a drop in the water table the final scenario is particularly pertinent to malawi where local villages close to the border are heavily reliant on groundwater supplied from thin but abundant alluvial aquifers some of which are transboundary equally the reverse is also possible if a neighbouring state has a higher abstraction rate fig 7 conceptualises a low thickness alluvial aquifer with the country border in an asymmetric position a better representation of reality the recharge across the border is not equal and a larger proportion of the aquifer resides within one country abstraction b on one side of the border complicates the situation by shifting the flow divide away from the border and this impacts surface water within the abstracting state importantly the abstraction also increases the speed at which the groundwater is moving across the border as a steeper gradient across the border causes an increase in transboundary flow climate change or deforestation within the scenario could also reduce recharge significantly within the system as is the case for figs 6 8 and 9 fig 8 conceptualises a semi confined system where the tba is not receiving natural recharge on one side of the border due to an overlying low permeability aquitard recharge to the confined aquifer occurs to one side of the border during natural conditions fig 8 a the confined section of the aquifer on the other side of the border is under artesian pressure resulting in upward leakage through the aquitard and into the aquifer above this leakage hence provides some support to river flow to the right of the border contributing to baseflow adding an abstraction on either side of the border could cause leakage to be reversed resulting in a losing river scenario fig 8b and c increased abstraction may result in complete loss of baseflow to the river such cases are illustrative of tba connectivity on the management of both surface and groundwater resources the final conceptual model fig 9 is of basement complex with an overlying discontinuous alluvial aquifer a common scenario across the sadc assuming a natural flow regime there are a variety of transboundary implications based on where the border sits borders a e borders a and e for example result in transboundary groundwater flow through both unconsolidated alluvial sediments and fractured basement rock borders b and d would exhibit just fractured rock groundwater flow and border c close to the groundwater flow divide would have fairly limited groundwater contributions from the opposing border side contributing to aquitard leakage and the shown spring discharge this conceptualization highlights how variable aquifer lithologies and discontinuities throughout the basement complex can cause different transboundary system types that need to be considered on an individual and local basis fig 9 could have been developed to portray a different basement complex lithology or a weathered zone instead of a no fracture zone this again could result in the unit being broken up into smaller aquifer units 5 integrated water resource management iwrm although widely recognised that groundwater is an integral part of many hydrological systems many iwrm schemes still omit transboundary groundwater from their scope whilst some groundwater resources may appear to have weak hydraulic connectivity to other system compartments or contain fossil groundwater martin nagle 2011 many systems do display significant connectivity between groundwater and surface water systems rivera 2015 it is critical to recognise this connectivity within any tba assessment and iwrm framework adopted water resource units wrus have long been defined in malawi that sub divide the country into 17 separate physiographic regions and 66 sub region units based upon surface water catchments smith carrington and chilton 1983 more holistic iwrm at a national level needs to recognise that many aquifers cross these units and thereby allow water transfer between them this may result in iwrm tensions as neighbouring unit officials could manage their connected groundwater resources differently this scenario may be further complicated where transboundary issues also arise iwrm of tbas requires consideration of not only recharge sources and abstraction areas but also surface water recharge discharge connectivity to these aquifer systems future water resource policy in malawi will need to increasingly recognise that linkage of physiographic regions and groundwater including transboundary groundwater is required to achieve iwrm and sdg 6 it is not unreasonably surmised that similar challenges with local variation to those faced by malawi are likewise faced by other countries various foundations for iwrm and hence tba management beyond malawian borders are provided for by surface water catchment based initiatives within africa river basin organizations rbos have been developed to foster joint water cooperation between stakeholder countries built upon the african water vision 2025 un economic commission for africa 2001 malawi is part of the zambezi watercourse commission zamcom one of six river basin organizations within the sadc region similar to the malawian wrus these are surface water catchment management based often without mandate to manage transboundary groundwater or coordinate its management between the stakeholder basin states where mandates do exist e g orange senqu river commission technical skill or financial resource limitations inhibit the progress of groundwater management consequently the groundwater aspect of the river basin is often managed indirectly to the rest of the hydraulic system fostering institutes that cooperate conjunctively on hydraulically linked surface and groundwater management on both the local national and international scale is advocated to move forward with iwrm within the sadc recent progressive effort to account for groundwater management within sadc member states is evident through establishment of the sadc groundwater management institute sadc gmi hosted by the institute for groundwater studies in bloemfontein south africa their aim is to support the sustainable management of groundwater at national and transboundary levels across sadc member states sadc gmi 2016 our national border based tba assessment approach is seen to support this initiative 6 conclusion and recommendations integrated water resource management of transboundary groundwater is becoming increasingly important and can vitally underpin international achievement of sdg 6 this paper has critically assessed previously identified tbas in malawi and introduced the need for malawi and other countries to more generally develop a tba strategy that systematically examines its entire national border at relevant scales in order to establish and prioritise tba connectivity it is fundamentally built around conceptual models of tba connectivity and interaction that are presented here and offer generic value elsewhere within the african developing world context personified by malawi an entire national border approach may initially require local scale desk based assessments driven by the presence of rural low density populations dispersed community water points frequent minor aquifer systems and the potential for disconnected aquifer units e g by faulting or weathering whilst aquifers are often minor they are nonetheless critically important to life and livelihoods in most cases our proposed approach outlined and on going in terms of detailed assessments throughout the malawian national border length is necessarily desk based due to resource constraints in the developing world it is nonetheless expected to vitally steer where future tba efforts may be targeted our border based tba assessment approach is vitally overarched by an iwrm framework that recognises the connectivity of groundwater and surface water as a single hydraulic system such an approach is critical to informing and developing appropriate national management policies international cooperation and the development and implementation of science informed tba agreements that are workable international law and policy guidance will need to recognise the complexity of hydrogeological hydrological systems although the draft articles as indicated are moving in the right direction limitations must be addressed in order to facilitate a framework that promotes iwrm of tba systems it is anticipated that such recognitions and approaches will pave the way for appropriate local regional scaled sustainable and equitable management of the tbas identified

8469,study region malawi study focus integrated water resource management iwrm of transboundary aquifers tba s is becoming increasingly important without adequate and accurate scientific knowledge of their extent and characteristics uninformed policy creation could lead to unsustainable management of these vital resources this is particularly important within the southern african development community sadc where up to 85 of domestic water is supplied by groundwater in this paper malawi is used as a case study to critically evaluate the current transboundary aquifer assessment frameworks within the region and their value in promoting iwrm a series of illustrative conceptual models of tba interactions pertinent to the malawian national border are presented and we consider how tba assessments may be integrated to national iwrm and strategic policy development new hydrological insights for the region current tba assessments of malawi and the wider sadc neglect multiple aspects needed for a national scale management plan this includes full border tba system identification alongside given the geology of the region consideration of the discontinuous nature of basement complex aquifers and localised alluvial deposits that both result in smaller scale aquifer units conceptualising such local scale complexity and encouraging countries to develop a strategy that systematically examines tba systems along their national border at relevant scales will allow for more focused conjunctive policy creation and sustainable management of tba s keywords transboundary groundwater hydrogeology integrated water resources management africa malawi 1 introduction groundwater has often been described as an invisible resource yet it is important to recognise that almost 98 of the world s available freshwater resources is groundwater integrated water resources management iwrm acknowledges the important role of groundwater within frameworks that can sometimes be unduly surface water focused the importance of iwrm is recognised in sustainable development goal sdg 6 to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all united nations 2017 groundwater development is central to meeting sdg 6 a pressing need though iwrm is to recognise that many aquifers identified for resource use may cross national borders it is then critical that transboundary cooperation comes into play to allow sustainable and equitable groundwater use by stakeholder nations involved worldwide water use is increasing due to growing water sanitation and hygiene wash demands africa is heavily reliant upon groundwater including transboundary groundwater with an estimated 75 of its population dependent on this resource for basic water supplies altchenko and villholth 2013 investment in reliable water supplies will continue to depend on the development of groundwater resources this may include the exploitation of transboundary aquifers tba s giordano 2009 macdonald and calow 2009 this paper will focus primarily on malawi one of the 15 countries within the southern african development community sadc a sub continental region of africa where widespread groundwater development is needed to address sdg 6 effective groundwater management by some sadc member nations is faced by multiple challenges these include little or no adherence to abstraction licensing legislation low annual natural recharge in arid to semi arid localities low aquifer storage and vulnerability to climate change all of which provide critical impetus to the development of a science based strategy for groundwater management smith carrington and chilton 1983 the term transboundary water is used to describe a water body that crosses two or more international country borders this can be in the form of rivers lakes and groundwater un water 2014 an aquifer is a hydrostratographic unit that stores and transmits groundwater an aquifer becomes transboundary when it crosses one or more international political border and thus has the potential for groundwater exchange between neighbouring countries wada and heinrich 2013 the challenge faced by countries is to reliably define aquifer connectivity and groundwater movement at their borders often this is with limited data available or data not shared this knowledge then needs to be translated to accessible conceptual models that can underpin science based policy implementation clearly and accurately we propose that in order to meet sdg 6 there is a need for countries to develop strategies that systematically identifies and screens tba units along its national border this will allow countries to characterise tba connectivity and transmission of groundwater over their entire national border length this includes conceptualising how abstraction on one side of a border may influence groundwater and surface water availability on the opposing side where influence is judged to be significant this should trigger development of joint data collation efforts to underpin tba policy and agreements we further advocate that systematic tba screening along a national border should not only examine major aquifer systems where connectivity is already known but also include minor aquifer systems whilst not as geographically extensive individual minor aquifer tba s may be locally significance especially where relatively short distances separate neighbouring country communities furthermore tba connectivity of more major aquifer systems should not be assumed whilst extensive over tens of km scales or more aquifers may still be locally discontinuous e g due to structural faulting and weathering differences and their local connectivity should be assessed within the developing world context technical data and financial resources are often limited here desk based screening using available data to conceptualise tba connectivity is critical development of conceptual models of tba interaction within a wider system both generic and locally bespoke is fundamental consideration of the tba status of malawi a low income developing country bordered by mozambique tanzania and zambia is made here as an example a critical assessment of the current status of tba s in malawi is presented with the overarching goal to contribute to the development of a malawian

in africa malawi s population is estimated to be 18 3 million worldometers 2017 of which 90 live in rural areas its main economic income is generated from agriculture with subsistence farming common amongst the rural population government of malawi 2012 with less than 1400 m3 year person of available total renewable water resources malawi is one of the most water stressed countries in the world government of malawi 2012 this is largely due to the lack of infrastructure within the country to support large scale management of water resources and much of its rural population accessing groundwater through hand dug wells or low capacity boreholes fitted with hand pumps tens of thousands of water points now exist across malawi pavelic et al 2012 and added to daily under the sdg 6 agenda efforts with the population of malawi set to rise to 26 5 million by 2030 and renewable water resources likely to decline due to deforestation and climate change impact malawi could become water scarce with available total renewable water falling below 1000 m3 year person in the next 13 years these valuable groundwater resources are vulnerable to pollution threats that may be poorly constrained back et al 2018 sparse monitoring of both groundwater quality and level can also lead to a poor knowledge base for management rivett et al 2018a such factors and others indirectly influence the strategic development of tba assessment and management rivett et al 2018b 2 1 1 regional geology and hydrogeology the geology of the sadc is varied it is composed of a combination of crystalline basin complex rock units interconnected with younger orogenic belts of metamorphic rocks and large sedimentary basins underlain by basement the east of the region is heavily influenced by structural tectonics creating a complex geological history ramoeli et al 2009 the east african rift system ears runs 2100 km from uganda to malawi and formed during the onset of the miocene it can be seen at the surface as aligned tectonic basins forming rift valleys separated by uplifted continental blocks chorowicz 2005 that extend from mozambique to ethiopia the rifts of the western branch of the ears where malawi resides fig 2 are often filled with sediments or water specht and rosendahl 1989 2 1 2 malawi geology and hydrogeology the ears large scale rifting heavily influenced the topography and morphology of malawi monjerezi and ngongondo 2012 this is through the creation of four main physiographic areas the plateau the uplands the rift valley escarpment and rift valley plains the plateau area represents the largest proportion of the topography of malawi and is comprised of highly faulted basement gneiss smith carrington and chilton 1983 the rift valley where the shire river basin is located forms the most significant structural feature of malawi it comprises a series of half grabens that section into 60 100 km long extensional basins formed by faulting offset from the ears this is bordered on one side by steep normal faults and by en echelon step faults with minor vertical offset on the other side of the valley ebinger et al 1987 ring and betzler 1995 fig 2 these rift events have played a significant role in the distribution of the aquifer lithologies within malawi and the sadc smith carrington and chilton 1983 differing lithologies in malawi provide varying productive water bearing units theoretically allowing a large proportion of malawi access to groundwater accurate knowledge of the geology and hydrogeology is important to determine the aquifers that may be transboundary the main water bearing geological units in malawi are summarised below in order of increasing importance bradford 1973 1 precambrian to lower palaeozoic weathered and or fractured basement rocks composed of metamorphic rocks of varying lithology but primarily gneiss and granulites these are malawi s most abundant geological units and account for 96 of the total land cover these are low storage and low transmissivity aquifers with borehole yields between 0 5 and 0 8l s government of malawi 2006 upton et al 2016 2 permian to triassic karoo sedimentary rocks units exhibit low porosity and intergranular permeability due to calcite cementation groundwater flows through fractures and thus aquifers have low to moderate productivity although this may be increased in the south of malawi where more heavily faulted smith carrington and chilton 1983 upton et al 2016 3 cretaceous sedimentary rocks outcrops tend to be limited and of infrequent occurrence across malawi the units tend to exhibit good storage and high permeability and tend to be highly fractured there are extensive deposits across the southern extent of the sadc that are significant sources of water government of malawi 2006 upton et al 2016 4 lower jurassic weathered karoo basalts outcrops are limited to small regions within malawi these can form a valuable localised resource due to spaces at contacts between lava flows and vesicular cavities providing a flow path for water alongside jointing and faulting of the lava permeability within the units is hence high which provides a high quality and low mineralized water source smith carrington and chilton 1983 5 quaternary unconsolidated alluvial deposits found across the flood plains of rivers these form malawi s most productive aquifers they are spatially variable across the country with highest quality water being available within gravel beds where permeability is high smith carrington and chilton 1983 malawi s groundwater resources are representative of the east of the sadc and parts of the south of the sadc where the basement complex is exposed similarities can also be seen throughout the world where large proportions of the groundwater come from basement rocks that tend to support only low yielding boreholes and provide only local water supplies parallel cases of large scale basement complex aquifers can be seen in south asia south america and australia wright and burgess 1992 3 review of malawi s current status of tba identification 3 1 regional context the main driving force for international tba assessments is the unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme through the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm initiative and the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac igrac publishes a transboundary aquifers of the world map with all known tbas displayed based on the most recent inventory results from many projects globally this compilation of all international data constitutes a valuable starting point for governments there are 592 tba s currently identified worldwide 80 of these are located within africa fig 3 igrac 2015a b accounting for 43 of the continental land surface altchenko and villholth 2013 a large proportion of tba s within africa were identified through the global environment facility transboundary waters assessment program gef twap regional assessments ilec et al 2016 the aim of the gef twap was to provide the first global scale assessment of all transboundary waters gef twap regional assessments were carried out by an appropriate representative from each country and then collected and streamlined by the project 3 2 malawi context the gef twap and the most recent transboundary aquifers of the world map of the world map identify three tba s shared between malawi and its bordering neighbours table 1 fig 3 ilec et al 2016 igrac 2015a b malawi and its surrounding neighbours possess geological and hydrogeological maps geological survey of malawi 1970 government of malawi 1987 these data were used via the gef twap in 2014 ilec et al 2016 to assist in the reinterpretation of the extent of a tba previously identified as crossing the malawi tanzania and malawi zambia border further information was also collected on two other identified tba s shared between malawi and zambia and malawi and mozambique 3 3 tba assessment gaps a number of gaps have been identified that must be addressed in order for malawi to manage their aquifers on a local scale as well as nationally firstly the shire valley alluvial aquifer table 1 is not the only potential alluvial transboundary unit within malawi other small scale unconsolidated alluvial deposits can be found across the flood plains of other rivers throughout the country some of which are likely to be transboundary these have not been recognised on a regional scale most likely due to their limited extent and thickness although these smaller minor aquifers may not contribute large quantities of water to malawi and its neighbours small communities situated relatively close to the national border may rely exclusively upon them for local drinking water irrigation and other agricultural supply use the identification of small scale aquifers is also important in countries like malawi as they may provide baseflow to hydraulically connected river systems kingdon et al 1999 karoo sedimentary units and basalts also outcrop in malawi most of these units lie on the south west border of malawi and are transboundary with mozambique in many other parts of the southern african region the karoo super group has been seen to yield excellent quality and quantities of groundwater woodford and chevallier 2002 cheney et al 2006 this is potentially another tba shared between malawi and mozambique that could be a valuable groundwater resource locally within the twap regional assessment the complexity of the basement complex that underlies the sand and gravel tba table 1 is not considered ilec et al 2016 it is composed of multiple complex non uniform lithologies that are important when considering water storage and flow particularly close to the border these different lithological units are discontinuous and subject to fracturing by faults groundwater units of limited size are formed along these fracture zones which vary locally in their yield potential depending on lithology wright and burgess 1992 fractured basement aquifers often exhibit low transmissivity values and thus cross border groundwater flow may not be that significant still the extent of local flow regimes should be considered and in particular the potential for cross border flow and influence of abstraction from one border side upon the opposing side where local flow systems are more restrictive than previously thought limited groundwater present may be supplying larger populations than it can realistically support local assessments at national borders of the hydrogeological unit are hence needed to ensure that communities either side of a border sustainably and equitably use the local groundwater available storage within the basement complex is dependent on secondary porosity available due to weathering and fracturing which is also spatially variable upton et al 2016 weathering usually declines with depth and therefore higher yielding units occur nearer the surface smith carrington and chilton 1983 fracturing however forms along fault zones primarily within the rift valley of the southern limbs of the extensive ears given the local differences between the degree of weathering and fracturing within the basement complex lithologies these units cannot be considered as a single aquifer system and instead must be recognised to constitute multiple smaller systems dependent on the local conditions where local fracturing or weathering is significant enough so that groundwater can be stored there are therefore large non aquifer areas of the basement complex not capable of groundwater storage and other small local areas with intensive fractures or significant weathering providing sufficient yields upton et al 2016 these aquifers are hence more discontinuous in nature than the alluvial or sand and gravel systems making them less of a transboundary issue in some places again these factors point to the need for more local driven assessments of tba systems at national borders 3 4 legal provisions though transboundary surface water governance is regularly practiced nowadays transboundary groundwater governance has received comparatively little attention to date eckstein 2015 globally only six tba s have a governing agreement in place compared to over 3600 treaties relating to the use of transboundary surface waters unep 2002 cited by eckstein and sindico 2014 this deficiency has prompted our work under the climate justice fund water futures programme to support a country wide evaluation of all groundwater resources within malawi including tba potential scottish government 2017 there are currently no legally binding agreements between malawi and its neighbouring countries relating to the management of shared groundwater resources there is however some cooperation between malawi and mozambique concerning the management of the shire river basin in 2003 a treaty was signed by both parties on the agreement on the establishment of a joint water commission to improve responses to flooding in the basin iwmi 2015 a world bank funded project focused on the shire river basin is also on going but is primarily focused on the malawi side of the border it does not assess potential tba issues the world bank 2010 there are multiple protocols and policy instruments within the sadc that include groundwater and transboundary management within their scope these include the regional water policy adopted in 2005 the regional water strategy adopted in 2006 and the regional strategic action plan on integrated water resources and development management the most relevant to tba management is the revised protocol on shared watercourses sadc 2000 this protocol recognises that many watercourses within the sadc are shared among several member states it aims to foster closer cooperation amongst these states for the protection management and use of these shared watercourses within the region e g article 2 a article 3 8 a member states agree to cooperate on projects and exchange information on shared watercourses consulting with each other and collaborating on initiatives within malawi s own water resource act government of malawi 2013 a provision states that malawi must consider its obligations relating to shared waters part 4 section 41 e ii when granting an abstraction licence and issuing a permit to discharge effluent into a watercourse clarity is required in the forthcoming policy on how this provision binds malawi to uphold the sadc revised protocol on shared watercourses 2000 and customary international water law principles such as no significant harm or whether the provision is just a placeholder for any future obligation regarding shared waters that malawi might legally accept to be binding on it within international water law the unilc draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers 2008 ilc 2008 and the convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses 1997 unwc 2014 are two instruments available to countries looking to foster agreement over the management of their transboundary resources the watercourses convention is limited by its narrow and restricted definition of a watercourse which suggests that not all types of aquifers come under the regulations of the watercourse convention including fossil groundwater martin nagle 2016 furthermore the watercourse convention does not have a standard definition of what constitutes a tba alongside suggested criteria for the management of these resources the unilc draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers in contrast facilitate an international legal framework that focuses on all shared groundwater resources and conjunctive management of both groundwater and surface waters sanchez et al 2016 it does this by including both natural recharging and non recharging i e fossil tba s within its scope and recognising that tba s can be hydraulically linked to surface waters however they do have limitations of their own particularly within the exact definition of an aquifer and the exclusion of recharging only states i e those states from which recharge comes from but who hold not proportion of the aquifer within its border from the scope eckstein 2007 as draft articles they can only provide direction for member states and consequently only hold legal obligations if all involved states agree to utilize them if localised and regional tba management is to be supported by international law adopted instruments will need to recognise the complexity of the hydrogeological systems governed 4 discussion 4 1 a case for systematic national border based assessments many countries are now recognising the importance of tba identification as a contribution to iwrm they are assessing key tbas most often identified through regional initiatives such as the gef twap as previously described this includes western europe kazakhstan russia and the united states of america european commission 2015 puri and aureli 2005 zektser 2010 sanchez et al 2016 describe known tbas along the mexico usa border with a significant collation of available hydrogeological data the aquifer systems are laterally extensive and this mode of assessment may fail to resolve the potentially more local transboundary issues where more local minor aquifer assessments become more valid this need for greater resolution is alluded to by rivera 2015 who reviews the ten main identified tba systems along the canada usa border but acknowledges that more tbas likely remain to be resolved individual tba system assessments are more common for example the detailed assessment of the milk river formation between canada and the united states pétré et al 2016 pétré et al 2015 the study establishes a geological and hydrogeological conceptual model of the tba system characterising flow directions recharge zones and abstraction rates the conceptualisation underpins the development of effective strategies to sustainably manage the resource such dedicated aquifer system focused assessments whilst critical do not represent the whole transboundary circumstances of a country such detailed assessments also require extensive data and financial resources that may not be available to many developing countries our premise is that there is a need for countries to develop a tba assessment strategy that systematically screens its entire national border at relevant scales for some countries this may include local scales where more minor aquifers may form important resources that are relied upon by rural communities overall abstraction volumes may not be that large but still could be significant locally especially in sadc arid semi arid environments where recharge may be low this drives the need for relatively local tba assessment albeit within the context of the wider geological hydrogeological systems a flow diagram is developed in fig 4 to illustrate the fit of such a national border based tba assessment within an overall tba assessment framework the transboundary connectivity of the more major aquifer systems should not be assumed and requires consideration within the strategic approach fig 4 their potential locally discontinuous nature due to faulting and lithology variation heterogeneity needs to be understood detailed hydraulic functioning at local scales in the vicinity of national borders should be assessed with particular emphasis on assessing evidence for barriers to groundwater flow this may be aided by improved recording archiving and computer access to geological log water level and geophysical monitoring data than is often not practiced in the developing world for both minor and major aquifer systems the potential complicating influence of surface water flows hydraulically connected to these aquifer systems also needs to be explicitly recognised at relevant scales fig 4 groundwater surface water interactions may result in groundwater flow to surface water and vice versa these may alter seasonally and groundwater abstraction variation conditions may likewise vary upstream and downstream of a country border the aim of national border based assessments will be to allow for identification of a country s groundwater resources that are most vulnerable to tba influence and cross border flows whilst a desk based study may frequently lack data and resources to make a complete assessment it should enable some prioritisation and selection of higher risk tba scenarios that warrant further analysis and targeted field data collection fig 4 contributing metrics to evaluating the at risk status may include not only tba hydraulic connectivity but also consideration of near border population levels and relative water abstraction rates either side of a border such an approach helps to address sdg 6 target 6 5 requiring iwrm with transboundary cooperation where necessary united nations 2017 our on going tba assessment work in malawi seeks to account for the expected discontinuous nature of the basement complex arising from lithologies and will consider the differences between the weathered and fractured zones within the basement complex to evaluate the significance of transboundary groundwater exchange the first results of the reinterpretation of the hydro stratigraphic units shared with mozambique in the southern extent of malawi fig 5 illustrate the complexity that can be lost in a regional scale assessment whereas the twap ilec et al 2016 southern and eastern africa sub region recognises only one tba system the shire valley alluvial aquifer in reality exists a multilayer sedimentary aquifer and a discontinuous basement complex system that dominates a large proportion of the border 4 2 conceptual models for tba interactions a series of illustrative conceptual models of tba interactions applicable to the malawian national border are developed below they are anticipated to be of generic value elsewhere particularly across the sadc these models assume low thickness alluvial or basement complex aquifers with low to moderate transmissivity hydraulic conductivity at or near the border fig 6 portrays an idealised low thickness symmetric i e the national border lies in the middle of the aquifer fig 6 a illustrates the aquifer s natural conditions and fig 6 b shows the addition of a sustainable abstractions either side of the border the flow divide remains central with the resource equally shared increased groundwater abstraction may still result in an equal resource share either side of the border but a non sustainable use and ultimately a loss of groundwater and negative impacts on surface water losing rivers on both sides of the border fig 6d illustrates unequal abstraction which shifts the groundwater flow divide resulting in the share of groundwater becoming unequal and considerable surface water impact due to a drop in the water table the final scenario is particularly pertinent to malawi where local villages close to the border are heavily reliant on groundwater supplied from thin but abundant alluvial aquifers some of which are transboundary equally the reverse is also possible if a neighbouring state has a higher abstraction rate fig 7 conceptualises a low thickness alluvial aquifer with the country border in an asymmetric position a better representation of reality the recharge across the border is not equal and a larger proportion of the aquifer resides within one country abstraction b on one side of the border complicates the situation by shifting the flow divide away from the border and this impacts surface water within the abstracting state importantly the abstraction also increases the speed at which the groundwater is moving across the border as a steeper gradient across the border causes an increase in transboundary flow climate change or deforestation within the scenario could also reduce recharge significantly within the system as is the case for figs 6 8 and 9 fig 8 conceptualises a semi confined system where the tba is not receiving natural recharge on one side of the border due to an overlying low permeability aquitard recharge to the confined aquifer occurs to one side of the border during natural conditions fig 8 a the confined section of the aquifer on the other side of the border is under artesian pressure resulting in upward leakage through the aquitard and into the aquifer above this leakage hence provides some support to river flow to the right of the border contributing to baseflow adding an abstraction on either side of the border could cause leakage to be reversed resulting in a losing river scenario fig 8b and c increased abstraction may result in complete loss of baseflow to the river such cases are illustrative of tba connectivity on the management of both surface and groundwater resources the final conceptual model fig 9 is of basement complex with an overlying discontinuous alluvial aquifer a common scenario across the sadc assuming a natural flow regime there are a variety of transboundary implications based on where the border sits borders a e borders a and e for example result in transboundary groundwater flow through both unconsolidated alluvial sediments and fractured basement rock borders b and d would exhibit just fractured rock groundwater flow and border c close to the groundwater flow divide would have fairly limited groundwater contributions from the opposing border side contributing to aquitard leakage and the shown spring discharge this conceptualization highlights how variable aquifer lithologies and discontinuities throughout the basement complex can cause different transboundary system types that need to be considered on an individual and local basis fig 9 could have been developed to portray a different basement complex lithology or a weathered zone instead of a no fracture zone this again could result in the unit being broken up into smaller aquifer units 5 integrated water resource management iwrm although widely recognised that groundwater is an integral part of many hydrological systems many iwrm schemes still omit transboundary groundwater from their scope whilst some groundwater resources may appear to have weak hydraulic connectivity to other system compartments or contain fossil groundwater martin nagle 2011 many systems do display significant connectivity between groundwater and surface water systems rivera 2015 it is critical to recognise this connectivity within any tba assessment and iwrm framework adopted water resource units wrus have long been defined in malawi that sub divide the country into 17 separate physiographic regions and 66 sub region units based upon surface water catchments smith carrington and chilton 1983 more holistic iwrm at a national level needs to recognise that many aquifers cross these units and thereby allow water transfer between them this may result in iwrm tensions as neighbouring unit officials could manage their connected groundwater resources differently this scenario may be further complicated where transboundary issues also arise iwrm of tbas requires consideration of not only recharge sources and abstraction areas but also surface water recharge discharge connectivity to these aquifer systems future water resource policy in malawi will need to increasingly recognise that linkage of physiographic regions and groundwater including transboundary groundwater is required to achieve iwrm and sdg 6 it is not unreasonably surmised that similar challenges with local variation to those faced by malawi are likewise faced by other countries various foundations for iwrm and hence tba management beyond malawian borders are provided for by surface water catchment based initiatives within africa river basin organizations rbos have been developed to foster joint water cooperation between stakeholder countries built upon the african water vision 2025 un economic commission for africa 2001 malawi is part of the zambezi watercourse commission zamcom one of six river basin organizations within the sadc region similar to the malawian wrus these are surface water catchment management based often without mandate to manage transboundary groundwater or coordinate its management between the stakeholder basin states where mandates do exist e g orange senqu river commission technical skill or financial resource limitations inhibit the progress of groundwater management consequently the groundwater aspect of the river basin is often managed indirectly to the rest of the hydraulic system fostering institutes that cooperate conjunctively on hydraulically linked surface and groundwater management on both the local national and international scale is advocated to move forward with iwrm within the sadc recent progressive effort to account for groundwater management within sadc member states is evident through establishment of the sadc groundwater management institute sadc gmi hosted by the institute for groundwater studies in bloemfontein south africa their aim is to support the sustainable management of groundwater at national and transboundary levels across sadc member states sadc gmi 2016 our national border based tba assessment approach is seen to support this initiative 6 conclusion and recommendations integrated water resource management of transboundary groundwater is becoming increasingly important and can vitally underpin international achievement of sdg 6 this paper has critically assessed previously identified tbas in malawi and introduced the need for malawi and other countries to more generally develop a tba strategy that systematically examines its entire national border at relevant scales in order to establish and prioritise tba connectivity it is fundamentally built around conceptual models of tba connectivity and interaction that are presented here and offer generic value elsewhere within the african developing world context personified by malawi an entire national border approach may initially require local scale desk based assessments driven by the presence of rural low density populations dispersed community water points frequent minor aquifer systems and the potential for disconnected aquifer units e g by faulting or weathering whilst aquifers are often minor they are nonetheless critically important to life and livelihoods in most cases our proposed approach outlined and on going in terms of detailed assessments throughout the malawian national border length is necessarily desk based due to resource constraints in the developing world it is nonetheless expected to vitally steer where future tba efforts may be targeted our border based tba assessment approach is vitally overarched by an iwrm framework that recognises the connectivity of groundwater and surface water as a single hydraulic system such an approach is critical to informing and developing appropriate national management policies international cooperation and the development and implementation of science informed tba agreements that are workable international law and policy guidance will need to recognise the complexity of hydrogeological hydrological systems although the draft articles as indicated are moving in the right direction limitations must be addressed in order to facilitate a framework that promotes iwrm of tba systems it is anticipated that such recognitions and approaches will pave the way for appropriate local regional scaled sustainable and equitable management of the tbas identified
