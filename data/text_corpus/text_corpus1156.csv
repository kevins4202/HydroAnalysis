25 and 0 10 to 1 59 respectively the isotope ratios of the stream base flow were consistent with the groundwater isoscape and seasonally enriched by evaporation most enriched water are found in raised bogs and large lakes the most depleted water is found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater in a forest site with sandy soil the most enriched water was associated with significant short lived

lake burtnieks groundwater and a raised bog as well as in the river salaca drainage which emerges from the lake and its tributaries unexpectedly we found strong heavy isotope enrichment that was propagated through the hydrological cycle during periods of snowmelt and excessive precipitation that were associated with water impoundment on land surface 2 site description 2 1 physical geography this study was conducted on the scale of the watershed an upstream section of the river salaca in the north eastern part of latvia near the gulf of riga in the baltic sea fig 1 its drainage basin is situated in the lowlands of northern latvia and southern estonia the salaca headwater is the shallow lake burtnieks the lake is the main source of river flow and moderates seasonal discharge parameters input from tributaries is estimated at about 14 table 1 however the groundwater contribution is not known a 43 km section of the river salaca starting at lake burtnieks was considered in this section the river flows through a valley carved into poorly consolidated devonian sandstones capped by clay rich glacial till and outwash sediments sandstone cliffs are punctuated by springs and suffusion caves associated with springs the valley floor is as much as 20 m below the surrounding landscape 2 2 climate and hydrology according to the köppen geiger classification he study site has a warm summer humid continental dfb hemiboreal climate klocking et al 2006 the average annual air temperature is 5 9 c the warmest month is july with an average temperature of 17 c while the coldest

total amount and 80 of summer precipitation is lost to evapotranspiration briede and rodinovs 1993 annual fluctuations of the groundwater table indicating periods of recharge were characterised by an m shaped curve one maximum occurred in april due to infiltration of and another maximum began in september and culminated in december tolstovs et al 1986 reflecting increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration in autumn precipitation water is evapotranspirated in summer while freezing conditions in winter preclude infiltration tolstovs et al 1986 however due to milder winters in recent years the two groundwater table maxima tend to merge lauva et al 2012 in the catchment of the salaca river the runoff is primarily generated by precipitation that is classified as marine conditions by kriauciuniene et al 2012 the long term average specific drainage of the middle reaches of the salaca river is 8 l s km2 annually and 2 3 5 l s km2 in summer the flow velocity in summer is 0 1 to 0 3 m s down to mazsalaca and 0 3 to 0 4 m s downstream of mazsalaca briede and rodinovs 1993 it takes one or two days for water to travel the 43 km from the lake s outlet to the lowermost observation site macrophyte overgrowth on the river in summertime exceeds 30 grīnberga and spriņģe 2008 diminishing the flow velocity the catchment area of the salaca river tributaries iģe and ramata are 212 and 190 km2 respectively while the catchment of the salaca itself from the outlet to the entry of the iģe is 203 km2 the land surface is mostly covered by agriculture forests and raised bogs table 1 urban industrial areas comprise less than 1 the extent of the wetlands might be underestimated in the corine database european environment agency 2016 as some sources report up to 15 bog cover briede and rodinovs 1993 the soil is composed of sands loam glacial till or peat the catchment of the small river piģele is almost entirely 83 covered by raised bogs klavins et al 2012 lake burtnieks is on average 2 4 m deep its surface area is 40 km2 and its catchment occupies 2215 km2 apsīte et al 2012 several rivers feed into the lake rūja seda briede and a few smaller ones while the river salaca is its sole outlet water turnover in lake burtnieks occurs six to seven times per year with a residence times of two to three weeks in spring and three months in summer apsīte et al 2012 the total dissolved solids tds in the lake range between 370 and 400 mg l in winter and 280 to 320 mg l in summer rodinovs and kļaviņš 1993 a small hydropower plant rauskas hpp with a water reservoir is located on the ramata river fig 1 during low flow periods episodic operation of the hydropower plant manifests as fluctuations in the water table and electrical conductivity ec along the river 2 3 geology the study region is in the east european plain well within the extent of the last scandinavian glaciation kalm 2012 the salaca river catchment is characterised by undulating moraine and the elevation ranges from 33 m to 125 m above sea level a s l the middle devonian sediments are represented by the burtnieks and arukila formations belonging to givetina and eifelian chronostratigraphic stages and composed of sandstone sand siltstone and clay the devonian sediments are exposed on the slopes of the river salaca valley these rest on top of the narva regional aquiclude eifelian stage mostly composed of marls and other carbonate and clay rich sediments and interlayers of gypsum lukševičs et al 2012 the thickness of the arukila and burtnieks formations are around 70 m and up to 50 m respectively they are overlain by quaternary glacial till and in places glacial outwash sediments gravel and sand lukševičs et al 2012 the quaternary cover usually varies between 10 and 20 m thick rarely reaching 40 m in hilly landscapes popovs et al 2015 2 4 background precipitation and groundwater isotope ratios the precipitation isotope ratios data are available at the iaea gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation data base the three closest stations are tartu 110 km riga 120 km and vilsandi 190 km iaea wmo 2019 the notion of d excess deuterium excess is a convenient way to illustrate the deviation of water isotope observation from the gmwl calculated as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o craig 1961 indicating the deviation of the δ2h and δ18o the weighted d excess for local precipitation at the riga station 120 km to the south of the study site was 11 2 babre et al 2016 in tartu a continental location 110 km from the study site it was 8 63 and in vilsandi a marine location 190 km from the study site it was 9 10 iaea wmo 2019 the observation period was from 1981 to 1984 in riga and from 2013 to 2015 in tartu and vilsandi the least squares fit lsf regression lines between two isotope ratios are δ 2 h 7 45 δ 18 o 5 67 riga δ 2 h 7 94 δ 18 o 7 75 tartu and δ 2 h 8 23 δ 18 o 10 7 vilsandi the background isoscape for δ18o in groundwater was interpolated from direct observations by raidla et al 2016 it vary from 10 8 to 11 5 the average of 10 direct δ18o groundwater observations babre et al 2016 raidla et al 2016 in the study area is 11 34 0 19 standard deviations sd direct observations are consistent with interpolated values of the isoscape the interpolated groundwater isoscape is spatially continuous therefore in this study it is used as a reference instead of individual direct observations the mean of 7 direct δ2h groundwater observations babre et al 2016 raidla et al 2016 is 78 9 2 2 sd the linear regression line between observed δ18o and δ2h has a slope of 12 3 sd and an intercept of 55 36 sd note the high uncertainty 3 materials and methods 3 1 meteorological and hydrological data the meteorological data temperature and precipitation was obtained from meteorological stations rūjiena ainaži and priekuļi fig 1 these stations are 16 to 33 30 to 50 and 55 to 75 km respectively from the study region their elevations are 6 28 67 71 and 122 07 m a s l respectively river salaca water levels and discharge were measured at two national observation stations fig 1 b meteorological and hydrological observation stations are operated by the national meteorological agency latvian environment geology and meteorology centre 3 2 sampling strategy and methodology the sampling strategy was to observe common water types in the study region using precipitation data and discharge data from lake burtnieks tributaries to the river salaca raised bog and groundwater figs 1 and 2 detailed descriptions are given in supplementary material 1 samples were collected monthly for 25 consecutive months starting in august 2015 generally at the last days of each month for two months july and november 2016 samples were collected every two days the first period of intensive sampling corresponds to midsummer conditions with the strongest modulation in surface water isotope values likely due to evaporation while the second period was during the transition from summer to winter conditions and shifting isotopic values in surface waters were expected ec and ph were measured in the field using a wtw multimeter multiline 3420 with a tetracone 925 probe for ec and temperature and a sentix 940 probe for ph and temperature at each sampling location precipitation was measured when collecting the isotope samples samples including duplicates were collected in 25 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles without filtration river water was sampled with buckets directly from the stream surface and immediately transferred to a sample bottle groundwater was sampled from temporary monitoring wells with a 1 m long filter using either submersible or peristaltic pumps before sampling all water was removed from the well so that fresh water flowing into the well could be sampled or pumped until ec and ph values stabilised 3 3 laboratory procedures stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water were analysed in the laboratory of environmental dating at the university of latvia faculty of geography and earth sciences isotope ratios are expressed in standard δ notation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 both isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen were measured using the cavity ring down laser spectroscopy method brand et al 2009 with a picarro l2120 i isotopic water analyzer reproducibility of stable isotope measurements was less than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h to assure quality of water sampling and processing in the laboratory internationally accepted procedures elaborated by the iaea aggarwal et al 2007 were followed the laboratory has successfully participated in world wide open proficiency tests on the determination of stable isotopes in water organised by the iaea in 2016 wassenaar et al 2018 4 results 4 1 hydrometeorological conditions the observed precipitation rarely exceeded 50 mm week and was evenly distributed throughout the year fig 3 approximately corresponding with long term average observations one exception occurred in august 2016 when the monthly precipitation at the rūjiena meteorological station was 233 mm during the observation period summer and early autumn was characterised by low levels of both surface water fig 4 and groundwater tables fig 5 while in winter and spring water tables were high at the mazsalaca hydrological station the ice cover was present in january 2016 and january to mid february 2017 reflecting relatively mild winters it is assumed that a stable water temperature close to 0 c indicates ice cover at sv1 the headwater of the river salaca fig 4 according to this indicator the ice cover in winter 2015 2016 was less than three months and in 2016 2017 it was around four months the average duration of ice cover on lake burtnieks from 1988 to 2001 was 116 days apsīte et al 2012 almost four months 4 2 isotope ratios in total isotope rations were measured in 554 samples however several samples were discarded after quality check initially two precipitation traps were set up in accordance with iaea gnip 2014 guidelines but evaporation partial shading by vegetation blocking of tubing by ice and vegetative litter and a change in methodology compromised the sample quality therefore all the precipitation samples were excluded from the analysis in this paper finally results from detailed observations two month of measurements every other day are not examined in this paper as well all samples considered after quality control were within the range of 6 65 to 14 4 δ18o and 60 8 to 100 9 for δ2h d excess varied between 11 2 and 21 9 fig 6 groundwater samples gu1 ru1 ru2 ru3 including the spring ga1 showed more stable results for all parameters throughout the observation period and have the most depleted average values standard deviations of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 0 8 for deuterium bog samples pp pv1 lu1 showed significantly enriched isotope ratios compared to other sampling sites and had the lowest mean deuterium d excess 1 8 isotope ratios of the samples reflect the local evaporation line while phreatic groundwater ga1 ru1 ru2 ru3 and groundwater gu1 samples mostly coincide with the gmwl fig 7 the lowest mean ec values are from raised bog indicating atmospheric recharge while the highest values were obtained from shallow groundwater samples fig 6 the broadest range of ec was for surface water samples fig 6 essentially all water types figs 4 5 8 and 9 except groundwater fig 10 have seasonal fluctuations in isotope ratios isotope seasonality can be smooth and pronounced like in the river salaca and its tributaries figs 4 and 5 or event driven as in phreatic groundwater and raised bogs figs 8 and 9 fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 the wet events the most extreme average monthly isotope ratios january to february 2016 august to october 2016 and february to may 2017 fig 11 can be linked to meteorological conditions 5 2 winter thaw january 2016 at the end of january 2016 after several weeks of freezing temperatures a thaw event occurred in the tile drainage ru3 strongly depleted water with low ec was observed fig 8 indicating preferential infiltration of snowmelt to a lesser extent this depletion signal was evident in tributaries and with a one month delay in the raised bog and salaca river figs 4 5 and 9 5 3 extreme precipitation in august 2016 in august 2016 exceptionally high precipitation was observed monthly total of 233 mm and 150 mm in a single event on august 23 at rūjiena meteorological station fig 3 that is approximately one quarter of the yearly mean precipitation briede and koreļska 2018 september 2016 had moderate precipitation 28 8 mm rūjiena meteorological station the average air temperature was 13 c and the average relative air humidity was 84 fig 3 the mean phreatic groundwater δ18o and d excess in august 2016 were 9 7 and 3 5 respectively fig 11 indicating enrichment by evaporation following this event enriched δ18o was observed in the river salaca and raised bog as well a spike of enriched water at the end of august 2016 was found in the river iģe as well but not in the river ramata fig 5 enriched water averaging δ18o 10 7 fig 8 was observed in govs ala spring ga1 up to three months after this event while the two year mean was 11 4 with a standard deviation of 0 33 the spring discharges from a sandy phreatic aquifer as evident from the outcrop of poorly consolidated sandstones covered by glacial outwash sediments state geological survey n d as determined from the topographical map the thickness of unsaturated sediments above the spring discharge site is around 16 m the observed excursion of isotope ratios can be explained by preferential infiltration of an unusually large volume of precipitation in this event fig 3 5 4 thaw in february 2017 phreatic groundwater ru1 ru2 ru3 and lake burtnieks sv1 samples collected at the end of february 2017 had noticeably depleted δ18o values while water in the tributaries and downstream sampling sites on the river salaca sv2 and sv3 had enriched values enriched δ18o values were already observed in phreatic groundwater and surface runoff figs 4 5 8 and 9 at the end of march 2017 the δ18o enrichment is associated with decreasing d excess values indicating modification by evaporation enriched water was observed in phreatic groundwater samples up to three months after the event fig 11 the same pattern was observed in the raised bog but with a one month delay fig 11 it appears that in february 2017 due to the combination of snowmelt and precipitation a large volume of depleted water appeared in the catchment some of it was drained as surface runoff some entered the groundwater system and some remained on the frozen soil surface the average air temperature in march 2017 was 1 4 c and the average relative air humidity was 82 fig 3 thus facilitating evaporation it is likely that water stagnating on the soil surface attained increasingly enriched isotope values due to evaporation and as frozen soil was thawing infiltrated the groundwater and drained into streams 5 5 generalisation and implications we suggest that at these three episodes the impoundment of the water on the soil surface and subsequent infiltration of water enriched by evaporation fig 12 are the dominant mechanisms producing the observed excursions in isotope ratios fig 11 we suggest that the intensity distribution of precipitation has significant control on surface and ground water isotope ratios in terrestrial conditions enriched water derived isotope ratios and decrease of d excess in paleorecords may be due to increased precipitation and its intensity rather than a shift towards more arid conditions isotope seasonality is controlled by the complex interplay between precipitation evaporation transpiration and hydrological conditions impoundment of precipitation water on land surface can occur when rapid snowmelt takes place over frozen ground when soil permeability is insufficient to drain incoming precipitation or when the groundwater table reaches the soil surface during events in spring 2016 and 2017 rapid infiltration of precipitation and snowmelt water likely was precluded by froze soil the event in august september 2016 likely is combination precipitation intensity exceeding the soil infiltration capacity and groundwater table reaching soil surface at places described events are associated with decreasing ec in the river salaca and its tributaries figs 4 and 5 indicating input of unaltered precipitation water the magnitude of ec fluctuations is in line with those previously observed rodinovs and kļaviņš 1993 alternatively evolution of isotope ratios can be explained by mobilisation of enriched water stored in topsoil sprenger et al 2016 due to sublimation of the snowpack stichler et al 2001 and infiltration of melt water or by evaporation of rain or snow trapped by the canopy before reaching the soil and groundwater vystavna et al 2018 or precipitation water may already have a particularly low d excess in addition enhanced surface runoff can trigger mobilisation of isotopically enriched water stored in bogs and ponds potentially this can have noticeable effects on isotopic signatures in rivers as the estimated wetland area in this catchment is between 5 european environment agency 2016 and 15 briede and rodinovs 1993 meteorological conditions that can lead to water impoundment on land surface and cause significant enrichment before entering the subterranean and surface runoff system seem to occur frequently in estonia just north of the study area during the warm season there were up to four days of extreme precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile r99p 20 mm day due to climate change the number of such extreme events is expected to increase päädam and post 2011 thus changes in precipitation intensity distribution alone can affect the isotope ratios of groundwater kriauciuniene et al 2012 indicated that the runoff of salaca river is primarily generated by precipitation implying surface runoff or short cycle groundwater runoff given the predominantly lowland plain type of terrain that does not favour swift surface runoff the river salaca catchment has favourable conditions for isotopic enrichment of precipitation water by the mechanism proposed we can speculate that in other regions of similar dominant mechanism of river runoff generation mechanisms identified by kriauciuniene et al 2012 may indicate areas where the proposed mechanism is an important factor contribution to isotope ratios of surface and groundwater additional studies are clearly needed to assess whether evaporative enrichment of water temporarily residing on the land surface is a significant mechanism contributing to the groundwater isotope ratios we suggest that water isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h are valuable indicators for groundwater monitoring in line with the eu water framework directive the european parliament and the council of the european union 2000 to better understand evolving changes in recharge conditions and surface groundwater interactions water stable isotopes already have been used as indicators of groundwater recharge sources joshi et al 2018 or to explain variations of groundwater quality sarkar et al 2017 free flowing springs like govs ala spring ga1 are often included in groundwater monitoring programmes lvģmc 2015b as a cost effective means of obtaining groundwater samples without the need for heavy pumping equipment episodic discharge of preferential infiltration as indicated by a spike in isotope ratios in august to october 2016 sampling site ga1 fig 8 can complicate or even disable meaningful interpretation of results water quality parameters measured during such episodes would be difficult if not impossible to interpret and to generalise over a wider region 6 conclusions we found characteristic signatures of isotope ratios for each type of water studied water in raised bogs confined groundwater phreatic groundwater in terrains with fine grained cultivated soils and forested sandy soils and river and lake water on average the most enriched water was found in raised bog δ18o 8 84 and river emanating from lake burtnieks δ18o 9 18 the most depleted water was found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater at a forest site with sandy soil δ18o 11 4 we suggest that evaporation of water impounded on the soil surface is an important mechanism leading to isotopic enrichment of surface and subsurface water further case studies are needed to test if this is a regionally significant mechanism contributing to the surface and groundwater isotope ratios credit authorship contribution

m shaped curve one maximum occurred in april due to infiltration of and another maximum began in september and culminated in december tolstovs et al 1986 reflecting increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration in autumn precipitation water is evapotranspirated in summer while freezing conditions in winter preclude infiltration tolstovs et al 1986 however due to milder winters in recent years the two groundwater table maxima tend to merge lauva et al 2012 in the catchment of the salaca river the runoff is primarily generated by precipitation that is classified as marine conditions by kriauciuniene et al 2012 the long term average specific drainage of the middle reaches of the salaca river is 8 l s km2 annually and 2 3 5 l s km2 in summer the flow velocity in summer is 0 1 to 0 3 m

macrophyte overgrowth on the river in summertime exceeds 30 grīnberga and spriņģe 2008 diminishing the flow velocity the catchment area of the salaca river tributaries iģe and ramata are 212 and 190 km2 respectively while the catchment of the salaca itself from the outlet to the entry of the iģe is 203 km2 the land surface is mostly covered by agriculture forests and raised bogs table 1 urban industrial areas comprise less than 1 the extent of the wetlands might be underestimated in the corine database european environment agency 2016 as some sources report up to 15 bog cover briede and

on the ramata river fig 1 during low flow periods episodic operation of the hydropower plant manifests as fluctuations in the water table and electrical conductivity ec along the river 2 3 geology the study region is in the east european plain well within the extent of the last scandinavian glaciation kalm 2012 the salaca river catchment is characterised by undulating moraine and the elevation ranges from 33 m to 125 m above sea level a s l the middle devonian sediments are represented by the burtnieks and arukila formations belonging to givetina and eifelian chronostratigraphic stages and

network of isotopes in precipitation data base the three closest stations are tartu 110 km riga 120 km and vilsandi 190 km iaea wmo 2019 the notion of d excess deuterium excess is a convenient way to illustrate the deviation of water isotope observation from the gmwl calculated as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o craig 1961 indicating the deviation of the δ2h and δ18o the weighted d excess for local precipitation at the riga station 120 km to the south of the study site was 11 2 babre et al 2016 in tartu a continental location 110 km from the study site it was 8 63 and in vilsandi a marine location 190 km from the study site it was 9 10 iaea wmo 2019 the observation period was from 1981 to 1984 in riga and from 2013 to 2015 in tartu and vilsandi the least squares fit lsf regression

and δ2h has a slope of 12 3 sd and an intercept of 55 36 sd note the high uncertainty 3 materials and methods 3 1 meteorological and hydrological data the meteorological data temperature and precipitation was obtained from meteorological stations rūjiena ainaži and priekuļi fig 1 these stations are 16 to 33 30 to 50 and 55 to 75 km respectively from the study region their elevations are 6 28 67 71 and 122 07 m a s l respectively river salaca water levels and discharge were measured at two national observation stations fig 1 b meteorological and hydrological observation stations are operated by the national meteorological agency latvian environment geology and meteorology centre 3 2 sampling strategy and methodology the sampling strategy was to observe common water types in the study region using precipitation data and discharge data from lake burtnieks tributaries to the river salaca raised bog and groundwater figs 1 and 2 detailed descriptions are given in supplementary material 1 samples were collected monthly for 25 consecutive months starting in august 2015 generally at the last days of each month for two months july and november 2016 samples were collected every two days the first period of intensive sampling corresponds to midsummer conditions with the strongest modulation in surface water isotope values likely due to evaporation while the second period was during the transition from summer to winter conditions and shifting isotopic values in surface waters were expected ec and ph were measured in the field using a wtw multimeter multiline 3420 with a tetracone 925 probe for ec and temperature and a sentix 940 probe for ph and temperature at each sampling location precipitation was measured when collecting the isotope samples samples including duplicates were collected in 25 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles without filtration river water was sampled with buckets directly from the stream surface and immediately transferred to a sample bottle groundwater was sampled from temporary monitoring wells with a 1 m long filter using either submersible or peristaltic pumps before sampling all water was removed from the well so that fresh water flowing into the well could be sampled or pumped until ec and ph values stabilised 3 3 laboratory procedures stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water were analysed in the laboratory of environmental dating at the university of latvia faculty of geography and earth sciences isotope ratios are expressed in standard δ notation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 both isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen were measured using the cavity ring down laser spectroscopy method brand et al 2009 with a picarro l2120 i isotopic water analyzer reproducibility of stable isotope measurements was less than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h to assure quality of water sampling and processing in the laboratory internationally accepted procedures elaborated by the iaea aggarwal et al 2007 were followed the laboratory has successfully participated in world wide open proficiency tests on the determination of stable isotopes in water organised by the iaea in 2016 wassenaar et al 2018 4 results 4 1 hydrometeorological conditions the observed precipitation rarely exceeded 50 mm week and was evenly distributed throughout the year fig 3 approximately corresponding with long term average observations one exception occurred in august 2016 when the monthly precipitation at the rūjiena meteorological station was 233 mm during the observation period summer and early autumn was characterised by low levels of both surface water fig 4 and groundwater tables fig 5 while in winter and spring water tables were high at the mazsalaca hydrological station the ice cover was present in january 2016 and january to mid february 2017 reflecting relatively mild winters it is assumed that a stable water temperature close to 0 c indicates ice cover at sv1 the headwater of the river salaca fig 4 according to this indicator the ice cover in winter 2015 2016 was less than three months and in 2016 2017 it was around four months the average duration of ice cover on lake burtnieks from 1988 to 2001 was 116 days apsīte et al 2012 almost four months 4 2 isotope ratios in total isotope rations were measured in 554 samples however several samples were discarded after quality check initially two precipitation traps were set up in accordance with iaea gnip 2014 guidelines but evaporation partial shading by vegetation blocking of tubing by ice and vegetative litter and a change in methodology compromised the sample quality therefore all the precipitation samples were excluded from the analysis in this paper finally results from detailed observations two month of measurements every other day are not examined in this paper as well all samples considered after quality control were within the range of 6 65 to 14 4 δ18o and 60 8 to 100 9 for δ2h d excess varied between 11 2 and 21 9 fig 6 groundwater samples gu1 ru1 ru2 ru3 including the spring ga1 showed more stable results for all parameters throughout the observation period and have the most depleted average values standard deviations of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 0 8 for deuterium bog samples pp pv1 lu1 showed significantly enriched isotope ratios compared to other sampling sites and had the lowest mean deuterium d excess 1 8 isotope ratios of the samples reflect the local evaporation line while phreatic groundwater ga1 ru1 ru2 ru3 and groundwater gu1 samples mostly coincide with the gmwl fig 7 the lowest mean ec values are from raised bog indicating atmospheric recharge while the highest values were obtained from shallow groundwater samples fig 6 the broadest range of ec was for surface water samples fig 6 essentially all water types figs 4 5 8 and 9 except groundwater fig 10 have seasonal fluctuations in isotope ratios isotope seasonality can be smooth and pronounced like in the river salaca and its tributaries figs 4 and 5 or event driven as in phreatic groundwater and raised bogs figs 8 and 9 fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 the wet events the most extreme average monthly isotope ratios january to february 2016 august to october 2016 and february to may 2017 fig 11 can be linked to meteorological conditions 5 2 winter thaw january 2016 at the end of january 2016 after several weeks of freezing temperatures a thaw event occurred in the tile drainage ru3 strongly depleted water with low ec was observed fig 8 indicating preferential infiltration of snowmelt to a lesser extent this depletion signal was evident in tributaries and with a one month delay in the raised bog and salaca river figs 4 5 and 9 5 3 extreme precipitation in august 2016 in august 2016 exceptionally high precipitation was observed monthly total of 233 mm and 150 mm in a single event on august 23 at rūjiena meteorological station fig 3 that is approximately one quarter of the yearly mean precipitation briede and koreļska 2018 september 2016 had moderate precipitation 28 8 mm rūjiena meteorological station the average air temperature was 13 c and the average relative air humidity was 84 fig 3 the mean phreatic groundwater δ18o and d excess in august 2016 were 9 7 and 3 5 respectively fig 11 indicating enrichment by evaporation following this event enriched δ18o was observed in the river salaca and raised bog as well a spike of enriched water at the end of august 2016 was found in the river iģe as well but not in the river ramata fig 5 enriched water averaging δ18o 10 7 fig 8 was observed in govs ala spring ga1 up to three months after this event while the two year mean was 11 4 with a standard deviation of 0 33 the spring discharges from a sandy phreatic aquifer as evident from the outcrop of poorly consolidated sandstones covered by glacial outwash sediments state geological survey n d as determined from the topographical map the thickness of unsaturated sediments above the spring discharge site is around 16 m the observed excursion of isotope ratios can be explained by preferential infiltration of an unusually large volume of precipitation in this event fig 3 5 4 thaw in february 2017 phreatic groundwater ru1 ru2 ru3 and lake burtnieks sv1 samples collected at the end of february 2017 had noticeably depleted δ18o values while water in the tributaries and downstream sampling sites on the river salaca sv2 and sv3 had enriched values enriched δ18o values were already observed in phreatic groundwater and surface runoff figs 4 5 8 and 9 at the end of march 2017 the δ18o enrichment is associated with decreasing d excess values indicating modification by evaporation enriched water was observed in phreatic groundwater samples up to three months after the event fig 11 the same pattern was observed in the raised bog but with a one month delay fig 11 it appears that in february 2017 due to the combination of snowmelt and precipitation a large volume of depleted water appeared in the catchment some of it was drained as surface runoff some entered the groundwater system and some remained on the frozen soil surface the average air temperature in march 2017 was 1 4 c and the average relative air humidity was 82 fig 3 thus facilitating evaporation it is likely that water stagnating on the soil surface attained increasingly enriched isotope values due to evaporation and as frozen soil was thawing infiltrated the groundwater and drained into streams 5 5 generalisation and implications we suggest that at these three episodes the impoundment of the water on the soil surface and subsequent infiltration of water enriched by evaporation fig 12 are the dominant mechanisms producing the observed excursions in isotope ratios fig 11 we suggest that the intensity distribution of precipitation has significant control on surface and ground water isotope ratios in terrestrial conditions enriched water derived isotope ratios and decrease of d excess in paleorecords may be due to increased precipitation and its intensity rather than a shift towards more arid conditions isotope seasonality is controlled by the complex interplay between precipitation evaporation transpiration and hydrological conditions impoundment of precipitation water on land surface can occur when rapid snowmelt takes place over frozen ground when soil permeability is insufficient to drain incoming precipitation or when the groundwater table reaches the soil surface during events in spring 2016 and 2017 rapid infiltration of precipitation and snowmelt water likely was precluded by froze soil the event in august september 2016 likely is combination precipitation intensity exceeding the soil infiltration capacity and groundwater table reaching soil surface at places described events are associated with decreasing ec in the river salaca and its tributaries figs 4 and 5 indicating input of unaltered precipitation water the magnitude of ec fluctuations is in line with those previously observed rodinovs and kļaviņš 1993 alternatively evolution of isotope ratios can be explained by mobilisation of enriched water stored in topsoil sprenger et al 2016 due to sublimation of the snowpack stichler et al 2001 and infiltration of melt water or by evaporation of rain or snow trapped by the canopy before reaching the soil and groundwater vystavna et al 2018 or precipitation water may already have a particularly low d excess in addition enhanced surface runoff can trigger mobilisation of isotopically enriched water stored in bogs and ponds potentially this can have noticeable effects on isotopic signatures in rivers as the estimated wetland area in this catchment is between 5 european environment agency 2016 and 15 briede and rodinovs 1993 meteorological conditions that can lead to water impoundment on land surface and cause significant enrichment before entering the subterranean and surface runoff system seem to occur frequently in estonia just north of the study area during the warm season there were up to four days of extreme precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile r99p 20 mm day due to climate change the number of such extreme events is expected to increase päädam and post 2011 thus changes in precipitation intensity distribution alone can affect the isotope ratios of groundwater kriauciuniene et al 2012 indicated that the runoff of salaca river is primarily generated by precipitation implying surface runoff or short cycle groundwater runoff given the predominantly lowland plain type of terrain that does not favour swift surface runoff the river salaca catchment has favourable conditions for isotopic enrichment of precipitation water by the mechanism proposed we can speculate that in other regions of similar dominant mechanism of river runoff generation mechanisms identified by kriauciuniene et al 2012 may indicate areas where the proposed mechanism is an important factor contribution to isotope ratios of surface and groundwater additional studies are clearly needed to assess whether evaporative enrichment of water temporarily residing on the land surface is a significant mechanism contributing to the groundwater isotope ratios we suggest that water isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h are valuable indicators for groundwater monitoring in line with the eu water framework directive the european parliament and the council of the european union 2000 to better understand evolving changes in recharge conditions and surface groundwater interactions water stable isotopes already have been used as indicators of groundwater recharge sources joshi et al 2018 or to explain variations of groundwater quality sarkar et al 2017 free flowing springs like govs ala spring ga1 are often included in groundwater monitoring programmes lvģmc 2015b as a cost effective means of obtaining groundwater samples without the need for heavy pumping equipment episodic discharge of preferential infiltration as indicated by a spike in isotope ratios in august to october 2016 sampling site ga1 fig 8 can complicate or even disable meaningful interpretation of results water quality parameters measured during such episodes would be difficult if not impossible to interpret and to generalise over a wider region 6 conclusions we found characteristic signatures of isotope ratios for each type of water studied water in raised bogs confined groundwater phreatic groundwater in terrains with fine grained cultivated soils and forested sandy soils and river and lake water on average the most enriched water was found in raised bog δ18o 8 84 and river emanating from lake burtnieks δ18o 9 18 the most depleted water was found in a spring discharging phreatic groundwater at a forest site with sandy soil δ18o 11 4 we suggest that evaporation of water impounded on the soil surface is an important mechanism leading to isotopic enrichment of surface and subsurface water further case studies are needed to test if this is a regionally significant mechanism contributing to the surface and groundwater isotope ratios credit authorship contribution

two years of monthly observations 
5781,in recent years more studies have been focusing on the transient behaviors of the movement of soil water and changes in matric potential which require the measurement of the rapid changes in matric potential or capillary pressure because of the delayed response the value of the matric potential measured using a tensiometer may not precisely reflect the actual matric potential during a transient condition we performed a series of experiments to analyze the effect of grain size effective saturation and the hydraulic conductivities of ceramic cup and porous media on the response time of a tensiometer the outcomes suggested that a decrease of hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic cup significantly increases the response time moreover the response time measured under unsaturated conditions did not follow an ideal exponential decay this finding was consistent with the existing theories based on which we proposed three models to describe the time varied response function these models were applied to correct the measured matric potential for dynamic water retention curve wrc and the findings were compared with those of other existing methods used for measuring the matric potential we found that the incorporation of the theory of response time significantly reduced the discrepancy between the matric potential measured using two ceramic cups with different response times during dynamic drainage we concluded that the delayed response of a tensiometer can have a significant effect on the measurement of the transient matric potential or capillary pressure and can be corrected using response time equations keywords response time dynamic matric potential dynamic water retention curve 1 introduction tensiometers have been one of the major instruments used in the quantification of soil matric potential by providing measurements of the water pressure inside a porous cup in laboratory and field environments for decades camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 kirkham 2014 lo et al 2017 or 2001 tokunaga 2005 nevertheless a tensiometer requires a finite time which is called the response time to transfer the matric potential through the ceramic cup to the pressure transducer in recent years studies on the transient behaviors of matric potential or capillary pressure during rapid soil water movements such as preferential flow saturation overshoot and dynamic effect on the water retention curve wrc require the measurement of the rapid changes in the matric potential or capillary pressure hassanizadeh and gray 1990 mokady and low 1964 topp et al 1967 the flow rate dependent wrc is called dynamic capillary effects on wrc or dynamic wrc the deviation between the dynamic and static wrcs which is defined as the dynamic effect can be incorrectly assessed when the effect of the tensiometer response time is ignored camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 when a tensiometer reading is obtained without sufficient time for the instrument to re equilibrate the apparent matric potential will deviate from the actual value tokunaga 1992 this deviation depends on the drainage system in previous studies the lag in the matric potential measurement led to an overestimation of the dynamic effects when the air was pressurized hou et al 2012 and an underestimation when the water was extracted by vacuuming camps roach et al 2010 lo et al 2017 to reduce the effects of the delayed response dicarlo 2007 and hou et al 2012 created their own custom designed tensiometers with highly permeable ceramic cups however the experiments performed using the custom designed tensiometers can not be easily reproduced in addition the ceramic cups of such tensiometers usually have high conductivity and large pores hence they can mainly be used in the laboratory but are susceptible to damage and blockage by air and small particles when used in fields therefore the delayed response of tensiometers for measuring the matric potential is still one of the major concerns for investigating the rapid changes in the matric potential or capillary pressure abidoye and das 2014 camps roach et al 2010 hassanizadeh et al 2002 hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 and correcting the measured data obtained from the delayed response of standardized tensiometer products such as commercialized tensiometers is still necessary furthermore systematic investigations of the effect of the ceramic cup physical properties soil structure and soil moisture on the response time of tensiometers are still rare we performed a series of experiments to analyze the effect of grain size effective saturation and hydraulic conductivities of the ceramic cup and porous media on the response time of a tensiometer a tensiometer only senses the changes in the matric potential when the water flows through the ceramic cup klute and gardner 1962 towner 1980 the delayed response of a tensiometer could be related to the volume flux of the water as it passes through the ceramic cup previous studies have indicated that the pores in a ceramic cup become blocked by soil particles or air after long term use and the volume flux of water passing through the ceramic cup decreases resulting in the diminution of the cup conductance and increase in the response time hou et al 2012 tokunaga 2005 in addition the tensiometer response time was shown to be affected by the soil hydraulic conductivity which is a function of soil moisture and matric potential hayashi et al 1997 hou et al 2012 selker et al 1992 based on towner s 1981 model selker et al 1992 established a relationship between the response time and soil hydraulic conductivity and showed that the lower is the hydraulic conductivity the more significantly is the response time affected by the hydraulic conductivity hayashi et al 1997 indicated that a non exponential decay in the tensiometer response can occur when the soil water storage and tensiometer shape were considered under unsaturated conditions by solving the three dimensional richards equation hayashi et al 1997 showed that when the flow resistance of the porous cup is sufficiently small the soil water storage and soil water dynamic can cause a non exponential decay in the tensiometer response under unsaturated conditions in addition they proposed a practical method to inverse the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity with the tensiometer response data although the theory of response time has been well investigated in the past few decades the current literature shows that only few dynamic wrc studies have corrected their measured matric potential based on the response time theories hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 moreover these studies did not consider the non exponential response decay of the tensiometer under unsaturated conditions a systematic investigation of the effect of the ceramic cup and effective saturation on the tensiometer response time should improve the usage of tensiometers for measuring rapid changes in matric potential whether this error can be corrected and improved to prolong the service life of the ceramic cup is one of the practical issues for measuring matric potential in the field in this study we measured the response time of a tensiometer for different grain sizes ceramic cups and water contents and quantitatively evaluated the effect of the ceramic cup conductance and effective saturation on the response time of the tensiometer to correct the effect of delayed response under unsaturated condition we established new physical based models to describe the non ideal response decay curve and the time varied response time furthermore we performed drainage experiments to show that the effect of the delayed response on the dynamic wrc measurement can be corrected by considering the response time the methodology of response time and measurement is detailed in section 2 in section 3 the results and discussion of response time measurement and the dynamic wrc experiment are presented the conclusion is included in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 theory of tensiometer response time klute and gardner 1962 regarded that the volume flux of water across the cup is the product of the difference of pressures in the inner and outer ceramic cups and the conductance of the ceramic cups 1 dv dt c p s cup p t where v m3 is the unit volume of water across the ceramic cup p s cup m is the matric potential at the interface between the ceramic cup and the surrounding soil pt m is the water potential head in the tensiometer inner pressure of the ceramic cup and c m2 s is the conductance of the ceramic cup both p s cup and pt can vary with time the relationship between the ceramic cup matric potential and volume flux of water is shown in fig 1 following a chain rule 1 c dv d p t d p t dt p s cup p t the response time of a tensiometer t s is defined as follows 2 t p s cup p t d p t dt 1 c s t where st m 2 is the gauge sensitivity of the entire tensiometer system s t d p t d v defined as the change in a tensiometer s pressure reading per unit volume exchange dv across the ceramic cup tokunaga 2005 towner 1981 three assumptions for eq 2 are to be noted i the gauge storage capacity is constant ii soil hydraulic conductivity is constant and iii soil has no water storage capacity hayashi et al 1997 nevertheless these assumptions are generally invalid in unsaturated soils even under saturated conditions assumption iii can be invalid since soils can have some water storage capacity towner 1981 used the method of solving an analogous heat conduction problem and developed a time response equation for tensiometers embedded in soil by combining the response time of instruments and that of the soil effect 3 t 1 s t 1 c 1 4 π r k where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of soil and r m is the outer radius of the ceramic cups the first part of eq 3 describes the effect of the instrument and the second part presents the effect on the response time caused by the soil from eq 3 both k and st are important factors for the response time of a tensiometer biesheuvel et al 1999 for unsaturated soils water storage capacity hydraulic conductivity and matric potential vary with water content hayashi et al 1997 considered the three dimensional soil water flow across the ceramic cup soil water dynamic was described by the equations relating to soil hydraulic conductivity for the total potential head in the ceramic cup and in soil under unsaturated conditions 4 d p t dt s t a k p s cup p s n d a 5 c w p s t k p s 2 p s where a m2 is the outer surface area of a ceramic cup n is the outward normal unit vector and cw m 1 is the water capacity of soil the numerical solution of eqs 4 and 5 shows that in the three dimension conditions the delayed response of a tensiometer is related to the shape of the tensiometer and soil water storage a non exponential decay response curve can occur in unsaturated soil hayashi et al 1997 equations 4 and 5 can be further linearized by fixing k and cw to correct the measured matric potential affected by the delayed response hou et al 2012 and lo et al 2017 followed eq 2 with a constant t nevertheless when any of the assumptions for eq 2 is invalid developing a method to correct the measured matric potential is necessary by considering a non exponential decay response curve for a non exponential decay response curve or under soil limiting conditions we introduce an effective response time teff s and eq 2 becomes 6 t eff p s p t d p t dt we derived the time varied teff based on geometric and analytical solutions consider a three dimension flow under a soil limiting condition where the effect of the ceramic cup is neglected the relationship between ps and

reducing the flow dimension but preserved the physical concept from towner s work the formation of teff can be further simplified by reducing the three dimensional flow to one dimensional 1 d flow we rewrote eqs 4 and 5 into a form for a 1 d flow system the coupling eq 10 describes the water pressures in the ceramic cup and in the soil outside the ceramic cup which is based on the linearized 1 d

computation of the complementary error functions and roots of a quadratic function in eq 1 the delayed response is mainly due to the amount of volume flux of water dv d t across the cup of a tensiometer thus the model can be further simplified by focusing on predicting the volume flux crossing the ceramic cup of a tensiometer barry et al 1993 revealed that in a homogeneous porous media the analytical solution of the cumulative infiltration from 1 d richards equation is consistent with that from green ampt model green and ampt 1911 in addition green ampt model is feasible under variable head conditions freyberg et al 1980 therefore alternatively the volume flux through the boundary of a ceramic cup and the soil should be described using green ampt model as shown in fig 1 in the case of soil water around the ceramic cup the sharp wetting front might not be well defined but green ampt model could still be able to estimate the volume flux across the ceramic cup in green

measured matric potential and wrc is shown in section 3 3 2 2 experimental materials four uniform spherical glass beads named b35 b60 b150 and b320 with different grain sizes were used in the experiments the grain size distribution geometric mean grain size and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the glass beads are shown in table 1 the particle density is 2 5 g cm3 the grain size distributions of b35 b60 b150 and b320 range from 200 to 700 μm 100 to 600 μm 50 to 230 μm and 1 to 200 μm respectively their geometric mean grain sizes are 451 348 138 and 13 μm respectively the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks of b35 b60 b150 and b320 are 1 4 10 1 5 10 2 9 5 10 3 and 9 2 10 4 cm s respectively more detailed information on the properties of the experimental materials can be found in tsai et al 2018 the tensiometer used in this study is model 2100f from soilmoisture equipment corp u s a this tensiometer 2100f includes a ceramic cup and cup tube assembly vent tube plastic body tube and digital pressure transducer model 5301 2 bar pressure difference range 1 accuracy the ceramic cup of the 2100f consists of a porous ceramic al2o3 sintered material which is homogeneous permeable and stiff the physical properties of the ceramic cup are shown in table 2 as early as 1983 some researchers used digital pressure transducers to measure soil matric potential they have the following advantages easy to use low maintenance and less erroneous readings marthaler et al 1983 the pressure transducer in our tensiometer is attached to the body tube and allows continuous monitoring of soil matric potential with time before using tensiometer 2100f we first immersed the ceramic cups in deionized water for more than 24 h to fill the pores with water second by slowly filling and pushing the de aired pure water after boiling deionized water we forced water through the tubes and the ceramic cup to purge air from the system third we excluded the entrapped air released from the water and the porous cup to achieve de airing or outgassing the entrapped air needed to be purged from the tensiometer by outgassing with a vacuum pump and refilling de aired pure water repeatedly to ensure that no air bubbles were present in the system moreover in the dynamic matric potential experiment the soil moisture sensor ec 5 decagon devices inc specifications length 8 9 cm width 1 8 cm height 0 7 cm measurement time 10 ms volumetric water content range from 0 to saturation resolution 0 001 cm3 cm3 accuracy 0 03 cm3 cm3 was used to measure the water content during the drainage process the tensiometer and sensor have been widely used in both laboratory experiments and field measurements camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 kirkham 2014 lo et al 2017 or 2001 in this study tensiometer 2100f and sensor ec 5 were calibrated with pure water and six known water contents of glass bead b35 respectively the pressure transducer was also tested in a positive negative varying pressure field by using the same tube setup to clearly confirm that its response time was 0 24 s in pure water in all experiments the pure water used refers to deionized water that has been boiled and used within an hour after cooling 2 3 measurement of tensiometer response time we used two ceramic cups labeled o and n which have the same material and dimensions with different saturated hydraulic conductivities of ceramic cups kc to investigate the influence of kc on the response time of the tensiometer the low kc of ceramic cup o is due to the long term usage similar to the investigation by marthaler et al 1983 who used the tensiometer system of ceramic cup and pressure transducer to connect to a data logger their ceramic cups were used in a grass covered flood irrigated field for about three years and 2 to 10 min were required for complete re equilibration before the start of each experiment we immersed the cups o and n in pure water for more than 24 h we also ensured that no air bubbles were present in the tubes after the ceramic cup was attached to the tensiometer after each experiment the tubes were examined for entrapped air and the ceramic cup was carefully washed and immersed in pure water for the next experiment furthermore we adjusted the depth of the ceramic cup under water to check the corresponding pressure reading of the tensiometer we first performed the response time experiment in pure water to eliminate the soil condition effects klute and gardner 1962 towner 1981 during the response experiments in pure water the ceramic cup of the tensiometer was first placed under the water surface after the reading of the pressure became stable we rapidly moved the ceramic cup to a depth of 5 cm and recorded the measured value of pressure pt over time according to eq 2 in pure water the measured response time is solely controlled by the ceramic cup conductance c and the gauge sensitivity st of the tensiometer system to investigate the impact of grain size and effective saturation on the response time of the tensiometer we measured the tensiometer response to the changing matric potential by using the same ceramic cup in different glass beads b35 b60 b150 and b320 with different effective saturations the controlled effective saturation se levels of the glass beads were se 1 se 0 37 and se 0 to prepare the saturated sample we first poured deionized water into the container next we slowly sprinkled glass beads from a height of 3 cm above the water surface and tapped the outer wall of the container with a rubber rake to evenly distribute the grains of glass beads unsaturated samples in which water was gradually added into and evenly stirred until the effective saturation was 0 37 volumetric water content 0 2 cm3 cm3 were packed into the container with the same method as that used for saturated packing the dry samples se 0 were prepared by 7 day air drying and packing by using the same method first the ceramic cup was placed in water until the registered pressure became stable next we inserted the cup into a small hole in the center of the sample surface and pushed it to a depth of approximately 5 cm and recorded the changing pt until it approached a steady state finally the aforementioned process was repeated for the four kinds of glass beads under three different effective saturations se 1 se 0 37 and se 0 2 4 measurement of dynamic water retention curve a device diagram for measuring the wrcs under dynamic and static conditions is shown in fig 2 the bottom of the sandbox was connected to a pump or mariotte s bottle for a fixed drainage rate or a constant head boundary condition the glass bead b35 was gradually and uniformly packed into a sandbox acrylic material length 30 cm width 20 cm height 30 cm we slowly injected water from the bottom of the sandbox by using the mariotte s bottle which was gradually raised to ensure that the sandbox was completely saturated the sandbox was equipped with tensiometer 2100f on one side and the soil moisture sensor ec 5 was installed on the other side the ceramic cup was placed near the center of the entire profile the distances from the cup to glass bead surface and sandbox bottom in the vertical direction are both 10 cm and to front and rear box walls in the horizontal direction are also 10 cm the ceramic cup and ec 5 sensor were placed horizontally and at the same vertical level their tips were about 2 cm apart the 2100f and ec 5 were connected to a data logger during the drainage process the changes in matric potential and water content were simultaneously measured using the 2100f and ec 5 mariotte s bottle was used to control the constant head boundary condition for measuring the static wrcs a pump was used to drain the water from the sandbox at a constant drainage rate for the dynamic wrc experiments the static wrc experiments were performed as follows 1 the glass beads were initially saturated and the water level in the mariotte s bottle connected to the bottom of the sandbox was initially set to match the height of the surface of the glass beads 2 the matric potential negative pressure was generated in a stepwise manner by reducing the elevation of the mariotte s bottle while maintaining atmospheric pressure at the surface of the sandbox the incremental decrease in the height of the mariotte s bottle was 5 cm 3 after the elevation of the mariotte s bottle was adjusted decreased matric potential the outflowing mass of water was measured we assumed that a static condition was reached when no water content change was detected from ec 5 4 when the static condition was reached the equilibrium matric potential and moisture content were measured simultaneously by using the 2100f with ceramic cup n and ec 5 the mariotte s bottle was then lowered 5 we repeated steps 3 and 4 and stopped the experiment when the mariotte s bottle reached the bottom of the sandbox similar experimental processes have been performed in other studies lo et al 2017 sakaki et al 2010 the experimental setup for the measurement of dynamic wrcs was similar to that under static conditions first we used tensiometer 2100f with ceramic cup n to measure the dynamic wrcs the following steps were used 1 the glass beads were initially saturated and the water level was set to just match the surface of glass beads 2 we generated matric potential negative pressure by pumping water out through a pump at the bottom of the sandbox the pumping flow rate was fixed to 1 11 cm3 s 3 while pumping the matric potential and water content were continuously recorded via the 2100f and ec 5 during the whole drainage period 4 the collected matric potential and water content were averaged over 15 s periods 5 the experiment was stopped after 30 40 min of pumping 6 we repeated steps 1 5 but used tensiometer 2100f with ceramic cup o 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the hydraulic conductivity of ceramic cups on response time the relationships between pt which is standardized from the measured pt via the tensiometers with ceramic cups o and n where p t p s p t p s p 0 versus t a d pt versus dpt dt b e and the corresponding response time t versus t c f in pure water are shown in fig 3 the white circles in fig 3 a and d represent the standardized pt values and the solid black line is based on eq 2 fitting to the observed data in fig 3 b and e the black circles are the ratios of pt to dpt dt the overall slope of the linear distribution could be regarded as the average response time in eq 2 in fig 3 c and f the black circles show a nearly constant t calculated from eq 2 for measuring the changes in water potential head of pure water the dotted line represents the average t value of the response time from eq 2 however in fig 3 c and f when dpt dt became small in the later period of the experiment a small measurement noise of the sensor in pt led to a large change in t for all practical purposes the variation of the late t should not significantly affect the data interpretation of soil water dynamics since the change in pt at the late stage is small from the results of fig 3 the discrepancy between the response times of the tensiometer with ceramic cups o and n are mainly attributed to the difference in kc between the ceramic cups under saturated conditions according to the response time model of klute and gardner 1962 and towner 1981 in pure water the response time of a tensiometer is only dependent on c and st the st can be inversed from eq 2 with a measured t and a known c value of a tensiometer thus according to towner 1980 1981 and tokunaga 2005 c is closely related to the characteristics of the ceramic cup and can be written as follows 23 c 4 π r i r k c r r i where r and ri m are the outer and inner radii of the ceramic cup respectively in pure water considering the physical characteristics of the ceramic cup in table 2 and eq 23 st 3 9 104 cm 2 of our tensiometer system connecting the electronic pressure transducer model 5301 was obtained by using a brand new ceramic cup that has kc 7 56 10 7 cm s and measured t 8 7 s the st value is in accordance with the range considered by tokunaga 2005 and the st of the electronic pressure transducer is in the range of 103 105 cm 2 the same tensiometer system was used for all experiments and the st value was the same in our study we also calculated the c values of cups o and n by using eq 2 with measured t and known st in pure water the kc values were obtained using eq 23 the values of kc and c of the ceramic cups o and n are shown in table 3 3 2 effect of grain size and effective saturation on the response time 3 2 1 saturated conditions in fig 4 c f j and m the trend of t values versus time for glass beads with different grain sizes was close to a linear relationship during the experiments the average response times calculated using eq 2 for the saturated b35 b60 b150 and b320 were 82 81 75 and 76 s respectively table 4 the results showed that the effect of grain size of the glass beads on the response time was insignificant under saturated conditions the constant response time of the tensiometer was close to that measured from the response experiments in pure water as shown in table 4 although the grain size is related to the hydraulic conductivity arya et al 1999 the ks of our smallest glass bead b320 was not sufficiently small referring to ceramic cup conductance to affect the response time of the tensiometer 3 2 2 unsaturated conditions the non exponential decay curve of pt t the nonlinear pt dpt dt and a time varied t under unsaturated conditions are shown in figs 5 and 6 the deviation between the ideal with a constant t and non exponential decay curves of pt t increased as the se decreased from 0 37 to 0 the measured non ideal case was consistent with the theoretical data and numerical simulation by hayashi et al 1997 therefore the time varied teff in eqs 9 14 and 22 which includes the tensiometer response characteristic and soil limiting term is needed to describe the non exponential decay response curve the ideal exponential decay curve dashed line based on eq 2 with a constant t poorly fits the measured pt t white circles for the dry glass bead b320 se 0 but the measured data can be well described by towner s equation 1980 1 d richards equation and green ampt model approach by using the time varied teff solid lines fig 7 a the fitting parameters are shown in table 5 moreover the deviations between the model predictions solid lines and measured response time black circles fig 7 b could have contributed to the simplified flow geometry and the linearization of richards equation which have been indicated by hayashi et al 1997 3 3 the correction of the measured p t hou et al 2012 and lo et al 2017 applied eq 2 to estimate the dynamic ps by correcting the measured pt with a constant response time t nevertheless under soil limiting conditions the response time of a tensiometer in eq 2 should be replaced by the time dependent effective response time teff as shown in eq 6 by substituting the measured pt and the calculated teff into eq 6 we obtained the matric potential ps in soil around the ceramic cup the estimated ps of glass bead b35 obtained using eq 6 with teff based on towner 1980 eq 9 1 d richards equation eq 14 and green ampt model eq 22 is shown in fig 8 since the soil water saturation remained constant during the experiments a constant matric potential ps should be expected under the saturated and unsaturated conditions most of the estimated ps values were nearly constant fig 8 however in the early stage of the unsaturated condition the ps estimated using eq 2 with a constant t black circles was unsteady and gradually reached a constant therefore at the early stage the use of eq 2 with a constant t to estimate ps from measured pt could produce a systematic bias under unsaturated conditions conversely the ps estimated using teff from the three models was similar to each other implying similar performance of the three models in estimating the true value of ps in the next section the correction method of using eq 6 with teff was adopted to correct the measured matric potential during dynamic wrc measurement 3 4 effects of response time on the dynamic wrc measurement the dynamic matric potential and wrcs of glass bead b35 which were measured using ceramic cups o dot dashed blue line and n dotted orange line under the drainage flow rate of 1 11 cm3 s and the static matric potential and static wrc which were measured using a water head difference of 5 cm solid black line are shown in fig 9 error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean of three experimental replicates furthermore the van genuchten 1980 model is widely used to describe wrcs 24 s e 1 α p s n m where se m3 m3 is the effective saturation s e θ θ r θ s θ r θ m3 m3 is the volumetric water content the subscript letters s and r indicate saturated and residual respectively and α m 1 n and m are the parameters of the mode1 m 1 1 n assumed by van genuchten 1980 the fitting parameters based on eq 24 with the measured data are α 0 064 cm 1 n 4 94 for ceramic cup o and α 0 038 cm 1 n 10 38 for ceramic cup n table 3 in fig 9 the measured dynamic wrc with ceramic cup n agreed with the findings of previous studies that the matric potential under dynamic conditions was greater than that of the static wrc during drainage sakaki et al 2010 however the dynamic wrc measured using the same tensiometer with ceramic cup o was significantly lower than that measured using ceramic cup n and that of static wrc the underestimated dynamic matric potential pc in dynamic wrc measured using ceramic cup o showed that the delayed effect of the tensiometer response time owing to the ceramic cup characteristic can be significant while measuring the rapid changes in matric potential in addition the uncorrected dynamic wrc measured using ceramic cup o could yield findings contradictory to those obtained by previous studies sakaki et al 2010 that is when the water was vacuumed during drainage the wrc in the dynamic conditions was greater than that in the static condition we followed the method mentioned in section 3 3 to correct the measured dynamic matric potential in wrc by using the response time functions the measured dynamic wrc of glass bead b35 with ceramic cup n and the corrected dynamic matric potential pc obtained using eq 6 with 1 a constant t 124 which is the average value from 82 se 1 120 se 0 37 and 170 se 0 2 the teff based on towner 1980 eq 9 3 the teff based on 1 d richards equation eq 14 and 4 the teff based on green ampt model eq 22 is shown in fig 10 the parameters required for the above mentioned equations were derived from the fitting parameters of the unsaturated b35 se 0 37 the result showed that the corrected pc with the constant t crosses was higher than that with teff squares triangles and diamonds the difference slightly decreased as the effective saturation decreased indicating that correction of the measured matric potential by using eq 2 with a constant t which is used in most of the previous studies can still lead to the overestimation of the dynamic effect of wrc when the water was vacuumed during drainage the corrected values of pc obtained using eq 6 with the time varied teff from the different models are close to each other and even overlapped therefore we applied the simplest teff from green ampt based model to correct the values of pc measured using the tensiometers with ceramic cup o the measured pc in the dynamic wrcs of glass bead b35 measured using ceramic cups o and n with and without correction by using eq 6 with teff is shown in fig 11 after correction the deviation between the wrcs from the corrected pc of ceramic cups o and n green triangles and red diamonds was significantly reduced we concluded that the significant difference between the dynamic wrcs measured using ceramic cups o and n was attributed to the difference in the delayed tensiometer response without considering the response time the dynamic effect of wrc which is the difference between the dynamic and static wrc can be wrongly assessed during drainage the errors in the matric potential measurement owing to the response time can be corrected using the proposed method with time varied teff the response time of a tensiometer increases as the usage of the ceramic cup increases in particular owing to the pore size in the ceramic the ceramic cup can be blocked by air bubbles tiny particles or other contaminants in soil and water or bacterial growth may adhere to the ceramic surface our study showed that the measured transient matric potentials from two distinct ceramic cups can be very different because of the difference in the response time therefore the time dependent response time of the tensiometer may also cause difficulties in monitoring the transient matric potential or capillary pressure in field traditionally this problem was addressed by replacing the old ceramic cup with a new one or cleaning and re calibrating it in the laboratory however our study showed that the measurement errors due to the increase of the response time can be reduced by using the proposed methods for example for some tensiometers used in field over a long term the measured data can be corrected by considering their response time by installing a new tensiometer with a known response time close to the old tensiometer in field we can obtain the measured matric potentials of the new and old tensiometers the corrected matric potential from the new tensiometer is regarded as ps and we can estimate teff of the old tensiometer by using eq 6 and further correct the measured data from the old tensiometer without disturbing the soil surrounding the old tensiometer and interrupting the monitoring process this might extend the service life of tensiometers especially when they are installed in field 4 conclusions in this study a series of experiments was performed to systematically investigate the influence of the ceramic cup hydraulic conductivity grain size and effective saturation on the response time of a tensiometer the results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic cup significantly affected the response time of the tensiometer during the response experiments the hydraulic conductivity and grain size of the glass bead had a limited effect on the response time under saturated conditions but significantly affected the response time under unsaturated conditions furthermore under unsaturated or soil limiting conditions a non exponential decay response curve was noted and the curve was described using three different models based on the proposed models we developed the method to correct the measured matric potential or capillary pressure with response time functions under saturated and unsaturated conditions thus the actual matric potential during a transient condition can be revealed from the data obtained using tensiometers these models were used to adjust the measured matric potentials for the dynamic wrc experiments before correction the dynamic wrcs measured using the tensiometers with different ceramic cups were inconsistent but became similar after correcting with the response functions the delayed effect of a tensiometer can cause a significant impact on the measurements of dynamic wrcs and it can be corrected using the proposed models practically for a tensiometer used in field and for long term measurement during the measurement a completely de aired tensiometer system is difficult to achieve instead a rapid response tensiometer is commonly used however a custom designed tensiometer usually requires an assembly of a ceramic cup with a high kc value and large pores which may be susceptible to damage and blockage by air and small particles in field in particular experiments conducted using a custom designed tensiometer are difficult to reproduce and limited to the field therefore in this study we developed a method to correct the measured values of commercially available tensiometers with response time functions our study findings might help quantify erroneous readings due to response time and thus extend the service life of a commercialized tensiometer attached to a non special ceramic cup for long term use declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

5781,in recent years more studies have been focusing on the transient behaviors of the movement of soil water and changes in matric potential which require the measurement of the rapid changes in matric potential or capillary pressure because of the delayed response the value of the matric potential measured using a tensiometer may not precisely reflect the actual matric potential during a transient condition we performed a series of experiments to analyze the effect of grain size effective saturation and the hydraulic conductivities of ceramic cup and porous media on the response time of a tensiometer the outcomes suggested that a decrease of hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic cup significantly increases the response time moreover the response time measured under unsaturated conditions did not follow an ideal exponential decay this finding was consistent with the existing theories based on which we proposed three models to describe the time varied response function these models were applied to correct the measured matric potential for dynamic water retention curve wrc and the findings were compared with those of other existing methods used for measuring the matric potential we found that the incorporation of the theory of response time significantly reduced the discrepancy between the matric potential measured using two ceramic cups with different response times during dynamic drainage we concluded that the delayed response of a tensiometer can have a significant effect on the measurement of the transient matric potential or capillary pressure and can be corrected using response time equations keywords response time dynamic matric potential dynamic water retention curve 1 introduction tensiometers have been one of the major instruments used in the quantification of soil matric potential by providing measurements of the water pressure inside a porous cup in laboratory and field environments for decades camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 kirkham 2014 lo et al 2017 or 2001 tokunaga 2005 nevertheless a tensiometer requires a finite time which is called the response time to transfer the matric potential through the ceramic cup to the pressure transducer in recent years studies on the transient behaviors of matric potential or capillary pressure during rapid soil water movements such as preferential flow saturation overshoot and dynamic effect on the water retention curve wrc require the measurement of the rapid changes in the matric potential or capillary pressure hassanizadeh and gray 1990 mokady and low 1964 topp et al 1967 the flow rate dependent wrc is called dynamic capillary effects on wrc or dynamic wrc the deviation between the dynamic and static wrcs which is defined as the dynamic effect can be incorrectly assessed when the effect of the tensiometer response time is ignored camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 when a tensiometer reading is obtained without sufficient time for the instrument to re equilibrate the apparent matric potential will deviate from the actual value tokunaga 1992 this deviation depends on the drainage system in previous studies the lag in the matric potential measurement led to an overestimation of the dynamic effects when the air was pressurized hou et al 2012 and an underestimation when the water was extracted by vacuuming camps roach et al 2010 lo et al 2017 to reduce the effects of the delayed response dicarlo 2007 and hou et al 2012 created their own custom designed tensiometers with highly permeable ceramic cups however the experiments performed using the custom designed tensiometers can not be easily reproduced in addition the ceramic cups of such tensiometers usually have high conductivity and large pores hence they can mainly be used in the laboratory but are susceptible to damage and blockage by air and small particles when used in fields therefore the delayed response of tensiometers for measuring the matric potential is still one of the major concerns for investigating the rapid changes in the matric potential or capillary pressure abidoye and das 2014 camps roach et al 2010 hassanizadeh et al 2002 hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 and correcting the measured data obtained from the delayed response of standardized tensiometer products such as commercialized tensiometers is still necessary furthermore systematic investigations of the effect of the ceramic cup physical properties soil structure and soil moisture on the response time of tensiometers are still rare we performed a series of experiments to analyze the effect of grain size effective saturation and hydraulic conductivities of the ceramic cup and porous media on the response time of a tensiometer a tensiometer only senses the changes in the matric potential when the water flows through the ceramic cup klute and gardner 1962 towner 1980 the delayed response of a tensiometer could be related to the volume flux of the water as it passes through the ceramic cup previous studies have indicated that the pores in a ceramic cup become blocked by soil particles or air after long term use and the volume flux of water passing through the ceramic cup decreases resulting in the diminution of the cup conductance and increase in the response time hou et al 2012 tokunaga 2005 in addition the tensiometer response time was shown to be affected by the soil hydraulic conductivity which is a function of soil moisture and matric potential hayashi et al 1997 hou et al 2012 selker et al 1992 based on towner s 1981 model selker et al 1992 established a relationship between the response time and soil hydraulic conductivity and showed that the lower is the hydraulic conductivity the more significantly is the response time affected by the hydraulic conductivity hayashi et al 1997 indicated that a non exponential decay in the tensiometer response can occur when the soil water storage and tensiometer shape were considered under unsaturated conditions by solving the three dimensional richards equation hayashi et al 1997 showed that when the flow resistance of the porous cup is sufficiently small the soil water storage and soil water dynamic can cause a non exponential decay in the tensiometer response under unsaturated conditions in addition they proposed a practical method to inverse the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity with the tensiometer response data although the theory of response time has been well investigated in the past few decades the current literature shows that only few dynamic wrc studies have corrected their measured matric potential based on the response time theories hou et al 2012 lo et al 2017 moreover these studies did not consider the non exponential response decay of the tensiometer under unsaturated conditions a systematic investigation of the effect of the ceramic cup and effective saturation on the tensiometer response time should improve the usage of tensiometers for measuring rapid changes in matric potential whether this error can be corrected and improved to prolong the service life of the ceramic cup is one of the practical issues for measuring matric potential in the field in this study we measured the response time of a tensiometer for different grain sizes ceramic cups and water contents and quantitatively evaluated the effect of the ceramic cup conductance and effective saturation on the response time of the tensiometer to correct the effect of delayed response under unsaturated condition we established new physical based models to describe the non ideal response decay curve and the time varied response time furthermore we performed drainage experiments to show that the effect of the delayed response on the dynamic wrc measurement can be corrected by considering the response time the methodology of response time and measurement is detailed in section 2 in section 3 the results and discussion of response time measurement and the dynamic wrc experiment are presented the conclusion is included in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 theory of tensiometer response time klute and gardner 1962 regarded that the volume flux of water across the cup is the product of the difference of pressures in the inner and outer ceramic cups and the conductance of the ceramic cups 1 dv dt c p s cup p t where v m3 is the unit volume of water across the ceramic cup p s cup m is the matric potential at the interface between the ceramic cup and the surrounding soil pt m is the water potential head in the tensiometer inner pressure of the ceramic cup and c m2 s is the conductance of the ceramic cup both p s cup and pt can vary with time the relationship between the ceramic cup matric potential and volume flux of water is shown in fig 1 following a chain rule 1 c dv d p t d p t dt p s cup p t the response time of a tensiometer t s is defined as follows 2 t p s cup p t d p t dt 1 c s t where st m 2 is the gauge sensitivity of the entire tensiometer system s t d p t d v defined as the change in a tensiometer s pressure reading per unit volume exchange dv across the ceramic cup tokunaga 2005 towner 1981 three assumptions for eq 2 are to be noted i the gauge storage capacity is constant ii soil hydraulic conductivity is constant and iii soil has no water storage capacity hayashi et al 1997 nevertheless these assumptions are generally invalid in unsaturated soils even under saturated conditions assumption iii can be invalid since soils can have some water storage capacity towner 1981 used the method of solving an analogous heat conduction problem and developed a time response equation for tensiometers embedded in soil by combining the response time of instruments and that of the soil effect 3 t 1 s t 1 c 1 4 π r k where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of soil and r m is the outer radius of the ceramic cups the first part of eq 3 describes the effect of the instrument and the second part presents the effect on the response time caused by the soil from eq 3 both k and st are important factors for the response time of a tensiometer biesheuvel et al 1999 for unsaturated soils water storage capacity hydraulic conductivity and matric potential vary with water content hayashi et al 1997 considered the three dimensional soil water flow across the ceramic cup soil water dynamic was described by the equations relating to soil hydraulic conductivity for the total potential head in the ceramic cup and in soil under unsaturated conditions 4 d p t dt s t a k p s cup p s n d a 5 c w p s t k p s 2 p s where a m2 is the outer surface area of a ceramic cup n is the outward normal unit vector and cw m 1 is the water capacity of soil the numerical solution of eqs 4 and 5 shows that in the three dimension conditions the delayed response of a tensiometer is related to the shape of the tensiometer and soil water storage a non exponential decay response curve can occur in unsaturated soil hayashi et al 1997 equations 4 and 5 can be further linearized by fixing k and cw to correct the measured matric potential affected by the delayed response hou et al 2012 and lo et al 2017 followed eq 2 with a constant t nevertheless when any of the assumptions for eq 2 is invalid developing a method to correct the measured matric potential is necessary by considering a non exponential decay response curve for a non exponential decay response curve or under soil limiting conditions we introduce an effective response time teff s and eq 2 becomes 6 t eff p s p t d p t dt we derived the time varied teff based on geometric and analytical solutions consider a three dimension flow under a soil limiting condition where the effect of the ceramic cup is neglected the relationship between ps and p s cup from the solution of towner 1980 equation h in appendix can be used to write coupling eq 2 as follows 7 p s p t 0 p s cup p t 0 1 α 1 β 1 2 γ 1 2 e α 1 β 1 γ 1 2 α 1 2 e β 1 γ 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 e

following equation 8 q 3 c 2 π r 2 k 1 r q 2 c s t d q c s t dr 0 according to eqs 6 and 7 and the solution of pt from towner 1980 the effective response time based on the model proposed by towner 1980 is 9 t eff 1 d α 1 β 1 2 γ 1 2 e α 1 β 1 γ 1 2 α 1 2 e β 1 γ 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 e γ 1 α 1 3 β 1 2 γ 1 2 e α 1 β 1 3 γ 1 2 α 1 2 e β 1 γ 1 3 α 1 2 β 1 2 e γ 1 we further simplified the model by reducing the flow dimension but preserved the physical concept from towner s work the formation of teff can be further simplified by reducing the three dimensional flow to one dimensional 1 d flow we rewrote eqs 4 and 5 into a form for a 1 d flow system the coupling eq 10 describes the water pressures in the ceramic cup and in the soil outside the ceramic cup which is based on the linearized 1 d richards equation with a fixed diffusion coefficient d m2 s 10 p t t s t a k p s x p s t d 2 p s x 2 where x is the distance from the ceramic cup the derivative rule of the laplace transform is used

the roots of the following equation 12 ω 2 1 tk s t a ω 1 td 0 from coupling eq 2 the solution to the relationship between ps and p s cup can be written as follows 13 p s p t 0 p s cup p t 0 1 ξ 1 ξ 2

computation of the complementary error functions and roots of a quadratic function in eq 1 the delayed response is mainly due to the amount of volume flux of water dv d t across the cup of a tensiometer thus the model can be further simplified by focusing on predicting the volume flux crossing the ceramic cup of a tensiometer barry et al 1993 revealed that in a homogeneous porous media the analytical solution of the cumulative infiltration from 1 d richards equation is consistent with that from green ampt model green and ampt 1911 in addition green ampt model is feasible under variable head conditions freyberg et al 1980 therefore alternatively the volume flux through the boundary of a ceramic cup and the soil should be described using green ampt model as shown in fig 1 in the case of soil water around the ceramic cup the sharp wetting front might not be well defined but green ampt model could still be able to estimate the volume flux across the ceramic cup in green ampt model the volume flux of water in the soil around the ceramic cup is 15 dv dt a k p s cup t p s p s cup t l t l m is the distance between the location of the wetting front and the ceramic cup the

substituting p s cup t into eq 16 and assuming that water flows with a constant soil hydraulic conductivity k p s cup t k in l t we have a new equation similar to eq 2 17 t 1 s t a l t k p s p t t d p

measured matric potential and wrc is shown in section 3 3 2 2 experimental materials four uniform spherical glass beads named b35 b60 b150 and b320 with different grain sizes were used in the experiments the grain size distribution geometric mean grain size and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the glass beads are shown in table 1 the particle density is 2 5 g cm3 the grain size distributions of b35 b60 b150 and b320 range from 200 to 700 μm 100 to 600 μm 50 to 230 μm and 1 to 200 μm respectively their geometric mean grain sizes are 451 348 138 and 13 μm respectively the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks of b35 b60 b150 and b320 are 1 4 10 1 5 10 2 9 5 10 3 and 9 2 10 4 cm s respectively more detailed information on the properties of the experimental materials can be found in tsai et al 2018 the tensiometer used in this study is model 2100f from soilmoisture equipment corp u s a this tensiometer 2100f includes a ceramic cup and cup tube assembly vent tube plastic body tube and digital pressure transducer model 5301 2 bar pressure difference range 1 accuracy the ceramic cup of the 2100f consists of a porous ceramic al2o3 sintered material which is homogeneous permeable and stiff the physical properties of the ceramic cup are shown in table 2 as early as 1983 some researchers used digital pressure transducers to measure soil matric potential they have the following advantages easy to use low maintenance and less erroneous readings marthaler et al 1983 the pressure transducer in our tensiometer is attached to the body tube and allows continuous monitoring of soil matric potential with time before using tensiometer 2100f we first immersed the ceramic cups in deionized water for more than 24 h to fill the pores with water second by slowly filling and pushing the de aired pure water after boiling deionized water we forced water through the tubes and the ceramic cup to purge air from the system third we excluded the entrapped air released from the water and the porous cup to achieve de airing or outgassing the entrapped air needed to be purged from the tensiometer by outgassing with a vacuum pump and refilling de aired pure water repeatedly to ensure that no air bubbles were present in the system moreover in the dynamic matric potential experiment the soil moisture sensor ec 5 decagon devices inc specifications length 8 9 cm width 1 8 cm height 0 7 cm measurement time 10 ms volumetric water content range from 0 to saturation resolution 0 001 cm3 cm3 accuracy 0 03 cm3 cm3 was used to measure the water content during the drainage process the tensiometer and sensor have been widely used in both laboratory experiments and field measurements camps roach et al 2010 hou et al 2012 kirkham 2014 lo et al 2017 or 2001 in this study tensiometer 2100f and sensor ec 5 were calibrated with pure water and six known water contents of glass bead b35 respectively the pressure transducer was also tested in a positive negative varying pressure field by using the same tube setup to clearly confirm that its response time was 0 24 s in pure water in all experiments the pure water used refers to deionized water that has been boiled and used within an hour after cooling 2 3 measurement of tensiometer response time we used two ceramic cups labeled o and n which have the same material and dimensions with different saturated hydraulic conductivities of ceramic cups kc to investigate the influence of kc on the response time of the tensiometer the low kc of ceramic cup o is due to the long term usage similar to the investigation by marthaler et al 1983 who used the tensiometer system of ceramic cup and pressure transducer to connect to a data logger their ceramic cups were used in a grass covered flood irrigated field for about three years and 2 to 10 min were required for complete re equilibration before the start of each experiment we immersed the cups o and n in pure water for more than 24 h we also ensured that no air bubbles were present in the tubes after the ceramic cup was attached to the tensiometer after each experiment the tubes were examined for entrapped air and the ceramic cup was carefully washed and immersed in pure water for the next experiment furthermore we adjusted the depth of the ceramic cup under water to check the corresponding pressure reading of the tensiometer we first performed the response time experiment in pure water to eliminate the soil condition effects klute and gardner 1962 towner 1981 during the response experiments in pure water the ceramic cup of the tensiometer was first placed under the water surface after the reading of the pressure became stable we rapidly moved the ceramic cup to a depth of 5 cm and recorded the measured value of pressure pt over time according to eq 2 in pure water the measured response time is solely controlled by the ceramic cup conductance c and the gauge sensitivity st of the tensiometer system to investigate the impact of grain size and effective saturation on the response time of the tensiometer we measured the tensiometer response to the changing matric potential by using the same ceramic cup in different glass beads b35 b60 b150 and b320 with different effective saturations the controlled effective saturation se levels of the glass beads were se 1 se 0 37 and se 0 to prepare the saturated sample we first poured deionized water into the container next we slowly sprinkled glass beads from a height of 3 cm above the water surface and tapped the outer wall of the container with a rubber rake to evenly distribute the grains of glass beads unsaturated samples in which water was gradually added into and evenly stirred until the effective saturation was 0 37 volumetric water content 0 2 cm3 cm3 were packed into the container with the same method as that used for saturated packing the dry samples se 0 were prepared by 7 day air drying and packing by using the same method first the ceramic cup was placed in water until the registered pressure became stable next we inserted the cup into a small hole in the center of the sample surface and pushed it to a depth of approximately 5 cm and recorded the changing pt until it approached a steady state finally the aforementioned process was repeated for the four kinds of glass beads under three different effective saturations se 1 se 0 37 and se 0 2 4 measurement of dynamic water retention curve a device diagram for measuring the wrcs under dynamic and static conditions is shown in fig 2 the bottom of the sandbox was connected to a pump or mariotte s bottle for a fixed drainage rate or a constant head boundary condition the glass bead b35 was gradually and uniformly packed into a sandbox acrylic material length 30 cm width 20 cm height 30 cm we slowly injected water from the bottom of the sandbox by using the mariotte s bottle which was gradually raised to ensure that the sandbox was completely saturated the sandbox was equipped with tensiometer 2100f on one side and the soil moisture sensor ec 5 was installed on the other side the ceramic cup was placed near the center of the entire profile the distances from the cup to glass bead surface and sandbox bottom in the vertical direction are both 10 cm and to front and rear box walls in the horizontal direction are also 10 cm the ceramic cup and ec 5 sensor were placed horizontally and at the same vertical level their tips were about 2 cm apart the 2100f and ec 5 were connected to a data logger during the drainage process the changes in matric potential and water content were simultaneously measured using the 2100f and ec 5 mariotte s bottle was used to control the constant head boundary condition for measuring the static wrcs a pump was used to drain the water from the sandbox at a constant drainage rate for the dynamic wrc experiments the static wrc experiments were performed as follows 1 the glass beads were initially saturated and the water level in the mariotte s bottle connected to the bottom of the sandbox was initially set to match the height of the surface of the glass beads 2 the matric potential negative pressure was generated in a stepwise manner by reducing the elevation of the mariotte s bottle while maintaining atmospheric pressure at the surface of the sandbox the incremental decrease in the height of the mariotte s bottle was 5 cm 3 after the elevation of the mariotte s bottle was adjusted decreased matric potential the outflowing mass of water was measured we assumed that a static condition was reached when no water content change was detected from ec 5 4 when the static condition was reached the equilibrium matric potential and moisture content were measured simultaneously by using the 2100f with ceramic cup n and ec 5 the mariotte s bottle was then lowered 5 we repeated steps 3 and 4 and stopped the experiment when the mariotte s bottle reached the bottom of the sandbox similar experimental processes have been performed in other studies lo et al 2017 sakaki et al 2010 the experimental setup for the measurement of dynamic wrcs was similar to that under static conditions first we used tensiometer 2100f with ceramic cup n to measure the dynamic wrcs the following steps were used 1 the glass beads were initially saturated and the water level was set to just match the surface of glass beads 2 we generated matric potential negative pressure by pumping water out through a pump at the bottom of the sandbox the pumping flow rate was fixed to 1 11 cm3 s 3 while pumping the matric potential and water content were continuously recorded via the 2100f and ec 5 during the whole drainage period 4 the collected matric potential and water content were averaged over 15 s periods 5 the experiment was stopped after 30 40 min of pumping 6 we repeated steps 1 5 but used tensiometer 2100f with ceramic cup o 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the hydraulic conductivity of ceramic cups on response time the relationships between pt which is standardized from the measured pt via the tensiometers with ceramic cups o and n where p t p s p t p s p 0 versus t a d pt versus dpt dt b e and the corresponding response time t versus t c f in pure water are shown in fig 3 the white circles in fig 3 a and d represent the standardized pt values and the solid black line is based on eq 2 fitting to the observed data in fig 3 b and e the black circles are the ratios of pt to dpt dt the overall slope of the linear distribution could be regarded as the average response time in eq 2 in fig 3 c and f the black circles show a nearly constant t calculated from eq 2 for measuring the changes in water potential head of pure water the dotted line represents the average t value of the response time from eq 2 however in fig 3 c and f when dpt dt became small in the later period of the experiment a small measurement noise of the sensor in pt led to a large change in t for all practical purposes the variation of the late t should not significantly affect the data interpretation of soil water dynamics since the change in pt at the late stage is small from the results of fig 3 the discrepancy between the response times of the tensiometer with ceramic cups o and n are mainly attributed to the difference in kc between the ceramic cups under saturated conditions according to the response time model of klute and gardner 1962 and towner 1981 in pure water the response time of a tensiometer is only dependent on c and st the st can be inversed from eq 2 with a measured t and a known c value of a tensiometer thus according to towner 1980 1981 and tokunaga 2005 c is closely related to the characteristics of the ceramic cup and can be written as follows 23 c 4 π r i r k c r r i where r and ri m are the outer and inner radii of the ceramic cup respectively in pure water considering the physical characteristics of the ceramic cup in table 2 and eq 23 st 3 9 104 cm 2 of our tensiometer system connecting the electronic pressure transducer model 5301 was obtained by using a brand new ceramic cup that has kc 7 56 10 7 cm s and measured t 8 7 s the st value is in accordance with the range considered by tokunaga 2005 and the st of the electronic pressure transducer is in the range of 103 105 cm 2 the same tensiometer system was used for all experiments and the st value was the same in our study we also calculated the c values of cups o and n by using eq 2 with measured t and known st in pure water the kc values were obtained using eq 23 the values of kc and c of the ceramic cups o and n are shown in table 3 3 2 effect of grain size and effective saturation on the response time 3 2 1 saturated conditions in fig 4 c f j and m the trend of t values versus time for glass beads with different grain sizes was close to a linear relationship during the experiments the average response times calculated using eq 2 for the saturated b35 b60 b150 and b320 were 82 81 75 and 76 s respectively table 4 the results showed that the effect of grain size of the glass beads on the response time was insignificant under saturated conditions the constant response time of the tensiometer was close to that measured from the response experiments in pure water as shown in table 4 although the grain size is related to the hydraulic conductivity arya et al 1999 the ks of our smallest glass bead b320 was not sufficiently small referring to ceramic cup conductance to affect the response time of the tensiometer 3 2 2 unsaturated conditions the non exponential decay curve of pt t the nonlinear pt dpt dt and a time varied t under unsaturated conditions are shown in figs 5 and 6 the deviation between the ideal with a constant t and non exponential decay curves of pt t increased as the se decreased from 0 37 to 0 the measured non ideal case was consistent with the theoretical data and numerical simulation by hayashi et al 1997 therefore the time varied teff in eqs 9 14 and 22 which includes the tensiometer response characteristic and soil limiting term is needed to describe the non exponential decay response curve the ideal exponential decay curve dashed line based on eq 2 with a constant t poorly fits the measured pt t white circles for the dry glass bead b320 se 0 but the measured data can be well described by towner s equation 1980 1 d richards equation and green ampt model approach by using the time varied teff solid lines fig 7 a the fitting parameters are shown in table 5 moreover the deviations between the model predictions solid lines and measured response time black circles fig 7 b could have contributed to the simplified flow geometry and the linearization of richards equation which have been indicated by hayashi et al 1997 3 3 the correction of the measured p t hou et al 2012 and lo et al 2017 applied eq 2 to estimate the dynamic ps by correcting the measured pt with a constant response time t nevertheless under soil limiting conditions the response time of a tensiometer in eq 2 should be replaced by the time dependent effective response time teff as shown in eq 6 by substituting the measured pt and the calculated teff into eq 6 we obtained the matric potential ps in soil around the ceramic cup the estimated ps of glass bead b35 obtained using eq 6 with teff based on towner 1980 eq 9 1 d richards equation eq 14 and green ampt model eq 22 is shown in fig 8 since the soil water saturation remained constant during the experiments a constant matric potential ps should be expected under the saturated and unsaturated conditions most of the estimated ps values were nearly constant fig 8 however in the early stage of the unsaturated condition the ps estimated using eq 2 with a constant t black circles was unsteady and gradually reached a constant therefore at the early stage the use of eq 2 with a constant t to estimate ps from measured pt could produce a systematic bias under unsaturated conditions conversely the ps estimated using teff from the three models was similar to each other implying similar performance of the three models in estimating the true value of ps in the next section the correction method of using eq 6 with teff was adopted to correct the measured matric potential during dynamic wrc measurement 3 4 effects of response time on the dynamic wrc measurement the dynamic matric potential and wrcs of glass bead b35 which were measured using ceramic cups o dot dashed blue line and n dotted orange line under the drainage flow rate of 1 11 cm3 s and the static matric potential and static wrc which were measured using a water head difference of 5 cm solid black line are shown in fig 9 error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean of three experimental replicates furthermore the van genuchten 1980 model is widely used to describe wrcs 24 s e 1 α p s n m where se m3 m3 is the effective saturation s e θ θ r θ s θ r θ m3 m3 is the volumetric water content the subscript letters s and r indicate saturated and residual respectively and α m 1 n and m are the parameters of the mode1 m 1 1 n assumed by van genuchten 1980 the fitting parameters based on eq 24 with the measured data are α 0 064 cm 1 n 4 94 for ceramic cup o and α 0 038 cm 1 n 10 38 for ceramic cup n table 3 in fig 9 the measured dynamic wrc with ceramic cup n agreed with the findings of previous studies that the matric potential under dynamic conditions was greater than that of the static wrc during drainage sakaki et al 2010 however the dynamic wrc measured using the same tensiometer with ceramic cup o was significantly lower than that measured using ceramic cup n and that of static wrc the underestimated dynamic matric potential pc in dynamic wrc measured using ceramic cup o showed that the delayed effect of the tensiometer response time owing to the ceramic cup characteristic can be significant while measuring the rapid changes in matric potential in addition the uncorrected dynamic wrc measured using ceramic cup o could yield findings contradictory to those obtained by previous studies sakaki et al 2010 that is when the water was vacuumed during drainage the wrc in the dynamic conditions was greater than that in the static condition we followed the method mentioned in section 3 3 to correct the measured dynamic matric potential in wrc by using the response time functions the measured dynamic wrc of glass bead b35 with ceramic cup n and the corrected dynamic matric potential pc obtained using eq 6 with 1 a constant t 124 which is the average value from 82 se 1 120 se 0 37 and 170 se 0 2 the teff based on towner 1980 eq 9 3 the teff based on 1 d richards equation eq 14 and 4 the teff based on green ampt model eq 22 is shown in fig 10 the parameters required for the above mentioned equations were derived from the fitting parameters of the unsaturated b35 se 0 37 the result showed that the corrected pc with the constant t crosses was higher than that with teff squares triangles and diamonds the difference slightly decreased as the effective saturation decreased indicating that correction of the measured matric potential by using eq 2 with a constant t which is used in most of the previous studies can still lead to the overestimation of the dynamic effect of wrc when the water was vacuumed during drainage the corrected values of pc obtained using eq 6 with the time varied teff from the different models are close to each other and even overlapped therefore we applied the simplest teff from green ampt based model to correct the values of pc measured using the tensiometers with ceramic cup o the measured pc in the dynamic wrcs of glass bead b35 measured using ceramic cups o and n with and without correction by using eq 6 with teff is shown in fig 11 after correction the deviation between the wrcs from the corrected pc of ceramic cups o and n green triangles and red diamonds was significantly reduced we concluded that the significant difference between the dynamic wrcs measured using ceramic cups o and n was attributed to the difference in the delayed tensiometer response without considering the response time the dynamic effect of wrc which is the difference between the dynamic and static wrc can be wrongly assessed during drainage the errors in the matric potential measurement owing to the response time can be corrected using the proposed method with time varied teff the response time of a tensiometer increases as the usage of the ceramic cup increases in particular owing to the pore size in the ceramic the ceramic cup can be blocked by air bubbles tiny particles or other contaminants in soil and water or bacterial growth may adhere to the ceramic surface our study showed that the measured transient matric potentials from two distinct ceramic cups can be very different because of the difference in the response time therefore the time dependent response time of the tensiometer may also cause difficulties in monitoring the transient matric potential or capillary pressure in field traditionally this problem was addressed by replacing the old ceramic cup with a new one or cleaning and re calibrating it in the laboratory however our study showed that the measurement errors due to the increase of the response time can be reduced by using the proposed methods for example for some tensiometers used in field over a long term the measured data can be corrected by considering their response time by installing a new tensiometer with a known response time close to the old tensiometer in field we can obtain the measured matric potentials of the new and old tensiometers the corrected matric potential from the new tensiometer is regarded as ps and we can estimate teff of the old tensiometer by using eq 6 and further correct the measured data from the old tensiometer without disturbing the soil surrounding the old tensiometer and interrupting the monitoring process this might extend the service life of tensiometers especially when they are installed in field 4 conclusions in this study a series of experiments was performed to systematically investigate the influence of the ceramic cup hydraulic conductivity grain size and effective saturation on the response time of a tensiometer the results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic cup significantly affected the response time of the tensiometer during the response experiments the hydraulic conductivity and grain size of the glass bead had a limited effect on the response time under saturated conditions but significantly affected the response time under unsaturated conditions furthermore under unsaturated or soil limiting conditions a non exponential decay response curve was noted and the curve was described using three different models based on the proposed models we developed the method to correct the measured matric potential or capillary pressure with response time functions under saturated and unsaturated conditions thus the actual matric potential during a transient condition can be revealed from the data obtained using tensiometers these models were used to adjust the measured matric potentials for the dynamic wrc experiments before correction the dynamic wrcs measured using the tensiometers with different ceramic cups were inconsistent but became similar after correcting with the response functions the delayed effect of a tensiometer can cause a significant impact on the measurements of dynamic wrcs and it can be corrected using the proposed models practically for a tensiometer used in field and for long term measurement during the measurement a completely de aired tensiometer system is difficult to achieve instead a rapid response tensiometer is commonly used however a custom designed tensiometer usually requires an assembly of a ceramic cup with a high kc value and large pores which may be susceptible to damage and blockage by air and small particles in field in particular experiments conducted using a custom designed tensiometer are difficult to reproduce and limited to the field therefore in this study we developed a method to correct the measured values of commercially available tensiometers with response time functions our study findings might help quantify erroneous readings due to response time and thus extend the service life of a commercialized

matrix block size distributions ranjbar et al 2013 reis 1998 the assumption of the proposed model was based on warren and root model that is uniform in matrix block size in order to improve the flow modeling in the fractured reservoirs we need to consider the matrix block size distribution the most common matrix block size distribution that can be observed in the fractured reservoirs is

simulator and imbibition test data reported by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 were used bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 undertook spontaneous water oil imbibition tests with different types including co current counter currents and both simultaneously on strongly water wet rock samples experimentally the authors made use of homogenous parallelepiped blocks with average 118 137 md permeability and 23 3 percent porosity the initial water saturation was set to 40 percent in the tests synthetic brine and light refine oil with api of 55 were incorporated also to validate the derived analytical solution from another viewpoint a radial model was numerically solved as shown in fig 2 the blocks at the matrix block interface are small enough to perfectly observe the water advancement into the matrix the water injection and liquid production are at constant rate and constant pressure correspondingly the production well is perforated in the last fracture grid block in order to verify the one dimensional flow in the matrix the permeability of the matrix blocks is set to zero in the r and θ directions the facture matrix block and fluid properties used to simulate water flooding model are given in table 3 these parameters are based on counter current imbibition experiments by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 the fracture relative permeabilities are assumed to be linear functions of saturation and the irreducible saturation and capillary pressure in the fracture are zero counter current relative permeabilities and capillary pressure from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 are shown in fig 3 fig 4 compares oil recovery using the presented analytical model and numerical simulator with that of the counter current imbibition experimental data to compare the results of the analytical model with the laboratory data the matrix block is considered around the injection well also behbahani 2004 modeled counter current imbibition experiments bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 in one dimension by using an industry standard reservoir simulator eclipse 100 4 results and discussion in this section using the presented analytical model the fluid flow during the two phase flow is examined also the effect of the block size distribution capillary diffusion coefficient and capillary number on water saturation is investigated then type curves are generated to characterize the fractured reservoir parameters fig 5 shows that by increasing the value of a the buildup of the water saturation in the monitoring well during water injection takes effect slower this is because for positive values of a intense fracturing matrix block sizes are smaller and injected water has a larger contact area with matrix block hence a higher rate of imbibition inside the fractured reservoir exists fig 6 shows the derivative of water saturation in the fracture for exponential probability density functions at a given distance from the well as depicted in fig 7 by increasing the value of m which implies a larger rock matrix block size of the fractured reservoir the imbibition mechanism between the fracture and matrix blocks takes place slower thus one can capture water saturation in the monitoring well faster fig 8 shows the derivative of water saturation in the fracture for linear probability density functions at a given distance from the well figs 6 and 8 show the derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation versus dimensionless time for exponential and linear probability density functions the results show that dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation for different probability density functions is independent of the fracture intensity distribution as can be seen the water saturation derivative plot expresses a unique feature fig 9 shows dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation in the monitoring well for different capillary numbers in fact the dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation decreases by increasing the capillary number by increasing the water injection rate the velocity of the water inside the fracture increases and causes the water to reach the monitoring well sooner and the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation will occur in less time during water injection in the fractured reservoirs fracture capillary diffusion coefficient is not known this coefficient is independent of the fracture intensity distribution and we can use different capillary diffusion coefficient values for various fracture intensity distributions fig 10 shows dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation in the monitoring well for different capillary diffusion coefficient and capillary numbers as shown in fig 10 for a small value of capillary diffusion coefficient the maximum derivative is independent of the capillary diffusion coefficient for large values of capillary diffusion coefficient the maximum derivative is inversely proportional to the capillary diffusion coefficient in this paper we seek to estimate the capillary diffusion coefficient and fracture intensity distribution using water saturation data in the monitoring well previously haddad et al 2014 used a similar approach for block size distribution and dispersivity coefficient by analyzing tracer test data in order to examine water injection efficiency in fractured reservoirs a number of parameters including breakthrough time water saturation reservoir pressure and fluid samples at monitoring well are usually measured for saturation water one can incorporate saturation or temperature logs which are run in the wellbore in the monitoring well simultaneously with other logging tools to evaluate water injection in fractured carbonate reservoirs wu et al 2015 therefore it is not required to accomplish a specific test in the reservoir during the process of water injection the proposed method is applicable even when only the information related to water saturation in the monitoring well is accessible with no other available data in this regard one can estimate rock matrix block size distribution and capillary diffusion coefficient on the field scale in addition in a typical tracer test tracer is added to the injection water and then monitored in the observation well the cost of these two methods i e tracer injection and well logs are different depending on the field operational conditions thus one could use either of them based on the technical and economic analyses in order to assess matrix block size distribution to characterize the reservoir we first calculate the capillary diffusion coefficient then according to the available information we predict the matrix block size distribution based on figs 6 and 8 the dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation is independent of the fracture intensity distribution using the water saturation information in the monitoring well and plotting the fracture dimensionless water saturation derivative versus dimensionless time we can find tdmax then the dimensionless capillary diffusion coefficient can be obtained using fig 10 utilizing this plot it is easy to calculate fracture capillary diffusion coefficient on field scale in figs 11 and 12 the dimensionless water saturation plots in the monitoring well versus probability density function parameters at different times are generated by using calculated fracture capillary diffusion coefficient and other parameters such as storativity ratio capillary number matrix capillary diffusion coefficient and distance from the injection well using eqs 10 and 11 we can calculate the probability density function parameters and characterize the rock matrix block distribution this method is based on saturation data during water injection which differs from previous methods such as well testing based on pressure diffusion or tracer test based on mass transfer figs 11 and 12 indicate the water saturation at different dimensionless times for all values of a and m as depicted in figs 11 and 12 in order to characterize the fracture intensity fracture dimensionless water saturation data from a monitoring well can be plotted on the type curves then we can estimate the probability density function parameters a for exponential distribution or m for linear distribution using water saturation in the monitoring well at different times by integrating the matrix water saturation equation eq 17 the average water saturation can be defined as follows 28 s dwm 1 v m v m s dwm d v m when the fluid flow in the matrix reaches pseudo steady state the fluid rate is proportional to the saturation difference between matrix block and fracture as follows 29 q m σ d em s dwm s dwf in addition the fluid flow between matrix and fracture can be obtained in terms of matrix saturation by the following equation 30 q m ϕ m s dwm t combining eqs 29 and 30 yields 31 ϕ m s dwm t σ d em s dwm s dwf by using these equations the dimensionless shape factor can be derived as follows 32 σ l m 2 h r 2 1 θ s dwm t d s dwf s dwm fig 13 depicts the dimensionless shape factor for exponential probability density function considered for rd 10 ca 160 dr 0 01 and ω 0 032 as shown in fig 13 by reducing the size of the blocks the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture decreases also by reducing the size of the matrix block the fluid transfer rate between the matrix and the fracture increases which results in a reduction in the time required to reach pseudo steady state period the shape factor defined in this paper is transient and can be embedded within the commercial reservoir simulators to model the imbibition mechanism inside the fractured reservoirs fig 14 demonstrates the necessary steps that one should take to determine fracture capillary diffusion coefficient and fracture intensity distribution based on the measured water saturation data in the monitoring well the interpretation of water saturation data in monitoring well is described as an inverse problem whose determination of matrix block size distribution and imbibition shape factor can often results in a non unique solution particularly when the capillary diffusion coefficient is small fig 10 this problem can be averted by choosing the appropriate time and conditions when measuring saturation in the monitoring well for example in small capillary numbers also by comparing the results of this method with other methods such as well testing tracer testing and seismic results a better evaluation of the reservoir is performed although this analytical solution involves some simplifying assumptions it can still be a used as a useful and relatively fast tool for estimating the capillary diffusion coefficient and the matrix block size distribution on the field scale using the parameters obtained from this method the reservoir simulation model of water injection can be updated and thus the prediction accuracy increases 5 conclusions in this paper water injection modeling in fractured reservoirs was discussed and an analytical model was presented then the proposed analytical model was validated using laboratory data and a numerical model by using presented analytical model a graphical method was developed to estimate capillary diffusion coefficient and the matrix block size distribution based on water saturation data in the monitoring well during water injection according to the results the fracture capillary diffusion coefficient was independent of the fracture intensity distribution and this parameter could be calculated using the derivative plot of water saturation data in the monitoring well using the estimated capillary diffusion coefficient and other available data such as capillary number porosity ratio and distance from the injection well matrix block size could be determined using the proposed methodology and data at disposal the simulator model will become more accurate also an equation to predict the imbibition shape factor was formulated in accordance with viscous capillary transport through fracture network and capillary imbibition within the rock matrix blocks this model could account for the impact of fracture intensity distribution on fractured reservoirs the findings demonstrated that erroneous results are reached if block size distribution is ignored this can negatively affect the performance prediction and numerical evaluation of fractured reservoirs although an analytical solution was derived for an ideal system with a number of simplifying assumptions it is a framework for the scrutiny of imbibition mechanism in the fractured reservoirs this can further assist researchers for the verification of numerical models derived for this objective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

matrix block size distributions ranjbar et al 2013 reis 1998 the assumption of the proposed model was based on warren and root model that is uniform in matrix block size in order to improve the flow modeling in the fractured reservoirs we need to consider the matrix block size distribution the most common matrix block size distribution that can be observed in the fractured reservoirs is

simulator and imbibition test data reported by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 were used bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 undertook spontaneous water oil imbibition tests with different types including co current counter currents and both simultaneously on strongly water wet rock samples experimentally the authors made use of homogenous parallelepiped blocks with average 118 137 md permeability and 23 3 percent porosity the initial water saturation was set to 40 percent in the tests synthetic brine and light refine oil with api of 55 were incorporated also to validate the derived analytical solution from another viewpoint a radial model was numerically solved as shown in fig 2 the blocks at the matrix block interface are small enough to perfectly observe the water advancement into the matrix the water injection and liquid production are at constant rate and constant pressure correspondingly the production well is perforated in the last fracture grid block in order to verify the one dimensional flow in the matrix the permeability of the matrix blocks is set to zero in the r and θ directions the facture matrix block and fluid properties used to simulate water flooding model are given in table 3 these parameters are based on counter current imbibition experiments by bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 the fracture relative permeabilities are assumed to be linear functions of saturation and the irreducible saturation and capillary pressure in the fracture are zero counter current relative permeabilities and capillary pressure from bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 are shown in fig 3 fig 4 compares oil recovery using the presented analytical model and numerical simulator with that of the counter current imbibition experimental data to compare the results of the analytical model with the laboratory data the matrix block is considered around the injection well also behbahani 2004 modeled counter current imbibition experiments bourbiaux and kalaydjian 1990 in one dimension by using an industry standard reservoir simulator eclipse 100 4 results and discussion in this section using the presented analytical model the fluid flow during the two phase flow is examined also the effect of the block size distribution capillary diffusion coefficient and capillary number on water saturation is investigated then type curves are generated to characterize the fractured reservoir parameters fig 5 shows that by increasing the value of a the buildup of the water saturation in the monitoring well during water injection takes effect slower this is because for positive values of a intense fracturing matrix block sizes are smaller and injected water has a larger contact area with matrix block hence a higher rate of imbibition inside the fractured reservoir exists fig 6 shows the derivative of water saturation in the fracture for exponential probability density functions at a given distance from the well as depicted in fig 7 by increasing the value of m which implies a larger rock matrix block size of the fractured reservoir the imbibition mechanism between the fracture and matrix blocks takes place slower thus one can capture water saturation in the monitoring well faster fig 8 shows the derivative of water saturation in the fracture for linear probability density functions at a given distance from the well figs 6 and 8 show the derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation versus dimensionless time for exponential and linear probability density functions the results show that dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation for different probability density functions is independent of the fracture intensity distribution as can be seen the water saturation derivative plot expresses a unique feature fig 9 shows dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation in the monitoring well for different capillary numbers in fact the dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation decreases by increasing the capillary number by increasing the water injection rate the velocity of the water inside the fracture increases and causes the water to reach the monitoring well sooner and the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation will occur in less time during water injection in the fractured reservoirs fracture capillary diffusion coefficient is not known this coefficient is independent of the fracture intensity distribution and we can use different capillary diffusion coefficient values for various fracture intensity distributions fig 10 shows dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation in the monitoring well for different capillary diffusion coefficient and capillary numbers as shown in fig 10 for a small value of capillary diffusion coefficient the maximum derivative is independent of the capillary diffusion coefficient for large values of capillary diffusion coefficient the maximum derivative is inversely proportional to the capillary diffusion coefficient in this paper we seek to estimate the capillary diffusion coefficient and fracture intensity distribution using water saturation data in the monitoring well previously haddad et al 2014 used a similar approach for block size distribution and dispersivity coefficient by analyzing tracer test data in order to examine water injection efficiency in fractured reservoirs a number of parameters including breakthrough time water saturation reservoir pressure and fluid samples at monitoring well are usually measured for saturation water one can incorporate saturation or temperature logs which are run in the wellbore in the monitoring well simultaneously with other logging tools to evaluate water injection in fractured carbonate reservoirs wu et al 2015 therefore it is not required to accomplish a specific test in the reservoir during the process of water injection the proposed method is applicable even when only the information related to water saturation in the monitoring well is accessible with no other available data in this regard one can estimate rock matrix block size distribution and capillary diffusion coefficient on the field scale in addition in a typical tracer test tracer is added to the injection water and then monitored in the observation well the cost of these two methods i e tracer injection and well logs are different depending on the field operational conditions thus one could use either of them based on the technical and economic analyses in order to assess matrix block size distribution to characterize the reservoir we first calculate the capillary diffusion coefficient then according to the available information we predict the matrix block size distribution based on figs 6 and 8 the dimensionless time at the maximum derivative of the fracture dimensionless water saturation is independent of the fracture intensity distribution using the water saturation information in the monitoring well and plotting the fracture dimensionless water saturation derivative versus dimensionless time we can find tdmax then the dimensionless capillary diffusion coefficient can be obtained using fig 10 utilizing this plot it is easy to calculate fracture capillary diffusion coefficient on field scale in figs 11 and 12 the dimensionless water saturation plots in the monitoring well versus probability density function parameters at different times are generated by using calculated fracture capillary diffusion coefficient and other parameters such as storativity ratio capillary number matrix capillary diffusion coefficient and distance from the injection well using eqs 10 and 11 we can calculate the probability density function parameters and characterize the rock matrix block distribution this method is based on saturation data during water injection which differs from previous methods such as well testing based on pressure diffusion or tracer test based on mass transfer figs 11 and 12 indicate the water saturation at different dimensionless times for all values of a and m as depicted in figs 11 and 12 in order to characterize the fracture intensity fracture dimensionless water saturation data from a monitoring well can be plotted on the type curves then we can estimate the probability density function parameters a for exponential distribution or m for linear distribution using water saturation in the monitoring well at different times by integrating the matrix water saturation equation eq 17 the average water saturation can be defined as follows 28 s dwm 1 v m v m s dwm d v m when the fluid flow in the matrix reaches pseudo steady state the fluid rate is proportional to the saturation difference between matrix block and fracture as follows 29 q m σ d em s dwm s dwf in addition the fluid flow between matrix and fracture can be obtained in terms of matrix saturation by the following equation 30 q m ϕ m s dwm t combining eqs 29 and 30 yields 31 ϕ m s dwm t σ d em s dwm s dwf by using these equations the dimensionless shape factor can be derived as follows 32 σ l m 2 h r 2 1 θ s dwm t d s dwf s dwm fig 13 depicts the dimensionless shape factor for exponential probability density function considered for rd 10 ca 160 dr 0 01 and ω 0 032 as shown in fig 13 by reducing the size of the blocks the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture decreases also by reducing the size of the matrix block the fluid transfer rate between the matrix and the fracture increases which results in a reduction in the time required to reach pseudo steady state period the shape factor defined in this paper is transient and can be embedded within the commercial reservoir simulators to model the imbibition mechanism inside the fractured reservoirs fig 14 demonstrates the necessary steps that one should take to determine fracture capillary diffusion coefficient and fracture intensity distribution based on the measured water saturation data in the monitoring well the interpretation of water saturation data in monitoring well is described as an inverse problem whose determination of matrix block size distribution and imbibition shape factor can often results in a non unique solution particularly when the capillary diffusion coefficient is small fig 10 this problem can be averted by choosing the appropriate time and conditions when measuring saturation in the monitoring well for example in small capillary numbers also by comparing the results of this method with other methods such as well testing tracer testing and seismic results a better evaluation of the reservoir is performed although this analytical solution involves some simplifying assumptions it can still be a used as a useful and relatively fast tool for estimating the capillary diffusion coefficient and the matrix block size distribution on the field scale using the parameters obtained from this method the reservoir simulation model of water injection can be updated and thus the prediction accuracy increases 5 conclusions in this paper water injection modeling in fractured reservoirs was discussed and an analytical model was presented then the proposed analytical model was validated using laboratory data and a numerical model by using presented analytical model a graphical method was developed to estimate capillary diffusion coefficient and the matrix block size distribution based on water saturation data in the monitoring well during water injection according to the results the fracture capillary diffusion coefficient was independent of the fracture intensity distribution and this parameter could be calculated using the derivative plot of water saturation data in the monitoring well using the estimated capillary diffusion coefficient and other available data such as capillary number porosity ratio and distance from the injection well matrix block size could be determined using the proposed methodology and data at disposal the simulator model will become more accurate also an equation to predict the imbibition shape factor was formulated in accordance with viscous capillary transport through fracture network and capillary imbibition within the rock matrix blocks this model could account for the impact of fracture intensity distribution on fractured reservoirs the findings demonstrated that erroneous results are reached if block size distribution is ignored this can negatively affect the performance prediction and numerical evaluation of fractured reservoirs although an analytical solution was derived for an ideal system with a number of simplifying assumptions it is a framework for the scrutiny of imbibition mechanism in the fractured reservoirs this can further assist researchers for the verification of numerical models derived for this objective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

reappearance of historical water quality change process and prediction of future water quality change trend were important theoretical basis and data support for rational planning and integrated management of lake water resources water quality prediction was to establish the mapping relationship between multi variable observation data and water quality parameters by certain models and

chla in dianchi lake 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data source located in the middle of yunnan guizhou plateau dianchi lake is the sixth largest freshwater lake in china with an elevation about 1886 m an area about 330 km2 and an average water depth about 5 m it was a semi closed lake with only the south western haikou as its outlet he et al 2015 located in the southwestern monsoon of the subtropical plateau climate change was dominated by the alternation of southwest monsoon and tropical continental air mass luo et al 2017 and dianchi lake was the main water body of irrigation livestock regulation and acceptance in kunming area and also the basic condition of urban development it played an important role in the climate regulation of dianchi lake watershed lu et al 2015 gao et al 2015 in addition with the strategy of the belt and road yunnan province was being deeply integrated into the national strategy as the provincial capital of yunnan kunming has become an important radiation center for south and southeast asia controlling and improving the ecological environment of dianchi lake was the environmental basis for implementing and promoting the belt and road strategy therefore dianchi lake was chosen as the research area with regional characteristics urban lake on plateau and temporal characteristics the belt and road strategy the data in this study was obtained from the yunnan academy of environmental sciences and the yunnan bureau of hydrology and water resources which was daily observation data of 54 parameters as shown in table a 1 from 1 january 2005 to 31 december 2012 at 10 observation sites in dianchi lake the geographical distribution of the study area and observation sites are shown in fig 1 the 54 parameters we collected are important indicators for describing the lake water environment including the physical chemical and biological properties of water quality 2 2 methods 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm recurrent neural network rnn had the characteristics of memory parameter sharing and turing completeness and can learn the nonlinear characteristics of sequences with high efficiency long short term memory lstm network was a kind of time recurrent neural network which inherited the characteristics of most rnn models and solves the problem of vanishing gradient caused by gradient back propagation process on the basis of rnn lstm added a memory cell structure to judge whether the information was useful or not each cell consisted of an input gate a forget gate and an output gate as shown in fig 2 gers et al 2000 each information entered the lstm network and was judged to be useful according to the rules only information that conforms to the rules was left behind and information that did not conform was forgotten through the forget gate this was very effective for data with long term sequence dependence problems yu et al 2018 1 i t σ w xi x t w hi h t 1 b i 2 f t σ w xf x t w hf h t 1 b f 3 o t σ w xo x t w ho

2016 eq 4 showed that the forget gate ft controls how much information ct 1 in the memory cells of the previous moment can be transmitted to the memory cells of the current moment the input gate it controlled how much information can flow into the memory cell ct and the output gate ot controlled how much information in the memory cell ct of the current moment can flow into the current hidden layer ht 2 2 2 wavelet domain threshold denoising wdtd and wavelet mean fusion wmf continuous wavelet transform cwt inherited and developed the idea of short time fourier transform localization and overcame the disadvantage that window size did not change with frequency commonly used wavelet basis functions are harr wavelet daubechies wavelet symlets wavelet coiflets wavelet and biorthogonal wavelets wavelet domain threshold denoising wdtd donoho 2002 was to get the characteristic wavelet coefficients after the signal was passed through cwt the wavelet coefficients were decomposed processed and reconstructed to get the denoising effect in the wavelet domain the coefficients corresponding to the effective signal were larger while the coefficients corresponding to the noise were smaller and satisfy the gauss distribution if the variance of the wavelet coefficients corresponding to the noise in the wavelet domain was σ most of the noise coefficients 99 99 were located in the 3 σ 3 σ interval starck murtagh 1998 therefore setting the coefficients in this interval to zero can restrain the noise to the greatest extent and damage the effective signal less based on the algorithm of cwt and wdtd and according to the character of lstm to train and forecast the data in this paper a wavelet mean fusion wmf algorithm as shown in fig 2 was proposed to improve the prediction precision effectively let the variable wdij be the j th layer data of group i after wavelet decomposition and wm be the input data of wavelet reconstruction finally the final result was obtained by wavelet reconstruction of wm as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 w m j 1 n i 1 n w d ij 1 i n 1 j 8 7 wm w m 1 w m 8 among them i was the group number of input data n was the group number of input data j was the layer number of wavelet decomposition and the wavelet basis function was db3 for the selection of wavelet basis functions as shown in table 1 db3 had higher signal to noise ratio snr 4 46 and lower error rmse 46 01 2 2 3 wdtd lstm wmf combined forecasting model lstm model had good results in predicting the trend of chla but the overall value was low while wdtd lstm model showed a higher value after lstm and wdtd lstm prediction results were averaged wdtd lstm mean model the data was sensitivity to trend decreases to solve this problem a wdtd lstm wmf model with high accuracy for trend and numerical prediction was proposed the principle of model construction is shown in fig 2 the process of model construction was as follows step 1 data collection and cleaning if 10 of the data were missing the linear interpolation method was used to fill after considering the availability and efficiency of various outlier test methods 3σ criterion was chosen to eliminate outliers the dimension of sample data reached 54 including 54 water quality parameters and not all parameters were closely related to chla if the data were directly input into model the prediction effect of the model would be greatly reduced and it was difficult to obtain satisfactory results in effective time for training considering the applicability advantages and disadvantages of several methods missing value ratio mvr was used in this study and the missing values included non zero missing values and zero using mvr 39 variables with 10 missing value ratio were deleted finally 15 input variables were determined and combined into input sample set after monthly mean to eliminate the effects of different dimensional and numerical differences the original variables were normalized suppose there were m indicators x 1 x 2 x m representing the properties of n objects which were denoted by an n m matrix as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 x n m x 11 x 1 m x n 1 x nm 9 x ij x ij x j s j where and s j were the mean and variance of the index variable x j respectively step 2 denoising the data based on the wdtd the preprocessed sample data set chla was decomposed into eight layers by wavelet decomposition with wi as the data set where 1 i 8 then the low frequency was set to zero and the wavelet reconstruction was carried out with db3 as the wavelet basis function the denoised chla data was generated finally the data set wr was composed of 15 variables only chla is the denoised data step 3 training and prediction based on lstm the data set wr and the historical data set data both included 960 data sets of 15 variables at 10 observation sites with 720 groups 75 as the training set and 240 groups 25 as the validation set the training set and validation set corresponding to wr were datat1 and datav1 and corresponding to data are datat2 and datav2 the goal was to predict the chla datap1 and datap2 for the next eight years 96 months in the model construction 15 variables were used as input data of lstm and the implicit layer of the model was set to 10 the learning rate was 0 0006 the time step was 24 the batch size was 12 and the output data was chla then validate with verification set finally the validated model was saved and historical data of 15 variables from each observation site were used as input to predict chla over the next 8 years step 4 data optimization based on wmf the datap1 and datap2 were decomposed into wd1 and wd2 by wavelet decomposition 8 layers the wavelet basis function was db3 then the wd1 and wd2 were averaged to get the data set wm finally the final prediction results were obtained by wavelet reconstruction 2 2 4 trend analysis the trend of change and the rate of change were plotted using a linear regression one dimensional equation expressed as y ax b where x was the year y was the corresponding water quality parameter and a was the rate of change when a 0 it indicates an upward trend when a 0 it indicates a downward trend 2 2 5 kriging spatial interpolation the kriging method was also referred to as spatial local estimation or spatial local interpolation and was based on measured sample data for a limited area of the sample to be estimated knotters et al 1995 values of unobserved points were more accurate when determined via the kriging method than when determined via the average method and systematic errors were avoided the spatial correlation or spatial heterogeneity of the covariance and variation functions were expressed in a two dimensional plane which not only was important for the analysis of the regionalization of chla for dianchi lake but which also provides effective support for the quantitative study of spatial distribution patterns in order to verify the credibility of the interpolation results we used 10 of the data for cross validation using root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae as metrics as shown in eqs 10 11 10 rmse 1 m i 1 m x i y i 2 11 mae 1 m i 1 m x i y i among them i is the sample number m is the number of samples x is the historical data and y is the estimated data 3 results 3 1 algorithm implementation after preprocessing the daily observation data of 15 water quality parameters at 10 observation sites in dianchi lake from january 1 2005 to december 31 2012 96 months were selected as the input for wdtd lstm wmf model to predict chla in 2013 2020 the 15 parameters included water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do permanganate index codmn chemical oxygen demand cod 5 day biochemical oxygn demand bod5 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn hg pb volatile phenol vp oils secchi depth sd and chlorophyll a concentration chla the prediction results are shown in fig 3 a j the wdtd lstm wmf model presented the lowest mean absolute error mae 13 56 the relative error and the observed value of chla are shown in fig 4 and the error statistics of each model are shown in table 2 the results showed that the prediction method proposed in this paper had the best performance and can objectively and truly reflect the change of chla 3 2 temporal variation characteristics analysis the chla of 10 observation sites showed an increasing trend during 2005 to 2012 the mean growth rate was 42 87 5 87 μg l 1 decade the caohai center showed a decreasing trend 2 07 μg l 1 decade the lowest growth rate was baiyukou 34 99 μg l 1 decade and the highest growth rate was 64 85 μg l 1 decade during 2005 to 2020 the mean growth rate was 30 05 1 29 μg l 1 decade the highest growth rate was guanyinshan east 37 86 μg l 1 decade and the lowest growth rate was luojiaying 23 12 μg l 1 decade the chla in caohai center was relatively high among the 10 observation sites the mean concentration from 2005 to 2020 was higher than 100 μg l 1 followed by duanqiao and huiwan center the chla in dianchi south haikou west baiyukou and guanyinshan west were relatively low for example the mean chla was 63 2 3 99 μg l 1 at the baiyukou observation site reaching the highest value of 141 μg l 1 in september 2007 and the lowest value of 4 μg l 1 in july 2005 the results of data analysis showed that there was an obvious fluctuation period from july to october october to february of the following year and the maximum chla annually was in this range the fluctuation of chla was the smallest in 2005 but there was still a fluctuation cycle between july and february the fluctuations in the remaining months were relatively small and can be regarded as a fluctuation cycle that was from march to june each year with the passage of time the law of periodic fluctuation became more and more obvious previous research yang et al 2019 showed that the mean temperature in the dianchi lake watershed from 2005 to 2012 was 16 15 c the annual mean water temperature was 17 87 c and the annual maximum temperature was 30 38 c the mean temperature from march to june was 18 2 c the mean water temperature was 17 4 c and the mean temperature from july to october was 19 13 c the mean water temperature was 22 3 c the mean temperature from november to february was 11 09 c and the mean water temperature was 13 87 c it was clear that the mean monthly water temperature from july to october was about 26 c indicating that the cyanobacteria growing temperature in this period was the most suitable providing favorable conditions for cyanobacterial bloom to sum up combined with the climatic factors of dianchi lake watershed and the observation data it is further shown that the growth regularity of cyanobacteria bloom in dianchi lake can be summarized as follows as shown in fig 5 biomass increase stage march to june growth and floating stage july to october and decline and fall stage november to february 3 3 spatial variation characteristics analysis the cross validation results of the four interpolation methods including inverse distance weighted idw interpolation spline interpolation trend interpolation and kriging interpolation were shown in table 3 and the results of spatial visualization thematic maps were shown in fig 6 among four methods kriging interpolation method has proved its superiority over others in the regard of same input conditions based on the above results kriging interpolation was used to create spatial visualization thematic maps of chla and the visualization results are shown in fig 7 the change from yellow to blue represents the change of chla from low to high the closer the color is to yellow the lower the concentration of chlorophyll a is and the closer the color is to blue the higher the concentration of chlorophyll a is from 2005 to 2015 the areas with chla higher than 100 μg l were mainly located in caohai in northern dianchi lake followed by the areas near huiwan center after 2010 the areas with chla higher than 100 μg l moved to the southwest and the coverage of the lake surface with high chla increased sharply in 2010 2012 2014 2016 and 2020 reaching as high as 30 4 discussion cyanobacteria bloom was a step by step process from gradual change to abrupt change with discontinuous and step by step characteristics yu et al 2018 improved the smoothing filtering effect of chla data by genetic algorithm first order lag filter ga folf solved the prediction problem of discontinuous and step data improved the prediction accuracy of the model and the overall error was 20 μg l in this paper the method of wavelet threshold de noising and wavelet mean fusion was used to solve this problem and got a better result the overall error was 13 56 μg l yang et al 2018b proposed a hybrid prediction model ε svr pca bpann to solve the problem of insufficient accuracy of multivariate prediction and compared with bpann ε svr ε svr bpann arima and gm 1 1 this model had the best performance rmse 25 28 mae 19 03 r2 0 29 in this paper the wdtd lstm wmf model was better than ε svr pca bpann and compared with other models including ulstm mlstm wdtd lstm and wdtd lstm mean it can be more accurately predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms rmse 18 40 mae 13 56 r2 0 63 the phytoplankton community of dianchi lake was dominated by cyanobacteria ma et al 2015 these comprised microcystis aeruginosa accounting for 89 28 93 13 of the total density ma et al 2015 it was generally believed that a chla concentration higher than 10 μg l or a density of cyanobacteria above 2 107 cells l was the critical value for cyanobacterial blooms oliver and ganf 2000 in the experiment the optimal growth temperature of microcystis was 20 30 c chu et al 2007 wu et al 2008 imai et al 2009 in lake wang et al 2008 showed that the optimum temperature for the growth of cyanobacteria was 24 30 c and the high temperature above 30 c had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of cyanobacteria when the water temperature was 26 c it was most suitable for the aggregation of cyanobacteria and formation of bloom wang et al 2008 same as dianchi lake the four stage theory of cyanobacteria bloom was originally proposed by kong and gao 2005 on the taihu lake decline and fall stage november to february recovery stage march to april biomass increase stage april to september and growth and floating stage may to september in the early spring when the water temperature reached the recovery threshold which was 9 c in lake tao et al 2005 the cyanobacteria began to recover and grew until the biomass reaches the threshold of cyanobacterial bloom oliver and ganf 2000 for lakes with serious eutrophication the first time for the formation of water blooms was relatively early for lakes with geographically indistinguishable seasonal temperatures the process was more transient and the factors that caused the formation of cyanobacterial blooms were almost always present kong et al 2009 after acclimation at 15 c microcystis had acquired cold light tolerance yang et al 2008 which improved it wintering ability the four seasons in dianchi watershed yunnan province were not clear and the eutrophication of water was serious so we neglected recovery stage and proposed the four stages for dianchi lake the caohai area in dianchi lake where the caohai center observation site is located has experienced serious deterioration in water quality and was also the area with the most serious outbreak of cyanobacteria bloom of dianchi lake ma et al 2015 cao et al 2016 the negative growth of chla at this observation site during 2005 2012 may be influenced by extreme values such as 888 μg l 1 in september 2007 and 686 μg l 1 in september 2009 and may also be the result of the government s management the chla from 2013 to 2020 was the predicted data and it was not sensitive to the extreme value and human influence the government s management so the chla from 2005 to 2020 was increasing the chla in xishan and chenggong district increased obviously and the influence of wind speed on chla became more and more obvious which was consistent with the results of ma et al 2015 southwest wind dominates the dianchi lake all year round in summer the south and north of dianchi lake were also affected by the south wind the west by the east wind the east by the southeast wind and the northeast by the northeast wind cyanobacterial blooms were the largest in the northern coastal zone of dianchi lake most of the year and the thickness of cyanobacterial blooms can even reach several centimeters in more severe periods the region of caohai was located in the north of dianchi lake the outbreak of cyanobacteria blooms in this area was the most serious area in the whole dianchi lake watershed in spatial variation characteristics analysis four interpolation methods were used to select the most ideal interpolation method the idw interpolation method was more sensitive to the weight function and the results were prone to have independent points which values were significantly higher than the rest of the data value distribution the chla distribution in dianchi lake had obvious changes while the spline interpolation method had a large deviation in the estimation results for areas where the value changes were obvious in a short distance the result of trend interpolation is not as smooth as the other three results and it shows a stripe distribution which is difficult to effectively express chla change of the lake kriging interpolation method not only considered the positional relationship between the estimated point and the known point but also considered the positional relationship between the known points so it can better reflect the objective law and the estimation accuracy was relatively high however this method was more reliable when there were more points in this research fewer observation sites were objective limitations but the map only considered the chla change trend of the lake with no detailed information these points were able to express regional trends in chla cross validation results showed that kriging interpolation had the best performance among the four methods with the lowest rmse and mae and best continuous surface 5 conclusions using 54 water quality parameters obtained from 10 observation sites in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 as sample the wmf algorithm was proposed and the long term prediction model of chla was constructed by combining wdtd lstm and wmf algorithm the spatial temporal variation of chla in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 was simulated by geospatial analysis and from 2013 to 2020 was predicted by mixed model wdtd lstm wmf moreover the wdtd lstm wmf model had a good performance in chla s prediction rmse 18 40 mae 13 56 r2 0 63 the temporal analysis results showed that the chla in dianchi lake increased significantly p 0 0012 0 01 under the interaction and influence of a series of natural and human factors the water quality of dianchi lake was still poor cyanobacteria blooms may erupt on a large scale at any time the water quality of dianchi lake was becoming more and more eutrophic which provides sufficient conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria the spatial analysis results showed that chla in the southwest and west of dianchi lake were increasing year by year considering the natural environment the main reason was that the southwest wind dominated the dianchi lake watershed all year round and the algae in the lake moved toward the above two directions due to the dynamic action of the wind considering the human impact the western southern and eastern areas of dianchi lake have become the core areas of urban development because of the development strategy of one lake four areas one core five axes three layers and multiple centers proposed by kunming and the urban development idea of extending from south to north the impact on the water quality around dianchi lake

5783,with the rapid development of urbanization the water pollution in dianchi lake presents the trend of combining urban and agricultural non point source pollution and it is more difficult to control and improve the water environment the simulation and prediction of water quality state change is an important theoretical basis for water resources management the data set we selected was 15 water quality parameters of 10 water quality observation sites in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 wavelet domain threshold denoising wdtd wavelet mean fusion wmf and long short term memory lstm were combined to a wdtd lstm wmf long term prediction model that wmf was proposed based on wdtd in this paper the model and geospatial analysis were used to simulate the historical change process of chlorophyll a concentration chla in dianchi lake and predicted the future trend of chla the results showed that the model has a good prediction performance of low error and high generalization rmse 18 40 mae 13 56 r2 0 63 the spatial visualization analysis showed that the region with chla higher than 100 μg l from 2005 to 2020 had a tendency to spread from north to west and then to southwest this is related to the urbanization development and climate change in kunming keywords continuous wavelet transform wavelet threshold denoising long short term memory network geospatial analysis cyanobacterial bloom 1 introduction in the past 30 years with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in china the economic growth rate has been at a relatively fast level for a long time urban population is expanding constantly water quality deterioration caused by the speed first economic development model has become one of the main reasons that hinder the sustainable development of china and reduce the quality of people s lives zhang et al 2006 fang et al 2016 yang et al 2009 d souza and nagendra 2011 in recent years the government has invested a lot of manpower and material resources to control and improve the water environment zhang et al 2010 jantunen et al 2008 falconer et al 1995 the water pollution in china was serious showing the situation of overall pollution the self recovery ability of lakes was declining and the eutrophication was getting worse hasegawa et al 2010 arter 1989 liu et al 2014 objective and accurate evaluation of water quality reappearance of historical water quality change process and prediction of future water quality change trend were important theoretical basis and data support for rational planning and integrated management of lake water resources water quality prediction was to establish the mapping relationship between multi variable observation data and water quality parameters by certain models and algorithms which can generally be established by explicit or implicit methods the common explicit methods included multiple linear regression andrews 1974 mogaji et al 2015 and index method ban et al 2010 wu et al 2018 it had the advantages of fast modeling and response speed and was suitable for solving the problems with simple relationship among parameters and obvious linear characteristics the common implicit methods were neural network liu et al 2014 wilson and recknagel 2001 chan et al 2007 grey theory karmakar mujumdar 2006 li et al 2012 wavelet analysis xiao et al 2017 2019 liu et al 2014 longyang 2019 and other high dimensional nonlinear models it had strong nonlinear mapping and learning ability high fault tolerance and good generalization ability the single water quality prediction model sahoo et al 2009 piotrowski et al 2015 fang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 has been widely used in water quality prediction and assessment but the single prediction algorithm had the shortcomings of insufficient use of the existing data and information which led to poor prediction accuracy and effect the mixed model can combine the advantages of each algorithm fully excavate the information hidden in the data and improve the prediction effect significantly for the researches of neural networks zhang et al 2018 used 2 352 sets of water level and precipitation data from the city of drammen in southeastern norway different neural network models which included multilayer perceptron mlp wavelet neural network wnn long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru were established to simulate and predict the water level of combined sewer overflow cso structure the experimental results showed that lstm and gru had good prediction ability of multi step time series zhanga et al 2018 proposed a prediction model suitable for hydrological field based on lstm taking five districts of hetao irrigation district in china northwest arid area as research object and the results showed that the accuracy of the model is higher than that of the conventional feedforward neural network chen et al 2018 proposed the prediction model of dissolved oxygen based on principal component analysis pca and lstm and the results showed that the model is superior to other shallow model such as back propagation neural network bpann to sum up the neural network has been widely used in water resources related fields sahoo jha 2013 adamowski chan 2011 kingston et al 2005 farmaki et al 2010 keskin et al 2015 but less on chlorophyll a concentration chla on the basis of previous researches yang et al 2016a b 2018a b 2019 luo et al 2017 2019a b c xu et al 2016 a wavelet mean fusion wmf algorithm was proposed and wavelet analysis and long short term memory lstm were combined to a mixed chlorophyll a concentration chla prediction model using the measured data of 10 water quality observation sites in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 dataset including training set and validation set simulated and predicted the historical change process and future change trend of chla in dianchi lake watershed from 2005 to 2020 and used geospatial analysis to visualize the temporal changes of chla in dianchi lake 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data source located in the middle of yunnan guizhou plateau dianchi lake is the sixth largest freshwater lake in china with an elevation about 1886 m an area about 330 km2 and an average water depth about 5 m it was a semi closed lake with only the south western haikou as its outlet he et al 2015 located in the southwestern monsoon of the subtropical plateau climate change was dominated by the alternation of southwest monsoon and tropical continental air mass luo et al 2017 and dianchi lake was the main water body of irrigation livestock regulation and acceptance in kunming area and also the basic condition of urban development it played an important role in the climate regulation of dianchi lake watershed lu et al 2015 gao et al 2015 in addition with the strategy of the belt and road yunnan province was being deeply integrated into the national strategy as the provincial capital of yunnan kunming has become an important radiation center for south and southeast asia controlling and improving the ecological environment of dianchi lake was the environmental basis for implementing and promoting the belt and road strategy therefore dianchi lake was chosen as the research area with regional characteristics urban lake on plateau and temporal characteristics the belt and road strategy the data in this study was obtained from the yunnan academy of environmental sciences and the yunnan bureau of hydrology and water resources which was daily observation data of 54 parameters as shown in table a 1 from 1 january 2005 to 31 december 2012 at 10 observation sites in dianchi lake the geographical distribution of the study area and observation sites are shown in fig 1 the 54 parameters we collected are important indicators for describing the lake water environment including the physical chemical and biological properties of water quality 2 2 methods 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm recurrent neural network rnn had the characteristics of memory parameter sharing and turing completeness and can learn the nonlinear characteristics of sequences with high efficiency long short term memory lstm network was a kind of time recurrent neural network which inherited the characteristics of most rnn models and solves the problem of vanishing gradient caused by gradient back propagation process on the basis of rnn lstm added a memory cell structure to judge whether the information was useful or not each cell consisted of an input gate a forget gate and an output gate as shown in fig 2 gers et al 2000 each information entered the lstm network and was judged to be useful according to the rules only information that conforms to the rules was left behind and information that did not conform was forgotten through the forget gate this was very effective for data with long term sequence dependence problems yu et al 2018 1 i t σ w xi x t w hi h t 1 b i 2 f t σ w xf x t w hf h t 1 b f 3 o t σ w xo x t w ho h t 1 b o 4 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w xc x t w hc h t 1 b c 5 h t o t tanh c t among them refers to the matrix element by dot product bγ was the deviation vector of the output layer bi was the deviation vector of the input gate bf was the deviation vector of the forget gate sigmoid function was σ x wαβ was the weight matrix of the corresponding layer wxf was the weight matrix of the input layer to the forget gate whi was the weight matrix of the hidden layer to the input layer who was the weight matrix of the hidden layer to the output layer ct was used to update cell status teng et al 2016 eq 4 showed that the forget gate ft controls how much information ct 1 in the memory cells of the previous moment can be transmitted to the memory cells of the current moment the input gate it controlled how much information can flow into the memory cell ct and the output gate ot controlled how much information in the memory cell ct of the current moment can flow into the current hidden layer ht 2 2 2 wavelet domain threshold denoising wdtd and wavelet mean fusion wmf continuous wavelet transform cwt inherited and developed the idea of short time fourier transform localization and overcame the disadvantage that window size did not change with frequency commonly used wavelet basis functions are harr wavelet daubechies wavelet symlets wavelet coiflets wavelet and biorthogonal wavelets wavelet domain threshold denoising wdtd donoho 2002 was to get the characteristic wavelet coefficients after the signal was passed through cwt the wavelet coefficients were decomposed processed and reconstructed to get the denoising effect in the wavelet domain the coefficients corresponding to the effective signal were larger while the coefficients corresponding to the noise were smaller and satisfy the gauss distribution if the variance of the wavelet coefficients corresponding to the noise in the wavelet domain was σ most of the noise coefficients 99 99 were located in the 3 σ 3 σ interval starck murtagh 1998 therefore setting the coefficients in this interval to zero can restrain the noise to the greatest extent and damage the effective signal less based on the algorithm of cwt and wdtd and according to the character of lstm to train and forecast the data in this paper a wavelet mean fusion wmf algorithm as shown in fig 2 was proposed to improve the prediction precision effectively let the variable wdij be the j th layer data of group i after wavelet decomposition and wm be the input data of wavelet reconstruction finally the final result was obtained by wavelet reconstruction of wm as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 w m j 1 n i 1 n w d ij 1 i n 1 j 8 7 wm w m 1 w m 8 among them i was the group number of input data n was the group number of input data j was the layer number of wavelet decomposition and the wavelet basis function was db3 for the selection of wavelet basis functions as shown in table 1 db3 had higher signal to noise ratio snr 4 46 and lower error rmse 46 01 2 2 3 wdtd lstm wmf combined forecasting model lstm model had good results in predicting the trend of chla but the overall value was low while wdtd lstm model showed a higher value after lstm and wdtd lstm prediction results were averaged wdtd lstm mean model the data was sensitivity to trend decreases to solve this problem a wdtd lstm wmf model with high accuracy for trend and numerical prediction was proposed the principle of model construction is shown in fig 2 the process of model construction was as follows step 1 data collection and cleaning if 10 of the data were missing the linear interpolation method was used to fill after considering the availability and efficiency of various outlier test methods 3σ criterion was chosen to eliminate outliers the dimension of sample data reached 54 including 54 water quality parameters and not all parameters were closely related to chla if the data were directly input into model the prediction effect of the model would be greatly reduced and it was difficult to obtain satisfactory results in effective time for training considering the applicability advantages and disadvantages of several methods missing value ratio mvr was used in this study and the missing values included non zero missing values and zero using mvr 39 variables with 10 missing value ratio were deleted finally 15 input variables were determined and combined into input sample set after monthly mean to eliminate the effects of different dimensional and numerical differences the original variables were normalized suppose there were m indicators x 1 x 2 x m representing the properties of n objects which were denoted by an n m matrix as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 x n m x 11 x 1 m x n 1 x nm 9 x ij x ij x j s j where and s j were the mean and variance of the index variable x j respectively step 2 denoising the data based on the wdtd the preprocessed sample data set chla was decomposed into eight layers by wavelet decomposition with wi as the data set where 1 i 8 then the low frequency was set to zero and the wavelet reconstruction was carried out with db3 as the wavelet basis function the denoised chla data was generated finally the data set wr was composed of 15 variables only chla is the denoised data step 3 training and prediction based on lstm the data set wr and the historical data set data both included 960 data sets of 15 variables at 10 observation sites with 720 groups 75 as the training set and 240 groups 25 as the validation set the training set and validation set corresponding to wr were datat1 and datav1 and corresponding to data are datat2 and datav2 the goal was to predict the chla datap1 and datap2 for the next eight years 96 months in the model construction 15 variables were used as input data of lstm and the implicit layer of the model was set to 10 the learning rate was 0 0006 the time step was 24 the batch size was 12 and the output data was chla then validate with verification set finally the validated model was saved and historical data of 15 variables from each observation site were used as input to predict chla over the next 8 years step 4 data optimization based on wmf the datap1 and datap2 were decomposed into wd1 and wd2 by wavelet decomposition 8 layers the wavelet basis function was db3 then the wd1 and wd2 were averaged to get the data set wm finally the final prediction results were obtained by wavelet reconstruction 2 2 4 trend analysis the trend of change and the rate of change were plotted using a linear regression one dimensional equation expressed as y ax b where x was the year y was the corresponding water quality parameter and a was the rate of change when a 0 it indicates an upward trend when a 0 it indicates a downward trend 2 2 5 kriging spatial interpolation the kriging method was also referred to as spatial local estimation or spatial local interpolation and was based on measured sample data for a limited area of the sample to be estimated knotters et al 1995 values of unobserved points were more accurate when determined via the kriging method than when determined via the average method and systematic errors were avoided the spatial correlation or spatial heterogeneity of the covariance and variation functions were expressed in a two dimensional plane which not only was important for the analysis of the regionalization of chla for dianchi lake but which also provides effective support for the quantitative study of spatial distribution patterns in order to verify the credibility of the interpolation results we used 10 of the data for cross validation using root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae as metrics as shown in eqs 10 11 10 rmse 1 m i 1 m x i y i 2 11 mae 1 m i 1 m x i y i among them i is the sample number m is the number of samples x is the historical data and y is the estimated data 3 results 3 1 algorithm implementation after preprocessing the daily observation data of 15 water quality parameters at 10 observation sites in dianchi lake from january 1 2005 to december 31 2012 96 months were selected as the input for wdtd lstm wmf model to predict chla in 2013 2020 the 15 parameters included water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do permanganate index codmn chemical oxygen demand cod 5 day biochemical oxygn demand bod5 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn hg pb volatile phenol vp oils secchi depth sd and chlorophyll a concentration chla the prediction results are shown in fig 3 a j the wdtd lstm wmf model presented the lowest mean absolute error mae 13 56 the relative error and the observed value of chla are shown in fig 4 and the error statistics of each model are shown in table 2 the results showed that the prediction method proposed in this paper had the best performance and can objectively and truly reflect the change of chla 3 2 temporal variation characteristics analysis the chla of 10 observation sites showed an increasing trend during 2005 to 2012 the mean growth rate was 42 87 5 87 μg l 1 decade the caohai center showed a decreasing trend 2 07 μg l 1 decade the lowest growth rate was baiyukou 34 99 μg l 1 decade and the highest growth rate was 64 85 μg l 1 decade during 2005 to 2020 the mean growth rate was 30 05 1 29 μg l 1 decade the highest growth rate was guanyinshan east 37 86 μg l 1 decade and the lowest growth rate was luojiaying 23 12 μg l 1 decade the chla in caohai center was relatively high among the 10 observation sites the mean concentration from 2005 to 2020 was higher than 100 μg l 1 followed by duanqiao and huiwan center the chla in dianchi south haikou west baiyukou and guanyinshan west were relatively low for example the mean chla was 63 2 3 99 μg l 1 at the baiyukou observation site reaching the highest value of 141 μg l 1 in september 2007 and the lowest value of 4 μg l 1 in july 2005 the results of data analysis showed that there was an obvious fluctuation period from july to october october to february of the following year and the maximum chla annually was in this range the fluctuation of chla was the smallest in 2005 but there was still a fluctuation cycle between july and february the fluctuations in the remaining months were relatively small and can be regarded as a fluctuation cycle that was from march to june each year with the passage of time the law of periodic fluctuation became more and more obvious previous research yang et al 2019 showed that the mean temperature in the dianchi lake watershed from 2005 to 2012 was 16 15 c the annual mean water temperature was 17 87 c and the annual maximum temperature was 30 38 c the mean temperature from march to june was 18 2 c the mean water temperature was 17 4 c and the mean temperature from july to october was 19 13 c the mean water temperature was 22 3 c the mean temperature from november to february was 11 09 c and the mean water temperature was 13 87 c it was clear that the mean monthly water temperature from july to october was about 26 c indicating that the cyanobacteria growing temperature in this period was the most suitable providing favorable conditions for cyanobacterial bloom to sum up combined with the climatic factors of dianchi lake watershed and the observation data it is further shown that the growth regularity of cyanobacteria bloom in dianchi lake can be summarized as follows as shown in fig 5 biomass increase stage march to june growth and floating stage july to october and decline and fall stage november to february 3 3 spatial variation characteristics analysis the cross validation results of the four interpolation methods including inverse distance weighted idw interpolation spline interpolation trend interpolation and kriging interpolation were shown in table 3 and the results of spatial visualization thematic maps were shown in fig 6 among four methods kriging interpolation method has proved its superiority over others in the regard of same input conditions based on the above results kriging interpolation was used to create spatial visualization thematic maps of chla and the visualization results are shown in fig 7 the change from yellow to blue represents the change of chla from low to high the closer the color is to yellow the lower the concentration of chlorophyll a is and the closer the color is to blue the higher the concentration of chlorophyll a is from 2005 to 2015 the areas with chla higher than 100 μg l were mainly located in caohai in northern dianchi lake followed by the areas near huiwan center after 2010 the areas with chla higher than 100 μg l moved to the southwest and the coverage of the lake surface with high chla increased sharply in 2010 2012 2014 2016 and 2020 reaching as high as 30 4 discussion cyanobacteria bloom was a step by step process from gradual change to abrupt change with discontinuous and step by step characteristics yu et al 2018 improved the smoothing filtering effect of chla data by genetic algorithm first order lag filter ga folf solved the prediction problem of discontinuous and step data improved the prediction accuracy of the model and the overall error was 20 μg l in this paper the method of wavelet threshold de noising and wavelet mean fusion was used to solve this problem and got a better result the overall error was 13 56 μg l yang et al 2018b proposed a hybrid prediction model ε svr pca bpann to solve the problem of insufficient accuracy of multivariate prediction and compared with bpann ε svr ε svr bpann arima and gm 1 1 this model had the best performance rmse 25 28 mae 19 03 r2 0 29 in this paper the wdtd lstm wmf model was better than ε svr pca bpann and compared with other models including ulstm mlstm wdtd lstm and wdtd lstm mean it can be more accurately predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms rmse 18 40 mae 13 56 r2 0 63 the phytoplankton community of dianchi lake was dominated by cyanobacteria ma et al 2015 these comprised microcystis aeruginosa accounting for 89 28 93 13 of the total density ma et al 2015 it was generally believed that a chla concentration higher than 10 μg l or a density of cyanobacteria above 2 107 cells l was the critical value for cyanobacterial blooms oliver and ganf 2000 in the experiment the optimal growth temperature of microcystis was 20 30 c chu et al 2007 wu et al 2008 imai et al 2009 in lake wang et al 2008 showed that the optimum temperature for the growth of cyanobacteria was 24 30 c and the high temperature above 30 c had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of cyanobacteria when the water temperature was 26 c it was most suitable for the aggregation of cyanobacteria and formation of bloom wang et al 2008 same as dianchi lake the four stage theory of cyanobacteria bloom was originally proposed by kong and gao 2005 on the taihu lake decline and fall stage november to february recovery stage march to april biomass increase stage april to september and growth and floating stage may to september in the early spring when the water temperature reached the recovery threshold which was 9 c in lake tao et al 2005 the cyanobacteria began to recover and grew until the biomass reaches the threshold of cyanobacterial bloom oliver and ganf 2000 for lakes with serious eutrophication the first time for the formation of water blooms was relatively early for lakes with geographically indistinguishable seasonal temperatures the process was more transient and the factors that caused the formation of cyanobacterial blooms were almost always present kong et al 2009 after acclimation at 15 c microcystis had acquired cold light tolerance yang et al 2008 which improved it wintering ability the four seasons in dianchi watershed yunnan province were not clear and the eutrophication of water was serious so we neglected recovery stage and proposed the four stages for dianchi lake the caohai area in dianchi lake where the caohai center observation site is located has experienced serious deterioration in water quality and was also the area with the most serious outbreak of cyanobacteria bloom of dianchi lake ma et al 2015 cao et al 2016 the negative growth of chla at this observation site during 2005 2012 may be influenced by extreme values such as 888 μg l 1 in september 2007 and 686 μg l 1 in september 2009 and may also be the result of the government s management the chla from 2013 to 2020 was the predicted data and it was not sensitive to the extreme value and human influence the government s management so the chla from 2005 to 2020 was increasing the chla in xishan and chenggong district increased obviously and the influence of wind speed on chla became more and more obvious which was consistent with the results of ma et al 2015 southwest wind dominates the dianchi lake all year round in summer the south and north of dianchi lake were also affected by the south wind the west by the east wind the east by the southeast wind and the northeast by the northeast wind cyanobacterial blooms were the largest in the northern coastal zone of dianchi lake most of the year and the thickness of cyanobacterial blooms can even reach several centimeters in more severe periods the region of caohai was located in the north of dianchi lake the outbreak of cyanobacteria blooms in this area was the most serious area in the whole dianchi lake watershed in spatial variation characteristics analysis four interpolation methods were used to select the most ideal interpolation method the idw interpolation method was more sensitive to the weight function and the results were prone to have independent points which values were significantly higher than the rest of the data value distribution the chla distribution in dianchi lake had obvious changes while the spline interpolation method had a large deviation in the estimation results for areas where the value changes were obvious in a short distance the result of trend interpolation is not as smooth as the other three results and it shows a stripe distribution which is difficult to effectively express chla change of the lake kriging interpolation method not only considered the positional relationship between the estimated point and the known point but also considered the positional relationship between the known points so it can better reflect the objective law and the estimation accuracy was relatively high however this method was more reliable when there were more points in this research fewer observation sites were objective limitations but the map only considered the chla change trend of the lake with no detailed information these points were able to express regional trends in chla cross validation results showed that kriging interpolation had the best performance among the four methods with the lowest rmse and mae and best continuous surface 5 conclusions using 54 water quality parameters obtained from 10 observation sites in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 as sample the wmf algorithm was proposed and the long term prediction model of chla was constructed by combining wdtd lstm and wmf algorithm the spatial temporal variation of chla in dianchi lake from 2005 to 2012 was simulated by geospatial analysis and from 2013 to 2020 was predicted by mixed model wdtd lstm wmf moreover the wdtd lstm wmf model had a good performance in chla s prediction rmse 18 40 mae 13 56 r2 0 63 the temporal analysis results showed that the chla in dianchi lake increased significantly p 0 0012 0 01 under the interaction and influence of a series of natural and human factors the water quality of dianchi lake was still poor cyanobacteria blooms may erupt on a large scale at any time the water quality of dianchi lake was becoming more and more eutrophic which provides sufficient conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria the spatial analysis results showed that chla in the southwest and west of dianchi lake were increasing year by year considering the natural environment the main reason was that the southwest wind dominated the dianchi lake watershed all year round and the algae in the lake moved toward the above two directions due to the dynamic action of the wind considering the human impact the western southern and eastern areas of dianchi lake have become the core areas of urban development because of the development strategy of one lake four areas one core five axes three layers and multiple centers proposed by kunming and the urban development idea of extending from south to north the impact on the water quality around dianchi lake

5784,various studies have shown that stream flow regimes play a significant role in fish spawning stimuli stream flows have been altered by reservoir operations around the world especially in arid and semi arid regions in this study the flow rising processes most effective for fish spawning stimuli are identified and their quantitative characteristics are then represented by a set of hydrological indices based on a quantitative ecological scoring method describing the statistical similarity between the reservoir release and the natural flow regime a multi objective optimization model considering hydropower generation and fish habitat protection is proposed and then solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the proposed methodology is applied to a large scale reservoir on the upper reaches of the yellow river in china the statistics of these indices verify the regulations on the flow rising processes in fish spawning seasons via reservoir operation in different hydrological years the pareto front derived from the multi objective optimization indicates that it is possible to both improve the local ecology and increase hydropower generation profits using the method proposed herein on the basis of proper understanding of the effective flow process required by fish keywords fish spawning stimulus flow rising process multi objective optimization power generation yangqu hydropower station 1 introduction over half of the 292 large river systems in the world have been influenced by the construction and operation of water conservancy projects nilsson et al 2005 and in many cases the influence extends for hundreds of kilometers richter and thomas 2007 although the relationship between aquatic ecosystem health and the stream flow regime differs from case to case and some studies even use the requirements of certain fish types as the index for the ecological flow requirements chen et al 2013 it is generally agreed upon that maintaining or mimicking natural flow regimes is important for ecosystem health richter et al 1996 flow regimes refer to not only the flow magnitude but also to other characteristics such as the timing and duration of the flow rise decrease and the number of flow peaks poff and zimmerman 2010 which have been proven to be effective and necessary for fish reproduction alonso gonzalez et al 2008 studies have demonstrated that high flow events including both high flow pulses and floods play an important role in ecological functions poff et al 2010 such as aiding migration providing spawning cues triggering new life cycle phases and providing access to floodplains for feeding spawning and nursery habitats yin et al 2011 bailly et al 2008 determined that intense floods favor gonad development and increase fish survival ozen and noble 2002 concluded that the initiation of largemouth bass spawning is stimulated by water level increases through collections of juvenile fish over seven years in lucchetti reservoir puerto rico zhang et al 2018 argue that an ecological flow regime with specific eco hydrological signals such as flow frequency duration timing and rate of change can not only guarantee oviposition but also meet the drifting conditions required for eggs agostinho et al 2004 found that the proportion of individual fish with ripe and partially spent gonads which indicates spawning were higher during the period in which water levels were increasing in the upper parana river floodplain however seasonal flood peaks can be weakened or eliminated by reservoir scheduling thereby interrupting the triggering factors required for fish migration spawning and hatching leira and cantonati 2008 a study by piana et al 2017 found that porto primavera dam negatively impacts the abundance of curimba prochilodus lineatus at sites in the floodplain tan et al 2010 reported that flow changes in the pearl river in china resulted in delays in fish spawning time and a decrease in fish larval abundance shen et al 2018 stated that after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir the habitat of the chinese sturgeon was degraded and its spawn time was delayed by correlation analysis and significance testing shen 2015 demonstrated that the initial flow and daily average flow increases are the most critical indicators for the reproduction of four major chinese carps attempts to balance human needs and ecological flow requirements by reservoir operation have been undertaken over the past few decades cai et al 2013 generally there are three types of models available to consider the ecological flow in reservoir operation the constraint control type model ccm the target control type model tcm dai et al 2017 and the ecological value target type model evtm due to their simplicity ccms are widely used chang et al 2010 without respect to flow regimes evtms with full cost accounting still face numerous challenges in regions without developed water markets bryan et al 2010 tcms with a relatively solid theoretical foundation are the main direction of future research yan et al 2018 but they still need to be able to quantify the key flow characteristics an ideal ecological flow process should help maintain the stability and biodiversity of an aquatic ecosystem with similar statistical characteristics to those of the natural flow processes xia et al 2007 more than 170 hydrologic metrics have been developed with the aim of capturing the ecologically relevant stream flow attributes during the past decade olden and poff 2003 generally there are four types of ecological flow estimations for riverine ecosystems 1 the minimum flow requirement for downstream habitats to maintain the survival of specific species cardwell et al 1996 2 the flow regime based on fish diversity information yang and cai 2011 3 a regime based prescribed flow duration curve considering floods and droughts for species and morphological needs lane et al 2015 and 4 flow alterations before and after reservoir construction zhang et al 2015 these first two methods neglect the flow fluctuations in determining the ecological integrity hence the last two methods have attracted increasing attention the most widely used metric to quantify the hydrologic alterations caused by human activity is the indicators of hydrologic alteration proposed by richter et al 1996 and li and qiu 2016 however existing recommendations suggest that at least 15 years of data are needed kennard et al 2010 which can be data intensive computationally difficult and prone to uncertainty julian et al 2016 in practice legal requirements on minimum flow releases is nearly the only environmental consideration in reservoir operation jager and smith 2008 which implicitly gives lower priority to ecosystems than to human needs yin and yang 2011 another method of practical reservoir operation is run of the river ror operation adopting the philosophy that healthy river ecosystems require a natural flow process baron et al 2002 which is inapplicable for large reservoirs with multiple functions wang et al 2015 and may reduce the revenue of hydropower producers yin et al 2018 the key challenge of reservoir operation involving ecological requirements lies in 1 quantitatively identifying the stream flow regimes required for the health of aquatic ecosystems and 2 considering the flow regimes in reservoir operations and balancing the ecological and economic objectives attempts to discharge water in a manner closer to the natural stream flow via reservoir operations are still in their early stages and only a few reservoir management schemes use historical streamflow regimes to incorporate flow variability suen et al 2009 to achieve economic and ecological consensus for reservoir operation with consideration of the ecological flow regimes a multi objective optimization model is proposed in this study the flow regime most effective for fish spawning stimuli is first identified and a set of indices are then defined to quantitatively describe the characteristics of the identified flow rising processes taking into account the integrated indices an ecological score is defined to evaluate the similarity between the reservoir release and the natural flow regimes economic and ecological benefits are balanced by maximizing the ecological score and power generation during the spawning season the proposed multi objective optimization model is applied on a large scale reservoir in the upper reaches of the yellow river in china and solved using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the quantitative features of the flow rising process of the upper yellow river during fish spawning seasons are obtained where some of the rare plateau fish reside more importantly the derived pareto front indicates that it is possible to achieve both ecological and economic objectives via reservoir operation even in arid and semi arid areas 2 methodology 2 1 fluctuation identification the aforementioned studies have shown that the flow rising processes with multiple pulses in fish spawning season are important stimuli for fish in this study a flow rising process is defined as the whole process in which the flow rises from a local minimum to the highest point of a certain range and then falls back to the next local minimum the rising and falling edges of the natural flow rising processes are identified respectively according to the procedure in fig 1 essentially the flow rising edge and falling edge are identified separately only those rising with a flow increment δ q r i larger than a certain threshold are recognized as effective stimuli for fish spawning as in eq 1 while those small fluctuations are considered to be irrelevant 1 δ q r i q r c r i where δ q r i q p i q v i q is the flow rate the index r refers to the variables related to the flow rising edge i is the index of the flow rising processes in the spawning season the subscripts p and v refer to the maximum and minimum in a flow process respectively q r c r i is the increment threshold and if the increment δ q r i is larger than that of q r c r i the corresponding rising process is recognized as an effective stimulus for fish spawning the increment threshold q r c r i relates to both the maximum flow rate in the spawning season and the hydrological characteristics during the year which is thus defined as the mean of the maximum flow of the corresponding hydrological years i e wet years normal years or dry years as shown in eq 2 2 q r c r i α 1 m e a n max τ q h τ where α 1 is a sensitive factor for the identification of the flow rising process the probability of being identified as a flow rising process is larger with a smaller α 1 for a certain fluctuation and the recommended value of α 1 is between 0 15 and 0 35 this means that if the flow rises with an amplitude larger than 15 to 35 of the mean value of the peak flood flow of the corresponding hydrological years wet normal dry it will be regarded as an effective stimulus for fish spawning the specific value of α 1 can be determined by consulting an ichthyologist or utilizing parameter calibration in this study α 1 0 20 h is the index of the hydrological years and h 1 2 and 3 indicates wet years normal years and dry years respectively τ is the index of the studied year if the change in the flow of the adjacent rising processes identified in the first step is relatively gentle as described in eq 3 they are identified as the same continuous flow rising process instead of as two independent rising processes 3 δ q f i α 2 q r c r i where δ q f i is the rising magnitude of the adjacent fluctuation as illustrated in fig 1 b and α 2 0 1 is another sensitive factor to identify a continuous flow rising process the larger α 2 is the more likely the flow is identified as a continuous flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 2 is between 0 1 and 0 15 in this study α 2 0 10 after the two steps above the rising process is regarded to end if the derived flow rising edge is linked to a relatively stable flow process with a small amplitude however if the subsequent rising becomes more and more severe as described in eqs 4 and 5 the process is deemed to continue 4 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n where q p i j indicates the j th follow up peaks in the i th flow rising process as illustrated in fig 1 c eq 5 actually describes a case in which although the follow up rising process is gentle the increment becomes larger and larger which should also be recognized as the same rising process that is effective for fish spawning stimuli 5 q p i j q p i j 1 α 3 j 1 e j 1 j q r c r i j 1 2 n where α 3 is the sensitive factor of the identification of the follow up flow rising process the smaller the α 3 the larger the possibility that a steady follow up process is included in the rising process in this study α 3 is set to 0 1 with respect to the falling edge the first and second falling edge are identified according to eqs 6 and 7 as in fig 1 d which consider only those fallings with increasingly lower peak values at the falling edge 6 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 7 e j 1 j q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 2 2 characteristic parameters of the ecological flow for the identified flow rising processes effective for fish spawning stimuli indices need to be defined to quantify their characteristics those indices with similar features in the spawning season of different hydrological years are regarded as the key factors to stimulate the fish to spawn there are seven indices defined in this study to characterize the flow rising processes illustrated as follows where m is the total number of flow rising processes in a spawning season s represents the number of daily flow data in the entire spawning season the i th rising process covers ni daily flow data and q id represents the flow of the d th day in the i th rising process 1 the number of rising processes in the whole spawning season n 2 the average duration in days of each flow rising process t which is used to describe the mean durations of multiple flow rising processes in the spawning season of a certain year 3 the daily average flow in the flow rising processes q which is used to describe the daily average flow in the flow rising processes in the same fish spawning season as shown in eq 8 8 q i 1 m d 1 n i q id i 1 m n i 4 average flow rising ratio in a spawning season η which is defined as the ratio of the daily average flow in the flow rising processes to the daily average flow in the spawning season and is used to describe the flow ratios of the flow rising processes throughout the spawning season which reflects the relative intensity of the rising flow as in eq 9 9 η q h 1 s q h s 5 average flow increment in a spawning season δ q r which is used to describe the average flow increment of multiple rising processes in a certain spawning season which reflects the absolute intensity of the flow increment as shown in eq 10 10 δ q r i 1 m max q id min q id m d 1 2 n i 6 average growth rate which is used to describe the mean growth rate of multiple rising processes in a certain spawning season in eq 11 11 v i 1 m max q id min q id day max q id d a y min q id 1 m i 1 2 n i the larger the v is the more severely the fish perceive a rising flow thus v is deemed to be an important parameter for fish spawning 2 3 evaluation index of the ecological flow assuming that a certain index x k defined in section 2 2 is a random variable in a normal distribution i e x k n μ σ 2 whose probability density function pdf is shown in eq 12 12 f x k 1 2 π σ e x p x k μ 2 2 σ 2 the average value of the index x k of the natural flow regime in wet normal and dry years can be respectively taken as the expectation μ for different hydrological years and the standard deviation of all natural inter annual flow sequences can be set as the σ in eq 12 by integrating the pdf f x k the cumulative distribution function f x k can be derived and the eco score of index x k can be defined as in eq 13 13 ecoscore k 2 f x k x k μ x k μ 100 the comprehensive eco score of the m indices of the flow rising process ecoscore is defined in eq 14 which is used to estimate the level of similarity between the flow regimes 14 ecoscore 1 m k 1 m ecoscore k 2 4 multi objective optimization model the hydrological demand of fish spawning and hydropower generation are the two major objectives to consider during the spawning season which are incommensurable but competitive in water allocation to recreate the natural flow process downstream the reservoir should not store water resulting in economic loss from power generation meanwhile to improve power generation it is necessary to raise the water level of the reservoir and release less flow impacting fish spawning downstream to achieve a mutually beneficial solution a multi objective optimization model is established in this study maximizing the power generation and eco score while meeting other operational constraints as illustrated below 2 4 1 objective function objective 1 maximizing the hydropower generation during the considered period during the spawning season maximizing the total hydropower generation is set as the first objective function to make full use of the regulation capacity of the reservoir with a higher water head and less water abandonment written as 15 z 1 m a x e m a x t 1 t n t δ t m a x t 1 t k q t δ h δ t where e is the total power generation n is the power output of the hydropower station δt is the corresponding time k is the output coefficient of the hydropower station and δh is the water head of the reservoir objective 2 maximizing the comprehensive eco score of the reservoir release the characteristics of the natural flow regime are set as the expectation μ and standard deviation σ in eq 12 thus maximizing the comprehensive eco score of the reservoir release essentially indicates that the statistical results of the characteristic indices of the reservoir release are closest to those of the natural flow rising process as in eq 16 16 z 2 m a x e c o s c o r e 2 4 2 decision variables according to eqs 15 and 16 the reservoir release not only influences the hydropower generation but also determines the ecological score thus it is selected as the decision variable as shown in eq 17 using one day as the time step 17 u q 1 q 2 q s where s represents the number of daily flow data in the entire spawning season 2 4 3 state equations and constraints multiple requirements need to be satisfied under reservoir state equations including the water balance equation water level reservoir storage relationship and release tailwater level relationship as shown in eqs 18 20 18 v t v t 1 i t δ t q t δ t 19 l t f v t 20 t t g q t where v t is the reservoir storage i t is the inflow l t indicates the reservoir water level and t t is the tailwater level the operational requirements such as flood control ice prevention and water supply are realized by controlling the reservoir water level and release as in eqs 21 and 22 21 l t min l t l t max 22 q t min q t q t max where l t min and l t max are the minimum and maximum water levels of the reservoir permitted on the t th day and q t min and q t max are the minimum and maximum water release of the reservoir permitted on the t th day these limitations can be found in the reservoir regulations 2 5 implementation without loss of generality for a multi objective optimization problem defined in eq 23 the optimum result is a solution set instead of a single solution known as pareto optimal solutions min x ω f x f 1 x f 2 x f λ x t subject to g l x 0 l 1 2 l i 23 h l x 0 l 1 2 l e where x is a variable vector ω is a feasible solution space f 1 x f 2 x f λ x denote real valued objective functions and l i and l e indicate the number of inequality constraints and equality constraints respectively for any two points x 1 and x 2 in ω x 1 is defined to dominate x 2 if the conditions in eq 24 are satisfied 24 x 1 dom x 2 i f i x 1 f i x 2 and j f j x 1 f j x 2 if no other solution dominates x 1 x 1 is called a pareto optimal solution the boundary consisting of the set of pareto optimal solutions is called a trade off surface or a pareto front due to the competitiveness and incommensurability of the two objectives shown in eqs 15 and 16 the modified version of nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 is adopted in this study to solve the optimization model introduced in section 2 4 which is one of the most efficient and commonly used evolutionary algorithms with simplicity effectiveness and consideration of the objective competitiveness niu et al 2017 the initial population composed of individuals represented in eq 17 is generated randomly within the feasible domain in eq 22 the fitness of each individual i e the objective function values defined in eqs 15 and 16 are then calculated according to the quantitative relation described in eqs 18 20 and the ecological scoring method described from eqs 1 14 after a feasibility evaluation according to eq 21 the feasible individuals are sorted to form multiple pareto fronts with different ranks based on the dominant level determined by the fitness as defined in eq 24 the procedure described above is iterated until all the individuals are sorted for the last pareto front those individuals in scarcely populated areas are selected to fill up the population to maintain its diversity which is measured by crowding distance d w as defined in eq 25 deb et al 2002 25 d w o 1 λ f w o 1 f w o 1 f w o m a x f w o m i n where f w o is the o th objective value of the w th individual and f w o m a x and f w o m i n are the maximum and minimum for the o th objective respectively selection is carried out so that those individuals with better performance have large survival probabilities the selection criteria are as follows individuals with higher front ranks are preferred for those with the same pareto front level the individuals with larger crowding distances are selected simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation operations are then employed for those selected individuals to generate offspring populations an elite strategy is adopted to maintain superior parent individuals in the offspring population the new parent population is configured by adding elite individuals from the parent and offspring population based on the domination levels and crowding distances a schematic of the proposed optimization methodology is given in fig 2 3 results 3 1 study area yangqu hydropower station located on the upper reaches of the yellow river is still in the demonstration stage it is about 100 km away from the longyangxia reservoir downstream as shown in fig 3 the yangqu project is a diurnal regulating reservoir with regulation storage of 239 106 m3 the hydropower station has an installed capacity of 1200 mw with annual power generation of about 4 746 109 kwh influences on the fish habitats caused by the new reservoir are the primary consideration in the demonstration of the yangqu hydropower station the upper reaches of the yellow river are in arid and semi arid regions with fragile ecological environments many aquatic species are so rare that they must be protected the protected fish in the yangqu river section mainly lay eggs in the yehuxia spawning ground located downstream of the yangqu project and in the backwater zone of the longyangxia reservoir as shown in fig 3 these fish adapt better to riptide environments and will be greatly affected by the operation of the yangqu project the yehuxia spawning ground with a riffle area and slow flow during fish spawning season is thus selected as the key ecological consideration of the reservoir operation the protected fish in the yangqu river mainly include chuanchia labiosa platypharodon extremus gymnocypris eckloni schizopygopsis pylzovi triplophysa siluroides gymnodiptychus pachycheilus and acanthogobio guentheri only gymnodiptychus pachycheilus lay eggs against the stream after the ice melts in april the spawning season for the rest of the fish is concentrated in may to june most of the protected fish listed above are cold water fish producing adhesive and demersal eggs the flow regime plays an important role in the maintenance of fish spawning ground long term observations indicate that fish spawning requires not only a flow pulse but also a continuous rising process and there must be sufficient flow peaks besides fish spawning grounds are mostly slow flowing water areas with pebble and gravel bottoms i e there are also requirements for flow velocity and water depth which can be reflected by the flow in addition to the dynamic characteristics of the flow the appropriate water temperature is also an indispensable condition for the survival and hatching of fish eggs it can be seen from the analysis above that by using the yehuxia spawning ground as the protection target the key ecological needs for the hydro environment mainly include the 1 flow regime as the fish gonad development requires stimulus from the flow rising process 2 water depth as the hatchings of the adhesive and demersal eggs require a gentle shallow flow with small variations in amplitude and 3 water temperature as the appropriate temperature for fish spawning and egg hatching in the target spawning ground is about 14 15 c under the conditions of gentle shallow flow the area has sufficient sunshine during the spawning season to meet the water temperature demand therefore the protection of the spawning ground can be realized by control of the reservoir release upstream taking into account the ecological requirement of fish spawning downstream and economic profit simultaneously this study tries to determine whether it is possible to increase the power generation during the spawning season while protecting fish spawning another motivation lies in the fact that the natural streamflow especially during dry years may not benefit fish spawning when the reservoir can conduct ecological compensation to the riverine ecosystem in arid and semi arid areas the historical inflow data into the longyangxia reservoir from the years 2010 to 2015 are used to analyze the natural flow characteristics for the yehuxia spawning ground 3 2 characteristic parameters of the ecological fluctuation a frequency analysis according to a a type iii pearson p iii distribution is carried out to determine the hydrological classification of each year and the statistical parameters and design values of each frequency determined by the frequency analysis are used as the criteria for the classification of hydrological years including the sample mean ex 619 18 m3 s variation coefficient cv 0 26 and skewness coefficient cs 1 43 after the distribution is determined with the calibrated parameters different hydrological years can be classified according to the national standard of china gb t50095 98 i e the years with the frequency p 37 5 62 5 are the normal years while those with p 37 5 or p 62 5 are wet years and dry years respectively based on the natural daily flow data of the yehuxia reach in fish spawning season april to june the historical natural water rising processes are identified whose characteristic indices are calculated and presented in table 1 the characteristic indices of the flow rising process during fish spawning season at the yehuxia spawning ground indicate that the number of rising processes throughout the entire spawning season is between 3 and 7 times with an average value of 5 2 times the average duration of each flow rising process is between 7 33 and 12 33 days with an average of 10 57 days the average flow rising ratio during a spawning season is between 0 97 and 1 48 with an average of 1 26 the daily average flow in the flow rising processes is between 685 m3 s and 810 m3 s with an average of 751 m3 s the average flow increment in a spawning season is between 276 m3 s and 451 m3 s with an average of 341 m3 s and the average growth rate is between 47 m3 s day and 63 m3 s day with an average of 54 m3 s day the daily flow rising process at the yehuxia spawning ground i e the outflow of the yangqu reservoir should be in accordance with the characteristic indices of the corresponding hydrological year as closely as possible that is the eco score defined in eq 14 should be maximized for ecological benefits as in eq 16 3 3 multi objective optimization results for the presented case only the spawning season lasting from april to june each year was studied therefore there are 91 decision variables taking one day as the time step for such a high multi dimensional decision variable a randomly generated initial population within a large range as shown in eq 22 will result in a large number of infeasible solutions li et al 2012 corresponding to emptying the reservoir or overtopping the dam and the population in the nsga ii simulation will be inundated with invalid individuals since the yangqu hydropower station is a daily regulation reservoir a certain fluctuation range is added to the inflow to form the solution domain in order to improve the efficiency of the nsga ii within this range as shown in eq 26 individuals are generated randomly and participate in the iteration 26 β 1 i t q t β 2 i t where two working conditions with β 1 β 2 10 and β 1 β 2 20 are adopted by referring to both the research of li et al 2012 and parameter calibration in this study respectively the two objectives shown in eqs 15 and 16 respectively representing economic and ecological benefits are evaluated for each individual after genetic operation and non dominated sorting the pareto front for the multi objective optimization model described from eqs 15 22 is presented in fig 4 and the corresponding operational schemes are presented in fig 5 the pareto front in the subgraphs in fig 4 are all non dominated solutions i e they cannot be compared with one another the reservoir operator needs to evaluate the power generation and the eco score of the reservoir release and select an operational scheme from the pareto front the current regulations of the yangqu hydropower station dictate that the yangqu reservoir will not store water from april to june every year and the power station will not carry out daily peak operations to maintain the stability of the backwater reach of the longyangxia reservoir in this study the flow process corresponding to the maximum power generation and the highest eco score are selected from all of the pareto optimal solutions under the two given conditions illustrated in eq 26 which are compared with the natural streamflow as shown in fig 5 the solutions in the pareto front cannot be compared i e for any two schemes in the front if the power generation of one scheme is larger than that of the other scheme its ecological score must be lower than that of the other the two schemes with the largest power generation and the highest ecological score in the pareto front are compared in table 2 table 3 shows the optimization potential of different targets according to the results in table 2 it can be seen that compared with the current ror regulation scheme even for the scheme with the highest ecological score the power generation will increase slightly after multi objective optimization although the percentage increment is relatively small the total amount of power generation during the entire spawning season from april to june can be increased by 2 5 million kwh in different years for the scheme with the largest amount of power generation it can be increased by more than 0 4 3 4 discussion 1 as there is no relevant report on the flow processes in this region the quantitative results about the flow rising process are only verified by interviews of some plateau ichthyologists see the acknowledgements section they confirm that 4 6 times of continuous flow rising processes are needed in the region according to their long term observations and each of these processes lasts for about 10 days other quantitative features of the flow rising process such as the rising rate and the flow rate cannot be identified by the ichthyologists these findings generally agree with ours which is essential for our knowledge of fish spawning stimulus from the perspective of the flow regime 2 it can be seen from the analysis for different hydrological years that although the average number of rising processes in wet years is larger than that in normal years followed by dry years the average duration of each flow rising process in different hydrological years is similar around 11 days another relatively stable regime index of the flow rising processes is the average growth rate of the rising processes in the spawning season which is around 50 m3 s day in different hydrological years 3 in the spawning season from april to june there exists a certain competitive relationship between the demand for fish spawning downstream and power generation i e part of the economic profit must be sacrificed to benefit the ecology as much as possible as shown in fig 4 as the total power generation increases the ecological score of the flow process will decrease it costs more power generation to get a higher ecological score in normal and wet years compared with dry years in general due to the limitation of the candidate discharge scheme in eq 26 the optimized reservoir release for the two cases seems similar in fig 5 it can be inferred that some small adjustment of the reservoir operation could result in a large benefit of ecological recovery with little cost to power generation 4 it is possible to increase the power generation of the yangqu hydropower station while taking into account the ecological demand by multi objective optimization table 3 indicates that even for the scheme with the highest ecological score the total amount of power generation during the spawning season can be increased by 2 5 million kwh 5 it can be seen from the comparison of flow processes with the largest power generation and the highest ecological score as well as the natural flow process in fig 5 that for both schemes with different optimal targets the flow processes fluctuate slightly around the original natural process the fluctuation range is within 20 and is basically 10 it does not significantly change the natural flow process so even if it utilizes the scheme with the maximum power generation during the period the fish spawning ground downstream will not be affected significantly it should be noted that the optimization results are directly related to the initial solution space in this study the decision variables in the optimization process are generated within the range of 10 β 1 β 2 10 and 20 β 1 β 2 20 of the natural discharge flow respectively as illustrated in eq 26 however for most years except 2011 and 2013 both of the optimum schemes with the highest ecological score and largest power generation appear under the condition of β 1 β 2 10 indicating that when the solution space increases the invalid solutions in the population increase when prematurity occurs for nsga ii i e there is a large number of infeasible solutions derived from the random generation in a large solution space and once there appears a feasible solution in the iteration the optimization converges to it without further improvement 4 conclusion an identification algorithm to identify the effective flow rising processes for fish spawning as well as the characteristic indices to quantitatively describe the processes is presented in this study based on these indices an ecological scoring method is established to evaluate the ecological benefits of the flow for fish spawning a multi objective optimization model is then proposed considering both the economic and ecological benefits of the hydropower station during fish spawning season which is solved by nsga ii the proposed methodology is applied to a large scale reservoir on the upper reaches of the yellow river in arid and semi arid areas yangqu hydropower station quantitative features of the flow rising process effective for fish spawning in this region are obtained for the first time which helps to protect the rare plateau fishes more importantly the analysis of the pareto front suggests that there is potential for the improvement of the reservoir operation for both fish protection and hydropower generation with knowledge of the flow regime needed for fish spawning this study is only a theoretical analysis based on historical data more observations on the relationships between fish spawning and reservoir operations need to be carried out to verify the findings of this study in the future the main limitation of the proposed methodology lies in the determination of the parameters α 1 α 2 and α 3 which needs some priori knowledge about the fish in the river and can be obtained by consulting ichthyologists

5784,various studies have shown that stream flow regimes play a significant role in fish spawning stimuli stream flows have been altered by reservoir operations around the world especially in arid and semi arid regions in this study the flow rising processes most effective for fish spawning stimuli are identified and their quantitative characteristics are then represented by a set of hydrological indices based on a quantitative ecological scoring method describing the statistical similarity between the reservoir release and the natural flow regime a multi objective optimization model considering hydropower generation and fish habitat protection is proposed and then solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the proposed methodology is applied to a large scale reservoir on the upper reaches of the yellow river in china the statistics of these indices verify the regulations on the flow rising processes in fish spawning seasons via reservoir operation in different hydrological years the pareto front derived from the multi objective optimization indicates that it is possible to both improve the local ecology and increase hydropower generation profits using the method proposed herein on the basis of proper understanding of the effective flow process required by fish keywords fish spawning stimulus flow rising process multi objective optimization power generation yangqu hydropower station 1 introduction over half of the 292 large river systems in the world have been influenced by the construction and operation of water conservancy projects nilsson et al 2005 and in many cases the influence extends for hundreds of kilometers richter and thomas 2007 although the relationship between aquatic ecosystem health and the stream flow regime differs from case to case and some studies even use the requirements of certain fish types as the index for the ecological flow requirements chen et al 2013 it is generally agreed upon that maintaining or mimicking natural flow regimes is important for ecosystem health richter et al 1996 flow regimes refer to not only the flow magnitude but also to other characteristics such as the timing and duration of the flow rise decrease and the number of flow peaks poff and zimmerman 2010 which have been proven to be effective and necessary for fish reproduction alonso gonzalez et al 2008 studies have demonstrated that high flow events including both high flow pulses and floods play an important role in ecological functions poff et al 2010 such as aiding migration providing spawning cues triggering new life cycle phases and providing access to floodplains for feeding spawning and nursery habitats yin et al 2011 bailly et al 2008 determined that intense floods favor gonad development and increase fish survival ozen and noble 2002 concluded that the initiation of largemouth bass spawning is stimulated by water level increases through collections of juvenile fish over seven years in lucchetti reservoir puerto rico zhang et al 2018 argue that an ecological flow regime with specific eco hydrological signals such as flow frequency duration timing and rate of change can not only guarantee oviposition but also meet the drifting conditions required for eggs agostinho et al 2004 found that the proportion of individual fish with ripe and partially spent gonads which indicates spawning were higher during the period in which water levels were increasing in the upper parana river floodplain however seasonal flood peaks can be weakened or eliminated by reservoir scheduling thereby interrupting the triggering factors required for fish migration spawning and hatching leira and cantonati 2008 a study by piana et al 2017 found that porto primavera dam negatively impacts the abundance of curimba prochilodus lineatus at sites in the floodplain tan et al 2010 reported that flow changes in the pearl river in china resulted in delays in fish spawning time and a decrease in fish larval abundance shen et al 2018 stated that after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir the habitat of the chinese sturgeon was degraded and its spawn time was delayed by correlation analysis and significance testing shen 2015 demonstrated that the initial flow and daily average flow increases are the most critical indicators for the reproduction of four major chinese carps attempts to balance human needs and ecological flow requirements by reservoir operation have been undertaken over the past few decades cai et al 2013 generally there are three types of models available to consider the ecological flow in reservoir operation the constraint control type model ccm the target control type model tcm dai et al 2017 and the ecological value target type model evtm due to their simplicity ccms are widely used chang et al 2010 without respect to flow regimes evtms with full cost accounting still face numerous challenges in regions without developed water markets bryan et al 2010 tcms with a relatively solid theoretical foundation are the main direction of future research yan et al 2018 but they still need to be able to quantify the key flow characteristics an ideal ecological flow process should help maintain the stability and biodiversity of an aquatic ecosystem with similar statistical characteristics to those of the natural flow processes xia et al 2007 more than 170 hydrologic metrics have been developed with the aim of capturing the ecologically relevant stream flow attributes during the past decade olden and poff 2003 generally there are four types of ecological flow estimations for riverine ecosystems 1 the minimum flow requirement for downstream habitats to maintain the survival of specific species cardwell et al 1996 2 the flow regime based on fish diversity information yang and cai 2011 3 a regime based prescribed flow duration curve considering floods and droughts for species and morphological needs lane et al 2015 and 4 flow alterations before and after reservoir construction zhang et al 2015 these first two methods neglect the flow fluctuations in determining the ecological integrity hence the last two methods have attracted increasing attention the most widely used metric to quantify the hydrologic alterations caused by human activity is the indicators of hydrologic alteration proposed by richter et al 1996 and li and qiu 2016 however existing recommendations suggest that at least 15 years of data are needed kennard et al 2010 which can be data intensive computationally difficult and prone to uncertainty julian et al 2016 in practice legal requirements on minimum flow releases is nearly the only environmental consideration in reservoir operation jager and smith 2008 which implicitly gives lower priority to ecosystems than to human needs yin and yang 2011 another method of practical reservoir operation is run of the river ror operation adopting the philosophy that healthy river ecosystems require a natural flow process baron et al 2002 which is inapplicable for large reservoirs with multiple functions wang et al 2015 and may reduce the revenue of hydropower producers yin et al 2018 the key challenge of reservoir operation involving ecological requirements lies in 1 quantitatively identifying the stream flow regimes required for the health of aquatic ecosystems and 2 considering the flow regimes in reservoir operations and balancing the ecological and economic objectives attempts to discharge water in a manner closer to the natural stream flow via reservoir operations are still in their early stages and only a few reservoir management schemes use historical streamflow regimes to incorporate flow variability suen et al 2009 to achieve economic and ecological consensus for reservoir operation with consideration of the ecological flow regimes a multi objective optimization model is proposed in this study the flow regime most effective for fish spawning stimuli is first identified and a set of indices are then defined to quantitatively describe the characteristics of the identified flow rising processes taking into account the integrated indices an ecological score is defined to evaluate the similarity between the reservoir release and the natural flow regimes economic and ecological benefits are balanced by maximizing the ecological score and power generation during the spawning season the proposed multi objective optimization model is applied on a large scale reservoir in the upper reaches of the yellow river in china and solved using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the quantitative features of the flow rising process of the upper yellow river during fish spawning seasons are obtained where some of the rare plateau fish reside more importantly the derived pareto front indicates that it is possible to achieve both ecological and economic objectives via reservoir operation even in arid and semi arid areas 2 methodology 2 1 fluctuation identification the aforementioned studies have shown that the flow rising processes with multiple pulses in fish spawning season are important stimuli for fish in this study a flow rising process is defined as the whole process in which the flow rises from a local minimum to the highest point of a certain range and then falls back to the next local minimum the rising and falling edges of the natural flow rising processes are identified respectively according to the procedure in fig 1 essentially the flow rising edge and falling edge are identified separately only those rising with a flow increment δ q r i larger than a certain threshold are recognized as effective stimuli for fish spawning as in eq 1 while those small fluctuations are considered to be irrelevant 1 δ q r i q r c r i where δ q r i q p i q v i q is the flow rate the index r refers to the variables related to the flow rising edge i is the index of the flow rising processes in the spawning season the subscripts p and v refer to the maximum and minimum in a flow process respectively q r c r i is the increment threshold and if the increment δ q r i is larger than that of q r c r i the corresponding rising process is recognized as an effective stimulus for fish spawning the increment threshold q r c r i relates to both the maximum flow rate in the spawning season and the hydrological characteristics during the year which is thus defined as the mean of the maximum flow of the corresponding hydrological years i e wet years normal years or dry years as shown in eq 2 2 q r c r i α 1 m e a n max τ q h τ where α 1 is a sensitive factor for the identification of the flow rising process the probability of being identified as a flow rising process is larger with a smaller α 1 for a certain fluctuation and the recommended value of α 1 is between 0 15 and 0 35 this means that if the flow rises with an amplitude larger than 15 to 35 of the mean value of the peak flood flow of the corresponding hydrological years wet normal dry it will be regarded as an effective stimulus for fish spawning the specific value of α 1 can be determined by consulting an ichthyologist or utilizing parameter calibration in this study α 1 0 20 h is the index of the hydrological years and h 1 2 and 3 indicates wet years normal years and dry years respectively τ is the index of the studied year if the change in the flow of the adjacent rising processes identified in the first step is relatively gentle as described in eq 3 they are identified as the same continuous flow rising process instead of as two independent rising processes 3 δ q f i α 2 q r c r i where δ q f i is the rising magnitude of the adjacent fluctuation as illustrated in fig 1 b and α 2 0 1 is another sensitive factor to identify a continuous flow rising process the larger α 2 is the more likely the flow is identified as a continuous flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 2 is between 0 1 and 0 15 in this study α 2 0 10 after the two steps above the rising process is regarded to end if the derived flow rising edge is linked to a relatively stable flow process with a small amplitude however if the subsequent rising becomes more and more severe as described in eqs 4 and 5 the process is deemed to continue 4 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n where q p i j indicates the j th follow up peaks in the i th flow rising process as illustrated in fig 1 c eq 5 actually describes a case in which although the follow up rising process is gentle the increment becomes larger and larger which should also be recognized as the same rising process that is effective for fish spawning stimuli 5 q p i j q p i j 1 α 3 j 1 e j 1 j q r c r i j 1 2 n where α 3 is the sensitive factor of the identification of the follow up flow rising process the smaller the α 3 the larger the possibility that a steady follow up process is included in the rising process in this study α 3 is set to 0 1 with respect to the falling edge the first and second falling edge are identified according to eqs 6 and 7 as in fig 1 d which consider only those fallings with increasingly lower peak values at the falling edge 6 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 7 e j 1 j q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 2 2 characteristic parameters of the ecological flow for the identified flow rising processes effective for fish spawning stimuli indices need to be defined to quantify their characteristics those indices with similar features in the spawning season of different hydrological years are regarded as the key factors to stimulate the fish to spawn there are seven indices defined in this study to characterize the flow rising processes illustrated as follows where m is the total number of flow rising processes in a spawning season s represents the number of daily flow data in the entire spawning season the i th rising process covers ni daily flow data and q id represents the flow of the d th day in the i th rising process 1 the number of rising processes in the whole spawning season n 2 the average duration in days of each flow rising process t which is used to describe the mean durations of multiple flow rising processes in the spawning season of a certain year 3 the daily average flow in the flow rising processes q which is used to describe the daily average flow in the flow rising processes in the same fish spawning season as shown in eq 8 8 q i 1 m d 1 n i q id i 1 m n i 4 average flow rising ratio in a spawning season η which is defined as the ratio of the daily average flow in the flow rising processes to the daily average flow in the spawning season and is used to describe the flow ratios of the flow rising processes throughout the spawning season which reflects the relative intensity of the rising flow as in eq 9 9 η q h 1 s q h s 5 average flow increment in a spawning season δ q r which is used to describe the average flow increment of multiple rising processes in a certain spawning season which reflects the absolute intensity of the flow increment as shown in eq 10 10 δ q r i 1 m max q id min q id m d 1 2 n i 6 average growth rate which is used to describe the mean growth rate of multiple rising processes in a certain spawning season in eq 11 11 v i 1 m max q id min q id day max q id d a y min q id 1 m i 1 2 n i the larger the v is the more severely the fish perceive a rising flow thus v is deemed to be an important parameter for fish spawning 2 3 evaluation index of the ecological flow assuming that a certain index x k defined in section 2 2 is a random variable in a normal distribution i e x k n μ σ 2 whose probability density function pdf is shown in eq 12 12 f x k 1 2 π σ e x p x k μ 2 2 σ 2 the average value of the index x k of the natural flow regime in wet normal and dry years can be respectively taken as the expectation μ for different hydrological years and the standard deviation of all natural inter annual flow sequences can be set as the σ in eq 12 by integrating the pdf f x k the cumulative distribution function f x k can be derived and the eco score of index x k can be defined as in eq 13 13 ecoscore k 2 f x k x k μ x k μ 100 the comprehensive eco score of the m indices of the flow rising process ecoscore is defined in eq 14 which is used to estimate the level of similarity between the flow regimes 14 ecoscore 1 m k 1 m ecoscore k 2 4 multi objective optimization model the hydrological demand of fish spawning and hydropower generation are the two major objectives to consider during the spawning season which are incommensurable but competitive in water allocation to recreate the natural flow process downstream the reservoir should not store water resulting in economic loss from power generation meanwhile to improve power generation it is necessary to raise the water level of the reservoir and release less flow impacting fish spawning downstream to achieve a mutually beneficial solution a multi objective optimization model is established in this study maximizing the power generation and eco score while meeting other operational constraints as illustrated below 2 4 1 objective function objective 1 maximizing the hydropower generation during the considered period during the spawning season maximizing the total hydropower generation is set as the first objective function to make full use of the regulation capacity of the reservoir with a higher water head and less water abandonment written as 15 z 1 m a x e m a x t 1 t n t δ t m a x t 1 t k q t δ h δ t where e is the total power generation n is the power output of the hydropower station δt is the corresponding time k is the output coefficient of the hydropower station and δh is the water head of the reservoir objective 2 maximizing the comprehensive eco score of the reservoir release the characteristics of the natural flow regime are set as the expectation μ and standard deviation σ in eq 12 thus maximizing the comprehensive eco score of the reservoir release essentially indicates that the statistical results of the characteristic indices of the reservoir release are closest to those of the natural flow rising process as in eq 16 16 z 2 m a x e c o s c o r e 2 4 2 decision variables according to eqs 15 and 16 the reservoir release not only influences the hydropower generation but also determines the ecological score thus it is selected as the decision variable as shown in eq 17 using one day as the time step 17 u q 1 q 2 q s where s represents the number of daily flow data in the entire spawning season 2 4 3 state equations and constraints multiple requirements need to be satisfied under reservoir state equations including the water balance equation water level reservoir storage relationship and release tailwater level relationship as shown in eqs 18 20 18 v t v t 1 i t δ t q t δ t 19 l t f v t 20 t t g q t where v t is the reservoir storage i t is the inflow l t indicates the reservoir water level and t t is the tailwater level the operational requirements such as flood control ice prevention and water supply are realized by controlling the reservoir water level and release as in eqs 21 and 22 21 l t min l t l t max 22 q t min q t q t max where l t min and l t max are the minimum and maximum water levels of the reservoir permitted on the t th day and q t min and q t max are the minimum and maximum water release of the reservoir permitted on the t th day these limitations can be found in the reservoir regulations 2 5 implementation without loss of generality for a multi objective optimization problem defined in eq 23 the optimum result is a solution set instead of a single solution known as pareto optimal solutions min x ω f x f 1 x f 2 x f λ x t subject to g l x 0 l 1 2 l i 23 h l x 0 l 1 2 l e where x is a variable vector ω is a feasible solution space f 1 x f 2 x f λ x denote real valued objective functions and l i and l e indicate the number of inequality constraints and equality constraints respectively for any two points x 1 and x 2 in ω x 1 is defined to dominate x 2 if the conditions in eq 24 are satisfied 24 x 1 dom x 2 i f i x 1 f i x 2 and j f j x 1 f j x 2 if no other solution dominates x 1 x 1 is called a pareto optimal solution the boundary consisting of the set of pareto optimal solutions is called a trade off surface or a pareto front due to the competitiveness and incommensurability of the two objectives shown in eqs 15 and 16 the modified version of nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 is adopted in this study to solve the optimization model introduced in section 2 4 which is one of the most efficient and commonly used evolutionary algorithms with simplicity effectiveness and consideration of the objective competitiveness niu et al 2017 the initial population composed of individuals represented in eq 17 is generated randomly within the feasible domain in eq 22 the fitness of each individual i e the objective function values defined in eqs 15 and 16 are then calculated according to the quantitative relation described in eqs 18 20 and the ecological scoring method described from eqs 1 14 after a feasibility evaluation according to eq 21 the feasible individuals are sorted to form multiple pareto fronts with different ranks based on the dominant level determined by the fitness as defined in eq 24 the procedure described above is iterated until all the individuals are sorted for the last pareto front those individuals in scarcely populated areas are selected to fill up the population to maintain its diversity which is measured by crowding distance d w as defined in eq 25 deb et al 2002 25 d w o 1 λ f w o 1 f w o 1 f w o m a x f w o m i n where f w o is the o th objective value of the w th individual and f w o m a x and f w o m i n are the maximum and minimum for the o th objective respectively selection is carried out so that those individuals with better performance have large survival probabilities the selection criteria are as follows individuals with higher front ranks are preferred for those with the same pareto front level the individuals with larger crowding distances are selected simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation operations are then employed for those selected individuals to generate offspring populations an elite strategy is adopted to maintain superior parent individuals in the offspring population the new parent population is configured by adding elite individuals from the parent and offspring population based on the domination levels and crowding distances a schematic of the proposed optimization methodology is given in fig 2 3 results 3 1 study area yangqu hydropower station located on the upper reaches of the yellow river is still in the demonstration stage it is about 100 km away from the longyangxia reservoir downstream as shown in fig 3 the yangqu project is a diurnal regulating reservoir with regulation storage of 239 106 m3 the hydropower station has an installed capacity of 1200 mw with annual power generation of about 4 746 109 kwh influences on the fish habitats caused by the new reservoir are the primary consideration in the demonstration of the yangqu hydropower station the upper reaches of the yellow river are in arid and semi arid regions with fragile ecological environments many aquatic species are so rare that they must be protected the protected fish in the yangqu river section mainly lay eggs in the yehuxia spawning ground located downstream of the yangqu project and in the backwater zone of the longyangxia reservoir as shown in fig 3 these fish adapt better to riptide environments and will be greatly affected by the operation of the yangqu project the yehuxia spawning ground with a riffle area and slow flow during fish spawning season is thus selected as the key ecological consideration of the reservoir operation the protected fish in the yangqu river mainly include chuanchia labiosa platypharodon extremus gymnocypris eckloni schizopygopsis pylzovi triplophysa siluroides gymnodiptychus pachycheilus and acanthogobio guentheri only gymnodiptychus pachycheilus lay eggs against the stream after the ice melts in april the spawning season for the rest of the fish is concentrated in may to june most of the protected fish listed above are cold water fish producing adhesive and demersal eggs the flow regime plays an important role in the maintenance of fish spawning ground long term observations indicate that fish spawning requires not only a flow pulse but also a continuous rising process and there must be sufficient flow peaks besides fish spawning grounds are mostly slow flowing water areas with pebble and gravel bottoms i e there are also requirements for flow velocity and water depth which can be reflected by the flow in addition to the dynamic characteristics of the flow the appropriate water temperature is also an indispensable condition for the survival and hatching of fish eggs it can be seen from the analysis above that by using the yehuxia spawning ground as the protection target the key ecological needs for the hydro environment mainly include the 1 flow regime as the fish gonad development requires stimulus from the flow rising process 2 water depth as the hatchings of the adhesive and demersal eggs require a gentle shallow flow with small variations in amplitude and 3 water temperature as the appropriate temperature for fish spawning and egg hatching in the target spawning ground is about 14 15 c under the conditions of gentle shallow flow the area has sufficient sunshine during the spawning season to meet the water temperature demand therefore the protection of the spawning ground can be realized by control of the reservoir release upstream taking into account the ecological requirement of fish spawning downstream and economic profit simultaneously this study tries to determine whether it is possible to increase the power generation during the spawning season while protecting fish spawning another motivation lies in the fact that the natural streamflow especially during dry years may not benefit fish spawning when the reservoir can conduct ecological compensation to the riverine ecosystem in arid and semi arid areas the historical inflow data into the longyangxia reservoir from the years 2010 to 2015 are used to analyze the natural flow characteristics for the yehuxia spawning ground 3 2 characteristic parameters of the ecological fluctuation a frequency analysis according to a a type iii pearson p iii distribution is carried out to determine the hydrological classification of each year and the statistical parameters and design values of each frequency determined by the frequency analysis are used as the criteria for the classification of hydrological years including the sample mean ex 619 18 m3 s variation coefficient cv 0 26 and skewness coefficient cs 1 43 after the distribution is determined with the calibrated parameters different hydrological years can be classified according to the national standard of china gb t50095 98 i e the years with the frequency p 37 5 62 5 are the normal years while those with p 37 5 or p 62 5 are wet years and dry years respectively based on the natural daily flow data of the yehuxia reach in fish spawning season april to june the historical natural water rising processes are identified whose characteristic indices are calculated and presented in table 1 the characteristic indices of the flow rising process during fish spawning season at the yehuxia spawning ground indicate that the number of rising processes throughout the entire spawning season is between 3 and 7 times with an average value of 5 2 times the average duration of each flow rising process is between 7 33 and 12 33 days with an average of 10 57 days the average flow rising ratio during a spawning season is between 0 97 and 1 48 with an average of 1 26 the daily average flow in the flow rising processes is between 685 m3 s and 810 m3 s with an average of 751 m3 s the average flow increment in a spawning season is between 276 m3 s and 451 m3 s with an average of 341 m3 s and the average growth rate is between 47 m3 s day and 63 m3 s day with an average of 54 m3 s day the daily flow rising process at the yehuxia spawning ground i e the outflow of the yangqu reservoir should be in accordance with the characteristic indices of the corresponding hydrological year as closely as possible that is the eco score defined in eq 14 should be maximized for ecological benefits as in eq 16 3 3 multi objective optimization results for the presented case only the spawning season lasting from april to june each year was studied therefore there are 91 decision variables taking one day as the time step for such a high multi dimensional decision variable a randomly generated initial population within a large range as shown in eq 22 will result in a large number of infeasible solutions li et al 2012 corresponding to emptying the reservoir or overtopping the dam and the population in the nsga ii simulation will be inundated with invalid individuals since the yangqu hydropower station is a daily regulation reservoir a certain fluctuation range is added to the inflow to form the solution domain in order to improve the efficiency of the nsga ii within this range as shown in eq 26 individuals are generated randomly and participate in the iteration 26 β 1 i t q t β 2 i t where two working conditions with β 1 β 2 10 and β 1 β 2 20 are adopted by referring to both the research of li et al 2012 and parameter calibration in this study respectively the two objectives shown in eqs 15 and 16 respectively representing economic and ecological benefits are evaluated for each individual after genetic operation and non dominated sorting the pareto front for the multi objective optimization model described from eqs 15 22 is presented in fig 4 and the corresponding operational schemes are presented in fig 5 the pareto front in the subgraphs in fig 4 are all non dominated solutions i e they cannot be compared with one another the reservoir operator needs to evaluate the power generation and the eco score of the reservoir release and select an operational scheme from the pareto front the current regulations of the yangqu hydropower station dictate that the yangqu reservoir will not store water from april to june every year and the power station will not carry out daily peak operations to maintain the stability of the backwater reach of the longyangxia reservoir in this study the flow process corresponding to the maximum power generation and the highest eco score are selected from all of the pareto optimal solutions under the two given conditions illustrated in eq 26 which are compared with the natural streamflow as shown in fig 5 the solutions in the pareto front cannot be compared i e for any two schemes in the front if the power generation of one scheme is larger than that of the other scheme its ecological score must be lower than that of the other the two schemes with the largest power generation and the highest ecological score in the pareto front are compared in table 2 table 3 shows the optimization potential of different targets according to the results in table 2 it can be seen that compared with the current ror regulation scheme even for the scheme with the highest ecological score the power generation will increase slightly after multi objective optimization although the percentage increment is relatively small the total amount of power generation during the entire spawning season from april to june can be increased by 2 5 million kwh in different years for the scheme with the largest amount of power generation it can be increased by more than 0 4 3 4 discussion 1 as there is no relevant report on the flow processes in this region the quantitative results about the flow rising process are only verified by interviews of some plateau ichthyologists see the acknowledgements section they confirm that 4 6 times of continuous flow rising processes are needed in the region according to their long term observations and each of these processes lasts for about 10 days other quantitative features of the flow rising process such as the rising rate and the flow rate cannot be identified by the ichthyologists these findings generally agree with ours which is essential for our knowledge of fish spawning stimulus from the perspective of the flow regime 2 it can be seen from the analysis for different hydrological years that although the average number of rising processes in wet years is larger than that in normal years followed by dry years the average duration of each flow rising process in different hydrological years is similar around 11 days another relatively stable regime index of the flow rising processes is the average growth rate of the rising processes in the spawning season which is around 50 m3 s day in different hydrological years 3 in the spawning season from april to june there exists a certain competitive relationship between the demand for fish spawning downstream and power generation i e part of the economic profit must be sacrificed to benefit the ecology as much as possible as shown in fig 4 as the total power generation increases the ecological score of the flow process will decrease it costs more power generation to get a higher ecological score in normal and wet years compared with dry years in general due to the limitation of the candidate discharge scheme in eq 26 the optimized reservoir release for the two cases seems similar in fig 5 it can be inferred that some small adjustment of the reservoir operation could result in a large benefit of ecological recovery with little cost to power generation 4 it is possible to increase the power generation of the yangqu hydropower station while taking into account the ecological demand by multi objective optimization table 3 indicates that even for the scheme with the highest ecological score the total amount of power generation during the spawning season can be increased by 2 5 million kwh 5 it can be seen from the comparison of flow processes with the largest power generation and the highest ecological score as well as the natural flow process in fig 5 that for both schemes with different optimal targets the flow processes fluctuate slightly around the original natural process the fluctuation range is within 20 and is basically 10 it does not significantly change the natural flow process so even if it utilizes the scheme with the maximum power generation during the period the fish spawning ground downstream will not be affected significantly it should be noted that the optimization results are directly related to the initial solution space in this study the decision variables in the optimization process are generated within the range of 10 β 1 β 2 10 and 20 β 1 β 2 20 of the natural discharge flow respectively as illustrated in eq 26 however for most years except 2011 and 2013 both of the optimum schemes with the highest ecological score and largest power generation appear under the condition of β 1 β 2 10 indicating that when the solution space increases the invalid solutions in the population increase when prematurity occurs for nsga ii i e there is a large number of infeasible solutions derived from the random generation in a large solution space and once there appears a feasible solution in the iteration the optimization converges to it without further improvement 4 conclusion an identification algorithm to identify the effective flow rising processes for fish spawning as well as the characteristic indices to quantitatively describe the processes is presented in this study based on these indices an ecological scoring method is established to evaluate the ecological benefits of the flow for fish spawning a multi objective optimization model is then proposed considering both the economic and ecological benefits of the hydropower station during fish spawning season which is solved by nsga ii the proposed methodology is applied to a large scale reservoir on the upper reaches of the yellow river in arid and semi arid areas yangqu hydropower station quantitative features of the flow rising process effective for fish spawning in this region are obtained for the first time which helps to protect the rare plateau fishes more importantly the analysis of the pareto front suggests that there is potential for the improvement of the reservoir operation for both fish protection and hydropower generation with knowledge of the flow regime needed for fish spawning this study is only a theoretical analysis based on historical data more observations on the relationships between fish spawning and reservoir operations need to be carried out to verify the findings of this study in the future the main limitation of the proposed methodology lies in the determination of the parameters α 1 α 2 and α 3 which needs some priori knowledge about the fish in the river and can be obtained by consulting ichthyologists
