25320,the purpose of this study is to improve the prediction accuracy of algal blooms in the nakdong river korea to support improved management practices to improve algal bloom predictions it is necessary to consider the microbiological characteristics of algal groups therefore korean governmental data including water quality flow rate and meteorological data over 12 years 2004 2015 were analyzed to characterize chlorophyll a chl a concentration dynamics in the nakdong river as the primary indicator of algae the correlation between water temperature and chl a concentration differed by region at the study site while a positive correlation r 0 63 was found in the relatively clean i e mesotrophic upstream area a negative correlation r 0 51 was found in the more eutrophic downstream area these results indicate that nutrients are a dominant factor of algal blooms in mesotrophic upstream areas but other factors may have greater impacts in eutrophic downstream areas moreover the dominance of different algal groups differed spatially and temporally at the study site the three dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality modeling capable environmental fluid dynamics code model was applied to represent the hydrodynamics and kinetics of water quality variables including chl a four statistics the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency me percentage model bias pbias and cost function cf were used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy against field observation data compared to the case in which only a single algal group was modeled modeling multiple algal groups together improved the r2 me pbias and cf values from 0 25 to 0 50 0 15 to 0 50 30 43 to 4 98 and 0 56 to 0 48 respectively the degree of improvement in the model prediction accuracy was greater for more eutrophic regions at the study site these results show that there should be greater focus on studying multiple algal groups together when modeling algal bloom predictions to support the development of alternative management practices keywords algal blooms efdc error analysis eutrophication nakdong river water quality modeling 1 introduction river systems have complex interactions and mass and energy are continually transferred among biological and abiotic components which confer resilience against environmental changes and can help restore ecosystems however the ecosystem balance cannot be maintained when pollutants generated by human activities are input in amounts beyond a river s self purification capability eutrophication involves the enrichment of water by nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p although eutrophication can be found in natural systems this process is accelerated by human activities paerl 2006 algal blooms resulting from eutrophication are a serious problem not only in terms of water quality but also ecosystem and human health andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 as the second largest river in the republic of korea the nakdong river experiences severe algal blooms on an annual basis due to elevated nutrient concentrations until 2012 chlorophyll a chl a concentrations in downstream areas of the river periodically surpassed 100 mg m3 although there have been continuous efforts to reduce pollutant inputs into the river algal blooms have persisted water quality models have been developed to predict the fate and impact of pollutants in rivers sharma and kansal 2013 most eutrophication models were developed after the 1960s when eutrophication was initially recognized as a problem xu et al 2002 in the mid 1960s and early 1970s several simple regression models that focused on the relationships between chl a concentration and other environmental factors were proposed and applied to rivers and lakes dillon and rigler 1974 1975 jones and bachmann 1976 sakamoto 1966 in the 1970s a simple nutrient budget model describing the relationships between the nutrient concentration in lakes and rivers and external or internal nutrient loading was developed imboden 1974 larsen et al 1974 vollenweider 1975 after the mid 1970s models developed rapidly achieving the capability of modeling most processes including physical chemical biological ecological and hydrodynamic processes canale et al 1976 chen and orlob 1975 scavia and park 1976 silow et al 1995 thomann et al 1975 virtanen et al 1986 in the 2000s eutrophication models became much more complex and capable of calculating solutions rapidly due to the advancements in computer hardware and software ambrose et al 2009 however the prediction accuracy of algal blooms remains uncertain and water authorities worldwide remain burdened by repeated occurrences therefore this paper aims to improve model prediction accuracy to help understand and develop effective management alternatives first intensive data analyses were performed to understand the relationship between water quality and related data with chl a dynamics at the study site based on these findings methods of improving algal bloom model prediction accuracy are suggested in this study the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model park et al 1995 one of the most complex hydrodynamics and water quality models was applied to the nakdong river korea which experiences repeated severe algal blooms annually 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data acquisition methods with a length of 525 km the nakdong river is the longest river in korea and its basin area is 23 384 km2 which is equivalent to approximately 20 of basin area in korea the nakdong river is a major water resource for the southeastern part of korea including busan and daegu the second and the third largest cities in korea respectively fig 1 shows the locations of the nakdong river in korea and its basin area all data in this study were obtained from korean governmental database systems including the water environment information system nier 2017 water resources management information system hrfco 2017 and korea meteorological administration kma 2017 fig 1 also shows the locations of the major monitoring stations for water level and water quality observations chl a was used as the primary indicator of algae occurrence and nutrient concentrations were analyzed at 16 water quality monitoring stations see fig 1 over a 12 year period 2004 2015 2 2 data analysis of factors affecting algal blooms the temporal and spatial dynamics of algal blooms and the correlation between related environmental factors were analyzed using the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r puth et al 2014 whitlock and schluter 2009 to analyze the power and significance level of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient a hypothesis test

wetlands and can also be used for one two or three dimensional modeling over the past two decades it has become one of the most widely used models and has been applied to many water bodies for environmental assessments and management huang et al 2017 jeong et al 2010 ji et al 2001 kim and park 2012 kuo et al 1996 moustafa and hamrick 2000 park et al 2005 shen et al 1999 2012 tetra tech inc 1999 wang et al 2013 xie et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 the efdc also has been used to simulate chl a to predict algal blooms and eutrophication in various aquatic systems albertson et al 2002 he et al

the model by park et al 1995 it solves mass balance equations for 21 state variables which include three algal groups blue green algae diatoms and green algae various components of carbon c n p and silica cycles dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform bacteria hamrick and wu 1997 tetra tech inc 2007b wu and xu 2011 2 4 model input development the computational domain setting is an important factor to minimize error in any numerical model the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method in the efdc model was used to develop 8400 horizontal grids with three vertical layers the average orthogonal deviation was 8 43 with a maximum value of 15 58 in general orthogonal deviation less than 25 is regarded as acceptable although it is desirable to be as small as possible the average courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1967 for the developed horizontal grid system was 0 37 with a maximum value of 0 54 the cfl number is often represented as less than unity as a stability criterion the grid system was selected using the trial and error method to keep the above two indices as small as possible korean governmental data see section 2 1 were used to construct input files for boundary conditions such as tributary contributions the initial parameters and constants for interactions among water quality variables were initially obtained from studies such as bowie et al 1985 and were further calibrated using the trial and error method the final calibrated parameters and constants are summarized in table 3 2 5 evaluation of model prediction accuracy model prediction accuracy is assessed by comparing differences in model predictions to field observations the following four statistics and rating levels were used to evaluate model accuracy as suggested by allen et al 2007 holt et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 ostojski et al 2016 see allen et al 2007 for a more detailed explanation of these statistics table 1 shows the performance rating of the four statistics for the model performance assessment the coefficient of determination r2 indicates the percentage of variability in data that can be accounted for by the model and can be expressed by squaring the equation of the pearson correlation coefficient r 2 n 1 n d n d n m n m n 2 n 1 n d n d n 2 n 1 n m n m n 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency me of a model variable is a measure of the ratio of the

deviation of the observation data 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorophyll a concentration dynamics in the nakdong river 3 1 1 algal bloom occurrence and nutrient dynamics fig 3 shows the changes in chl a and total p tp concentration and the n p ratio in the study area the annual mean tp concentration was highest at station wq8 located immediately downstream of the largest and most polluted tributary the geumho river which carries pollutants from daegu after wq8 tp concentrations recovered probably due to self purification processes such as settling or plant uptake redfield 1958 reported that the most significant nutrients for algal synthesis were c n and p and their average molecular ratio c n p was 106 16 1 mass ratio 50 7 1 in water in general an n p mass ratio above 17 is considered to indicate p limiting conditions and a ratio below 10 indicates n limiting conditions forsberg 1980 hellstrÃ¶m 1996 the n p ratios throughout the study area were over 20 fig 3 indicating that the entire river is under p limiting conditions dodds et al 1998 reported upper limits of tp concentrations of 0 05 mg l and 0 075 mg l for mesotrophic and eutrophic streams respectively accordingly the nakdong river can be considered as eutrophic from wq8 station downstream where the average tp concentration was greater than 0 2 mg l while the average tp concentration in the adjacent upper stream station wq7 was 0 073 mg l the correlation between p and chl a concentrations was higher in the mesotrophic area wq1 wq7 than in the eutrophic area wq8 wq16 based on the trophic classifications for streams suggested by dodds et al 1998 the correlation between tp and chl a concentrations was higher in the region upstream of wq8 but there was a weak correlation between the two variables in the downstream region of wq8 fig 3 these results indicate that nutrient influences on algal blooms are relatively large in the upper stretch of the nakdong river where nutrient levels are low the nutrient influence on algae growth becomes weaker in the middle and lower stream stretches where nutrient levels are higher than the critical concentration for algae growth station wq8 is located immediately downstream of the inflow of the geumho river which passes through daegu and carries large pollutant loads due to the high human and industrial activities in this basin the results presented in fig 3 confirm that the geumho river is the major pollutant source of the nakdong river 3 1 2 algal blooms and water temperature water temperature is an important factor that affects eutrophication chemical synthesis of algal cells and absorption of nutrients and carbon dioxide singh and singh 2015 yan et al 2016 the optimum growth temperature differs among algal groups and is generally high for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 fig 4 a shows the seasonal distribution of chl a averaged over 12 years between 2004 and 2015 in the study area higher chl a concentrations were observed in summer and fall in the upper and middle stretches while higher chl a concentrations were observed in spring and winter in the downstream area the chl a concentration distribution at each station showed different characteristics by temperature or season this indicates that different algal groups may dominate spatially in the river based on different temperature preferences fig 4b shows the relationship between chl a concentration and water temperature water temperature and chl a concentration showed a positive relationship at most of the upstream monitoring stations wq1 wq10 however the opposite was true at most downstream stations wq11 wq16 which showed a negative relationship meanwhile there was either a weak correlation or no correlation at stations wq7 wq14 the relationships between chl a concentration and water temperature were significant p 05 for all stations except wq10 and wq12 therefore it can be inferred that in the upstream region the occurrence of algae is high at higher water temperatures but in the downstream region the occurrence of algae is low at lower water temperatures this analysis confirms the existence of different algal groups spatially favoring different temperature conditions moreover the temperature dependency of algal growth could be grouped into similar zones z1 z2 and z3 based on nutrient condition fig 5 z1 wq1 wq7 represented relatively clean water in the upstream area with an annual average tp concentration of 0 075 mg l whereas z2 wq8 wq10 and z3 wq11 wq16 represented relatively more polluted water in the downstream stream area of the river dodds et al 1998 suggested a tp concentration of 0 075 mg l as a criterion to distinguish between mesotrophic and eutrophic streams whereas z1 and z2 showed positive relationships between the two variables z3 showed a negative relationship this indicates that the algal growth characteristics differ in different trophic regions and supports the fact that multiple algal groups should be considered when modeling algal blooms in the nakdong river 3 2 efdc model calibration 3 2 1 water level and temperature calibration the physical model behavior was calibrated for water levels at 11 stations fig 6 and water temperature at 16 stations using data from 2007 fig 7 shows the validation of the calibrated model using field data from 2008 the performance of the calibrations for both water level and water temperature were evaluated as very good for all statistical methods tables 1 and 3 3 2 2 water quality calibration calibration and verification was performed for water quality at 16 stations in the study area over two years 2007 2008 table 2 lists some of the important model parameters used in the efdc model calibrations water quality calibrations were performed for all water quality variables used in the efdc model including chl a dissolved oxygen p and n figs 8 and 9 show the calibration results for tp and chl a at the 16 stations in the study area table 3 summarizes the calibration accuracies of the water quality model using the four statistics described in the methods when the model performance was evaluated using r2 the dissolved oxygen tn dissolved inorganic n and tp calibrations were rated as good 0 50 r2 0 65 and the dissolved inorganic p and chl a results were satisfactory 0 20 r2 0 50 the p values for all variables were estimated to be statistically significant at the 95 level when me was used only the tp calibration was evaluated as good 0 5 me 0 75 and the calibrations of all other variables were rated as satisfactory 0 00 me 0 50 when pbias was used the chl a calibration was rated as good 25 pbias 40 whereas the other variables were evaluated as very good pbias 25 when cf was used all variables were evaluated as very good cf 1 while the calibration results of most variables were above the satisfactory level the chl a calibration performance was generally slightly lower 3 3 multiple algae modeling the algal growth characteristics appeared to differ spatially and temporally as well as by temperature and nutrient conditions generally cyanobacteria and green algae prefer higher temperatures and diatoms prefer lower temperatures canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 according to the data analysis in section 3 1 in highly eutrophic areas the relationships between chl a concentration and nutrients had lower correlations therefore three algal groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms were modeled to determine whether this approach could improve chl a modeling compared with modeling one algae group fig 9 although it was necessary to calibrate the growth related parameters of each algae group only chl a concentration data were available from the national governmental database for algae therefore literature values cerco and cole 1993 1994 nier 2003 2004 tetra tech inc 1999 2005 yi et al 2016 were used to obtain additional constants and coefficients table 2 the four statistical values r2 me pbias and cf were used to evaluate the model calibration accuracy the results of the analysis of the two cases using the efdc model are shown in fig 10 a where the black line indicates perfect calibration results the triangles are the model results when applying only one algae group and the stars show the results when applying three algae groups for chl a concentration the stars were closer to the black line than the triangles indicating that using multiple algae groups increased the model accuracy the statistical analysis results of the water quality variables chl a dissolved oxygen tn dissolved inorganic n tp and dissolved inorganic p for the two cases are shown in fig 10b table 4 compares the prediction accuracies of chl a concentrations for the single and multiple algae group cases and for different eutrophic regions based on tp concentration as discussed with regard to fig 5 the algal growth characteristics differed by nutrient condition the river was considered to be mesotrophic when tp concentrations were between 0 025 and 0 075 mg l and eutrophic when tp was greater than 0 075 mg l and all statistics r2 me pbias and cf showed improvements in the model prediction accuracies of chl a concentrations for more eutrophic regions table 4 these results indicate that it may be necessary to divide algal groups by eutrophication level as suggested by kim et al 2017 they also show that nutrients are a dominant factor of algae occurrence in the upper nakdong river which is mesotrophic but other factors besides nutrients may have a greater effect in the middle and lower nakdong river which is eutrophic algae occurrence is generally driven by nutrients paerl 2006 and different algae have different sensitivities to water temperature canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 the results in table 4 indicate that the effect of water temperature on the occurrence of algae seems to be greater in areas with higher eutrophication 4 conclusions algal blooms in surface water have caused many water problems worldwide including in the nakdong river korea water quality models are an effective tool to diagnose and predict water quality for the development of management alternatives however despite various attempts accurate prediction of algal blooms is difficult therefore this study aimed to improve algal bloom model prediction accuracy using chl a concentrations as a surrogate in the nakdong river chl a concentration dynamics responded differently to different temperature and nutrient conditions while chl a concentrations were highest in summer and fall in mesotrophic areas they were highest in winter and spring in eutrophic areas moreover negative relationships between chl a concentration and temperature were found in the downstream area whereas the opposite trend was found in the upper stretch of the river these results indicate that the dominance of algal groups differs temporally and spatially in the nakdong river the three dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality modeling capable efdc was applied to represent water quality variables including chl a the model accuracy was evaluated for hydrodynamics including water levels and temperature as well as for 21 water quality variables e g chl a organic matter and nutrients four statistics r2 me pbias and cf were used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy against field observation data compared to modeling a single algal group modeling multiple algal groups improved the r2 me pbias and cf values from 0 25 to 0 50 0 15 to 0 50 30 43 to 4 98 and 0 56 to 0 48 respectively moreover the degree of improvement in the prediction accuracy of the models evaluated by all four statistics was greater in more eutrophic regions of the river to improve algal bloom predictions it is necessary to consider the microbiological characteristics of algal groups the results of this study highlight the necessity of simultaneously considering multiple algal groups for algal bloom analyses at the study site improving the prediction accuracy of chl a modeling can help support the development of alternative water management practices acknowledgement this research was supported by the korean ministry of the environment project no re201305039

accordingly the nakdong river can be considered as eutrophic from wq8 station downstream where the average tp concentration was greater than 0 2 mg l while the average tp concentration in the adjacent upper stream station wq7 was 0 073 mg l the correlation between p and chl a concentrations was higher in the mesotrophic area wq1 wq7 than in the eutrophic area wq8 wq16 based on the trophic classifications for streams suggested by dodds et al 1998 the correlation between tp and chl a concentrations was higher in the region upstream of wq8 but there was a weak correlation between the two variables in the downstream region of wq8 fig 3 these results indicate that nutrient influences on algal blooms are relatively large in the upper stretch of the nakdong river where nutrient levels are low the nutrient influence on algae growth becomes weaker in the middle and lower stream stretches where nutrient levels are higher than the critical concentration for algae growth station wq8 is located immediately downstream of the inflow of the geumho river which passes through daegu and carries large pollutant loads due to the high human and industrial activities in this basin the results presented in fig 3 confirm that the geumho river is the major pollutant source of the nakdong river 3 1 2 algal blooms and water temperature water temperature is an important factor that affects eutrophication chemical synthesis of algal cells and absorption of nutrients and carbon dioxide singh and singh 2015 yan et al 2016 the optimum growth temperature differs among algal groups and is generally high for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 fig 4 a shows the seasonal distribution of chl a averaged over 12 years between 2004 and 2015 in the study area higher chl a concentrations were observed in summer and fall in the upper and middle stretches while higher chl a concentrations were observed in spring and winter in the downstream area the chl a concentration distribution at each station showed different characteristics by temperature or season this indicates that different algal groups may dominate spatially in the river based on different temperature preferences fig 4b shows the relationship between chl a concentration and water temperature water temperature and chl a concentration showed a positive relationship at most of the upstream monitoring stations wq1 wq10 however the opposite was true at most downstream stations wq11 wq16 which showed a negative relationship meanwhile there was either a weak correlation or no correlation at stations wq7 wq14 the relationships between chl a concentration and water temperature were significant p 05 for all stations except wq10 and wq12 therefore it can be inferred that in the upstream region the occurrence of algae is high at higher water temperatures but in the downstream region the occurrence of algae is low at lower water temperatures this analysis confirms the existence of different algal groups spatially favoring different temperature conditions moreover the temperature dependency of algal growth could be grouped into similar zones z1 z2 and z3 based on nutrient condition fig 5 z1 wq1 wq7 represented relatively clean water in the upstream area with an annual average tp concentration of 0 075 mg l whereas z2 wq8 wq10 and z3 wq11 wq16 represented relatively more polluted water in the downstream stream area of the river dodds et al 1998 suggested a tp concentration of 0 075 mg l as a criterion to distinguish between mesotrophic and eutrophic streams whereas z1 and z2 showed positive relationships between the two variables z3 showed a negative relationship this indicates that the algal growth characteristics differ in different trophic regions and supports the fact that multiple algal groups should be considered when modeling algal blooms in the nakdong river 3 2 efdc model calibration 3 2 1 water level and temperature calibration the physical model behavior was calibrated for water levels at 11 stations fig 6 and water temperature at 16 stations using data from 2007 fig 7 shows the validation of the calibrated model using field data from 2008 the performance of the calibrations for both water level and water temperature were evaluated as very good for all statistical methods tables 1 and 3 3 2 2 water quality calibration calibration and verification was performed for water quality at 16 stations in the study area over two years 2007 2008 table 2 lists some of the important model parameters used in the efdc model calibrations water quality calibrations were performed for all water quality variables used in the efdc model including chl a dissolved oxygen p and n figs 8 and 9 show the calibration results for tp and chl a at the 16 stations in the study area table 3 summarizes the calibration accuracies of the water quality model using the four statistics described in the methods when the model performance was evaluated using r2 the dissolved oxygen tn dissolved inorganic n and tp calibrations were rated as good 0 50 r2 0 65 and the dissolved inorganic p and chl a results were satisfactory 0 20 r2 0 50 the p values for all variables were estimated to be statistically significant at the 95 level when me was used only the tp calibration was evaluated as good 0 5 me 0 75 and the calibrations of all other variables were rated as satisfactory 0 00 me 0 50 when pbias was used the chl a calibration was rated as good 25 pbias 40 whereas the other variables were evaluated as very good pbias 25 when cf was used all variables were evaluated as very good cf 1 while the calibration results of most variables were above the satisfactory level the chl a calibration performance was generally slightly lower 3 3 multiple algae modeling the algal growth characteristics appeared to differ spatially and temporally as well as by temperature and nutrient conditions generally cyanobacteria and green algae prefer higher temperatures and diatoms prefer lower temperatures canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 according to the data analysis in section 3 1 in highly eutrophic areas the relationships between chl a concentration and nutrients had lower correlations therefore three algal groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms were modeled to determine whether this approach could improve chl a modeling compared with modeling one algae group fig 9 although it was necessary to calibrate the growth related parameters of each algae group only chl a concentration data were available from the national governmental database for algae therefore literature values cerco and cole 1993 1994 nier 2003 2004 tetra tech inc 1999 2005 yi et al 2016 were used to obtain additional constants and coefficients table 2 the four statistical values r2 me pbias and cf were used to evaluate the model calibration accuracy the results of the analysis of the two cases using the efdc model are shown in fig 10 a where the black line indicates perfect calibration results the triangles are the model results when applying only one algae group and the stars show the results when applying three algae groups for chl a concentration the stars were closer to the black line than the triangles indicating that using multiple algae groups increased the model accuracy the statistical analysis results of the water quality variables chl a dissolved oxygen tn dissolved inorganic n tp and dissolved inorganic p for the two cases are shown in fig 10b table 4 compares the prediction accuracies of chl a concentrations for the single and multiple algae group cases and for different eutrophic regions based on tp concentration as discussed with regard to fig 5 the algal growth characteristics differed by nutrient condition the river was considered to be mesotrophic when tp concentrations were between 0 025 and 0 075 mg l and eutrophic when tp was greater than 0 075 mg l and all statistics r2 me pbias and cf showed improvements in the model prediction accuracies of chl a concentrations for more eutrophic regions table 4 these results indicate that it may be necessary to divide algal groups by eutrophication level as suggested by kim et al 2017 they also show that nutrients are a dominant factor of algae occurrence in the upper nakdong river which is mesotrophic but other factors besides nutrients may have a greater effect in the middle and lower nakdong river which is eutrophic algae occurrence is generally driven by nutrients paerl 2006 and different algae have different sensitivities to water temperature canale and vogel 1974 robarts and zohary 1987 the results in table 4 indicate that the effect of water temperature on the occurrence of algae seems to be greater in areas with higher eutrophication 4 conclusions algal blooms in surface water have caused many water problems worldwide including in the nakdong river korea water quality models are an effective tool to diagnose and predict water quality for the development of management alternatives however despite various attempts accurate prediction of algal blooms is difficult therefore this study aimed to improve algal bloom model prediction accuracy using chl a concentrations as a surrogate in the nakdong river chl a concentration dynamics responded differently to different temperature and nutrient conditions while chl a concentrations were highest in summer and fall in mesotrophic areas they were highest in winter and spring in eutrophic areas moreover negative relationships between chl a concentration and temperature were found in the downstream area whereas the opposite trend was found in the upper stretch of the river these results indicate that the dominance of algal groups differs temporally and spatially in the nakdong river the three dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality modeling capable efdc was applied to represent water quality variables including chl a the model accuracy was evaluated for hydrodynamics including water levels and temperature as well as for 21 water quality variables e g chl a organic matter and nutrients four statistics r2 me pbias and cf were used to evaluate the model prediction accuracy against field observation data compared to modeling a single algal group modeling multiple algal groups improved the r2 me pbias and cf values from 0 25 to 0 50 0 15 to 0 50 30 43 to 4 98 and 0 56 to 0 48 respectively moreover the degree of improvement in the prediction accuracy of the models evaluated by all four statistics was greater in more eutrophic regions of the river to improve algal bloom predictions it is necessary to consider the microbiological characteristics of algal groups the results of this study highlight the necessity of simultaneously considering multiple algal groups for algal bloom analyses at the study site improving the prediction accuracy of chl a modeling can help support the development of alternative water management practices acknowledgement this research was supported by the korean ministry of the environment project no re201305039 
25321,in addition to the hypothetical trends proposed by kira and shidei 1967 odum 1969 and ryan et al 1997 2004 oshima et al 1958 observed a complicated age related change in stand leaf biomass in abies forests to explain this change in stand leaf biomass theoretically the age related change in leaf biomass was modeled based on the following three assumptions after canopy closure i the self thinning law ii expanded allometric scaling between the mean individual leaf mass and mean individual total mass and iii the formulation of a logistic function for stand density change the model successfully explained these three trends in forest stand leaf biomass and introduced expanded allometric scaling including the properties of the model based on simple allometric scaling proposed by ogawa 2017 therefore the model developed here can generalize age related changes in forest stand biomass better than the model proposed by ogawa 2017 keywords abies forests allometric scaling canopy closure hypothetical trends logistic function stand density 1 introduction contrasting the classical hypothesis of stand leaf biomass constancy proposed by kira and shidei 1967 and odum 1969 ryan et al 1997 2004 hypothesized that there was an age related decline in stand leaf biomass after forest canopy closure cf fig 1 these two hypotheses were based on observations of cryptomeria japonica plantations in japan ando et al 1968 fig 2 a and pinus sylvestris plantations in england ovington 1957 fig 2b as summarized by tadaki 1977 however no mathematical or theoretical models explain why leaf biomass should remain constant or decline after canopy closure recently ogawa 2008 demonstrated the theoretical constancy of stand leaf biomass after canopy closure for the first time by scaling up from the shoot level to the stand level based on assumptions such as the leaf mass number leafing intensity trade off at the shoot level kleiman and aarssen 2007 according to this model leaf biomass constancy is constrained by the following assumptions 1 the mean individual tree leaf mass is inversely proportional to the mean leafing intensity kleiman and aarssen 2007 2 crown depth is proportional to tree height and 3 leaf biomass is proportional to tree height considering ogawa s theory the constancy of leaf biomass depends on several assumptions and empirical confirmation is necessary to test which of these assumptions are valid following his study ogawa et al 2010 developed a hypothetical model of stand leaf biomass changes based on the effects of self thinning of a stand on the mean leaf mass of a tree in their analysis the mean leaf mass of a tree remains essentially constant and then increases because of space produced by self thinning within the stand the rapid increase in leaf mass of a tree is referred to as a growth shift hozumi 1985 1987 a growth shift occurs when a plant resumes more vigorous growth after the removal of inhibitory effects such as the reduction in light intensity caused by the growth of adjacent plants ogawa 2012 developed a mathematical model to describe how leaf biomass varies as a function of stand density using empirical data from permanent plot studies ogawa 2017 also derived the age related changes in leaf biomass of forest stands theoretically under the following three assumptions 1 the self thinning law yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 2 the allometric scaling relationship between the mean individual leaf mass and mean individual total mass ogawa and kira 1977 niklas 1994 and 3 the formulation of a logistic function for stand density change ogawa 2012 as a result ogawa 2017 proposed a functional model of the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass and found that the forest stand leaf biomass may decline or remain constant after canopy closure depending on the values of the model parameters according to ogawa s 2017 model the possibility of leaf biomass constancy in forest stands is low and stand leaf biomass declines after canopy closure however the model proposed by ogawa 2017 cannot be used to predict the pattern of age related changes in stand leaf biomass for a given forest stand because there are no methods for setting model parameters based on the current state of a forest stand due to a lack of observed data in addition the complicated age related change in stand leaf biomass in abies forests on mt shimagare japan oshima et al 1958 fig 2c has not yet been explained theoretically by constructing a reasonable mathematical model therefore this study delineated the domain of model application based on the above three assumptions which are rearranged herein our rearrangement of the assumptions clarifies the domain of model application proposed by ogawa 2017 and leads to a new realistic model of the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass under the assumption of the self thinning law yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 2 materials and methods 2 1 stand density data on stand density were obtained from studies of a cryptomeria japonica d don sugi plantation ogawa and hagihara

among the most important trees in the japanese forestry industry yato 1978 hayashi 1988 the c japonica field study was conducted in a permanent experimental plot 280 m2 established in a 23 year old stand located in the nagoya university experimental forest at inabu 35 11 n 137 33 e ca 55 km east of nagoya aichi prefecture central japan this plantation is located at an elevation of 960 m on an east facing slope with a 23 gradient two year old seedlings were planted in a geometrical pattern at an initial density of 6000 trees ha 1 no thinning was performed after planting annual counts of all live trees in the plot were conducted in october for 22 years from 1983 to 2004 the c obtusa field study by ogawa et al 1988 ogawa et al 2010 was conducted in an experimental plot 171 m2 within the grounds of the graduate school of bioagricultural sciences nagoya university japan 35 09 n 136 58 e this plot was 50 m above sea level each seedling was planted in a separate 1 1 m cell within a gridded array 190 seedlings in total all live trees in the plot were counted in june over 11 years from 1986 to 1996 beginning when the stand reached 3 years of age the c obtusa field study by sumida et al 2013 was conducted in a permanent experimental plot 191 m2 containing a 21 year old stand of trees the plot was located in the nagoya university experimental forest at inabu 35 12 n 137 33 e ca 55 km east of nagoya aichi prefecture central japan this plantation grew on a northwest facing slope with a 37 gradient the plot elevation was 970 m the 2 year old seedlings were planted geometrically at an initial planting density of 8000 ha 1 the plants were not thinned during the observation period all live trees in the plot were counted annually in december over 20 years 1977 1996 2 2 stem volume a monthly census was conducted of all c obtusa trees in the stand for 11 years beginning when the stand was 3 years old in 1986 and ending when the stand was 13 years old in 1996 ogawa et al 1988 ogawa et al 2010 from 1986 to 1988 when the stand was at the seedling stage the stem diameter at the crown base was measured from 1989 to 1996 stem girth was measured at the crown base to estimate stem volume each year from 1986 to 1988 seedling height h and stem diameter at 10 of seedling height d 0 1h were measured ogawa 1989 examined an allometric relationship involving stem volume v cm3 tree 1 and the seedling height times the square of stem diameter at 10 of seedling height d 0 1h 2 h mm3 for 254 destructively sampled hinoki cypress seedlings and found a strong relationship v 0 000528 d 0 1h 2 h 0 955 r 2 0 969 p 001 ogawa et al 2010 this relationship was used to estimate the stem volume of individual trees in addition from 1989 to 1996 stem height and stem girth at 50 cm intervals starting from the base of the stem were measured yokota et al 1994 yokota and hagihara 1995 yokota and hagihara 1996 yokota and hagihara 1998 adu bredu and hagihara 1996 adu bredu and hagihara 2003 adu bredu et al 1996a adu bredu et al 1996b adu bredu et al 1997a adu bredu et al 1997b adu bredu et al 1997c from the measurements stem volume was calculated using smalian s formula e g avery and burkhart 1994 with the tree top being regarded as a cone 2 3 stand leaf biomass according to pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964a shinozaki et al 1964b the leaf mass of individual trees is proportional to the stem cross sectional area at the crown base in any stand regardless of age or habitat this relationship was confirmed by ogawa et al 2010 and ogawa 2015 r 2 0 71 p 001 therefore we used the stem cross sectional area at the crown base to determine the time course of leaf biomass changes we measured the stem diameters of c obtusa seedlings 3 5 years old and the crown base stem circumferences of trees that were 4 13 years old 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 ogawa s 2017 case assumption 1 stand density model according to hozumi 1973 the changes in stand density Ï with stand age t in a forest undergoing self thinning are generally expressed by a logistic model based on shinozaki s 1962 logistic theory of plant growth considering the theoretical background on stand density ogawa 2012 2017 used observational data from three different coniferous plantations to show that the changes in stand density Ï t with stand age t in a forest undergoing self thinning can be described by the following logistic equation fig 3 1 Ï t Ï 0 1 m e Î± t where t represents tree age and Ï0 m and Î± are positive coefficients table 1 here we use eq 1 to simulate the changes in stand density with stand age assumption 2 self thinning model following the first study of the relationship between stand density and average tree size stem diameter at breast height by reineke 1933 the relationship between mean tree mass w t and stand density Ï t complies with the self thinning law 2 w t k Ï t Î² where k and Î² are positive coefficients and t is stand age a geometrical analysis yoda et al 1963 and the dimensional rule miyanishi et al 1979 both assigned a value of 3 2 to the coefficient Î² while more recent estimates assigned a value of 4 3 to this coefficient based on a metabolic scaling model the west brown enquist theory west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 assumption 3 allometric scaling model the allometric relationship between mean leaf mass w l t and mean tree mass w t is described by the following equation 3 w l t gw t h where g and h are positive coefficients ogawa and kira 1977 niklas 1994 as stand leaf biomass y l t is defined as y l t wl t Ï t assumptions 2 and 3 predict the following relationship between y l t and stand density Ï t 4 y l t g k h Ï t 1 Î² h substituting eq 1 into eq 4 we obtain the following expression describing stand leaf biomass y l t as a function of stand age t 5 y l t g k h Ï 0 1 m e Î± t 1 Î² h 2 4 2 the present case in the model we develop here ogawa s 2017 third assumption was modified as the following expanded allometric scaling function ogawa and kira 1977 6 1 w l t 1 g w t h 1 w l if w l is infinitely large eq 6 becomes identical to eq 3 that is the latter equation eq 3 is included in the former eq 6 as a special case in addition as w t becomes sufficiently large in eq 6 w l t approaches the upper limit of w l by combining eqs 2 and 6 an equation for stand leaf biomass y l t can be derived as 7 y l t w l t Ï t g k h w l Ï t 1 Î² h g k h Ï t Î² h w l substituting eq 1 into eq 7 we obtain the following expression describing stand leaf biomass y l t as a function of stand age t 8 y l t g k h w l Ï 0 1 m e Î± t 1 Î² h g k h Ï 0 1 m e Î± t Î² h w l 2 4 3 non linear regression analysis the coefficients of the nonlinear equations Î± Ï0 and m in eqs 1 and 6 were determined using kaleidagraph ver 4 1 2 synergy software reading pa usa which is based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm press et al 1992 and an algorithm that measures the goodness of fit by the coefficient of determination r 2 3 results 3 1 growth stage combining the stand density eq 1 and self thinning eq 2 models leads to the following growth equation for mean tree mass w t 9 w t k Ï 0 Î² 1 m e Î± t Î² which indicates that the mean tree mass w t increases exponentially because coefficients Î± and Î² are positive since the stand biomass y t is defined as the product of w t and Ï t the function y t can be expressed as an exponential equation as follows 10 y t w t Ï t k Ï 0 1 Î² 1 m e Î± t Î² 1 where Î² 3 2 or 4 3 in the present study so that Î² 1 0 and then y t increases exponentially eqs 9 and 10 indicate that the domain of model application is restricted to the exponential growth stages or premature forest stands that is to those stands that have not yet reached their peak growth rate 3 2 application of an expanded allometric scaling relationship between leaf mass and tree mass kira and shidei 1967 found the relation in eq 6 between leaf mass and stem and branch mass in a cool temperate deciduous forest and ogawa and kira 1977 reported the same relationship between leaf mass and stem mass in a mixed evergreen forest since the tree mass is proportional to the stem volume white 1981 the stem mass is assumed to be proportional to the tree mass based on a dataset of the mean stem cross sectional area at the crown base and mean stem volume in a c obtusa plantation ogawa et al 2010 eq 6 is suitable for describing the expanded allometric scaling relationship between leaf mass and tree mass in a forest undergoing self thinning fig 4 the values of g h w l and r 2 in eq 6 are 30 91 cm2 dm 3 h 0 9685 26 39 cm2 and 0 9965 respectively 3 3 properties of the present model since the coefficients g k h and w l are constants in eqs 7 and 8 of the stand leaf biomass model both equations may be applied to three cases with different values of 1 Î²h Î²h 1 Î²h 1 or Î²h 1 according to the geometric yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 and metabolic scaling west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 theories the values of Î² eq 2 are 3 2 and 4 3 respectively consequently the values of h eq 3 are i h 2 3 or h 3 4 ii h 2 3 or h Â¾ or iii h 2 3 or h 3 4 respectively when Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 the stand leaf biomass y l t is essentially constant regardless of stand age t and then decreases with stand age t fig 5 a or b when Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 or Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 the value of y l t in eq 8 was simulated with Î²h as a parameter by fixing the values of gkh m Î± Ï0 and w l at 1 0 ha1 Î² h 0 0501 0 0823 yr 1 6491 ha 1 and 26 39 cm2 respectively fig 5a b here the values of m Î± and Ï0 correspond to the values determined for a c japonica plantation cf table 1 the stand leaf biomass y l t decreases monotonously with stand age t when Î²h 1 but shows complicated unrealistic changes with stand age t when Î²h 1 3 4 interpretation of the models the developmental stage of a forest in the present model is restricted to the time t t after full canopy closure when the self thinning rule eq 2 is operational fig 5 during the period before full canopy closure stand leaf biomass increases with stand age t because large areas of illuminated space are available in the model stand leaf biomass i remains constant and then decreases or ii decreases monotonously with stand age t after the forest closes fully although this model is related only to the development process after canopy closure future studies should focus on linking processes before and after the closure event a linked model would contribute to the development of predictions of the overall future dynamics of stand leaf biomass 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting the cases in the stand leaf biomass model in assumption 3 of the allometric scaling model eq 3 the leaf mass ratio w l t w t of an average tree increases with tree mass w t or tree age t when h 1 this trend in the leaf mass ratio is not biologically reasonable because trees commonly accumulate woody tissues in their trunks branches and roots as they age from this biological viewpoint ogawa 2017 suggested that the predicted increases in stand leaf biomass y l t with age t are not tenable therefore the increasing trend of stand leaf biomass y l t with age t observed in the model fig 5b is also considered untenable consequently the two alternative cases i decreasing y l t and ii constant and then decreasing y l t are considered to be more biologically reasonable case i fits the hypothetical trend proposed by ryan et al 1997 and case ii corresponds to the trend in abies forests observed by oshima et al 1958 although the hypothetical trend proposed by kira and shidei 1967 and odum 1969 is realized under the assumption of the simple allometric scaling model of eq 3 ogawa 2017 the leaf biomass constancy was rejected under the expanded allometric scaling model of eq 6 in the present analysis many studies have suggested that these coefficients of eq 2 or 3 are not stable even though west brown enquist imply that the scaling exponent is centered on 4 3 or 3 4 some examples of papers pretzsch 2006 ducey et al 2012 lines et al 2012 sileshi 2014 forrester et al 2017 with large empirical data sets showed these departures from west brown enquist 4 2 age related decline of stand leaf biomass eq 8 which is derived under the assumption of an expanded allometric scaling relationship of eq 7 is so complicated that the model deals with eq 7 to understand the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass y l t in eq 7 when w t becomes maximal or the time t progresses fully w l t approaches an upper limit of w l cf fig 2 thus the stand leaf biomass y l t can be expressed as 11 y l t w l Ï t w l Ï 0 1 m e Î± t eq 11 indicates that the stand leaf biomass y l t decreases exponentially as stand age increases the developmental stage of a forest in the model is restricted to the time after full canopy closure when the self thinning rule eq 2 is operational in this stage the domain of model application is restricted to the exponential growth stage or premature forest stands cf eq 10 therefore the decreasing y l t in the model results mainly from the property reflected in eq 11 during the period before full canopy closure stand leaf biomass increases with stand age t because large areas of illuminated space are available in the model stand leaf biomass decreases exponentially with stand age t after the forest closes fully as a result the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass y l t show a single peak during the entire development stage of forest stands 4 3 generality of the present leaf biomass model ogawa 2017 proposed a leaf biomass model in which stand leaf biomass decreases increases monotonously with stand age and then remains constant regardless of stand age after canopy closure the leaf biomass model given by eq 8 can cover all of the cases of age related changes in leaf biomass shown by ogawa 2017 in addition to the three cases proposed by ogawa 2017 the model revealed that another complicated leaf biomass change observed in abies forests oshima et al 1958 fig 2c can be explained mathematically by replacing the simple allometric scaling eq 3 with expanded allometric scaling eq 6 between the mean individual leaf mass and entire tree mass since the model based on a simple allometric scaling eq 3 proposed by ogawa 2017 cannot explain the leaf biomass changes in abies forests fig 2c the present model introduced expanded allometric scaling eq 6 and is considered to be useful for explaining age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass oshima et al 1958 also provided experimental evidence that with increasing tree age the dry mass of leaves on a standard tree increased and reached a maximum in mature trees this trend in individual leaf mass corresponds to the trend in expanded allometric scaling eq 6 between the mean individual leaf mass and entire tree mass as a result the model that introduced expanded allometric scaling includes the properties of the model based on the simple allometric scaling proposed by ogawa 2017 therefore the model developed here has generality for expressing age related changes in forest stand biomass unlike the model proposed by ogawa 2017 acknowledgements i thank the staff of the nagoya regional forest office and the midorigaoka nursery attached to the gifu

25321,in addition to the hypothetical trends proposed by kira and shidei 1967 odum 1969 and ryan et al 1997 2004 oshima et al 1958 observed a complicated age related change in stand leaf biomass in

leaf biomass should remain constant or decline after canopy closure recently ogawa 2008 demonstrated the theoretical constancy of stand leaf biomass after canopy closure for the first time by scaling up from the shoot level to the stand level based on assumptions such as the leaf mass number leafing intensity trade off at the shoot level kleiman and aarssen 2007 according to this model leaf biomass constancy is constrained by the following assumptions 1 the mean individual tree leaf mass is inversely proportional to the mean leafing intensity kleiman and aarssen 2007 2 crown depth is proportional to tree height and 3 leaf biomass is proportional to tree height considering ogawa s theory the constancy of leaf biomass depends on several assumptions and empirical confirmation is necessary to test which of these assumptions are valid following his study ogawa et al 2010 developed a hypothetical model of stand leaf biomass changes based on the effects of self thinning of a stand on the mean leaf mass of a tree in their analysis the mean leaf mass of a tree remains essentially constant and then increases because of space produced by self thinning within the stand the rapid increase in leaf mass of a tree is referred to as a growth shift hozumi 1985 1987 a growth shift occurs when a plant resumes more vigorous growth after the removal of inhibitory effects such as the reduction in light intensity caused by the growth of adjacent plants ogawa 2012 developed a mathematical model to describe how leaf biomass varies as a function of stand density using empirical data from permanent plot studies ogawa 2017 also derived the age related changes in leaf biomass of forest stands theoretically under the following three assumptions 1 the self thinning law yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 2 the allometric scaling relationship between the mean individual leaf mass and mean individual total mass ogawa and kira 1977 niklas 1994 and 3 the formulation of a logistic function for stand density change ogawa 2012 as a result ogawa 2017 proposed a functional model of the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass and found that the forest stand leaf biomass may decline or remain constant after canopy closure depending on the values of the model parameters according to ogawa s 2017 model the possibility of leaf biomass constancy in forest stands is low and stand leaf biomass declines after canopy closure however the model proposed by ogawa 2017 cannot be used to predict the pattern of age related changes in stand leaf biomass for a given forest stand because there are no methods for setting model parameters based on the current state of a forest stand due to a lack of observed data in addition the complicated age related change in stand leaf biomass in abies forests on mt shimagare japan oshima et al 1958 fig 2c has not yet been explained theoretically by constructing a reasonable mathematical model therefore this study delineated the domain of model application based on the above three assumptions which are rearranged herein our rearrangement of the assumptions clarifies the domain of model application proposed by ogawa 2017 and leads to a new realistic model of the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass under the assumption of the self thinning law yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 2 materials and methods 2 1 stand density data on stand density were obtained from studies of a cryptomeria japonica d don sugi plantation ogawa and hagihara 2003 ogawa and hagihara 2004 ogawa 2005 ogawa 2007 and two chamaecyparis obtusa sieb et zucc endl hinoki cypress plantations ogawa et al 1988 ogawa et al 2010 sumida et al 2013 the two species are among the most important trees in the japanese forestry industry yato 1978 hayashi 1988 the c japonica field study was conducted in a permanent experimental plot 280 m2 established in a 23 year old stand located in the nagoya university experimental forest at inabu 35 11 n 137 33 e ca 55 km east of nagoya aichi prefecture central japan this plantation is located at an elevation of 960 m on an east facing slope with a 23 gradient two year old seedlings were planted in a geometrical pattern at an initial density of 6000 trees ha 1 no thinning was performed after planting annual counts of all live trees in the plot were conducted in october for 22 years from 1983 to 2004 the c obtusa field study by ogawa et al 1988 ogawa et al 2010 was conducted in an experimental plot 171 m2 within the grounds of the graduate school of bioagricultural sciences nagoya university japan 35 09 n 136 58 e this plot was 50 m above sea level each seedling was planted in a separate 1 1 m cell within a gridded array 190 seedlings in total all live trees in the plot were counted in june over 11 years from 1986 to 1996 beginning when the stand reached 3 years of age the c obtusa field study by sumida et al 2013 was conducted in a permanent experimental plot 191 m2 containing a 21 year old stand of trees the plot was located in the nagoya university experimental forest at inabu 35 12 n 137 33 e ca 55 km east of nagoya aichi prefecture central japan this plantation grew on a northwest facing slope with a 37 gradient the plot elevation was 970 m the 2 year old seedlings were planted geometrically at an initial planting density of 8000 ha 1 the plants were not thinned during the observation period all live trees in the plot were counted annually in december over 20 years 1977 1996 2 2 stem volume a monthly census was conducted of all c obtusa trees in the stand for 11 years beginning when the stand was 3 years old in 1986 and ending when the stand was 13 years old in 1996 ogawa et al 1988 ogawa et al 2010 from 1986 to 1988 when the stand was at the seedling stage the stem diameter at the crown base was measured from 1989 to 1996 stem girth was measured at the crown base to estimate stem volume each year from 1986 to 1988 seedling height h and stem diameter at 10 of seedling height d 0 1h were measured ogawa 1989 examined an allometric relationship involving stem volume v cm3 tree 1 and the seedling height times the square of stem diameter at 10 of seedling height d 0 1h 2 h mm3 for 254 destructively sampled hinoki cypress seedlings and found a strong relationship v 0 000528 d 0 1h 2 h 0 955 r 2 0 969 p 001 ogawa et al 2010 this relationship was used to estimate the stem volume of individual trees in addition from 1989 to 1996 stem height and stem girth at 50 cm intervals starting from the base of the stem were measured yokota et al 1994 yokota and hagihara 1995 yokota and hagihara 1996 yokota and hagihara 1998 adu bredu and hagihara 1996 adu bredu and hagihara 2003 adu bredu et al 1996a adu bredu et al 1996b adu bredu et al 1997a adu bredu et al 1997b adu bredu et al 1997c from the measurements stem volume was calculated using smalian s formula e g avery and burkhart 1994 with the tree top being regarded as a cone 2 3 stand leaf biomass according to pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964a shinozaki et al 1964b the leaf mass of individual trees is proportional to the stem cross sectional area at the crown base in any stand regardless of age or habitat this relationship was confirmed by ogawa et al 2010 and ogawa 2015 r 2 0 71 p 001 therefore we used the stem cross sectional area at the crown base to determine the time course of leaf biomass changes we measured the stem diameters of c obtusa seedlings 3 5 years old and the crown base stem circumferences of trees that were 4 13 years old 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 ogawa s 2017 case assumption 1 stand density model according to hozumi 1973 the changes in stand density Ï with stand age t in a forest undergoing self thinning are generally expressed by a logistic model based on shinozaki s 1962 logistic theory of plant growth considering the theoretical background on stand density ogawa 2012 2017 used observational data from three different coniferous plantations to show that the changes in stand density Ï t with stand age t in a forest undergoing self thinning can be described by the following logistic equation fig 3 1 Ï t Ï 0 1 m e Î± t where t represents tree age and Ï0 m and Î± are positive coefficients table 1 here we use eq 1 to simulate the changes in stand density with stand age assumption 2 self thinning model following the first study of the relationship between stand density and average tree size stem diameter at breast height by reineke 1933 the relationship between mean tree mass w t and stand density Ï t complies with the self thinning law 2 w t k Ï t Î² where k and Î² are positive coefficients and t is stand age a geometrical analysis yoda et al 1963 and the dimensional rule miyanishi et al 1979 both assigned a value of 3 2 to the coefficient Î² while more recent estimates assigned a value of 4 3 to this coefficient based on a metabolic scaling model the west brown enquist theory west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 assumption 3 allometric scaling model the allometric relationship between mean leaf mass w l t and mean tree mass w t is described by the following equation 3 w l t gw t h where g and h are positive coefficients ogawa and kira 1977 niklas 1994 as stand leaf biomass y l t is defined as y l t wl t Ï t assumptions 2 and 3 predict the following relationship between y l t and stand density Ï t 4 y l t g k h Ï t 1 Î² h substituting eq 1 into eq 4 we obtain the following expression describing stand leaf biomass y l t as a function of stand age t 5 y l t g k h Ï 0 1 m e Î± t 1 Î² h 2 4 2 the present case in the model we develop here ogawa s 2017 third assumption was modified as the following expanded allometric scaling function ogawa and kira 1977 6 1 w l t 1 g w t h 1 w l if w l is infinitely large eq 6 becomes identical to eq 3 that is the latter equation eq 3 is included in the former eq 6 as a special case in addition as w t becomes sufficiently large in eq 6 w l t approaches the upper limit of w l by combining eqs 2 and 6 an equation for stand leaf biomass y l t can be derived as 7 y l t w l t Ï t g k h w l Ï t 1 Î² h g k h Ï t Î² h w l substituting eq 1 into eq 7 we obtain the following expression describing stand leaf biomass y l t as a function of stand age t 8 y l t g k h w l Ï 0 1 m e Î± t 1 Î² h g k h Ï 0 1 m e Î± t Î² h w l 2 4 3 non linear regression analysis the coefficients of the nonlinear equations Î± Ï0 and m in eqs 1 and 6 were determined using kaleidagraph ver 4 1 2 synergy software reading pa usa which is based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm press et al 1992 and an algorithm that measures the goodness of fit by the coefficient of determination r 2 3 results 3 1 growth stage combining the stand density eq 1 and self thinning eq 2 models leads to the following growth equation for mean tree mass w t 9 w t k Ï 0 Î² 1 m e Î± t Î² which indicates that the mean tree mass w t increases exponentially because coefficients Î± and Î² are positive since the stand biomass y t is defined as the product of w t and Ï t the function y t can be expressed as an exponential equation as follows 10 y t w t Ï t k Ï 0 1 Î² 1 m e Î± t Î² 1 where Î² 3 2 or 4 3 in the present study so that Î² 1 0 and then y t increases exponentially eqs 9 and 10 indicate that the domain of model application is restricted to the exponential growth stages or premature forest stands that is to those stands that have not yet reached their peak growth rate 3 2 application of an expanded allometric scaling relationship between leaf mass and tree mass kira and shidei 1967 found the relation in eq 6 between leaf mass and stem and branch mass in a cool temperate deciduous forest and ogawa and kira 1977 reported the same relationship between leaf mass and stem mass in a mixed evergreen forest since the tree mass is proportional to the stem volume white 1981 the stem mass is assumed to be proportional to the tree mass based on a dataset of the mean stem cross sectional area at the crown base and mean stem volume in a c obtusa plantation ogawa et al 2010 eq 6 is suitable for describing the expanded allometric scaling relationship between leaf mass and tree mass in a forest undergoing self thinning fig 4 the values of g h w l and r 2 in eq 6 are 30 91 cm2 dm 3 h 0 9685 26 39 cm2 and 0 9965 respectively 3 3 properties of the present model since the coefficients g k h and w l are constants in eqs 7 and 8 of the stand leaf biomass model both equations may be applied to three cases with different values of 1 Î²h Î²h 1 Î²h 1 or Î²h 1 according to the geometric yoda et al 1963 miyanishi et al 1979 and metabolic scaling west et al 1997 enquist et al 1998 theories the values of Î² eq 2 are 3 2 and 4 3 respectively consequently the values of h eq 3 are i h 2 3 or h 3 4 ii h 2 3 or h Â¾ or iii h 2 3 or h 3 4 respectively when Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 the stand leaf biomass y l t is essentially constant regardless of stand age t and then decreases with stand age t fig 5 a or b when Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 or Î²h 1 Î² 3 2 h 2 3 or Î² 4 3 h 3 4 the value of y l t in eq 8 was simulated with Î²h as a parameter by fixing the values of gkh m Î± Ï0 and w l at 1 0 ha1 Î² h 0 0501 0 0823 yr 1 6491 ha 1 and 26 39 cm2 respectively fig 5a b here the values of m Î± and Ï0 correspond to the values determined for a c japonica plantation cf table 1 the stand leaf biomass y l t decreases monotonously with stand age t when Î²h 1 but shows complicated unrealistic changes with stand age t when Î²h 1 3 4 interpretation of the models the developmental stage of a forest in the present model is restricted to the time t t after full canopy closure when the self thinning rule eq 2 is operational fig 5 during the period before full canopy closure stand leaf biomass increases with stand age t because large areas of illuminated space are available in the model stand leaf biomass i remains constant and then decreases or ii decreases monotonously with stand age t after the forest closes fully although this model is related only to the development process after canopy closure future studies should focus on linking processes before and after the closure event a linked model would contribute to the development of predictions of the overall future dynamics of stand leaf biomass 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting the cases in the stand leaf biomass model in assumption 3 of the allometric scaling model eq 3 the leaf mass ratio w l t w t of an average tree increases with tree mass w t or tree age t when h 1 this trend in the leaf mass ratio is not biologically reasonable because trees commonly accumulate woody tissues in their trunks branches and roots as they age from this biological viewpoint ogawa 2017 suggested that the predicted increases in stand leaf biomass y l t with age t are not tenable therefore the increasing trend of stand leaf biomass y l t with age t observed in the model fig 5b is also considered untenable consequently the two alternative cases i decreasing y l t and ii constant and then decreasing y l t are considered to be more biologically reasonable case i fits the hypothetical trend proposed by ryan et al 1997 and case ii corresponds to the trend in abies forests observed by oshima et al 1958 although the hypothetical trend proposed by kira and shidei 1967 and odum 1969 is realized under the assumption of the simple allometric scaling model of eq 3 ogawa 2017 the leaf biomass constancy was rejected under the expanded allometric scaling model of eq 6 in the present analysis many studies have suggested that these coefficients of eq 2 or 3 are not stable even though west brown enquist imply that the scaling exponent is centered on 4 3 or 3 4 some examples of papers pretzsch 2006 ducey et al 2012 lines et al 2012 sileshi 2014 forrester et al 2017 with large empirical data sets showed these departures from west brown enquist 4 2 age related decline of stand leaf biomass eq 8 which is derived under the assumption of an expanded allometric scaling relationship of eq 7 is so complicated that the model deals with eq 7 to understand the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass y l t in eq 7 when w t becomes maximal or the time t progresses fully w l t approaches an upper limit of w l cf fig 2 thus the stand leaf biomass y l t can be expressed as 11 y l t w l Ï t w l Ï 0 1 m e Î± t eq 11 indicates that the stand leaf biomass y l t decreases exponentially as stand age increases the developmental stage of a forest in the model is restricted to the time after full canopy closure when the self thinning rule eq 2 is operational in this stage the domain of model application is restricted to the exponential growth stage or premature forest stands cf eq 10 therefore the decreasing y l t in the model results mainly from the property reflected in eq 11 during the period before full canopy closure stand leaf biomass increases with stand age t because large areas of illuminated space are available in the model stand leaf biomass decreases exponentially with stand age t after the forest closes fully as a result the age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass y l t show a single peak during the entire development stage of forest stands 4 3 generality of the present leaf biomass model ogawa 2017 proposed a leaf biomass model in which stand leaf biomass decreases increases monotonously with stand age and then remains constant regardless of stand age after canopy closure the leaf biomass model given by eq 8 can cover all of the cases of age related changes in leaf biomass shown by ogawa 2017 in addition to the three cases proposed by ogawa 2017 the model revealed that another complicated leaf biomass change observed in abies forests oshima et al 1958 fig 2c can be explained mathematically by replacing the simple allometric scaling eq 3 with expanded allometric scaling eq 6 between the mean individual leaf mass and entire tree mass since the model based on a simple allometric scaling eq 3 proposed by ogawa 2017 cannot explain the leaf biomass changes in abies forests fig 2c the present model introduced expanded allometric scaling eq 6 and is considered to be useful for explaining age related changes in forest stand leaf biomass oshima et al 1958 also provided experimental evidence that with increasing tree age the dry mass of leaves on a standard tree increased and reached a maximum in mature trees this trend in individual leaf mass corresponds to the trend in expanded allometric scaling eq 6 between the mean individual leaf mass and entire tree mass as a result the model that introduced expanded allometric scaling includes the properties of the model based on the simple allometric scaling proposed by ogawa 2017 therefore the model developed here has generality for expressing age related changes in forest stand biomass unlike the model proposed by ogawa 2017 acknowledgements i thank the staff of the nagoya regional forest office and the midorigaoka nursery attached to the gifu

25322,a number of ecologically and economically important species in the southern benguela including the forage fish sardine sardinops sagax and anchovy engraulis encrasicolus have undergone southward eastward shifts in their distribution in the 1990s early 2000s in addition to the effects of changes in prey availability to top predators the spatially distinct nature of the system means the location of a stock has implications for its productivity the spatial dynamics of small pelagic fish are of particular importance because they are thought to exert wasp waisted trophic control on the system an objective driven frame based model was constructed to investigate the ability of the approach to represent spatial and population dynamics of sardine and anchovy and to explore the implications of possible management strategies climate variability and fishing pressure were assumed as drivers sensitivity analyses were performed and a number of scenarios tested a frame based approach appears to be useful within this context results suggest that the productivity of the sardine resource within the model is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of fishing pressure the role of anchovy within the model system has not yet been fully developed increasing our understanding of the relative suitability of environmental conditions of different regions is also important if we are to increase our capacity to predict trends in abundance and distribution this study shows support for continued careful consideration of spatialized management approaches to the south african sardine fishery keywords ecosystem approach frame based modelling small pelagic fish distributional shift fisheries management 1 introduction the southern benguela fig 1 comprises two of the four subsystems of the benguela current large marine ecosystem bclme hutchings et al 2009 the west coast characterised by seasonal wind driven upwelling and the south coast with characteristics of both a shelf system and an upwelling system hutchings et al 2009 shannon 1985 1 1 biology as in most eastern boundary current systems small pelagic fish in the southern benguela play an important role in ecosystem function acting as a trophic stepping stone between plankton and higher trophic level species such as predatory fish and seabirds a system operating under this model of trophic function is described as wasp waisted with small pelagic fish exerting both top down control on zooplankton populations as well as bottom up influence on predatory groups the southern benguela is thought to operate in this manner cury et al 2000 and the structure was generally supported when modelled data were fitted to observed data time series shannon et al 2008 sardine and anchovy have also formed the bulk of south africa s commercially valuable purse seine fishery since the 1940s crawford et al 1987 fairweather et al 2006 their ecological and commercial importance make the dynamics of sardine and anchovy populations of particular interest from an ecosystem research and fisheries management perspective historically both research and management have focused on a target resource oriented two species approach but more recently with the increasing emphasis on the application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management more importance is being placed on better understanding the role of sardine and anchovy within the system as a whole sardine and anchovy populations around the world have been observed as highly variable on an interannual and decadal scale with decadal scale dominance shifts between the two species schwartzlose et al 1999 cury and shannon 2004 this holds true for populations of sardine and anchovy in the southern benguela where one species has been dominant for a period on a decadal scale followed by a change in the community structure and dominance of the other species the southern benguela has also seen a period of high abundance of both species during the early 2000s as a consequence of an ecosystem regime shift blamey et al 2012 howard et al 2007 recent decades have seen the concept of regime shifts in marine systems become a more common approach to describing long term changes at an ecosystem level de young et al 2004 here we are defining a regime shift as a sudden change from one quantifiable state to another occurring at a large spatial scale de young et al 2004 jarre et al 2006 shifts in a number of physical and biological time series for the southern benguela have been detected in the late 1990s early 2000s roy et al 2007 howard et al 2007 blamey et al 2012 atkinson et al 2012 including in the distribution of sardine and anchovy since the late 1990s the majority of small pelagic fish spawner biomass has been found east of cape agulhas south coast fig 1 whereas historically biomass was located largely on the west coast illustrated in fig 2 van der lingen et al 2005 2002 this has had serious implications for both the management of the fishery and the structure and function of the ecosystem itself e g coetzee et al 2008 crawford et al 2008a jarre et al 2013 sherley et al 2013 watermeyer et al 2016 the physical and biological differences between the west and south coasts mean that the location of a stock has implications for its productivity the west coast is characterised by high but episodic wind induced productivity the south coast has lower concentrations but more continuous availability of nutrients and a higher biomass of consumers predators as a result the population dynamics of small pelagic fish have been shown to be quite different on each coast with sardine recruitment poorer on the south coast van der lingen 2011 de moor and butterworth 2012 the mechanisms behind the distributional shifts in sardine and anchovy are not well understood fishing pressure and environmental shifts in combination with possible natal homing of those sardine spawned further east are thought to be the main drivers behind the changes in distribution coetzee et al 2008 cury 1994 coetzee et al 2008 outline the role that maintaining high fishing pressure on the west coast while the stock had shifted south and east may have played the sardine fishery is managed using an operational management procedure omp that until now has assumed a single stock and with no spatial structure consequently during the late 1990s and 2000s when the majority of biomass has been on the south coast fishing effort remained largely where it had been focused for the previous 50 years and where the majority of processing infrastructure had been developed on the west coast the resulting high fishing pressure exerted on the diminished biomass of sardine on the west coast may have contributed to the continued lower abundance as a result spatial management of the sardine fishery is now under consideration de moor et al 2014 2013 in the case of anchovy roy et al 2007 suggest links between changes in anchovy distribution and shifts in sst on the agulhas bank 1 2 modelling sardine and anchovy in the southern benguela given the levels of complexity and interdisciplinarity inherent in any attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf the use of models and indicators as means of increasing both our understanding of and our ability to communicate system functioning and status has become a vital and accepted practice garcia and staples 2000 degnbol and jarre 2004 starfield and jarre 2011 indicators have been and continue to be developed and used to evaluate various aspects of the southern benguela e g cury et al 2005 yemane et al 2008 shannon et al 2009 shin et al 2010 and these in turn can be used as inputs for various modelling techniques that allow for the distillation and clearer communication of findings to stakeholders and management alike mcgregor 2015 paterson et al 2007 shin and shannon 2010 modelling in the context of an eaf includes the full spectrum of modelling approaches available ranging in complexity from simple to very complex fulton et al 2003 have shown a humped relationship between the complexity and the effectiveness of ecosystem models recommending an array of minimum realistic models as most effective one approach that has been suggested as suitable for the modelling of long term ecosystem level change is frame based modelling fbm where possible stable system states and the shifts between them are modelled starfield et al 1993 fbm applies a minimum realistic approach with a particular objective in mind starfield and jarre 2011 this is similar to the models of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments mice approach described by plagÃ¡nyi et al 2014 where a model somewhere between the complexity of a single species model and an ecosystem model is developed to answer specific questions relating to management although without the complexity of some of the ecosystem models currently developed for the southern benguela shannon et al 2008 2003 shin et al 2004 the minimum realistic and mice modelling paradigms allow specific questions to be addressed with the minimum level of complexity and thus investment of resources necessary starfield et al 1993 a fbm approach starfield et al 1993 is suitable when dynamic ecosystem functioning can be divided into distinct states or frames as is the case for small pelagic fish globally and in the southern benguela cury and shannon 2004 howard et al 2007 schwartzlose et al 1999 where frames would represent the stable periods between shifts a simple model for each frame is constructed that represents only the processes relevant to the objective of the model only one frame is operational at any time and rules must be developed for when the model should switch to a different frame the approach lends itself to the technique of rapid prototyping which allows for the simplest possible model to be developed quickly at which point it can be tested and adapted or complexity added in the next iteration if necessary starfield and jarre 2011 this has the advantage of allowing results of testing and feedback on the current generation model to inform developments in the next version making the final version more useful than if it had been developed from scratch to a high level of complexity rapid prototyping also means that fully functional versions of the model are available at increasing levels of complexity allowing hypotheses to be addressed before the final version of the model has been reached which is of value for time sensitive projects staples 1997 as well as demonstrating effective use of limited funding previously the frame based approach has been used to model shifting vegetation patterns in terrestrial ecosystems rupp et al 2000 starfield et al 1993 but more recently it has also been applied to the southern benguela to explore regime shifts in the dominance patterns between sardine and anchovy smith and jarre 2011 in this model single stocks of anchovy and sardine that migrate around the coastline were assumed in line with current assessment practice and frames represented high or low population levels more recently however there has been investigation into whether sardine in the southern benguela are in fact made up of two stocks one on the west coast and one on the south coast east of cape agulhas with some mixing between them coetzee et al 2008 the possibility of a small third stock on the kzn south coast had also been hypothesised van der lingen et al 2010 differences in biological characteristics of sardine on the west and south coasts and a separation of distributions and spawning areas at medium to low biomass levels support the hypothesis of functionally although not genetically separate stocks de moor and butterworth 2011 van der lingen 2011 as a result a recommendation to explore the incorporation of a two stock approach into the management of the sardine fishery in south africa is currently being investigated de moor and butterworth 2013 2012 van der lingen 2011 unfortunately this approach is complicated by the need to model an unknown but high degree of mixing between the proposed stocks although studies using parasites as a means of estimating possible mixing are currently underway van der lingen et al 2013 van der lingen and hendricks 2014 this situation is difficult to model and current management retains the assumption of a single stock but a two stock with mixing component hypothesis is also being considered in ongoing development of a revised omp de moor 2017 an alternative approach as explored here could assume a single stock operating in different frames or regimes depending on location i e a west coast frame or a south coast frame where the majority of the biomass is located west or east of cape agulhas respectively the formulation of an additional regime shift between west and south coast modes should therefore allow for better representation of the system dynamics than the previous model version smith and jarre 2011 which simulated shifts between high and low population levels additionally the simple sardine population model used by smith and jarre 2011 is updated in this model version to an age structured population model based on that originally used in sardine population assessments in the omp as described by de oliveira 2002 the model objective is thus to investigate whether our current understanding of the drivers of the west south shifts in small pelagic fish can roughly reproduce the observed dynamics if that is the case further testing of possible strategic management options will then be performed and evaluated on performance in terms of catch stability and a food base for the wider ecosystem the robustness of model results under alternate management strategies and sensitivity of outputs to uncertainties in our understanding of the relevant dynamics will also be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the model is a fbm designed according to the steps outlined by starfield et al 1993 incorporating sardine and anchovy population models for the southern benguela parameterised according to the current frame frames represent biomass high or low and distribution the majority of the population is based on the west or south coast and are determine based on a frame switching rules model

however for details regarding model design implementation and sensitivity analyses refer to the trace documentation directly available as an online supplement s1 compared with the previous version smith and jarre 2011 this model incorporates an age structured sardine population model and a spatial element via the addition of west and south frames as before dynamics are driven by fishing pressure and an environmental proxy signal model outcomes reflect implications for the functioning of the system as a whole additionally in this version an indicator of system state has also been included in the model outputs cury et al 2012 have shown over multiple systems that if forage fish biomass in a marine ecosystem falls below approximately 1 3 of their maximum long term abundance seabird breeding success is likely to be negatively affected providing a useful link between patterns in small pelagic abundance to top level predators this is particularly topical in the southern benguela where fluctuations and in the case of the african penguin serious declines in seabird populations have been strongly linked to small pelagic fish abundance and distribution crawford 2013 crawford et al 2008a b ludynia et al 2010 sherley et al 2013 weller et al 2014 2016 thus in addition to monitoring current frames of sardine and anchovy high low and west south the model also records whether the system as a whole is in a west coast mode i e the majority of small pelagic biomass is located on that coast b south coast mode or c whether the conditions as a whole are unfavourable for predators i e small pelagic biomass is 1 3 of its long term maximum for example if sardine and anchovy are on opposite coasts the coast with the higher population is set as the current mode if species are on opposite coasts and have equivalent population levels the system mode is biased towards sardine and thus system mode is set to that of sardine this is based on the higher calorific value of sardine compared to anchovy balmelli and wickens 1994 pichegru et al 2010 and the seasonal transience of anchovy which makes them less accessible as prey the system state is flagged as c unfavourable for predators or bad when the combined biomass of both species falls below 1 3 of the long term maximum within the model based on the average maximum biomass of sardine and anchovy during a 100 year run over 100 runs a model structure diagram is shown in fig 3 and the trace documentation section 2 3 should be referred to for details of model construction and function the basic model elements are however as follows 2 1 1 population models sardine and anchovy population models comprise the dynamic model that runs within each frame each parameterised according to that frame an age structured sardine population model and a simple anchovy population model stochastically variable around a midpoint are used as the basis of the model the possibility of the occurrence of extreme recruitment events in the sardine population was considered and the model both incorporates this possibility as well as average functioning of the system as far as it i known see s1 trace section 3 2 2 with the inclusion of the spatial element of west and south frames rather than modelling the populations on each coast separately the model assumes that the majority of the population is on one coast while at least a small nucleus remains on the other termed the other coast population when referred to see section 2 3 1 1 3 of the trace document for details unless conditions on the other coast are conducive this nucleus won t grow i e a shift from one coast frame to another will not occur sardine have more successful recruitment on whichever coast is currently more favourable in terms of environment and fishing pressure and thus that population expands the population on the current coast i e the majority of the population is modelled explicitly using a population model the other coast population is assumed to be anything from 0 40 of the modelled biomass with interannual variability constrained to less than 20 this value is then used by the sardine daemon the software agent that may trigger a switch to calculate whether fishing pressure on the other coast is high or low to inform the shifting decision see daemons and switching rules below and trace document section 2 3 4 2 1 2 environmental suitability index esi the esi is one of the model drivers and used as a proxy for natural environmental variation as such the units are arbitrary and created purely for modelling purposes parameters defining the esi were chosen based on those previously used in smith and jarre 2011 and updated where necessary the esi is modelled as variability around a sine function two esi signals run simultaneously within the model one representing conditions on each coast based on observed decadal scale variability the esi signal for the west coast is set as slightly shorter 20 years than that for the south coast 30 years note model outputs were only moderately sensitive to this assumption when tested with some combinations of period length west coast south coast period equal to 20 20 and 40 20 years resulting in a slight increase in time spent in a west frame trace document section 7 3 3 conditions are then evaluated by the model as having either a positive or a negative influence on recruitment on the west coast as in the previous model version and based on different feeding preferences of the two species what is good for one species is bad for the other and vice versa on the south coast the same conditions are good for both based on the relatively food poor environment model outputs only registered as moderately sensitive to alternate assumptions re impact of esi on recruitment see trace section 7 3 4 2 1 3 fishing sardine and anchovy directed fishing including bycatch of juvenile sardine are also drivers within the model sardine directed fishing can be applied via one of three possible routines 1 individual tacs this strategy allows the user to set a fixed sardine tac for the duration of the run for each species unlike the previous where model this was set in kilotons in this current version it is a percentage of total biomass with the addition of the spatial element the user can also now specify a further spatial fishing strategy for sardine focused on the west coast maxw south coast maxs or the tac can be split between the coasts based on the proportion of total biomass on each coast each year dynamic if either of the first two options is chosen the model will catch the maximum tac possible on the chosen coast even if this means fishing sardine on that coast to zero and redirect the remainder of the tac to the other coast 2 active management this strategy is the same as in smith and jarre 2011 allowing the user to reset the tac every three years as a default which enables the user to explore various reactive management options over the course of run 3 automanager in smith and jarre 2011 the automanager was set up as a sliding scale from conservative to severe the population size was evaluated based on pre set thresholds and a sardine tac in kilotons was assigned based on whether the population was identified as low moderate or high although theoretically this approach could allow for a more nuanced evaluation of fishing effects in reality the results tended to be fairly stable up to a tipping point e g results for 0 40 severity were quite similar but differed from results for 50 80 and when used for model testing generally only one of three settings was applied 0 50 or 100 severity in the current model the sliding scale was therefore replaced by a strategy like that used in the omp for sardine with three discrete options that result in minimal loss of meaningful detail conservative moderate and severe like the individual fishing strategy tac is now also set proportional to biomass rather than as a set value as before below a lower population threshold the tac is set to zero between this and an upper threshold the tac is constant and set to a minimum tac specific to that level of fishing pressure above the upper threshold the tac is proportional to biomass with the slope again related to the chosen severity trace document fig 2 6 minimum tac and tac slope increase with increasing severity and the lower threshold is reduced the focus of scientific effort and the small pelagic fishing industry has been on sardine during recent years hutchings et al 2012 shannon et al 2006 because of this as well as the historically conservative management and highly variable recruitment of anchovy in this model and the previous version smith and jarre 2011 a very simple anchovy model is used where only environment and not fishing affects the population anchovy are fished within the model but only in order to account for calculation of the bycatch of juvenile sardine taken in the anchovy directed catch when sardine are in a west frame anchovy landings do not influence the anchovy population 2 1 4 daemons and switching rules the sardine and anchovy daemons monitor variables and decide whether to stay in the current frame or whether to shift into a new frame if a shift occurs the daemons then determine which frame to shift into the switching rules govern switching behaviour between high and low and west and south frames the sardine switching rules incorporate population levels and esi and fishing pressure per coast while anchovy switching rules only rely on esi 2 2 sensitivity analyses comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the degree to which model outputs are affected by the selected input parameters due to the iterative nature of the development process sensitivity analyses for this model were performed in two stages the initial development step involved updating smith jarre s 2011 simple fbm of sardine and anchovy abundance designed for a system operating in a west coast frame only to incorporate an age structured sardine population model the second iterative step included the addition of the spatial element by way of the south and west frames sensitivity analyses were performed on each step and analyses are thus presented in two parts analyses of the non spatial west coast based model after the addition of the age structured sardine population model table 4 trace section 7 2 1 for details and after the addition of the spatial element south frame table 5 trace section 7 2 2 for details for parameters and estimates used in the model see s1 trace document section 3 2 in all sensitivity analyses of quantitative variables inputs were varied 50 from baseline in 10 increments for details of all tests performed see s1 trace document section 7 2 3 spatial fishing and south coast effect tests in addition to model function and sensitivity analyses the model was tested further for sensitivities to and effects on outputs of spatial fishing pressure and assumptions regarding the south coast 2 3 1 test 1 spatial fishing assuming as suggested by coetzee et al 2008 that increased pressure on the west coast contributed to the relative increase in biomass on the south coast in the late 1990s and since and given the design of the rules governing switching for sardine the maxw and maxs fishing strategies fishing pressure focused on the west or south coasts should result in increased residency of sardine in south and west frames respectively which would in turn affect model outputs such as total population based on the differences in productivity of sardine on each coast the dynamic strategy fishing pressure proportionate to distribution should have little to no effect on west and south frame residency which should be driven rather by esi because high fishing pressure on either coast should be avoided under this scenario all scenarios were run over 100 years to avoid any potential influence of esi fluctuations and outputs averaged over 1000 runs using the individual fishing strategy model outputs were compared over maxw maxs and dynamic strategies as well as over different levels of fishing pressure tac s of 10 20 and 30 of total biomass were applied to both sardine and anchovy in three separate tests 2 3 2 test 2 spatial fishing when sardine are in a south frame the low sardine recruitment observed since the early 2000s and until recently when biomass has been primarily located on the south coast indicates that sardine are less productive on the south coast than on the west coast de moor and butterworth 2012 shabangu et al 2012 as a result and given that fishing is thought to play a role in their distribution coetzee et al 2008 there is reason to establish whether any particular fishing strategy would be more or less likely to result in an increased biomass on the more productive west coast in this test the effects of the possible fishing strategies on model outputs were tested with sardine starting out in a south frame and the strategies resulting in the most rapid return to a west frame identified given the design of the shifting rules and the fact that high fishing pressure on the south coast is most likely to arise during the maxs strategy this strategy would be expected to result in the quickest or most frequent shifting of sardine back into a west frame this scenario was tested using a model configuration in which sardine are forced into a south frame for the first 15 years of a 100 year run 2 3 3 test 3 alternate fixed proportions of biomass on the other coast in an expansion of test 7 in section 7 2 2 6 of the trace document and to further interrogate assumptions made regarding the other coast population the baseline values for the maximum proportion of biomass on the other coast and maximum interannual variability in the other coast population were varied from 50 to 50 in 10 increments under the spatial fishing scenarios used in scenarios 1 and 2 here model outputs are expected to be sensitive to changes to other coast population parameters under spatial fishing as lower or higher biomasses on the other coast will affect whether the sardine daemon evaluates fishing pressure on that coast as low or high and thus shifting is likely to be affected 2 3 4 test 4 alternate shifting rules in an expansion of the test in section 7 4 1 of the trace document alternate shifting rules were further tested under the spatial fishing scenarios used in the above scenarios the alternate rules tested were as follows i only fishing pressure is considered ii only esi is considered in both of the above cases the current coast was first evaluated if it was found favourable no shift occurred if not the other coast was evaluated and either a shift occurred if it was favourable or there was a 50 50 probability of a shift occurring if not iii under conditions when a probability of a shift occurring is the outcome the probability is high 80 20 iv under conditions when a probability of a shift occurring is the outcome the probability is low 20 80 2 3 5 test 5 alternate minimum years between shifts in an expansion of the test in section 7 4 2 of the trace document addressing alternate minimum number of years between shifts the min years between shifts was set to 0 5 7 and 10 baseline 3 and model outputs under spatial fishing scenarios used above compared with those of the baseline model 2 3 6 test 6 positive impact of a south frame on anchovy as discussed previously based on observations of lower productivity in sardine on the south coast and theory on the structure and functioning of the south coast shelf based system versus the west coast of the southern benguela it was assumed in the model that both sardine and anchovy would be less productive there than when on the west coast this may not be the case however given that anchovy biomass has been on average higher from 2000 to 2015 than it was before the 1996 change in proportional abundance this scenario tests the implications for model outputs of increased productivity of anchovy in a south frame rather than lower productivity as previously assumed tests were run on a model version parameterised to allow increased recruitment success for anchovy in a south frame recruitment parameters used are shown in table 2 the assumption that variability is higher in a south frame was retained and as in the standard model variability was set at half of the high frame mid point the spatial fishing strategies and range of tacs used in previous scenarios were applied and results compared with those from the standard model in scenario 1 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses the following provides an overview of results from the sensitivity analyses comprehensive details of results from all tests performed are presented in the trace documentation section 7 output metrics in sensitivity analyses were ranked by degree of sensitivity to input parameters from negligible to extremely sensitive note that these were ranked based on a sensitivity index calculated as the relative change in output compared to that in the variable being tested an output categorised as negligible effect or slightly sensitive is still responding to the change in input but not outside the expected bounds details of categories are provided in table 3 an overview of results from tests performed on the model updated to include an age structured sardine population model is shown in table 4 and from analyses of the further update and inclusion of the spatial element south and west frame in table 5 for tests run on a model forced to the south coast frame only in table 5 west coast catch sardine juvenile bycatch taken in the anchovy fishery which operates in the west frame only and west frame duration are not applicable 3 2 spatial fishing and south coast effect tests 3 2 1 test 1 effects of spatial fishing on model outputs as expected the spatial strategy chosen does affect model outputs and sardine tend to shift away into the coastal frame that is experiencing lower fishing pressure for example under maxw fishing sardine spend the majority of the run in a south frame which has implications for overall productivity change in selected outputs for each strategy over the different fishing pressures are shown in fig 4a f somewhat counterintuitively from a historic fisheries management perspective maxs appears to be the strategy that resulted in increased residency time in west and high frames maximising both the biomass and catch of sardine as a result note that under this strategy although the majority of the catch is taken from the south coast some is still taken from the west and this proportion increases with increasing pressure see wc catch fig 4 a crash rates also benefit under this strategy and remain close to zero even at high levels of fishing pressure however the interannual variability of the catch is the highest under this strategy fig 5 a surprisingly the dynamic strategy where the tac is split according to the division of biomass west and south performed the worst both in terms of total yield and sustainability and resulted in relatively high crash rates at heavy fishing pressure 151 1000 predictably this strategy did not affect west south frame residency however high frame duration did decline over time although the maxw strategy appears more sustainable than the dynamic tracking approach with fewer crashes under high fishing pressure it resulted in the lowest population levels and total catch due to low catch returns on the south coast resulting from increased time spent in a south frame fig 4c and d catch variability was similar under dynamic and maxw strategies as an indicator of food availability to top predators the system state indicator fell below the threshold of 1 3 of the long term maximum fish biomass increasingly with increasing fishing pressure under all strategies fig 5b under both maxw and maxs strategies the difference in number of bad years per run was greatest between low to medium pressure when compared with medium high pressure under the maxw strategy particularly the number of bad years per run almost doubled under medium pressure when compared with low the number of bad years for top predators was highest under the maxw strategy and lowest under maxs as a result of those strategies leading to increased time in the less productive south frame and more productive west frame respectively as discussed above 3 2 2 test 2 effects of spatial fishing on model outputs when sardine are in a south frame note for this test sardine were forced to the south coast for the first 15 years of a run when the model was run with no fishing sardine remained on the south coast 15 25 years after shifting restrictions were lifted i e sardine first moved to a west frame no earlier than 30 years and no later than 40 years into the run over 50 runs of 100 years each see table 6 2 when maxw fishing was applied although the earliest shift remained at 30 years when 10 tac was applied the latest shift moved to 60 years into the run and at 20 and 30 tacs in some runs sardine never shifted west when a dynamic fishing strategy was applied there was no real difference under any level of fishing pressure between the timing of the earliest and latest shift when compared with runs performed under zero fishing the maxs strategy at 20 and 30 tac were the only ones to change the timing of the earliest shift which moved forward to 15 years the latest shifts for those levels of fishing were also earlier than under other fishing strategies at approximately 32 years into the run compared with 40 60 years under other strategies 3 2 3 test 3 alternate fixed proportions of biomass on the other coast under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure while model outputs were only slightly sensitive to alternate proportions of biomass on the other coast under the dynamic tracking fishing strategy as expected multiple outputs ranged from sensitive to extremely sensitive under the maxw and maxs strategies these were notably sardine catch frame duration the indicator bad years for predators and crash rate fig 6 effects were particularly strong where the other coast population was set to 0 i e if sardine are in a west frame the model assumes all biomass is on the west coast zero on the south coast at 0 of biomass the other coast population is likely to experience what is evaluated as high fishing pressure if any fishing at all is directed at it under low maxw and maxs fishing strategies where f is not proportional to biomass making the coast frame unlikely to shift to this other coast for example under maxw fishing as shown in test 1 the model is most likely to be in a south frame making the west coast the other coast the compounding effect of forcing this population to equal zero is that fishing pressure on the west coast almost always registers as high the model is therefore even more unlikely to shift back into a west frame than in the baseline model residence in a south frame and thus also south coast catch are increased likewise under maxs fishing with 0 biomass on the other coast the model spends more time in a west frame and west coast catch is increased this effect on catch is less pronounced under higher fishing pressures 20 and 30 due to the baseline model already experiencing this effect the other coast often evaluates as experiencing high pressure which is not the case at low 10 fishing pressure unless the other coast population is very low this increased time spent in a less productive south frame under maxw fishing at 0 other coast biomass also resulted in the increased in number of crashed runs under higher fishing pressures at higher proportions of biomass on the other coast 30 or 40 catches were also affected but due to the increased population available to be caught rather than a change in frame residence time under maxw fishing for example as discussed under test 1 above the majority of the run was spent in a south frame making the west coast more likely to be the other coast because the maxw fishing strategy dictates that the tac is directed first at the west coast and the remainder taken from the south regardless of current frame when the west coast is the other coast and the other coast population is relatively high west coast catches increase likewise under a maxs strategy south coast catches increase fig 6 crash rates were also sensitive to higher other coast populations under maxw fishing because the tac is calculated as a percentage of total biomass including the other coast population a higher overall tac is therefore set by the model but fishing is still targeted at the now proportionally smaller modelled population on the west coast under maxw fishing juvenile sardine are also being caught as bycatch which is not the case on the south coast see trace document section 2 3 3 1 school trap effect this adds to directed fishing pressure and results in a higher crash rate this effect was not evident under a maxs strategy because overall population levels were higher due to the majority of the run being spent in the more productive west frame 3 2 4 test 4 alternate shifting rules under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure at low levels of fishing pressure outputs across all fishing strategies were only slightly sensitive to changes in switching rules fig 7 stronger effects were visible at 20 and 30 tacs but overall only crash rate and years bad for predators were strongly affected the moderate sensitivity of crash rate under maxw fishing with 20 tac as well as extreme sensitivity under maxs 30 tac reflect relatively small changes in real rather than relative terms in the first instance a change from a baseline rate of 2 1000 to 0 1000 in the esi and 80 20 tests was recorded and in the second from a baseline rate of 1 1000 to 4 1000 in the fishing and 0 1000 in the esi and 80 20 tests in this case and in test 6 as discussed below the use of a relative measure as a sensitivity index produced an overstated result when in reality the outputs were not particularly sensitive the system state indicator of bad years for predators was however sensitive under the fishing rule test for maxs 20 and 30 tac and crash rate was moderately sensitive under the same test fishing for maxw 30 tac overall the model behaves as one would expect and under spatial fishing was most sensitive to the switching rule scenario where only fishing pressure and not esi influences shifts outputs were also slightly sensitive to the rules which resulted in increased probability of a shift 80 20 visible in the deviation from zero for this test under maxw and maxs fishing these changes in output reflect the slight increase in the amount of time spent by sardine in a high frame under these rules as one would expect if a shift is more likely under unfavourable conditions 3 2 5 test 5 alternate minimum years between shifts under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure under spatial fishing pressure the effects on outputs of alternate minimum years between shifts fig 8 were similar to those shown during sensitivity analyses using the automanager to apply fishing pressure section 7 4 2 of trace document the number of years flagged as bad for predators increased particularly at the lowest tac 10 this output was not as sensitive at higher tac levels with the effect of fishing pressure at 20 and 30 tac outweighing that of the increased years between shifts at these levels of fishing pressure however the number of crashed runs became extremely sensitive to the min years between shifts and was the only output variable that registered as anything more than slightly sensitive again this was a response to the increasingly negative effects of being forced to remain in an unfavourable frame at high fishing pressures note that while relative crash rate registers as extremely sensitive under the maxs strategy at 30 tac showing a change from baseline of up to 200 the absolute crash rate only varied between 1 and 3 1000 in this test sardine were most vulnerable to crashing under the maxw fishing as shown above fig 4 this strategy results in increased time spent by sardine in the less productive south frame and high fishing pressure is more likely to lead to crashes as in sensitivity analyses section 7 of trace document outputs were on average no more than slightly sensitive to changes in the min years between shifts with the exception of crash rate and to a lesser degree the indicator bad years for predators effects were minimal when there was no restriction on shifting 0 years supporting the use of the baseline restriction of three years between shifts as means of increasing realism without greatly impacting outputs 3 2 6 test 6 positive effect of a south frame on anchovy only anchovy biomass and catch were sensitive to the assumption that the south coast is beneficial for anchovy rather than decreasing their productivity as is assumed in the baseline model table 7 the only other output that changed more than 3 from the standard model outputs was crash rate of the sardine population although as above these are actually reflecting very minor absolute changes e g the 28 6 change under 20 dynamic fishing reflects a change from 7 1000 9 1000 crashes and the 100 changes are from 1 1000 to 2 1000 4 summary and conclusions 4 1 summary of model results the model was constructed to reproduce our current understanding of system function and drivers thus those drivers are required to be represented within the model model testing see trace document sections 5 and 7 serves to further illustrate the effects of assumptions made regarding structure as well as to build confidence in the model so that it could be used to explore possible management scenarios as expected model results imply that the fishing strategy applied has a significant impact on whether or not sardine ever switch back into a west frame from a south frame in the absence of fishing pressure the environmental signal drives a shift to the west at some point but given focused pressure on one coast or the other the shift may be hastened or prevented entirely this has implications for distributions and productivity impacting both the fishery and dependent predators the main factor behind the differences in outputs under different spatial fishing strategies in test 1 relates to west or south frame switching and duration due to the lower productivity assumed on the south coast in the model for example the maxs strategy results in more time spent by sardine in a west frame this in turn results in higher west coast based sardine biomass under that strategy increased high frame residency and total catch and resulting in fewer years below the threshold below which the system is classified as bad for predators counterintuitively catches are highest on the south coast under maxs fishing this is because of the overall increase in biomass induced when sardine are in a west frame where as discussed above they are more likely to be under the maxs strategy as discussed the current frame is assumed to be the location of only the majority of biomass the proportion of that explicitly modelled biomass estimated to be on the other coast population is therefore also higher when the current coast biomass is high for example in this case because sardine are in a west frame and the modelled population is high the estimated and proportional other or south coast population from which the south coast catch is taken is also higher than it would be in a less productive south frame a high south coast catch is then taken even though sardine are in a west frame conversely when a maxw strategy is applied sardine are more likely to be in a south frame resulting in lower productivity consequently biomass and catches from both coasts during those runs are also relatively low and the system is more likely to be limiting bad for predators interannual catch variability may be higher during maxs runs due to the increased influence of the other coast catches in those runs which are in turn correlated with the fluctuating minority population on that other coast the unexpected production of the highest crash rates under the dynamic strategy can be explained by the fact that the tac is set as a percentage of the total biomass rather than just the biomass modelled on the dominant coast i e explicitly modelled biomass and other coast biomass combined because dynamic tracking splits the tac according to biomass distribution this means that both coasts are always experiencing the specified fishing pressure if this is not strictly conservative it will lead to increasing crashes this in contrast to the maxw strategy for example where fishing tends to drive sardine to the south frame but the fishing pressure remains directed at the west coast as a result the estimated proportion of the population on the other in this case west coast will generally be subjected to a substantial proportion of the tac before any fishing pressure is placed on the sardine in the south frame lowering the probability of crashing the system state indicator included in the model is useful in that it allows a quantitative interpretation of the implications of fishing strategies within the model for seabirds and other top predators although the indicator is generalised it does allow for this link to be made and adds some depth to the discussion of the implications of spatial fishing strategies within the context of an eaf within the model heavy fishing focusing on the west coast and resulting in increased residence of sardine in the south frame leads to more years in which forage fish are too low to sustain seabird populations again this is due to lower productivity in the south frame if this is the case it lends further weight to the question of whether spatialised fishing pressure has a role to play in the real world in increasing the biomass of sardine on the west coast where they are more accessible to both the fishery infrastructure and seabird predators this is particularly relevant for birds such as african penguins e g weller et al 2016 2014 which are restricted in their breeding habitat and less able to adapt to change in prey distribution the sensitivity of the model to changes in the proportion of biomass found on the other coast under spatial fishing places further emphasis on the need to investigate spatial management of the small pelagic fisheries decisions in this regard may strongly influence the shift or lack thereof of sardine from a west to a south frame or vice versa this sensitivity reflects what is suspected to have occurred in the early 2000s on the west coast where fishing remained directed at the west coast despite the majority of biomass shifting to the south coetzee et al 2008 and which may have prevented a complete shift back to the west since although the results under alternate switching rules tested fig 7 do not suggest changes are required to the baseline model they do highlight the need to better understand how the relative environmental suitability of each coast affects whether or not a shift occurs confirming results from model function and sensitivity analyses tests in section 7 of the trace document given that the biggest determinant of outputs is the current frame this indicator shift or no shift ultimately determines the productivity of the stock if shifts away from unfavourable condition are more or less likely either directly due to probability settings in the model or because of relative conditions on each coast this can mean the difference between a crash and a stable productive stock increased understanding of this interaction in the real world should be a priority although whether or not the environment on the south coast is beneficial to anchovy definitely warrants further investigation for reasons previously discussed the focus of the development of this model has focused on sardine as a result the model is not particularly sensitive to changes in anchovy productivity e g test 6 above and in its current iteration is not well suited to answering questions in that regard the bycatch of juvenile sardine in anchovy catches does influence the model sardine population however and sardine bycatch is related to the proportion of anchovy catch therefore sardine bycatch is not affected by changes in anchovy population but only by an increase in the proportion of anchovy caught in further development of this fbm the anchovy population model should distinguish anchovy recruits from adults and also refine the anchovy fishery the design of the esi within the model is currently quite simplistic although it is functional it assumes that either completely disparate conditions are favourable for sardine and anchovy or that suitable conditions completely overlap this excludes conditions that are unfavourable for both on the west coast as well as the possibility of some overlap in the range of suitable environmental states this area also warrants further attention in view of the expected climate change while the current approach of using coupled single species stock assessment models to manage sardine and anchovy fisheries in the southern benguela is successful in terms of short term prediction and the output of specific and quantifiable assessments of risk it is not well suited to addressing more long term changes in conditions or variability in productivity over time e g frÃ©on et al 2005 jarre et al 2006 given that no approach at this time can be assumed to take into account all relevant variables considering multiple modelling techniques when attempting to answer management problems is the only way to achieve a more well rounded understanding of the issues at hand the model described here could in no way be used in the capacity of a stock assessment model for tactical management recommendations since it is not designed in this way it can and does however provide insight unavailable from that approach in terms of the possible system level implications of various management strategies the assumptions made when designing the switching rules for this model should however be kept at the forefront when considering model outcomes given that by determining frame west or south they heavily influence results nonetheless a fbm does add to the general understanding in terms of overall system stability related to strategic management choices the system state indicator is a useful addition to the toolkit of quantitative indicators when considering what modelling approach would best meet the objectives in addressing the spatial element in small pelagic distribution in this study both spatial and frame based models were considered the advantages of using a fbm approach are that the model structure is well suited to represent regime shifts such as those observed in the system the model assumes the same stock structure as used in the current omp that of a single stocks the main distribution of which shift around the coast and it is readily modified further along with increased understanding of the processes in the real world although a fbm does require the proportion of biomass on the other coast to be estimated within the model this estimate can be based on observed proportions on each coast tests showed that the corresponding model assumptions i e proportion of and variability in biomass on the other coast test 3 above and test 7 in section 7 2 2 of the trace document did not affect outputs greatly outputs were only affected notably when the model system was subjected to spatial fishing pressure as thought to be the case in reality on the other hand a spatial model would represent the hypothesised two stock or single stock with two mixing components structure previously discussed with no need to estimate biomass on the other coast the two stock hypothesis however has so far not been supported by genetic data hampton 2014 or in the stock assessment paradigm dunn et al 2016 additionally in both the two stock or single stock with two mixing components cases an estimate would still need to be made this time of the degree of mixing between the two stocks and based on what is currently very limited knowledge outputs of a fbm are by design highly dependent on the rules used to drive shifts while the current rules are based on the best available information to date our understanding of the relative importance of fishing pressure and environmental signal remains fairly crude when this understanding improves it will be straightforward to change the model in line with the improved understanding the spatial fishing scenarios tested here allow for useful exploration of potential outcomes based on various candidate strategies although a spatial model may produce similar results the clearly defined breaks that are inherent in a fbm as shifts occur are particularly useful in the context of regime shifts these breaks or shifts also make for clearer interpretation allowing for the simplification of a complex situation in support of fisheries management 5 conclusions although a spatial model could certainly be a useful tool in enhancing our evaluation of likely consequences of fishing there were no key sensitivities that came up in the fbm that would be directly resolved within a spatial model similar population models would be used as a basis for both approaches retaining sensitivities to parameters such as mortality and the thresholds used in applying fishing pressure as long as migration in the spatial model is not linked to an environmental signal this fbm provides a unique perspective which is in line with our understanding of long term ecosystem scale processes hence the fbm is a useful and provides insights unavailable from current approaches despite the possibilities for further improvement model results show that the productivity of the sardine resource within the model is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the fishing pressure it experiences as is the ability of the system to sustain top predators this paper attempts to lay out model results in such a way that they are informative and useful for future considerations but does not recommend any specific strategy as the most appropriate one may vary based on trade offs between social economic and ecological objectives governing management decisions at a specific time results suggest that future research should focus on understanding the implications of the relative environmental conditions on each coast for the sardine stock and how these affect the probability of a shift occurring this emphasises the need for sustained and comprehensive long term monitoring of environmental variables throughout the southern benguela the role of anchovy within with model system has not yet been fully developed and further effort in this area may allow for more robust results in conclusion this study shows support for continued careful consideration of spatialized management approaches to the south african sardine fishery

25322,a number of ecologically and economically important species in the southern benguela including the forage fish sardine sardinops sagax and anchovy engraulis encrasicolus have undergone southward eastward shifts in their distribution in the 1990s early 2000s in addition to the effects of changes in prey availability to top predators the spatially distinct nature of the system means the location of a stock has implications for its productivity the spatial dynamics of small pelagic fish are of particular importance because they are thought to exert wasp waisted trophic control on the system an objective driven frame based model was constructed to investigate the ability of the approach to represent spatial and population dynamics of sardine and anchovy and to explore the implications of possible management strategies climate variability and fishing pressure were assumed as drivers sensitivity analyses were performed and a number of scenarios tested a frame based approach appears to be useful within this context results suggest that the productivity of the sardine resource within the model is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of fishing pressure the role of anchovy within the model system has not yet been fully developed increasing our understanding of the relative suitability of environmental conditions of different regions is also important if we are to increase our capacity to predict trends in abundance and distribution this study shows support for continued careful consideration of spatialized management approaches to the south african sardine fishery keywords ecosystem approach frame based modelling small pelagic fish distributional shift fisheries management 1 introduction the southern benguela fig 1 comprises two of the four subsystems of the benguela current large marine ecosystem bclme hutchings et al 2009 the west coast characterised by seasonal wind driven upwelling and the south coast with characteristics of both a shelf system and an upwelling system hutchings et al 2009 shannon 1985 1 1 biology as in most eastern boundary current systems small pelagic fish in the southern benguela play an important role in ecosystem function acting as a trophic stepping stone between plankton and higher trophic level species such as predatory fish and seabirds a system operating under this model of trophic function is described as wasp waisted with small pelagic fish exerting both top down control on zooplankton populations as well as bottom up influence on predatory groups the southern benguela is thought to operate in this manner cury et al 2000 and the structure was generally supported when modelled data were fitted to observed data time series shannon et al 2008 sardine and anchovy have also formed the bulk of south africa s commercially valuable purse seine fishery since the 1940s crawford et al 1987 fairweather et al 2006 their ecological and commercial importance make the dynamics of sardine and anchovy populations of particular interest from an ecosystem research and fisheries management perspective historically both research and management have focused on a target resource oriented two species approach but more recently with the increasing emphasis on the application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management more importance is being placed on better understanding the role of sardine and anchovy within the system as a whole sardine and anchovy populations around the world have been observed as highly variable on an interannual and decadal scale with decadal scale dominance shifts between the two species schwartzlose et al 1999 cury and shannon 2004 this holds true for populations of sardine and anchovy in the southern benguela where one species has been dominant for a period on a decadal scale followed by a change in the community structure and dominance of the other species the southern benguela has also seen a period of high abundance of both species during the early 2000s as a consequence of an ecosystem regime shift blamey et al 2012 howard et al 2007 recent decades have seen the concept of regime shifts in marine systems become a more common approach to describing long term changes at an ecosystem level de young et al 2004 here we are defining a regime shift as a sudden change from one quantifiable state to another occurring at a large spatial scale de young et al 2004 jarre et al 2006 shifts in a number of physical and biological time series for the southern benguela have been detected in the late 1990s early 2000s roy et al 2007 howard et al 2007 blamey et al 2012 atkinson et al 2012 including in the distribution of sardine and anchovy since the late 1990s the majority of small pelagic fish spawner biomass has been found east of cape agulhas south coast fig 1 whereas historically biomass was located largely on the west coast illustrated in fig 2 van der lingen et al 2005 2002 this has had serious implications for both the management of the fishery and the structure and function of the ecosystem itself e g coetzee et al 2008 crawford et al 2008a jarre et al 2013 sherley et al 2013 watermeyer et al 2016 the physical and biological differences between the west and south coasts mean that the location of a stock has implications for its productivity the west coast is characterised by high but episodic wind induced productivity the south coast has lower concentrations but more continuous availability of nutrients and a higher biomass of consumers predators as a result the population dynamics of small pelagic fish have been shown to be quite different on each coast with sardine recruitment poorer on the south coast van der lingen 2011 de moor and butterworth 2012 the mechanisms behind the distributional shifts in sardine and anchovy are not well understood fishing pressure and environmental shifts in combination with possible natal homing of those sardine spawned further east are thought to be the main drivers behind the changes in distribution coetzee et al 2008 cury 1994 coetzee et al 2008 outline the role that maintaining high fishing pressure on the west coast while the stock had shifted south and east may have played the sardine fishery is managed using an operational management procedure omp that until now has assumed a single stock and with no spatial structure consequently during the late 1990s and 2000s when the majority of biomass has been on the south coast fishing effort remained largely where it had been focused for the previous 50 years and where the majority of processing infrastructure had been developed on the west coast the resulting high fishing pressure exerted on the diminished biomass of sardine on the west coast may have contributed to the continued lower abundance as a result spatial management of the sardine fishery is now under consideration de moor et al 2014 2013 in the case of anchovy roy et al 2007 suggest links between changes in anchovy distribution and shifts in sst on the agulhas bank 1 2 modelling sardine and anchovy in the southern benguela given the levels of complexity and interdisciplinarity inherent in any attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf the use of models and indicators as means of increasing both our understanding of and our ability to communicate system functioning and status has become a vital and accepted practice garcia and staples 2000 degnbol and jarre 2004 starfield and jarre 2011 indicators have been and continue to be developed and used to evaluate various aspects of the southern benguela e g cury et al 2005 yemane et al 2008 shannon et al 2009 shin et al 2010 and these in turn can be used as inputs for various modelling techniques that allow for the distillation and clearer communication of findings to stakeholders and management alike mcgregor 2015 paterson et al 2007 shin and shannon 2010 modelling in the context of an eaf includes the full spectrum of modelling approaches available ranging in complexity from simple to very complex fulton et al 2003 have shown a humped relationship between the complexity and the effectiveness of ecosystem models recommending an array of minimum realistic models as most effective one approach that has been suggested as suitable for the modelling of long term ecosystem level change is frame based modelling fbm where possible stable system states and the shifts between them are modelled starfield et al 1993 fbm applies a minimum realistic approach with a particular objective in mind starfield and jarre 2011 this is similar to the models of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments mice approach described by plagÃ¡nyi et al 2014 where a model somewhere between the complexity of a single species model and an ecosystem model is developed to answer specific questions relating to management although without the complexity of some of the ecosystem models currently developed for the southern benguela shannon et al 2008 2003 shin et al 2004 the minimum realistic and mice modelling paradigms allow specific questions to be addressed with the minimum level of complexity and thus investment of resources necessary starfield et al 1993 a fbm approach starfield et al 1993 is suitable when dynamic ecosystem functioning can be divided into distinct states or frames as is the case for small pelagic fish globally and in the southern benguela cury and shannon 2004 howard et al 2007 schwartzlose et al 1999 where frames would represent the stable periods between shifts a simple model for each frame is constructed that represents only the processes relevant to the objective of the model only one frame is operational at any time and rules must be developed for when the model should switch to a different frame the approach lends itself to the technique of rapid prototyping which allows for the simplest possible model to be developed quickly at which point it can be tested and adapted or complexity added in the next iteration if necessary starfield and jarre 2011 this has the advantage of allowing results of testing and feedback on the current generation model to inform developments in the next version making the final version more useful than if it had been developed from scratch to a high level of complexity rapid prototyping also means that fully functional versions of the model are available at increasing levels of complexity allowing hypotheses to be addressed before the final version of the model has been reached which is of value for time sensitive projects staples 1997 as well as demonstrating effective use of limited funding previously the frame based approach has been used to model shifting vegetation patterns in terrestrial ecosystems rupp et al 2000 starfield et al 1993 but more recently it has also been applied to the southern benguela to explore regime shifts in the dominance patterns between sardine and anchovy smith and jarre 2011 in this model single stocks of anchovy and sardine that migrate around the coastline were assumed in line with current assessment practice and frames represented high or low population levels more recently however there has been investigation into whether sardine in the southern benguela are in fact made up of two stocks one on the west coast and one on the south coast east of cape agulhas with some mixing between them coetzee et al 2008 the possibility of a small third stock on the kzn south coast had also been hypothesised van der lingen et al 2010 differences in biological characteristics of sardine on the west and south coasts and a separation of distributions and spawning areas at medium to low biomass levels support the hypothesis of functionally although not genetically separate stocks de moor and butterworth 2011 van der lingen 2011 as a result a recommendation to explore the incorporation of a two stock approach into the management of the sardine fishery in south africa is currently being investigated de moor and butterworth 2013 2012 van der lingen 2011 unfortunately this approach is complicated by the need to model an unknown but high degree of mixing between the proposed stocks although studies using parasites as a means of estimating possible mixing are currently underway van der lingen et al 2013 van der lingen and hendricks 2014 this situation is difficult to model and current management retains the assumption of a single stock but a two stock with mixing component hypothesis is also being considered in ongoing development of a revised omp de moor 2017 an alternative approach as explored here could assume a single stock operating in different frames or regimes depending on location i e a west coast frame or a south coast frame where the majority of the biomass is located west or east of cape agulhas respectively the formulation of an additional regime shift between west and south coast modes should therefore allow for better representation of the system dynamics than the previous model version smith and jarre 2011 which simulated shifts between high and low population levels additionally the simple sardine population model used by smith and jarre 2011 is updated in this model version to an age structured population model based on that originally used in sardine population assessments in the omp as described by de oliveira 2002 the model objective is thus to investigate whether our current understanding of the drivers of the west south shifts in small pelagic fish can roughly reproduce the observed dynamics if that is the case further testing of possible strategic management options will then be performed and evaluated on performance in terms of catch stability and a food base for the wider ecosystem the robustness of model results under alternate management strategies and sensitivity of outputs to uncertainties in our understanding of the relevant dynamics will also be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the model is a fbm designed according to the steps outlined by starfield et al 1993 incorporating sardine and anchovy population models for the southern benguela parameterised according to the current frame frames represent biomass high or low and distribution the majority of the population is based on the west or south coast and are determine based on a frame switching rules model design and structure has been described following the trace transparent and comprehensive model evaluation format grimm et al 2014 schmolke et al 2010 table 1 provides a summary of the trace document however for details regarding model design implementation and sensitivity analyses refer to the trace documentation directly available as an online supplement s1 compared with the previous version smith and jarre 2011 this model incorporates an age structured sardine population model and a spatial element via the addition of west and south frames as before dynamics are driven by fishing pressure and an environmental proxy signal model outcomes reflect implications for the functioning of the system as a whole additionally in this version an indicator of system state has also been included in the model outputs cury et al 2012 have shown over multiple systems that if forage fish biomass in a marine ecosystem falls below approximately 1 3 of their maximum long term abundance seabird breeding success is likely to be negatively affected providing a useful link between patterns in small pelagic abundance to top level predators this is particularly topical in the southern benguela where fluctuations and in the case of the african penguin serious declines in seabird populations have been strongly linked to small pelagic fish abundance and distribution crawford 2013 crawford et al 2008a b ludynia et al 2010 sherley et al 2013 weller et al 2014 2016 thus in addition to monitoring current frames of sardine and anchovy high low and west south the model also records whether the system as a whole is in a west coast mode i e the majority of small pelagic biomass is located on that coast b south coast mode or c whether the conditions as a whole are unfavourable for predators i e small pelagic biomass is 1 3 of its long term maximum for example if sardine and anchovy are on opposite coasts the coast with the higher population is set as the current mode if species are on opposite coasts and have equivalent population levels the system mode is biased towards sardine and thus system mode is set to that of sardine this is based on the higher calorific value of sardine compared to anchovy balmelli and wickens 1994 pichegru et al 2010 and the seasonal transience of anchovy which makes them less accessible as prey the system state is flagged as c unfavourable for predators or bad when the combined biomass of both species falls below 1 3 of the long term maximum within the model based on the average maximum biomass of sardine and anchovy during a 100 year run over 100 runs a model structure diagram is shown in fig 3 and the trace documentation section 2 3 should be referred to for details of model construction and function the basic model elements are however as follows 2 1 1 population models sardine and anchovy population models comprise the dynamic model that runs within each frame each parameterised according to that frame an age structured sardine population model and a simple anchovy population model stochastically variable around a midpoint are used as the basis of the model the possibility of the occurrence of extreme recruitment events in the sardine population was considered and the model both incorporates this possibility as well as average functioning of the system as far as it i known see s1 trace section 3 2 2 with the inclusion of the spatial element of west and south frames rather than modelling the populations on each coast separately the model assumes that the majority of the population is on one coast while at least a small nucleus remains on the other termed the other coast population when referred to see section 2 3 1 1 3 of the trace document for details unless conditions on the other coast are conducive this nucleus won t grow i e a shift from one coast frame to another will not occur sardine have more successful recruitment on whichever coast is currently more favourable in terms of environment and fishing pressure and thus that population expands the population on the current coast i e the majority of the population is modelled explicitly using a population model the other coast population is assumed to be anything from 0 40 of the modelled biomass with interannual variability constrained to less than 20 this value is then used by the sardine daemon the software agent that may trigger a switch to calculate whether fishing pressure on the other coast is high or low to inform the shifting decision see daemons and switching rules below and trace document section 2 3 4 2 1 2 environmental suitability index esi the esi is one of the model drivers and used as a proxy for natural environmental variation as such the units are arbitrary and created purely for modelling purposes parameters defining the esi were chosen based on those previously used in smith and jarre 2011 and updated where necessary the esi is modelled as variability around a sine function two esi signals run simultaneously within the model one representing conditions on each coast based on observed decadal scale variability the esi signal for the west coast is set as slightly shorter 20 years than that for the south coast 30 years note model outputs were only moderately sensitive to this assumption when tested with some combinations of period length west coast south coast period equal to 20 20 and 40 20 years resulting in a slight increase in time spent in a west frame trace document section 7 3 3 conditions are then evaluated by the model as having either a positive or a negative influence on recruitment on the west coast as in the previous model version and based on different feeding preferences of the two species what is good for one species is bad for the other and vice versa on the south coast the same conditions are good for both based on the relatively food poor environment model outputs only registered as moderately sensitive to alternate assumptions re impact of esi on recruitment see trace section 7 3 4 2 1 3 fishing sardine and anchovy directed fishing including bycatch of juvenile sardine are also drivers within the model sardine directed fishing can be applied via one of three possible routines 1 individual tacs this strategy allows the user to set a fixed sardine tac for the duration of the run for each species unlike the previous where model this was set in kilotons in this current version it is a percentage of total biomass with the addition of the spatial element the user can also now specify a further spatial fishing strategy for sardine focused on the west coast maxw south coast maxs or the tac can be split between the coasts based on the proportion of total biomass on each coast each year dynamic if either of the first two options is chosen the model will catch the maximum tac possible on the chosen coast even if this means fishing sardine on that coast to zero and redirect the remainder of the tac to the other coast 2 active management this strategy is the same as in smith and jarre 2011 allowing the user to reset the tac every three years as a default which enables the user to explore various reactive management options over the course of run 3 automanager in smith and jarre 2011 the automanager was set up as a sliding scale from conservative to severe the population size was evaluated based on pre set thresholds and a sardine tac in kilotons was assigned based on whether the population was identified as low moderate or high although theoretically this approach could allow for a more nuanced evaluation of fishing effects in reality the results tended to be fairly stable up to a tipping point e g results for 0 40 severity were quite similar but differed from results for 50 80 and when used for model testing generally only one of three settings was applied 0 50 or 100 severity in the current model the sliding scale was therefore replaced by a strategy like that used in the omp for sardine with three discrete options that result in minimal loss of meaningful detail conservative moderate and severe like the individual fishing strategy tac is now also set proportional to biomass rather than as a set value as before below a lower population threshold the tac is set to zero between this and an upper threshold the tac is constant and set to a minimum tac specific to that level of fishing pressure above the upper threshold the tac is proportional to biomass with the slope again related to the chosen severity trace document fig 2 6 minimum tac and tac slope increase with increasing severity and the lower threshold is reduced the focus of scientific effort and the small pelagic fishing industry has been on sardine during recent years hutchings et al 2012 shannon et al 2006 because of this as well as the historically conservative management and highly variable recruitment of anchovy in this model and the previous version smith and jarre 2011 a very simple anchovy model is used where only environment and not fishing affects the population anchovy are fished within the model but only in order to account for calculation of the bycatch of juvenile sardine taken in the anchovy directed catch when sardine are in a west frame anchovy landings do not influence the anchovy population 2 1 4 daemons and switching rules the sardine and anchovy daemons monitor variables and decide whether to stay in the current frame or whether to shift into a new frame if a shift occurs the daemons then determine which frame to shift into the switching rules govern switching behaviour between high and low and west and south frames the sardine switching rules incorporate population levels and esi and fishing pressure per coast while anchovy switching rules only rely on esi 2 2 sensitivity analyses comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the degree to which model outputs are affected by the selected input parameters due to the iterative nature of the development process sensitivity analyses for this model were performed in two stages the initial development step involved updating smith jarre s 2011 simple fbm of sardine and anchovy abundance designed for a system operating in a west coast frame only to incorporate an age structured sardine population model the second iterative step included the addition of the spatial element by way of the south and west frames sensitivity analyses were performed on each step and analyses are thus presented in two parts analyses of the non spatial west coast based model after the addition of the age structured sardine population model table 4 trace section 7 2 1 for details and after the addition of the spatial element south frame table 5 trace section 7 2 2 for details for parameters and estimates used in the model see s1 trace document section 3 2 in all sensitivity analyses of quantitative variables inputs were varied 50 from baseline in 10 increments for details of all tests performed see s1 trace document section 7 2 3 spatial fishing and south coast effect tests in addition to model function and sensitivity analyses the model was tested further for sensitivities to and effects on outputs of spatial fishing pressure and assumptions regarding the south coast 2 3 1 test 1 spatial fishing assuming as suggested by coetzee et al 2008 that increased pressure on the west coast contributed to the relative increase in biomass on the south coast in the late 1990s and since and given the design of the rules governing switching for sardine the maxw and maxs fishing strategies fishing pressure focused on the west or south coasts should result in increased residency of sardine in south and west frames respectively which would in turn affect model outputs such as total population based on the differences in productivity of sardine on each coast the dynamic strategy fishing pressure proportionate to distribution should have little to no effect on west and south frame residency which should be driven rather by esi because high fishing pressure on either coast should be avoided under this scenario all scenarios were run over 100 years to avoid any potential influence of esi fluctuations and outputs averaged over 1000 runs using the individual fishing strategy model outputs were compared over maxw maxs and dynamic strategies as well as over different levels of fishing pressure tac s of 10 20 and 30 of total biomass were applied to both sardine and anchovy in three separate tests 2 3 2 test 2 spatial fishing when sardine are in a south frame the low sardine recruitment observed since the early 2000s and until recently when biomass has been primarily located on the south coast indicates that sardine are less productive on the south coast than on the west coast de moor and butterworth 2012 shabangu et al 2012 as a result and given that fishing is thought to play a role in their distribution coetzee et al 2008 there is reason to establish whether any particular fishing strategy would be more or less likely to result in an increased biomass on the more productive west coast in this test the effects of the possible fishing strategies on model outputs were tested with sardine starting out in a south frame and the strategies resulting in the most rapid return to a west frame identified given the design of the shifting rules and the fact that high fishing pressure on the south coast is most likely to arise during the maxs strategy this strategy would be expected to result in the quickest or most frequent shifting of sardine back into a west frame this scenario was tested using a model configuration in which sardine are forced into a south frame for the first 15 years of a 100 year run 2 3 3 test 3 alternate fixed proportions of biomass on the other coast in an expansion of test 7 in section 7 2 2 6 of the trace document and to further interrogate assumptions made regarding the other coast population the baseline values for the maximum proportion of biomass on the other coast and maximum interannual variability in the other coast population were varied from 50 to 50 in 10 increments under the spatial fishing scenarios used in scenarios 1 and 2 here model outputs are expected to be sensitive to changes to other coast population parameters under spatial fishing as lower or higher biomasses on the other coast will affect whether the sardine daemon evaluates fishing pressure on that coast as low or high and thus shifting is likely to be affected 2 3 4 test 4 alternate shifting rules in an expansion of the test in section 7 4 1 of the trace document alternate shifting rules were further tested under the spatial fishing scenarios used in the above scenarios the alternate rules tested were as follows i only fishing pressure is considered ii only esi is considered in both of the above cases the current coast was first evaluated if it was found favourable no shift occurred if not the other coast was evaluated and either a shift occurred if it was favourable or there was a 50 50 probability of a shift occurring if not iii under conditions when a probability of a shift occurring is the outcome the probability is high 80 20 iv under conditions when a probability of a shift occurring is the outcome the probability is low 20 80 2 3 5 test 5 alternate minimum years between shifts in an expansion of the test in section 7 4 2 of the trace document addressing alternate minimum number of years between shifts the min years between shifts was set to 0 5 7 and 10 baseline 3 and model outputs under spatial fishing scenarios used above compared with those of the baseline model 2 3 6 test 6 positive impact of a south frame on anchovy as discussed previously based on observations of lower productivity in sardine on the south coast and theory on the structure and functioning of the south coast shelf based system versus the west coast of the southern benguela it was assumed in the model that both sardine and anchovy would be less productive there than when on the west coast this may not be the case however given that anchovy biomass has been on average higher from 2000 to 2015 than it was before the 1996 change in proportional abundance this scenario tests the implications for model outputs of increased productivity of anchovy in a south frame rather than lower productivity as previously assumed tests were run on a model version parameterised to allow increased recruitment success for anchovy in a south frame recruitment parameters used are shown in table 2 the assumption that variability is higher in a south frame was retained and as in the standard model variability was set at half of the high frame mid point the spatial fishing strategies and range of tacs used in previous scenarios were applied and results compared with those from the standard model in scenario 1 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses the following provides an overview of results from the sensitivity analyses comprehensive details of results from all tests performed are presented in the trace documentation section 7 output metrics in sensitivity analyses were ranked by degree of sensitivity to input parameters from negligible to extremely sensitive note that these were ranked based on a sensitivity index calculated as the relative change in output compared to that in the variable being tested an output categorised as negligible effect or slightly sensitive is still responding to the change in input but not outside the expected bounds details of categories are provided in table 3 an overview of results from tests performed on the model updated to include an age structured sardine population model is shown in table 4 and from analyses of the further update and inclusion of the spatial element south and west frame in table 5 for tests run on a model forced to the south coast frame only in table 5 west coast catch sardine juvenile bycatch taken in the anchovy fishery which operates in the west frame only and west frame duration are not applicable 3 2 spatial fishing and south coast effect tests 3 2 1 test 1 effects of spatial fishing on model outputs as expected the spatial strategy chosen does affect model outputs and sardine tend to shift away into the coastal frame that is experiencing lower fishing pressure for example under maxw fishing sardine spend the majority of the run in a south frame which has implications for overall productivity change in selected outputs for each strategy over the different fishing pressures are shown in fig 4a f somewhat counterintuitively from a historic fisheries management perspective maxs appears to be the strategy that resulted in increased residency time in west and high frames maximising both the biomass and catch of sardine as a result note that under this strategy although the majority of the catch is taken from the south coast some is still taken from the west and this proportion increases with increasing pressure see wc catch fig 4 a crash rates also benefit under this strategy and remain close to zero even at high levels of fishing pressure however the interannual variability of the catch is the highest under this strategy fig 5 a surprisingly the dynamic strategy where the tac is split according to the division of biomass west and south performed the worst both in terms of total yield and sustainability and resulted in relatively high crash rates at heavy fishing pressure 151 1000 predictably this strategy did not affect west south frame residency however high frame duration did decline over time although the maxw strategy appears more sustainable than the dynamic tracking approach with fewer crashes under high fishing pressure it resulted in the lowest population levels and total catch due to low catch returns on the south coast resulting from increased time spent in a south frame fig 4c and d catch variability was similar under dynamic and maxw strategies as an indicator of food availability to top predators the system state indicator fell below the threshold of 1 3 of the long term maximum fish biomass increasingly with increasing fishing pressure under all strategies fig 5b under both maxw and maxs strategies the difference in number of bad years per run was greatest between low to medium pressure when compared with medium high pressure under the maxw strategy particularly the number of bad years per run almost doubled under medium pressure when compared with low the number of bad years for top predators was highest under the maxw strategy and lowest under maxs as a result of those strategies leading to increased time in the less productive south frame and more productive west frame respectively as discussed above 3 2 2 test 2 effects of spatial fishing on model outputs when sardine are in a south frame note for this test sardine were forced to the south coast for the first 15 years of a run when the model was run with no fishing sardine remained on the south coast 15 25 years after shifting restrictions were lifted i e sardine first moved to a west frame no earlier than 30 years and no later than 40 years into the run over 50 runs of 100 years each see table 6 2 when maxw fishing was applied although the earliest shift remained at 30 years when 10 tac was applied the latest shift moved to 60 years into the run and at 20 and 30 tacs in some runs sardine never shifted west when a dynamic fishing strategy was applied there was no real difference under any level of fishing pressure between the timing of the earliest and latest shift when compared with runs performed under zero fishing the maxs strategy at 20 and 30 tac were the only ones to change the timing of the earliest shift which moved forward to 15 years the latest shifts for those levels of fishing were also earlier than under other fishing strategies at approximately 32 years into the run compared with 40 60 years under other strategies 3 2 3 test 3 alternate fixed proportions of biomass on the other coast under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure while model outputs were only slightly sensitive to alternate proportions of biomass on the other coast under the dynamic tracking fishing strategy as expected multiple outputs ranged from sensitive to extremely sensitive under the maxw and maxs strategies these were notably sardine catch frame duration the indicator bad years for predators and crash rate fig 6 effects were particularly strong where the other coast population was set to 0 i e if sardine are in a west frame the model assumes all biomass is on the west coast zero on the south coast at 0 of biomass the other coast population is likely to experience what is evaluated as high fishing pressure if any fishing at all is directed at it under low maxw and maxs fishing strategies where f is not proportional to biomass making the coast frame unlikely to shift to this other coast for example under maxw fishing as shown in test 1 the model is most likely to be in a south frame making the west coast the other coast the compounding effect of forcing this population to equal zero is that fishing pressure on the west coast almost always registers as high the model is therefore even more unlikely to shift back into a west frame than in the baseline model residence in a south frame and thus also south coast catch are increased likewise under maxs fishing with 0 biomass on the other coast the model spends more time in a west frame and west coast catch is increased this effect on catch is less pronounced under higher fishing pressures 20 and 30 due to the baseline model already experiencing this effect the other coast often evaluates as experiencing high pressure which is not the case at low 10 fishing pressure unless the other coast population is very low this increased time spent in a less productive south frame under maxw fishing at 0 other coast biomass also resulted in the increased in number of crashed runs under higher fishing pressures at higher proportions of biomass on the other coast 30 or 40 catches were also affected but due to the increased population available to be caught rather than a change in frame residence time under maxw fishing for example as discussed under test 1 above the majority of the run was spent in a south frame making the west coast more likely to be the other coast because the maxw fishing strategy dictates that the tac is directed first at the west coast and the remainder taken from the south regardless of current frame when the west coast is the other coast and the other coast population is relatively high west coast catches increase likewise under a maxs strategy south coast catches increase fig 6 crash rates were also sensitive to higher other coast populations under maxw fishing because the tac is calculated as a percentage of total biomass including the other coast population a higher overall tac is therefore set by the model but fishing is still targeted at the now proportionally smaller modelled population on the west coast under maxw fishing juvenile sardine are also being caught as bycatch which is not the case on the south coast see trace document section 2 3 3 1 school trap effect this adds to directed fishing pressure and results in a higher crash rate this effect was not evident under a maxs strategy because overall population levels were higher due to the majority of the run being spent in the more productive west frame 3 2 4 test 4 alternate shifting rules under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure at low levels of fishing pressure outputs across all fishing strategies were only slightly sensitive to changes in switching rules fig 7 stronger effects were visible at 20 and 30 tacs but overall only crash rate and years bad for predators were strongly affected the moderate sensitivity of crash rate under maxw fishing with 20 tac as well as extreme sensitivity under maxs 30 tac reflect relatively small changes in real rather than relative terms in the first instance a change from a baseline rate of 2 1000 to 0 1000 in the esi and 80 20 tests was recorded and in the second from a baseline rate of 1 1000 to 4 1000 in the fishing and 0 1000 in the esi and 80 20 tests in this case and in test 6 as discussed below the use of a relative measure as a sensitivity index produced an overstated result when in reality the outputs were not particularly sensitive the system state indicator of bad years for predators was however sensitive under the fishing rule test for maxs 20 and 30 tac and crash rate was moderately sensitive under the same test fishing for maxw 30 tac overall the model behaves as one would expect and under spatial fishing was most sensitive to the switching rule scenario where only fishing pressure and not esi influences shifts outputs were also slightly sensitive to the rules which resulted in increased probability of a shift 80 20 visible in the deviation from zero for this test under maxw and maxs fishing these changes in output reflect the slight increase in the amount of time spent by sardine in a high frame under these rules as one would expect if a shift is more likely under unfavourable conditions 3 2 5 test 5 alternate minimum years between shifts under spatial fishing scenarios and increasing fishing pressure under spatial fishing pressure the effects on outputs of alternate minimum years between shifts fig 8 were similar to those shown during sensitivity analyses using the automanager to apply fishing pressure section 7 4 2 of trace document the number of years flagged as bad for predators increased particularly at the lowest tac 10 this output was not as sensitive at higher tac levels with the effect of fishing pressure at 20 and 30 tac outweighing that of the increased years between shifts at these levels of fishing pressure however the number of crashed runs became extremely sensitive to the min years between shifts and was the only output variable that registered as anything more than slightly sensitive again this was a response to the increasingly negative effects of being forced to remain in an unfavourable frame at high fishing pressures note that while relative crash rate registers as extremely sensitive under the maxs strategy at 30 tac showing a change from baseline of up to 200 the absolute crash rate only varied between 1 and 3 1000 in this test sardine were most vulnerable to crashing under the maxw fishing as shown above fig 4 this strategy results in increased time spent by sardine in the less productive south frame and high fishing pressure is more likely to lead to crashes as in sensitivity analyses section 7 of trace document outputs were on average no more than slightly sensitive to changes in the min years between shifts with the exception of crash rate and to a lesser degree the indicator bad years for predators effects were minimal when there was no restriction on shifting 0 years supporting the use of the baseline restriction of three years between shifts as means of increasing realism without greatly impacting outputs 3 2 6 test 6 positive effect of a south frame on anchovy only anchovy biomass and catch were sensitive to the assumption that the south coast is beneficial for anchovy rather than decreasing their productivity as is assumed in the baseline model table 7 the only other output that changed more than 3 from the standard model outputs was crash rate of the sardine population although as above these are actually reflecting very minor absolute changes e g the 28 6 change under 20 dynamic fishing reflects a change from 7 1000 9 1000 crashes and the 100 changes are from 1 1000 to 2 1000 4 summary and conclusions 4 1 summary of model results the model was constructed to reproduce our current understanding of system function and drivers thus those drivers are required to be represented within the model model testing see trace document sections 5 and 7 serves to further illustrate the effects of assumptions made regarding structure as well as to build confidence in the model so that it could be used to explore possible management scenarios as expected model results imply that the fishing strategy applied has a significant impact on whether or not sardine ever switch back into a west frame from a south frame in the absence of fishing pressure the environmental signal drives a shift to the west at some point but given focused pressure on one coast or the other the shift may be hastened or prevented entirely this has implications for distributions and productivity impacting both the fishery and dependent predators the main factor behind the differences in outputs under different spatial fishing strategies in test 1 relates to west or south frame switching and duration due to the lower productivity assumed on the south coast in the model for example the maxs strategy results in more time spent by sardine in a west frame this in turn results in higher west coast based sardine biomass under that strategy increased high frame residency and total catch and resulting in fewer years below the threshold below which the system is classified as bad for predators counterintuitively catches are highest on the south coast under maxs fishing this is because of the overall increase in biomass induced when sardine are in a west frame where as discussed above they are more likely to be under the maxs strategy as discussed the current frame is assumed to be the location of only the majority of biomass the proportion of that explicitly modelled biomass estimated to be on the other coast population is therefore also higher when the current coast biomass is high for example in this case because sardine are in a west frame and the modelled population is high the estimated and proportional other or south coast population from which the south coast catch is taken is also higher than it would be in a less productive south frame a high south coast catch is then taken even though sardine are in a west frame conversely when a maxw strategy is applied sardine are more likely to be in a south frame resulting in lower productivity consequently biomass and catches from both coasts during those runs are also relatively low and the system is more likely to be limiting bad for predators interannual catch variability may be higher during maxs runs due to the increased influence of the other coast catches in those runs which are in turn correlated with the fluctuating minority population on that other coast the unexpected production of the highest crash rates under the dynamic strategy can be explained by the fact that the tac is set as a percentage of the total biomass rather than just the biomass modelled on the dominant coast i e explicitly modelled biomass and other coast biomass combined because dynamic tracking splits the tac according to biomass distribution this means that both coasts are always experiencing the specified fishing pressure if this is not strictly conservative it will lead to increasing crashes this in contrast to the maxw strategy for example where fishing tends to drive sardine to the south frame but the fishing pressure remains directed at the west coast as a result the estimated proportion of the population on the other in this case west coast will generally be subjected to a substantial proportion of the tac before any fishing pressure is placed on the sardine in the south frame lowering the probability of crashing the system state indicator included in the model is useful in that it allows a quantitative interpretation of the implications of fishing strategies within the model for seabirds and other top predators although the indicator is generalised it does allow for this link to be made and adds some depth to the discussion of the implications of spatial fishing strategies within the context of an eaf within the model heavy fishing focusing on the west coast and resulting in increased residence of sardine in the south frame leads to more years in which forage fish are too low to sustain seabird populations again this is due to lower productivity in the south frame if this is the case it lends further weight to the question of whether spatialised fishing pressure has a role to play in the real world in increasing the biomass of sardine on the west coast where they are more accessible to both the fishery infrastructure and seabird predators this is particularly relevant for birds such as african penguins e g weller et al 2016 2014 which are restricted in their breeding habitat and less able to adapt to change in prey distribution the sensitivity of the model to changes in the proportion of biomass found on the other coast under spatial fishing places further emphasis on the need to investigate spatial management of the small pelagic fisheries decisions in this regard may strongly influence the shift or lack thereof of sardine from a west to a south frame or vice versa this sensitivity reflects what is suspected to have occurred in the early 2000s on the west coast where fishing remained directed at the west coast despite the majority of biomass shifting to the south coetzee et al 2008 and which may have prevented a complete shift back to the west since although the results under alternate switching rules tested fig 7 do not suggest changes are required to the baseline model they do highlight the need to better understand how the relative environmental suitability of each coast affects whether or not a shift occurs confirming results from model function and sensitivity analyses tests in section 7 of the trace document given that the biggest determinant of outputs is the current frame this indicator shift or no shift ultimately determines the productivity of the stock if shifts away from unfavourable condition are more or less likely either directly due to probability settings in the model or because of relative conditions on each coast this can mean the difference between a crash and a stable productive stock increased understanding of this interaction in the real world should be a priority although whether or not the environment on the south coast is beneficial to anchovy definitely warrants further investigation for reasons previously discussed the focus of the development of this model has focused on sardine as a result the model is not particularly sensitive to changes in anchovy productivity e g test 6 above and in its current iteration is not well suited to answering questions in that regard the bycatch of juvenile sardine in anchovy catches does influence the model sardine population however and sardine bycatch is related to the proportion of anchovy catch therefore sardine bycatch is not affected by changes in anchovy population but only by an increase in the proportion of anchovy caught in further development of this fbm the anchovy population model should distinguish anchovy recruits from adults and also refine the anchovy fishery the design of the esi within the model is currently quite simplistic although it is functional it assumes that either completely disparate conditions are favourable for sardine and anchovy or that suitable conditions completely overlap this excludes conditions that are unfavourable for both on the west coast as well as the possibility of some overlap in the range of suitable environmental states this area also warrants further attention in view of the expected climate change while the current approach of using coupled single species stock assessment models to manage sardine and anchovy fisheries in the southern benguela is successful in terms of short term prediction and the output of specific and quantifiable assessments of risk it is not well suited to addressing more long term changes in conditions or variability in productivity over time e g frÃ©on et al 2005 jarre et al 2006 given that no approach at this time can be assumed to take into account all relevant variables considering multiple modelling techniques when attempting to answer management problems is the only way to achieve a more well rounded understanding of the issues at hand the model described here could in no way be used in the capacity of a stock assessment model for tactical management recommendations since it is not designed in this way it can and does however provide insight unavailable from that approach in terms of the possible system level implications of various management strategies the assumptions made when designing the switching rules for this model should however be kept at the forefront when considering model outcomes given that by determining frame west or south they heavily influence results nonetheless a fbm does add to the general understanding in terms of overall system stability related to strategic management choices the system state indicator is a useful addition to the toolkit of quantitative indicators when considering what modelling approach would best meet the objectives in addressing the spatial element in small pelagic distribution in this study both spatial and frame based models were considered the advantages of using a fbm approach are that the model structure is well suited to represent regime shifts such as those observed in the system the model assumes the same stock structure as used in the current omp that of a single stocks the main distribution of which shift around the coast and it is readily modified further along with increased understanding of the processes in the real world although a fbm does require the proportion of biomass on the other coast to be estimated within the model this estimate can be based on observed proportions on each coast tests showed that the corresponding model assumptions i e proportion of and variability in biomass on the other coast test 3 above and test 7 in section 7 2 2 of the trace document did not affect outputs greatly outputs were only affected notably when the model system was subjected to spatial fishing pressure as thought to be the case in reality on the other hand a spatial model would represent the hypothesised two stock or single stock with two mixing components structure previously discussed with no need to estimate biomass on the other coast the two stock hypothesis however has so far not been supported by genetic data hampton 2014 or in the stock assessment paradigm dunn et al 2016 additionally in both the two stock or single stock with two mixing components cases an estimate would still need to be made this time of the degree of mixing between the two stocks and based on what is currently very limited knowledge outputs of a fbm are by design highly dependent on the rules used to drive shifts while the current rules are based on the best available information to date our understanding of the relative importance of fishing pressure and environmental signal remains fairly crude when this understanding improves it will be straightforward to change the model in line with the improved understanding the spatial fishing scenarios tested here allow for useful exploration of potential outcomes based on various candidate strategies although a spatial model may produce similar results the clearly defined breaks that are inherent in a fbm as shifts occur are particularly useful in the context of regime shifts these breaks or shifts also make for clearer interpretation allowing for the simplification of a complex situation in support of fisheries management 5 conclusions although a spatial model could certainly be a useful tool in enhancing our evaluation of likely consequences of fishing there were no key sensitivities that came up in the fbm that would be directly resolved within a spatial model similar population models would be used as a basis for both approaches retaining sensitivities to parameters such as mortality and the thresholds used in applying fishing pressure as long as migration in the spatial model is not linked to an environmental signal this fbm provides a unique perspective which is in line with our understanding of long term ecosystem scale processes hence the fbm is a useful and provides insights unavailable from current approaches despite the possibilities for further improvement model results show that the productivity of the sardine resource within the model is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the fishing pressure it experiences as is the ability of the system to sustain top predators this paper attempts to lay out model results in such a way that they are informative and useful for future considerations but does not recommend any specific strategy as the most appropriate one may vary based on trade offs between social economic and ecological objectives governing management decisions at a specific time results suggest that future research should focus on understanding the implications of the relative environmental conditions on each coast for the sardine stock and how these affect the probability of a shift occurring this emphasises the need for sustained and comprehensive long term monitoring of environmental variables throughout the southern benguela the role of anchovy within with model system has not yet been fully developed and further effort in this area may allow for more robust results in conclusion this study shows support for continued careful consideration of spatialized management approaches to the south african sardine fishery

25323,urban areas have contributed 75 of the global co2 emissions therefore seeking global carbon reduction solutions from the perspective of city has become a focus of decision makers in charge of environmental protection the carbon emission reduction potential in land management and spatial adjustment has become an important mean for achieving regional and global sustainable development in this paper we systematically review and synthesize four main aspects of urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis namely 1 advances in urban carbon metabolism 2 carbon accounting based on land use and cover change 3 spatial distribution of urban carbon metabolism and influencing factors and 4 forecasting based on land use change land use and cover change lucc in addition we point out current deficiencies in the study of urban carbon metabolism such as incomplete process analysis and lack of spatial display based on previous research we propose a spatial analysis centric outlook on urban carbon metabolism including the following key approaches 1 future researchers should simultaneously consider natural and socioeconomic components as well as vertical flows from land to atmosphere and horizontal flows among different land use types carbon flows to obtain a more complete picture of the entire urban carbon metabolism system 2 carbon metabolic spatial mapping can be implemented in patches to better serve government s goals for optimal regulation and spatial planning 3 researchers should refine current urban scale research also expanding it to the metropolitan i e urban agglomeration scale to establish multi scale multi level and organic network structures and study the spatial distribution pattern of carbon metabolism within and among cities and metropolitan areas which will lay a scientific foundation for urban regional and national sustainable development keywords urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis lucc sustainable development 1 introduction in recent years significant pressure to reduce co2 emissions has attracted more and more attention of government policy makers in spite of efforts to reduce fossil fuel combustion studies have shown that co2 emissions caused by global energy consumption have remained relatively stable for two consecutive years about 321gt in 2016 therefore transforming carbon emissions patterns and seeking more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions are necessary the 2007 ipcc report pointed out that about 80 of anthropogenic carbon emissions were from urban areas within which approximately one third are from land use and cover change lucc thus land management and spatial adjustment have become every country s key task to reduce urban and even global carbon emissions previous urban carbon cycle and carbon metabolism research has been reviewed from the viewpoint of industrial ecology and sociology and also through studies that use carbon accounting process analysis inside and outside cities zhao and huang 2013 these studies assess the content including energy consumption industry production agriculture production solid waste forest grassland water and external flows and methods including greenhouse gas inventory method field observation model construction and rs based method of carbon accounting zhang et al 2015b and factors influencing carbon emissions li et al 2013 this represents a shift in the research focus from macroscopic mode to microscopic mechanisms zhao and huang 2013 and from a single process of either a natural or anthropogenic process to a combined anthropogenic natural process however previous studies did not consider carbon flows among urban components from the perspective of spatial adjustment spatial analysis more intuitively demonstrates the distribution and spatial transfer of carbon metabolism it can provide a scientific foundation for land planning industrial distribution change and spatial adjustment of carbon management activity in this paper we review the research literature on urban carbon metabolism carbon accounting based on land use and cover change the spatial analysis of urban carbon metabolism and the main driving forces and scenario simulation fig 1 this study provides a scientific basis for future spatial planning and designs of low carbon cities 2 urban carbon metabolic process the concept of urban metabolism was first put forward by wolman 1965 who similar to describing a natural metabolic process described the complete process of material and energy input to and output from a city as a key ecological factor in urban metabolism carbon s metabolic process has received extensive attention from researchers sovacool and brown 2009 baccini 1996 first advanced the concept of urban carbon metabolism and considered carbon emissions caused by food processing industrial trade energy conversion residential consumption waste management and other social and economic activities as well as carbon sequestration owing to natural components such as farmland and forest this provided a conceptual framework for understanding urban horizontal carbon flows churkina 2008 urban carbon metabolism research firstly focused on metabolic process accounting and opened the black box of the city through the analysis of its material flows while exploring its internal metabolic mechanism the early research focused on the social and economic components of carbon emissions e g carbon emissions caused by electricity heat and industrial fuel surface transportation fuel industrial processes and waste of ten megacities kennedy et al 2010 household energy use in xiamen china ye et al 2011 and port city transportation activities in barcelona spain villalba and gemechu 2011 later some scholars considered the urban carbon transfer process in a human nature coupled system for example kellett et al 2013 considered natural components such as vegetation carbon sequestration when accounting for carbon emissions on the south side of vancouver canada resulting from social and economic activities such as the energy consumption of buildings and vehicles they considered the natural components of vancouver s carbon accounting system but found that accounting for natural components was still insufficient on the basis of social and economic components zhang et al 2016 considered the natural components of vertical carbon flux such as forest land grassland wetland and farmland most of these studies focused on the key metabolic pathways namely the vertical direction of carbon emissions and carbon sequestration while only a few scholars paid attention to the horizontal flows among different metabolic components within urban carbon balance chen and chen 2012 in their exploration of the process mechanism and circulation efficiency of the carbon cycle and metabolism zhang et al 2015a on the basis of carbon accounting some scholars tried to simulate integral carbon flow and the structure and function of carbon metabolism some used input output method to estimate final energy use cross border transportation and the carbon embodied in energy consumption when producing food water fuel cement and other products hillman and ramaswami 2010 while others used life cycle assessment to estimate the entire life cycle accumulation of carbon emissions wiedmann and minx 2007 hillman and ramaswami 2010 recommended that cities also track core metrics on end use energy and materials efficiency to understand and model their current and future carbon emissions none of these researchers studied urban carbon metabolism from the perspective of networks the rise of ecological network analysis has provided a new way to study the structure and function of carbon metabolism e g in a study of the ecological relationships and control situation of carbon metabolism in vienna austria chen and chen 2012 this approach can evaluate the overall characteristics of urban carbon metabolic system more comprehensively and intuitively from the perspective of the network based on this newer direction lu et al 2015 emphasized metabolic behavior and the stability of a structural analysis in studies of the ecological aspects of carbon metabolism in industrial parks lu and chen 2015 albeit at a smaller scale simulated carbon embodied in material and energy production transformation consumption emission and decomposition of a community zhao et al 2014 focused on embodied carbon interactions the scale of urban carbon metabolism modes and the efficiency between a city and the external environment among different subsystems of a city and between urban and rural areas however all of these previous studies ignored the spatial properties of carbon metabolism and did not reflect its spatial transfer based on land use changes xia et al 2016 used ecological network analysis method to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon metabolism better serving the goals of city planning low carbon city spatial design and global carbon emissions reduction in the present study we aim to conduct spatial analysis of urban carbon metabolism based on land use and cover change lucc including land use carbon accounting spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors and prediction simulation 3 carbon accounting based on land use and cover change unlike traditional urban carbon accounting land based carbon emissions are focused more on spatial attributes more attention was paid to the natural components at the early stage of such studies and researchers started the carbon emission and uptake studies in a vertical direction at different scales bolin 1977 first studied the relationship between lucc and the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems then scholars conducted carbon accounting at global mcguire et al 2001 continental canadell et al 2009 and national pan et al 2004 scales table 1 including tropical areas lambin et al 2003 forest ecosystems at medium and high latitudes kauppi et al 1992 and grassland ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas these researchers studied carbon emission and uptake in the process of conversion from natural components to socio economic components with a further increase at the scale and scope of human activities scholars expanded their studies to include plantation land fang et al 2007 farmland levy et al 2004 pasture lambin et al 2003 construction land hutyra et al 2011 and other socio economic components based on woodland grassland and other natural components the research perspective gradually shifted from the natural ecosystem to the anthropogenic natural coupling system the scale of the studies also shifted from the original regional scale to metropolitan lee et al 2009 and urban scales xia et al 2016 yet land use based urban carbon metabolism accounting continues to use the methods of land use change carbon accounting at large scales the accounting methods include field surveys houghton 1999 the process model method sitch et al 2003 and the remote sensing method hurtt et al 2001 in field surveys vegetation biomass is obtained through field sampling and then the biomass is multiplied by a carbon conversion coefficient to obtain the vegetation s carbon storage capacity among these the most typical study follows the bookkeeping model houghton 1999 fang et al 2007 obtained the size of the chinese forest carbon pool and its temporal and spatial changes by applying forest inventory data and biomass data based on a revised biomass conversion factor however the data obtained from field surveys often lack input from long term observations and it is difficult to carry out a dynamic analysis of the time series an ecosystem process model can combine information about land use change with its associated processes to a large extent to improve the accuracy of the carbon cycle dynamics caused by land use change table 1 scholars have used many other types of models including the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model defries et al 1999 four kinds of process based terrestrial biosphere models combined with the bookkeeping model tbms mcguire et al 2001 the lund potsdam jena dynamic global vegetation lpj model sitch et al 2003 the hybrid process model levy et al 2004 the terrestrial ecosystem model tem and the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2010 the emergence and application of remote sensing technology provide improved technical support for the accurate study of the impact of lucc on the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle and also make it possible to better monitor land use and cover change over time some examples of remote sensing technology include regional forest vegetation carbon stock accounting donga et al 2003 a study of land cover change in the amazon region of brazil cardille and foley 2003 and analysis of land use change in small parts of central italy pelorosso et al 2009 the urban carbon metabolism process based on land use change involves multiple subjects and multiple transmission paths which inevitably form complex networks this makes it possible the introduction of the ecological network model to simulate urban carbon metabolism ecological network analysis can be used to effectively identify the carbon transfer process between the various land use types and to study more comprehensively the carbon metabolism process of urban agglomeration rendering the entire system a white box xia et al 2016 later some scholars combined two of the above methods such as a field survey and modeling christen et al 2010 and a field survey and remote sensing chrysoulakis et al 2013 the combination of empirical data a remote sensing model and a geographic information system gis gives a better spatial expression of the relationship between lucc and carbon emissions hutyra et al 2011 moreover xia et al 2016 used the ecological network model and the empirical coefficient method combined with geographic information system software arcgis esri ca usa to clarify the carbon metabolism process network comprising natural and socio economic carbon metabolism in beijing china the emergence of software such as arcgis and remote sensing technologies provides more possibilities for the expression of the spatial properties of urban carbon metabolism 4 spatial analysis with the rise and development of geographic information systems arcgis more straightforward and efficient expressions of the spatial pattern of carbon emissions and absorption based on land use and cover change have been developed muÃ±oz rojas et al 2011 tao et al 2015 at present the studies of urban carbon spatial patterns are mainly focused on carbon emissions and absorption due to land use and cover change and on analysis of spatial differentiation of regional carbon emissions and absorption for instance high latitudes act as carbon sources based on lucc while mid to high latitudes act as carbon sinks kauppi et al 1992 however in terms of a national level the trends of carbon transformation from source to sink started in the 1980s in europe and around 1920 in the united states because of large forest land chen and tian 2007 in terms of city scale svirejeva hopkins and schellnhuber 2008 pointed out that chinese cities as well as some other asian cities acted as carbon sources while some other regions were in the process of making or had made the transition from carbon sources to carbon sinks such as highly industrialized european regions hi regions additionally some scholars have pointed out that the northern northeastern south central and southeastern cities of the united states had a higher level of forest carbon storage while showing a lower level in rocky mountain california pacific northwest and great plains in terms of average value the southeast north and northeast levels were higher than those of other areas nowak and crane 2002 later some scholars studied the distribution characteristic of carbon stock within a city they analyzed the discrepancy of carbon emissions of different land components such as urban green areas slums and built up areas svirejeva hopkins and schellnhuber 2006 and the carbon sinks spatial distribution of five urban forests mcpherson et al 2005 based on the aforementioned studies sun et al 2015 presented details about the temporal and spatial evolution of land use carbon intensity in 31 chinese provinces and discussed their spatial correlation characteristics to reveal the spatial interaction mechanism between the components most of these studies were more focused on the discrete form rather than on the continuous change gradient in studying carbon emissions and carbon uptake some scholars then started to use the spatial interpolation tool of arcgis software to obtain the continuous spatial change gradient among these a number of researchers made spatial expressions based on field sampling hutyra et al 2011 the differences between the carbon uptake and carbon emissions in the buffer zone at different distances from the center of seattle washington usa indicated that the higher amount of carbon stock and the smaller amount of carbon emissions were found far from the city center other scholars such as tao et al 2015 used the invest model with acquired remote sensing data to discover the discrepancy between urban and rural carbon storage their study indicated that both the amount of carbon storage and carbon density increased going from an urban to a rural area zhang et al 2016 took a different approach and combined an empirical coefficient with the arcgis transfer matrix to investigate the cascade change of carbon uptake based on lucc their conclusions showed that carbon emissions and absorption in beijing both formed a decreasing gradient but the former exhibited a single center while the latter exhibited multiple centers 5 influencing factors and scenario simulation based on lucc factors affecting urban carbon emissions uptake include socio economic factors such as per capita gdp zhang et al 2014 total population wang et al 2012 economic growth zhang et al 2014 energy intensity zhao et al 2010 energy structure zhang et al 2016 with the process of urbanization accelerating urban form and urban structure pataki et al 2006 have a significant impact on urban carbon emissions and sustainable urban development many scholars have recently begun to analyze the factors influencing urban carbon emissions and uptake based on lucc such as the impact of land use changes guo and gifford 2002 land use efficiency cui et al 2015 and land production and size yang 2015 on the density and efficiency of urban carbon emissions and uptake in fact lucc is considered the second largest factor contributing to global co2 emission except for fossil fuel burning human activities such as infrastructure construction economic development industrial zones urban planning and energy consumption are all tightly connected to land use and they will eventually be implemented in different ways of using land zhao et al 2010 hence identifying the impact of land use and cover change on carbon emissions and uptake is important for spatial adjustment and planning of ultimately sustainable low carbon cities however different types of land use changes have different impacts on the carbon cycle of an ecosystem chen and tian 2007 kasimir klemedtsson et al 1997 found that from 5 to 23 times the amount of co2 will be released into the atmosphere when swampland is reclaimed as farmland and approximately 27 of the soil s organic carbon will be released into the atmosphere when grassland or forest is changed into farmland houghton and goodale 2004 organic carbon storage in vegetation and soil will increase when farmland is changed into grassland or forest houghton et al 1983 the conversion process from grassland to urban land will manifest as carbon sinks because farmland is regarded as a carbon source while urban non industrial carbon releases are to be considered zero chen and tian 2007 therefore it is particularly important to carry out land consolidation and urban spatial adjustment considering the spatial distribution the researchers that carried out the aforementioned studies however did not quantitatively analyze the factors affecting carbon emissions from land use change common influencing factor decomposition methods include the laspeyres index method simple average decomposition sad the adaptive weighting divisia awd method ang 2005 the logarithmic mean d index decomposition method lmdi the stirpat model and the kaya formula analysis of the evolution of carbon emissions from land use and its influencing factors can provide a scientific basis for the intensive use of land and fossil energy through the analysis of driving forces the simulation of carbon and carbon uptake based on land use and cover change can be implemented levy et al 2004 constructed three scenarios no land use changes land use changes sres b2 scenario and land use changes with population variation b2 scenario chen and chen 2012 explored the carbon emissions from land use in four scenarios no low carbon economic policy constraints weak low carbon economy orientation moderate low carbon economy orientation and obvious low carbon economy orientation rittenhouse and rissman 2012 used three stepped scenarios of land cover changes to simulate their impact on carbon sinks based on the clue s model dai and zhang 2013 constructed five scenarios natural growth water resources constraints land use structure optimization economic development and ecological protection to simulate carbon emission caused by land use change xia et al 2016 using trend extrapolation of the business as usual bau scenario as a reference devised a scale control scenario si a structure control scenario ss and an efficiency control scenario se as well as scenarios that control two or three factors at the same time such as structure scale control scenario sis structure efficiency control scenario sse scale efficiency control scenario sie and scale structure efficiency control scenario sise under current pressures to balance economic development energy savings and emissions reduction it is possible to better control the spatial pattern of urban carbon metabolism and optimize the structure of cities toward low carbon scenarios 6 future directions this study can be used to improve the understanding of the entire urban carbon metabolic system in the existing research traditional urban carbon metabolism accounting has been focused more on carbon emissions caused by social and economic activities while investigations of carbon emissions based on land use and cover change more focused on carbon flows caused by change in the carbon stock of natural components therefore forming a combined anthropogenic natural process to complete the urban carbon metabolism is necessary however past studies only focused on the vertical direction of carbon flows while horizontal urban carbon flows between different components were ignored future urban carbon metabolism accounting needs to consider both horizontal and vertical carbon flows as well as the input from and output to the urban external environment to complete the description of the entire carbon metabolism process urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis can serve the planning and design of low carbon cities in the future and provides a scientific basis for urban sustainable development the existing urban carbon metabolism studies have paid much attention to spatial distribution but more focused on the pattern of distribution and spatial gradients furthermore the spatial unit has been mainly concerned with levels of city district and county and has not yet been implemented to the level of patches which is useful in a more accurate and fine spatial analysis future research can lead to combining software like arcgis with remote sensing technology to increase resolution better identify the current carbon metabolic problems in cities and their surrounding environment and to better serve the government s spatial distribution requirements and optimize regulation of carbon metabolism in the future urban carbon metabolism studies can be extended to the carbon metabolism of metropolitan areas completing the carbon metabolism process among cities and within and among larger regions with increasing study scale finer spatial units and worse regional environment the relative studies will be more meaningful in the future scholars can construct a multi level carbon metabolic network model this type of studies start from point line to surface and finally to the network to achieve the multi scale associative coupling that is beneficial to the coordinated control of regional carbon metabolism and the reduction of regional carbon emission acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

25323,urban areas have contributed 75 of the global co2 emissions therefore seeking global carbon reduction solutions from the perspective of city has become a focus of decision makers in charge of environmental protection the carbon emission reduction potential in land management and spatial adjustment has become an important mean for achieving regional and global sustainable development in this paper we systematically review and synthesize four main aspects of urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis namely 1 advances in urban carbon metabolism 2 carbon accounting based on land use and cover change 3 spatial distribution of urban carbon metabolism and influencing factors and 4 forecasting based on land use change land use and cover change lucc in addition we point out current deficiencies in the study of urban carbon metabolism such as incomplete process analysis and lack of spatial display based on previous research we propose a spatial analysis centric outlook on urban carbon metabolism including the following key approaches 1 future researchers should simultaneously consider natural and socioeconomic components as well as vertical flows from land to atmosphere and horizontal flows among different land use types carbon flows to obtain a more complete picture of the entire urban carbon metabolism system 2 carbon metabolic spatial mapping can be implemented in patches to better serve government s goals for optimal regulation and spatial planning 3 researchers should refine current urban scale research also expanding it to the metropolitan i e urban agglomeration scale to establish multi scale multi level and organic network structures and study the spatial distribution pattern of carbon metabolism within and among cities and metropolitan areas which will lay a scientific foundation for urban regional and national sustainable development keywords urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis lucc sustainable development 1 introduction in recent years significant pressure to reduce co2 emissions has attracted more and more attention of government policy makers in spite of efforts to reduce fossil fuel combustion studies have shown that co2 emissions caused by global energy consumption have remained relatively stable for two consecutive years about 321gt in 2016 therefore transforming carbon emissions patterns and seeking more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions are necessary the 2007 ipcc report pointed out that about 80 of anthropogenic carbon emissions were from urban areas within which approximately one third are from land use and cover change lucc thus land management and spatial adjustment have become every country s key task to reduce urban and even global carbon emissions previous urban carbon cycle and carbon metabolism research has been reviewed from the viewpoint of industrial ecology and sociology and also through studies that use carbon accounting process analysis inside and outside cities zhao and huang 2013 these studies assess the content including energy consumption industry production agriculture production solid waste forest grassland water and external flows and methods including greenhouse gas inventory method field observation model construction and rs based method of carbon accounting zhang et al 2015b and factors influencing carbon emissions li et al 2013 this represents a shift in the research focus from macroscopic mode to microscopic mechanisms zhao and huang 2013 and from a single process of either a natural or anthropogenic process to a combined anthropogenic natural process however previous studies did not consider carbon flows among urban components from the perspective of spatial adjustment spatial analysis more intuitively demonstrates the distribution and spatial transfer of carbon metabolism it can provide a scientific foundation for land planning industrial distribution change and spatial adjustment of carbon management activity in this paper we review the research literature on urban carbon metabolism carbon accounting based on land use and cover change the spatial analysis of urban carbon metabolism and the main driving forces and scenario simulation fig 1 this study provides a scientific basis for future spatial planning and designs of low carbon cities 2 urban carbon metabolic process the concept of urban metabolism was first put forward by wolman 1965 who similar to describing a natural metabolic process described the complete process of material and energy input to and output from a city as a key ecological factor in urban metabolism carbon s metabolic process has received extensive attention from researchers sovacool and brown 2009 baccini 1996 first advanced the concept of urban carbon metabolism and considered carbon emissions caused by food processing industrial trade energy conversion residential consumption waste management and other social and economic activities as well as carbon sequestration owing to natural components such as farmland and forest this provided a conceptual framework for understanding urban horizontal carbon flows churkina 2008 urban carbon metabolism research firstly focused on metabolic process accounting and opened the black box of the city through the analysis of its material flows while exploring its internal metabolic mechanism the early research focused on the social and economic components of carbon emissions e g carbon emissions caused by electricity heat and industrial fuel surface transportation fuel industrial processes and waste of ten megacities kennedy et al 2010 household energy use in xiamen china ye et al 2011 and port city transportation activities in barcelona spain villalba and gemechu 2011 later some scholars considered the urban carbon transfer process in a human nature coupled system for example kellett et al 2013 considered natural components such as vegetation carbon sequestration when accounting for carbon emissions on the south side of vancouver canada resulting from social and economic activities such as the energy consumption of buildings and vehicles they considered the natural components of vancouver s carbon accounting system but found that accounting for natural components was still insufficient on the basis of social and economic components zhang et al 2016 considered the natural components of vertical carbon flux such as forest land grassland wetland and farmland most of these studies focused on the key metabolic pathways namely the vertical direction of carbon emissions and carbon sequestration while only a few scholars paid attention to the horizontal flows among different metabolic components within urban carbon balance chen and chen 2012 in their exploration of the process mechanism and circulation efficiency of the carbon cycle and metabolism zhang et al 2015a on the basis of carbon accounting some scholars tried to simulate integral carbon flow and the structure and function of carbon metabolism some used input output method to estimate final energy use cross border transportation and the carbon embodied in energy consumption when producing food water fuel cement and other products hillman and ramaswami 2010 while others used life cycle assessment to estimate the entire life cycle accumulation of carbon emissions wiedmann and minx 2007 hillman and ramaswami 2010 recommended that cities also track core metrics on end use energy and materials efficiency to understand and model their current and future carbon emissions none of these researchers studied urban carbon metabolism from the perspective of networks the rise of ecological network analysis has provided a new way to study the structure and function of carbon metabolism e g in a study of the ecological relationships and control situation of carbon metabolism in vienna austria chen and chen 2012 this approach can evaluate the overall characteristics of urban carbon metabolic system more comprehensively and intuitively from the perspective of the network based on this newer direction lu et al 2015 emphasized metabolic behavior and the stability of a structural analysis in studies of the ecological aspects of carbon metabolism in industrial parks lu and chen 2015 albeit at a smaller scale simulated carbon embodied in material and energy production transformation consumption emission and decomposition of a community zhao et al 2014 focused on embodied carbon interactions the scale of urban carbon metabolism modes and the efficiency between a city and the external environment among different subsystems of a city and between urban and rural areas however all of these previous studies ignored the spatial properties of carbon metabolism and did not reflect its spatial transfer based on land use changes xia et al 2016 used ecological network analysis method to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon metabolism better serving the goals of city planning low carbon city spatial design and global carbon emissions reduction in the present study we aim to conduct spatial analysis of urban carbon metabolism based on land use and cover change lucc including land use carbon accounting spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors and prediction simulation 3 carbon accounting based on land use and cover change unlike traditional urban carbon accounting land based carbon emissions are focused more on spatial attributes more attention was paid to the natural components at the early stage of such studies and researchers started the carbon emission and uptake studies in a vertical direction at different scales bolin 1977 first studied the relationship between lucc and the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems then scholars conducted carbon accounting at global mcguire et al 2001 continental canadell et al 2009 and national pan et al 2004 scales table 1 including tropical areas lambin et al 2003 forest ecosystems at medium and high latitudes kauppi et al 1992 and grassland ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas these researchers studied carbon emission and uptake in the process of conversion from natural components to socio economic components with a further increase at the scale and scope of human activities scholars expanded their studies to include plantation land fang et al 2007 farmland levy et al 2004 pasture lambin et al 2003 construction land hutyra et al 2011 and other socio economic components based on woodland grassland and other natural components the research perspective gradually shifted from the natural ecosystem to the anthropogenic natural coupling system the scale of the studies also shifted from the original regional scale to metropolitan lee et al 2009 and urban scales xia et al 2016 yet land use based urban carbon metabolism accounting continues to use the methods of land use change carbon accounting at large scales the accounting methods include field surveys houghton 1999 the process model method sitch et al 2003 and the remote sensing method hurtt et al 2001 in field surveys vegetation biomass is obtained through field sampling and then the biomass is multiplied by a carbon conversion coefficient to obtain the vegetation s carbon storage capacity among these the most typical study follows the bookkeeping model houghton 1999 fang et al 2007 obtained the size of the chinese forest carbon pool and its temporal and spatial changes by applying forest inventory data and biomass data based on a revised biomass conversion factor however the data obtained from field surveys often lack input from long term observations and it is difficult to carry out a dynamic analysis of the time series an ecosystem process model can combine information about land use change with its associated processes to a large extent to improve the accuracy of the carbon cycle dynamics caused by land use change table 1 scholars have used many other types of models including the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model defries et al 1999 four kinds of process based terrestrial biosphere models combined with the bookkeeping model tbms mcguire et al 2001 the lund potsdam jena dynamic global vegetation lpj model sitch et al 2003 the hybrid process model levy et al 2004 the terrestrial ecosystem model tem and the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2010 the emergence and application of remote sensing technology provide improved technical support for the accurate study of the impact of lucc on the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle and also make it possible to better monitor land use and cover change over time some examples of remote sensing technology include regional forest vegetation carbon stock accounting donga et al 2003 a study of land cover change in the amazon region of brazil cardille and foley 2003 and analysis of land use change in small parts of central italy pelorosso et al 2009 the urban carbon metabolism process based on land use change involves multiple subjects and multiple transmission paths which inevitably form complex networks this makes it possible the introduction of the ecological network model to simulate urban carbon metabolism ecological network analysis can be used to effectively identify the carbon transfer process between the various land use types and to study more comprehensively the carbon metabolism process of urban agglomeration rendering the entire system a white box xia et al 2016 later some scholars combined two of the above methods such as a field survey and modeling christen et al 2010 and a field survey and remote sensing chrysoulakis et al 2013 the combination of empirical data a remote sensing model and a geographic information system gis gives a better spatial expression of the relationship between lucc and carbon emissions hutyra et al 2011 moreover xia et al 2016 used the ecological network model and the empirical coefficient method combined with geographic information system software arcgis esri ca usa to clarify the carbon metabolism process network comprising natural and socio economic carbon metabolism in beijing china the emergence of software such as arcgis and remote sensing technologies provides more possibilities for the expression of the spatial properties of urban carbon metabolism 4 spatial analysis with the rise and development of geographic information systems arcgis more straightforward and efficient expressions of the spatial pattern of carbon emissions and absorption based on land use and cover change have been developed muÃ±oz rojas et al 2011 tao et al 2015 at present the studies of urban carbon spatial patterns are mainly focused on carbon emissions and absorption due to land use and cover change and on analysis of spatial differentiation of regional carbon emissions and absorption for instance high latitudes act as carbon sources based on lucc while mid to high latitudes act as carbon sinks kauppi et al 1992 however in terms of a national level the trends of carbon transformation from source to sink started in the 1980s in europe and around 1920 in the united states because of large forest land chen and tian 2007 in terms of city scale svirejeva hopkins and schellnhuber 2008 pointed out that chinese cities as well as some other asian cities acted as carbon sources while some other regions were in the process of making or had made the transition from carbon sources to carbon sinks such as highly industrialized european regions hi regions additionally some scholars have pointed out that the northern northeastern south central and southeastern cities of the united states had a higher level of forest carbon storage while showing a lower level in rocky mountain california pacific northwest and great plains in terms of average value the southeast north and northeast levels were higher than those of other areas nowak and crane 2002 later some scholars studied the distribution characteristic of carbon stock within a city they analyzed the discrepancy of carbon emissions of different land components such as urban green areas slums and built up areas svirejeva hopkins and schellnhuber 2006 and the carbon sinks spatial distribution of five urban forests mcpherson et al 2005 based on the aforementioned studies sun et al 2015 presented details about the temporal and spatial evolution of land use carbon intensity in 31 chinese provinces and discussed their spatial correlation characteristics to reveal the spatial interaction mechanism between the components most of these studies were more focused on the discrete form rather than on the continuous change gradient in studying carbon emissions and carbon uptake some scholars then started to use the spatial interpolation tool of arcgis software to obtain the continuous spatial change gradient among these a number of researchers made spatial expressions based on field sampling hutyra et al 2011 the differences between the carbon uptake and carbon emissions in the buffer zone at different distances from the center of seattle washington usa indicated that the higher amount of carbon stock and the smaller amount of carbon emissions were found far from the city center other scholars such as tao et al 2015 used the invest model with acquired remote sensing data to discover the discrepancy between urban and rural carbon storage their study indicated that both the amount of carbon storage and carbon density increased going from an urban to a rural area zhang et al 2016 took a different approach and combined an empirical coefficient with the arcgis transfer matrix to investigate the cascade change of carbon uptake based on lucc their conclusions showed that carbon emissions and absorption in beijing both formed a decreasing gradient but the former exhibited a single center while the latter exhibited multiple centers 5 influencing factors and scenario simulation based on lucc factors affecting urban carbon emissions uptake include socio economic factors such as per capita gdp zhang et al 2014 total population wang et al 2012 economic growth zhang et al 2014 energy intensity zhao et al 2010 energy structure zhang et al 2016 with the process of urbanization accelerating urban form and urban structure pataki et al 2006 have a significant impact on urban carbon emissions and sustainable urban development many scholars have recently begun to analyze the factors influencing urban carbon emissions and uptake based on lucc such as the impact of land use changes guo and gifford 2002 land use efficiency cui et al 2015 and land production and size yang 2015 on the density and efficiency of urban carbon emissions and uptake in fact lucc is considered the second largest factor contributing to global co2 emission except for fossil fuel burning human activities such as infrastructure construction economic development industrial zones urban planning and energy consumption are all tightly connected to land use and they will eventually be implemented in different ways of using land zhao et al 2010 hence identifying the impact of land use and cover change on carbon emissions and uptake is important for spatial adjustment and planning of ultimately sustainable low carbon cities however different types of land use changes have different impacts on the carbon cycle of an ecosystem chen and tian 2007 kasimir klemedtsson et al 1997 found that from 5 to 23 times the amount of co2 will be released into the atmosphere when swampland is reclaimed as farmland and approximately 27 of the soil s organic carbon will be released into the atmosphere when grassland or forest is changed into farmland houghton and goodale 2004 organic carbon storage in vegetation and soil will increase when farmland is changed into grassland or forest houghton et al 1983 the conversion process from grassland to urban land will manifest as carbon sinks because farmland is regarded as a carbon source while urban non industrial carbon releases are to be considered zero chen and tian 2007 therefore it is particularly important to carry out land consolidation and urban spatial adjustment considering the spatial distribution the researchers that carried out the aforementioned studies however did not quantitatively analyze the factors affecting carbon emissions from land use change common influencing factor decomposition methods include the laspeyres index method simple average decomposition sad the adaptive weighting divisia awd method ang 2005 the logarithmic mean d index decomposition method lmdi the stirpat model and the kaya formula analysis of the evolution of carbon emissions from land use and its influencing factors can provide a scientific basis for the intensive use of land and fossil energy through the analysis of driving forces the simulation of carbon and carbon uptake based on land use and cover change can be implemented levy et al 2004 constructed three scenarios no land use changes land use changes sres b2 scenario and land use changes with population variation b2 scenario chen and chen 2012 explored the carbon emissions from land use in four scenarios no low carbon economic policy constraints weak low carbon economy orientation moderate low carbon economy orientation and obvious low carbon economy orientation rittenhouse and rissman 2012 used three stepped scenarios of land cover changes to simulate their impact on carbon sinks based on the clue s model dai and zhang 2013 constructed five scenarios natural growth water resources constraints land use structure optimization economic development and ecological protection to simulate carbon emission caused by land use change xia et al 2016 using trend extrapolation of the business as usual bau scenario as a reference devised a scale control scenario si a structure control scenario ss and an efficiency control scenario se as well as scenarios that control two or three factors at the same time such as structure scale control scenario sis structure efficiency control scenario sse scale efficiency control scenario sie and scale structure efficiency control scenario sise under current pressures to balance economic development energy savings and emissions reduction it is possible to better control the spatial pattern of urban carbon metabolism and optimize the structure of cities toward low carbon scenarios 6 future directions this study can be used to improve the understanding of the entire urban carbon metabolic system in the existing research traditional urban carbon

studies only focused on the vertical direction of carbon flows while horizontal urban carbon flows between different components were ignored future urban carbon metabolism accounting needs to consider both horizontal and vertical carbon flows as well as the input from and output to the urban external environment to complete the description of the entire carbon metabolism process urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis can serve the planning and design of low carbon cities in the future and provides a scientific basis for urban sustainable development the existing urban carbon metabolism studies have paid much attention to spatial distribution but more focused on the pattern of distribution and spatial gradients furthermore the spatial unit has been mainly concerned with levels of city district and county and has not yet been implemented to the level of patches which is useful in a more accurate and fine spatial analysis future research can lead to combining software like arcgis with remote sensing technology to increase resolution better identify the current carbon metabolic problems in cities and their surrounding environment and to better serve the government s spatial distribution requirements and optimize regulation of carbon metabolism in the future urban carbon metabolism studies can be extended to the carbon metabolism of metropolitan areas completing the carbon metabolism process among cities and within and among larger regions with increasing study scale finer spatial units and worse regional environment the relative studies will be more meaningful in the future scholars can construct a multi level carbon metabolic network model this type of studies start from point line to surface and finally to the network to achieve the multi scale

25324,patterned landscapes have long been a popular setting to test hypotheses about the effects of processes on ecosystem structure the combination of scale dependent and positive feedback theory is one of the most well supported in current literature each explaining separate aspects of patterned peatlands these theories have been developed from dynamics in boreal peatlands and tested in boreal systems but the mechanisms that control peat patterning in a sub tropical system have yet to be acknowledged in theory statistical evidence for different mechanisms are present in the biophysical features of sub tropical patterned peatlands such as the ridge and slough landscape rsl within the greater everglades wetland system we use data from the rsl to test whether features of a sub tropical patterned peatland conform to positive and scale dependent feedback patterning theories developed in boreal peatlands and use dynamic simulation to explain our results the analysis of surface elements and nutrient differences within the rsl and our dynamic simulations indicate that positive and scale dependent feedback may not be appropriate theories for sub tropical peat patterning decomposition rather than production appears to be more important for abrupt microtopographical elevation differences and differential nutrient concentrations are due to vegetation types rather than increased evapotranspiration from greater vascular plant growth our model expands on the current theories for rsl maintenance incorporating vegetation types and life history traits into differential peat deposition which create the signature microtopographical differences found in the everglades and demonstrates that the underlying ecological patterning processes in sub tropical peatlands are likely very different from boreal peatlands and require further discussion and study keywords landscape pattern positive feedback patterned peatlands restoration everglades sub tropical 1 introduction patterned landscapes have long been a popular setting to test hypotheses about the effects of processes on ecosystem patterning couteron and lejeune 2001 eppinga et al 2008 klausmeier 1999 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 specifically research in patterned peatlands has introduced a set self organization theories to explain how regularly patterned microtopography exists on the landscape belyea and lancaster 2002 couwenberg and joosten 2005 rietkerk et al 2004 swanson and grigal 1988 these include scale dependent feedback eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 differences in hydraulic conductivity between hummocks and hollows couwenberg and joosten 2005 foster et al 1983 glaser 1992 uplift by frost heaving brown 1970 eppinga et al 2008 moore and bellamy 1974 and the role of seasonal flooding sakaguchi 1980 seppÃ¤lÃ¤ and koutaniemi 1985 two different mechanisms within the scale dependent feedback theory nutrient accumulation and peat accumulation are the most well supported in current literature eppinga et al 2009a watts et al 2010 each explaining separate aspects of patterned peatlands the peat accumulation mechanism assumes that sharp microtopographical differences between ridges and hollows are reinforced by greater plant production on drier ridges primarily from the increased presence of vascular plants belyea and clymo 2001 hilbert et al 2000 rietkerk et al 2004 swanson and grigal 1988 plant productivity which determines the input of biomass to peat production belyea and clymo 2001 eppinga et al 2009a hilbert et al 2000 is a function of peat thickness a proxy for water stress on productivity eppinga et al 2009a net peat accumulation in this mechanism is primarily a function of plant production and peat decomposition both driven by water table depth evidence for this mechanism expressed as sharp microtopographical differences is a bimodal frequency distribution of surface elements vascular plant biomass or acrotelm thickness eppinga et al 2008 and is well documented in boreal peatlands eppinga et al 2009a this feedback has been studied along a climactic gradient eppinga et al 2010 and focused on the evapotranspiration et and precipitation ratio in sites dominated by temperate and sub arctic climates scotland sweden and siberia the nutrient accumulation mechanism on the other hand explains landscape patterning particularly regular string or maze patterning from the directed flow of water and nutrients into ridges by increased et of vascular plants rietkerk et al 2004 as nutrients accumulate within ridges from plant uptake and recycling vascular plant growth should increase and pull more water and nutrients by et reinforcing the nutrient accumulation cycle eppinga et al 2008 this occurs at a local scale within the ridge creating a negative effect for plants growing further from the ridge and generating a scale dependent feedback eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 these mechanisms have been developed from dynamics in boreal peatlands and tested as mathematical models or empirical models in temperate or boreal systems belyea and clymo 2001 couwenberg and joosten 2005 eppinga et al 2008 hilbert et al 2000 rietkerk et al 2004 a limited number of studies have discussed non boreal microtopography cheng et al 2011 couwenberg and joosten 2005 mcvoy et al 2011 nungesser 2003 and some aspects of scale dependent patterning theories have been applied to the sub tropical everglades heffernan et al 2013 larsen and harvey 2010 watts et al 2010 including nutrient accumulation effects larsen et al 2007 larsen et al 2015 these models were mainly theoretical studies but one data based analysis suggested that sub tropical peatlands do conform to boreal based peat accumulation mechanisms through elevation bimodality watts et al 2010 however we hypothesize that the mechanisms that control peat patterning in a sub tropical system should be different because increased temperatures longer photoperiod lack of seasonality and distinct vegetation communities contribute to differences in structuring processes through changes in decomposition and plant production aerts 1997 meentemeyer 1978 boreal based models include production and decomposition as a function of water stress and do not explicitly use temperature or differences in species attributes eppinga et al 2009a eppinga et al 2009b rietkerk et al 2004 which are likely important in a sub tropical climate statistical evidence for these differences between boreal and sub tropical processes would be present in the biophysical features of sub tropical patterned peatlands such as the ridge and slough landscape rsl within the greater everglades the everglades rsl is an example of a patterned peatland with parallel drainage topography whose patterning has been relatively stable on the landscape scale for thousands of years bernhardt and willard 2009 until water management for flood control and water supply was initiated in the early 20th century the historical rsl was a dominant landscape type of the central portion of the everglades and is a focus of the current restoration strategy the rsl consists of long linear ridges of sawgrass cladium jamaicense crantz longer hydroperiod sloughs open water areas with submerged aquatic plants and water lilies and occasional tree islands oriented parallel to the slow moving flow of water from northwest to southeast the rsl also includes a wet prairie community a short statured emergent community that is sometimes considered a result of over draining mcvoy et al 2011 but is a stable and important community for critically endangered wildlife zweig and kitchens 2014 this landscape has been fragmented by compartmentalization impoundment and reduced flows ogden 2005 and is now in a degraded state nungesser 2011 wu et al 2006 zweig et al 2011 we use data from the rsl explicitly considering wet prairie habitat to test whether features of a sub tropical patterned peatland do in fact conform to two patterning mechanisms of scale dependent feedback peat and nutrient accumulation prior studies within the rsl did not explicitly consider the wet prairie community or combined it with slough watts et al 2010 with productivity rates and biomass values between that of ridges and sloughs consideration of this community is expected to influence modality of biomass surface elements we tested modality of data based surface elements from the rsl plant biomass and elevation to determine the influence of the peat accumulation mechanism and differences between data based nutrient levels in ridge and sloughs as a basis for confirming the nutrient accumulation mechanism in sub tropical peatlands we also use a peat accumulation model based on species specific growth and decomposition rates to put the data based results into context 2 methods biomass and elevation data were taken from a long term monitoring study zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 zweig and kitchens 2014 within water conservation area 3a south wca3as fig 1 briefly 20 1 km2 plots were placed on the landscape in a stratified random manner stratified by water depth elevation and peat depth zweig and kitchens 2008 and 2 3 transects were randomly located in each plot transects always started in a slough and ran perpendicular to the flow gradient into a ridge transects ranged from 30 to 100 m in length we clipped above ground biomass in 0 25 m2 quadrats at 3 m intervals along transects samples were sorted to species oven dried to a constant weight and weighed to the nearest 0 1 g n 8464 our annual november sample events began in 2002 and continued to 2011 we also measured water depths at each 3 m interval to derive high resolution elevation data we acquired water stage surfaces from the everglades depth estimation network eden http sofia usgs gov eden for each day of sampling in 2002 and subtracted the measured water depth from the stage measurement at each site to obtain elevation of each sample point we only used 2002 water depth data n 1131 to avoid any changes in elevation associated with walking transects and disturbing peat 2 1 peat accumulation mechanism to address the applicability of the peat accumulation mechanism to sub tropical peatlands such as the everglades we tested for evidence of bimodality in elevation and biomass modality was tested by comparing the fit of our data to a unimodal and bimodal normal distribution eppinga et al 2008 watts et al 2010 with the statistical software r version 3 0 1 package mixsmsn except in the case of biomass biomass data was heavily right tailed so we used a package that could model skewed distributions a skewed t distribution and determined fit by bayes information criteria bic to compare to a similar rsl study watts et al 2010 we analyzed the biomass data two ways as a complete dataset and spatially by quadrant northeast southeast northwest and southwest fig 1 quadrants were used as proxies for water depth 9 30 cm deeper average water depths over the past 20 ears in the south due to impoundment eden and peat depth average depth 105 cm and 78 cm for the east and west respectively unpublished data zweig along landscape gradients the southeast quadrant was the most affected by impoundment and had the highest water depths zweig and kitchens 2008 2 2 nutrient accumulation mechanism to examine the applicability of the nutrient accumulation mechanism to sub tropical patterned peatlands we tested for differences in nutrient concentrations between ridge and sloughs using nutrient data collected for a prior study examining the effects of enrichment throughout all of water conservation area 3a bruland et al 2007 levene s statistic for data restricted to our study site wca3as indicated that variances were not homogenous so we compared nutrient concentrations in the top 10 cm of peat with a kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance test to determine significant differences between community types ridge prairie and slough n 184 we analyzed phosphorus instead of a suite of nutrients because the everglades is an extremely phosphorus limited system mccormick et al 1996 2 3 peat accumulation model we developed a closed form peat accretion model for the rsl in systems thinking experimental learning laboratory with animation stella v 10 0 4 isee systems lebanon new hampshire usa for two purposes one to understand how different species within vegetation communities contribute to peat deposition and elevation including belowground biomass and two to model the difference between peat deposition and elevation when the nutrient accumulation mechanism is applied to determine if this feedback was reflected in the everglades landscape our stella models were built from the conceptualization of the mechanics fig 2 of peat deposition in three different vegetation communities typical to the rsl ridge wet prairie and slough these simulate peat deposition at an annual time step and as a function of above and belowground biomass for each particular species within each community type within a 30 m 30 m area each model only had a few dominant species available for production and growth the ridge community contained c jamaicense and bacopa caroliniana as an edge species wet prairie and slough models contained the same species but were initialized with different biomasses nymphaea odorata utricularia spp b caroliniana eleocharis cellulosa and eleocharis elongata we developed two types of dynamic simulations one with nutrient accumulation to capture scale dependent feedback and one without any nutrient differences between vegetation communities to reflect only hydrodynamic control the main driving state variable was biomass which was a function of production belowground biomass was estimated as a simple ratio of aboveground biomass aboveground biomass b began as an initial condition defined as the average mass of the species in the community from our field data annual production p was simulated as a logistic function grace 2001 of biomass and what we suggest are critical environmental scalars air temperature hydroperiod maximum water depth and minimum water depth inundation i was only applied to c jamaicense and eleocharis spp fig 2 but at varying water depths for the different vegetation types eleocharis spp was configured to be less affected by deeper water than c jamaicense for simplicity the environmental scalars for production i ns t t shydro smin and smax table 1 were combined into one term denoted by scal in the equation below production for each species was summed for community p then is added to standing biomass b p b s c a l 1 b b m a x s c a l senescence s controled the flow from b to litter l and was a function of b p and for wet prairie slough communities only fig 2 dry down loss dd slough species such as n odorata was simulated to lose significant amounts of aboveground biomass when water depths are shallow dry down loss was an if then statement dependent on hydroperiod h but cannot lose more biomass than b s production standing biomass and the ratio of b to maximum biomass bmax controlled senescence s s p r a n d o m n u m b e r b e t w e e n 0 9 a n d 1 b b m a x 0 5 b biomass from senescence that flowed into litter l was then split between 3 processes 1 gaseous dissolved transport decomposition 2 particulate transport and 3 accretion these three processes were dependent on the species in the community as they differ in their lability and lignin content osborne et al 2007 particulate transport was a transformation term for flocculent material that was then moved out of the area by flow a flow of materials would come to bear in a spatial model gaseous dissolved transport was governed by temperature hydroperiod anoxic status and nutrient status 10 production for ridge center 8 for ridge edge and 5 for wet prairie peat was deposited from the below and aboveground accretion processes but had one outflow oxidation o accreted peat can be oxidized by exposure to air and by microbial processes so some proportion of peat was lost to oxidation each year depending on the hydrologic conditions we ran the model 200 times to capture random variance within the model for 100 years under three different hydrologic scenarios historic 90 of historic depths and 110 of historic depths we used the last 20 years of hydrologic data from site 64 in wca3as eden and repeated it four times to create a 100 year hydrologic dataset which causes some periodicity in the data site 64 represents the hydrology of the best conserved area of the rsl watts et al 2010 differences between hydrology for vegetation communities were calculated by adding 10 cm to site 64 depth data in a slough for wet prairie and 20 cm for the ridge so the same rainfall water management pattern would produce different hydroperiods minimums and maximums although low 20 cm is within the range of microtopological differences between ridge and slough in wca3as watts et al 2010 and typical of our dataset wet prairie was assumed to be in between these elevations at 10 cm below the ridge of the environmental scalars for production i ns t t shydro smin and smax all but t and t were affected by the different hydrologic regimes we did not test the sensitivity of the model to temperature as typical temperatures for our area do not normally fall higher than t or lower than t we did want to have temperature as part of the model for future climate scenarios to examine the difference between aboveground and aboveground belowground biomass as a surface element in a bimodal analysis for the peat accumulation mechanism we also ran each peat deposition model ridge prairie slough 50 times with randomly assigned initial biomasses for each species the random biomasses were selected from field data values and the initial species ratios were consistent with previous model runs as with the field data above we fit uni or bimodal normal distributions to the aboveground only data and the aboveground belowground ratio data to test for evidence of sharp microtopographical differences and to determine if adding belowground biomass would influence modality 3 results 3 1 peat accumulation mechanism 3 1 1 elevation data the lowest elevations occurred in the se quadrant near 190 cm above sea level with the highest elevations occurring in the north quadrants fig 3 overall the pooled landscape elevation data fit a bimodal distribution model better than unimodal distribution and that trend continued for the nw ne and sw quadrants table 2 in the se the most impounded and lowest of the quadrants the elevation data was distinctly unimodal fig 3 3 1 2 biomass data the biomass data distribution was heavily right tailed with the highest density of data points occurring between 0 and 10 g 0 25 m2 for all quadrants fig 4 and could not be modeled to fit a normal distribution bimodal or unimodal model fit analyses for a skewed t distribution indicated that biomass was unimodal in the northern quadrants and bimodal in the se table 3 the Î´bic for model fit in the sw was less than 1 0 and evidence for one model over the other is not strong kass and raftery 1995 separating vegetation communities fig 5 demonstrates that the heavy right tail of the biomass distribution is caused by sawgrass ridges and that they have relatively even distributed weights 3 2 nutrient accumulation mechanism there was a significant difference kruskal wallis test p 0 001 in total phosphorus between ridge average 0 43 mg kg 0 013 se and slough 0 35 mg kg 0 015 se but not between either ridge or slough and prairie 0 36 mg kg 0 043 se there were only 8 prairie samples which could account for the higher standard error in the prairie data the difference between total phosphorus in ridge and slough communities was statistically significant but has not shown to have a significant effect on vegetation production chambers and pederson 2006 ewe et al 2006 between the two communities this was reflected in the nutrient status runs of the dynamic simulation 3 3 peat accumulation model annual biomass estimates litter fall and production by species were within realistic ranges one standard deviation from the average table 4 of our field data and also within the ranges in published literature craft et al 1995 davis et al 2006 miao and zou 2012 serna et al 2013 providing model validation in the historic hydrology model sawgrass ridges deposited twice the amount of peat fig 6 a than wet prairie or slough kruskal wallis p 0 001 and the wet prairie and slough were not significantly different from each other in the nutrient runs fig 6b the middle of the ridge had increased production and increased decomposition from the non status runs the edge had some increased production wet prairies even less and sloughs had no increased production the ridge edge and middle were not significantly different from each other kruskal wallis p 0 16 and the wet prairie 0 0078 mm yr 0 00045 se produced approximately the same as the slough 0 0080 mm yr 0 00041 se the 110 hydrology was similar to the hydrology in the impounded se corner of wca3as and wet prairie produced the most biomass and peat deposition while this seemed counterintuitive it appears to be due to a species shift the community composition of this wet prairie at the end of 100 years of high water depths was more similar to the definition of slough than any other community fig 7 the model was able to simulate a transformation between communities under certain conditions but only wet prairie and slough because they shared model species this also provided validation of the model design as it captured the prairie species decline in biomass with wet conditions and slough species increase zweig and kitchens 2008 in the analysis of modeled aboveground versus aboveground belowground biomass the aboveground biomass fit a unimodal normal distribution better than a bimodal Î´bic 15 and the aboveground belowground biomass ratio with a skewed t distribution also fit a unimodal distribution Î´bic 19 the addition of belowground biomass did not affect the modality of the data 4 discussion while there was initial evidence that sub tropical patterned peatlands processes were similar to boreal patterned peatlands watts et al 2010 our ecological understanding of the rsl sub tropical system zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 zweig and kitchens 2014 indicated that differences in climate should significantly affect structuring processes and these patterned peatlands would not conform to current patterning theories most existing literature focuses on the theory of scale dependent feedback specifically the peat and nutrient accumulation mechanisms to describe both microtopographical differences and distinctive patterns in flat peatlands belyea and clymo 2001 eppinga et al 2009a rietkerk et al 2004 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 we used a combination of field data and modeling to ascertain their applicability in sub tropical patterned peatlands 4 1 peat accumulation mechanism according to the peat accumulation mechanism eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 distinct states in ridge and hollow landscapes should be evident from the bimodality of surface characteristics eppinga et al 2008 eppinga et al 2009b van de koppel et al 2001 elevation data representing peat depth from across the landscape within wca3as indicated that there are sharp microtopographical differences fig 3 in the three less inundated quadrants nw ne and sw and no statistically significant bimodality in the quadrant with the highest impoundment se this concurs with other rsl studies watts et al 2010 zweig et al 2011 and provides additional evidence of the degradation of the rsl pattern by impoundment and sustained high water however aboveground biomass another surface characteristic was unimodal even though it seemed logical to assume that a sawgrass dominated ridge would have more standing biomass than deep sloughs similar to boreal peatlands eppinga et al 2008 the biomass bimodality tests had to include skewed distributions not the typical normal distributions eppinga et al 2008 as the data was heavily right tailed even with a skewed t distribution which was a better model fit than a normal distribution the only bimodal quadrant was the southeast this southeastern impounded end of the rsl has lost a majority of its wet prairies zweig and kitchens 2014 zweig et al 2011 and it may be the wet prairie biomass bridging the lower biomass of the sloughs and higher biomass of the ridges that creates a unimodal distribution in rsl field data fig 5 we investigated the possibility that aboveground biomass while easier to collect is not appropriate as a surface characteristic and that we were missing critical information by not including belowground biomass however our peat accumulation model analysis determined that it was not a lack of data that created a unimodal distribution and the addition of belowground biomass did not affect its modality 4 2 reasons for deviations 4 2 1 disturbance there are two likely ecological reasons as to why biomass did not reflect the peat accumulation mechanism through bimodality within the everglades first is landscape instability and anthropogenic disturbance the lack of agreement between bimodality of elevation and biomass in the rsl might be indicative of degradation in the landscape pattern first seen in the vegetation and later through peat deposition in elevation like many wetlands large sections of the everglades rsl have been both over drained and inundated for extensive time periods davis and ogden 1994 givnish et al 2008 sklar and van der valk 2002 troxler and richards 2009 each having a similar effect on the landscape pattern namely a reduction of elevation differences between ridge and slough givnish et al 2008 mcvoy et al 2011 watts et al 2010 zweig et al 2011 literature has pointed to the presence of wet prairies on the landscape as an artifact of hydrologic degradation not a true community state in the rsl prairies are referred to as a transitional community between more stable ridges and sloughs heffernan et al 2013 mcvoy et al 2011 watts et al 2010 arising when sloughs are over drained and short stature emergent vegetation can dominate if this hypothesis is correct then the current observed unimodal nature of aboveground biomass is a precursor to microtopographical collapse where a feedback of drier conditions that encourage wet prairie growth and increased peat deposition from wet prairies will reduce the elevational difference between ridge and slough however according to the peat deposition model for either type of historic hydrology scale dependent or not wet prairies deposited approximately the same amount of peat as a slough in 100 years but much less than a ridge maintaining their position and stability on the landscape relative to the other communities if more water were added to the system as has been suggested to mimic a pre drainage everglades system mcvoy et al 2011 areas of wet prairie are expected to transition to slough mcvoy et al 2011 but according to the peat deposition models here the disappearance of wet prairies could be followed by a microtopographical collapse like the southeastern quadrant of wca3as fig 6 wet prairies may not be a transitional community between two stable states but a stable state of its own capable of maintaining its position on the landscape drying events that encourage the presence of wet prairies have occurred within wca3as but the most constant disturbance factor for the last 90 years has been inundation from pooling against the southern eastern levees zweig et al 2011 pooling is particularly apparent in the southeastern quadrant which has the additive effect even over the southwest quadrant of lower elevations decreased peat accretion on the ridges from decreased sawgrass productivity under a flooded regime childers et al 2006 and increased peat accretion in the sloughs from constant inundation and lack of flow act to reduce the elevation difference between ridge and sloughs this trend from the literature is also reflected in the unimodality of elevation in the inundated southeastern quadrant fig 3 and peat deposition model results fig 6 in the 110 historic hydrology a hydrology more similar but slightly shallower than what the southeastern quadrant of wca3as has experienced in the last 20 years the wet prairie transitions to a slough and the slough community is depositing more peat than the ridge reducing the microtopography of the system results from the dynamic simulations also suggest that the peat accumulation mechanism drier ridges produce more vascular peat biomass which increases the elevation of the ridge and encourages more plant growth that translates into sharp microtopographical differences may not apply to the rsl increased vascular plant growth on ridges does not appear to be the mechanism for increased ridge elevation according to the bimodality analysis in the peat deposition model during the historic hydrologic regime a hydrology from the middle and northern conserved watts et al 2010 sections of wca3as the ridge deposits more peat than wet prairies or sloughs enough to create a sharp microtopographical difference in ridges and slough elevation however it does not contain a sharp increase in biomass the biomass of ridges was evenly distributed fig 5 likely because c jamaicense is ubiquitous and can persist in areas where conditions are not ideal zweig and kitchens 2008 field data also shows that wet prairies contain a moderate amount of biomass fig 5 this suggests that the mechanism for sharp microtopographical differences in the rsl may be the differential decomposition of vegetation community species not differences in plant production 4 2 2 climactic differences this leads to the second underlying ecological possibility for a unimodal distribution in a rsl surface characteristic a fundamental difference between the vegetation of a sub tropical versus a boreal peatland vegetation communities seasonality nutrient dynamics and structuring process are very different between boreal and sub tropical wetlands processes in boreal peatlands are influenced by colder temperatures that slow decomposition and induce frost heaving brown 1970 moore and bellamy 1974 and they are also acidic systems eppinga et al 2009b siegel et al 2006 van breemen 1995 whose vegetation communities are largely dominated by one non vascular genus sphagnum moore and bellamy 1974 van breemen 1995 the presence of varied vascular vegetation communities in the everglades zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 and their fate in the process of decomposition and peat production could likely to be the main factor contributing to the difference between the bimodality of elevation and biomass difference in elevation between the ridges and sloughs lies not in the amount of biomass but how that biomass above and belowground transforms into peat through decomposition a recent study serna et al 2013 suggests that decomposition rates of rsl vascular plants are influenced more by species than habitat or water depth a sharp contrast to models from the boreal peatlands where decomposition is a function of water levels eppinga et al 2009a eppinga et al 2010 rietkerk et al 2004 greater net peat production on ridges is not being reinforced by greater plant production as is suggested by the lack of bimodality of biomass but by the characteristics of the species that grow on ridges in wet and dry conditions c jamaicense was the slowest to decompose over e cellulosa and n odorata due to more recalcitrant material in live and standing dead biomass serna et al 2013 this is supported in the paleo record by greater peat accumulation during drier eras of the holocene that were a c jamaicense dominated environment jones et al 2014 slough vegetation with less recalcitrant biomass such as n odorata provide high quality substrate for microbial communities and increases decomposition rates serna et al 2013 even without sharp distinctions in the amount of biomass between ridge and slough species harvested in slough transition transects n odorata utricularia sp eleocharis sp would degrade more completely than c jamaicense debusk and reddy 1998 larsen et al 2011 penton and newman 2008 contributing to less net peat deposition and maintaining the sharp microtopographical difference in this manner not all surface elements of the rsl conform to the peat accumulation mechanism but still express a sharp difference in peat accretion between ridge and slough states 4 3 nutrient accumulation mechanism we also tested the application of the nutrient accumulation mechanism to explain pattern regularity in the sub tropical rsl evidence for this mechanism included a concentration of nutrients under ridges as higher et rates on ridges pulls in more water nutrients and concentrates them in the ridge rietkerk et al 2004 there was a significant difference between total soil phosphorus in the ridge and slough in wca3as but as with biomass the wet prairie acted as an intermediate value between the two this concurs with the nutrient accumulation mechanism as the nutrient concentrations are higher in the ridge and decrease as you move out of the ridge into the wet prairie and lowest in the sloughs this has previously been demonstrated in the everglades but for tree islands ross et al 2006 wetzel et al 2005 however in other parts of the everglades ridge and slough samples were not significantly different ross et al 2006 while the difference between total phosphorus in ridge and slough communities in wca3as is statistically significant in some areas it does not appear to have a significant effect on vegetation production chambers and pederson 2006 ewe et al 2006 between the two communities we hypothesize that nutrient differences are not necessarily due to higher et rates and accumulation but again the difference of species within the vegetation communities both c jamaicense and e cellulosa reabsorb phosphorus and nitrogen from dead leaves 40 80 before they fall efficiently retaining nutrients within the plant serna et al 2013 even without differential et concentrating extra nutrients into the ridge a community dominated by c jamaicense and or e cellulosa would have higher soil nutrients from this process what little nutrients that are lost in the litter by these species are consolidated into peat in sloughs n odorata litter contained over 50 more phosphorus than live leaves serna et al 2013 this high nutrient content encourages microbial decomposition and shortens the turnover time for phosphorus into the water column not into the soil non floc layer so while the nutrient accumulation mechanism has been demonstrated on tree islands in the rsl differences in species life histories instead of increased et and nutrient accumulation may be a better explanation for ridges wet prairies and sloughs in the rsl larsen et al 2015 found the mechanism for nutrient accumulation in the rsl to be a function of differential hydrologic exchange between ridges and sloughs during dry down periods which could compliment our theory of differential decomposition and nutrient cycling by species 5 conclusion while sub tropical patterned peatlands initially appeared to concur with current peat patterning mechanisms we have demonstrated that their underlying ecological patterning processes may be very different from boreal peatlands and requires further discussion there has been a suite of literature modeling the origin and maintenance of the rsl by hydrology and flow givnish et al 2008 heffernan et al 2013 larsen et al 2011 larsen et al 2007 our model expands on the current theories for rsl maintenance and is the first to incorporate vegetation types and life history traits into differential peat deposition that create the signature microtopographical differences there is likely no single theory to explain patterning in the rsl or other sub tropical peatlands but we have contributed an increased understanding of species influence on net peat accretion and present a deviation from current boreal based mechanisms acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge m nungesser anad s gray for their careful review 
25324,patterned landscapes have long been a popular setting to test hypotheses about the effects of processes on ecosystem structure the combination of scale dependent and positive feedback theory is one of the most well supported in current literature each explaining separate aspects of patterned peatlands these theories have been developed from dynamics in boreal peatlands and tested in boreal systems but the mechanisms that control peat patterning in a sub tropical system have yet to be acknowledged in theory statistical evidence for different mechanisms are present in the biophysical features of sub tropical patterned peatlands such as the ridge and slough landscape rsl within the greater everglades wetland system we use data from the rsl to test whether features of a sub tropical patterned peatland conform to positive and scale dependent feedback patterning theories developed in boreal peatlands and use dynamic simulation to explain our results the analysis of surface elements and nutrient differences within the rsl and our dynamic simulations indicate that positive and scale dependent feedback may not be appropriate theories for sub tropical peat patterning decomposition rather than production appears to be more important for abrupt microtopographical elevation differences and differential nutrient concentrations are due to vegetation types rather than increased evapotranspiration from greater vascular plant growth our model expands on the current theories for rsl maintenance incorporating vegetation types and life history traits into differential peat deposition which create the signature microtopographical differences found in the everglades and demonstrates that the underlying ecological patterning processes in sub tropical peatlands are likely very different from boreal peatlands and require further discussion and study keywords landscape pattern positive feedback patterned peatlands restoration everglades sub tropical 1 introduction patterned landscapes have long been a popular setting to test hypotheses about the effects of processes on ecosystem patterning couteron and lejeune 2001 eppinga et al 2008 klausmeier 1999 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 specifically research in patterned peatlands has introduced a set self organization theories to explain how regularly patterned microtopography exists on the landscape belyea and lancaster 2002 couwenberg and joosten 2005 rietkerk et al 2004 swanson and grigal 1988 these include scale dependent feedback eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 differences in hydraulic conductivity between hummocks and hollows couwenberg and joosten 2005 foster et al 1983 glaser 1992 uplift by frost heaving brown 1970 eppinga et al 2008 moore and bellamy 1974 and the role of seasonal flooding sakaguchi 1980 seppÃ¤lÃ¤ and koutaniemi 1985 two different mechanisms within the scale dependent feedback theory nutrient accumulation and peat accumulation are the most well supported in current literature eppinga et al 2009a watts et al 2010 each explaining separate aspects of patterned peatlands the peat accumulation mechanism assumes that sharp microtopographical differences between ridges and hollows are reinforced by greater plant production on drier ridges primarily from the increased presence of vascular plants belyea and clymo 2001 hilbert et al 2000 rietkerk et al 2004 swanson and grigal 1988 plant productivity which determines the input of biomass to peat production belyea and clymo 2001 eppinga et al 2009a hilbert et al 2000 is a function of peat thickness a proxy for water stress on productivity eppinga et al 2009a net peat accumulation in this mechanism is primarily a function of plant production and peat decomposition both driven by water table depth evidence for this mechanism expressed as sharp microtopographical differences is a bimodal frequency distribution of surface elements vascular plant biomass or acrotelm thickness eppinga et al 2008 and is well documented in boreal peatlands eppinga et al 2009a this feedback has been studied along a climactic gradient eppinga et al 2010 and focused on the evapotranspiration et and precipitation ratio in sites dominated by temperate and sub arctic climates scotland sweden and siberia the nutrient accumulation mechanism on the other hand explains landscape patterning particularly regular string or maze patterning from the directed flow of water and nutrients into ridges by increased et of vascular plants rietkerk et al 2004 as nutrients accumulate within ridges from plant uptake and recycling vascular plant growth should increase and pull more water and nutrients by et reinforcing the nutrient accumulation cycle eppinga et al 2008 this occurs at a local scale within the ridge creating a negative effect for plants growing further from the ridge and generating a scale dependent feedback eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 these mechanisms have been developed from dynamics in boreal peatlands and tested as mathematical models or empirical models in temperate or boreal systems belyea and clymo 2001 couwenberg and joosten 2005 eppinga et al 2008 hilbert et al 2000 rietkerk et al 2004 a limited number of studies have discussed non boreal microtopography cheng et al 2011 couwenberg and joosten 2005 mcvoy et al 2011 nungesser 2003 and some aspects of scale dependent patterning theories have been applied to the sub tropical everglades heffernan et al 2013 larsen and harvey 2010 watts et al 2010 including nutrient accumulation effects larsen et al 2007 larsen et al 2015 these models were mainly theoretical studies but one data based analysis suggested that sub tropical peatlands do conform to boreal based peat accumulation mechanisms through elevation bimodality watts et al 2010 however we hypothesize that the mechanisms that control peat patterning in a sub tropical system should be different because increased temperatures longer photoperiod lack of seasonality and distinct vegetation communities contribute to differences in structuring processes through changes in decomposition and plant production aerts 1997 meentemeyer 1978 boreal based models include production and decomposition as a function of water stress and do not explicitly use temperature or differences in species attributes eppinga et al 2009a eppinga et al 2009b rietkerk et al 2004 which are likely important in a sub tropical climate statistical evidence for these differences between boreal and sub tropical processes would be present in the biophysical features of sub tropical patterned peatlands such as the ridge and slough landscape rsl within the greater everglades the everglades rsl is an example of a patterned peatland with parallel drainage topography whose patterning has been relatively stable on the landscape scale for thousands of years bernhardt and willard 2009 until water management for flood control and water supply was initiated in the early 20th century the historical rsl was a dominant landscape type of the central portion of the everglades and is a focus of the current restoration strategy the rsl consists of long linear ridges of sawgrass cladium jamaicense crantz longer hydroperiod sloughs open water areas with submerged aquatic plants and water lilies and occasional tree islands oriented parallel to the slow moving flow of water from northwest to southeast the rsl also includes a wet prairie community a short statured emergent community that is sometimes considered a result of over draining mcvoy et al 2011 but is a stable and important community for critically endangered wildlife zweig and kitchens 2014 this landscape has been fragmented by compartmentalization impoundment and reduced flows ogden 2005 and is now in a degraded state nungesser 2011 wu et al 2006 zweig et al 2011 we use data from the rsl explicitly considering wet prairie habitat to test whether features of a sub tropical patterned peatland do in fact conform to two patterning mechanisms of scale dependent feedback peat and nutrient accumulation prior studies within the rsl did not explicitly consider the wet prairie community or combined it with slough watts et al 2010 with productivity rates and biomass values between that of ridges and sloughs consideration of this community is expected to influence modality of biomass surface elements we tested modality of data based surface elements from the rsl plant biomass and elevation to determine the influence of the peat accumulation mechanism and differences between data based nutrient levels in ridge and sloughs as a basis for confirming the nutrient accumulation mechanism in sub tropical peatlands we also use a peat accumulation model based on species specific growth and decomposition rates to put the data based results into context 2 methods biomass and elevation data were taken from a long term monitoring study zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 zweig and kitchens 2014 within water conservation area 3a south wca3as fig 1 briefly 20 1 km2 plots were placed on the landscape in a stratified random manner stratified by water depth elevation and peat depth zweig and kitchens 2008 and 2 3 transects were randomly located in each plot transects always started in a slough and ran perpendicular to the flow gradient into a ridge transects ranged from 30 to 100 m in length we clipped above ground biomass in 0 25 m2 quadrats at 3 m intervals along transects samples were sorted to species oven dried to a constant weight and weighed to the nearest 0 1 g n 8464 our annual november sample events began in 2002 and continued to 2011 we also measured water depths at each 3 m interval to derive high resolution elevation data we acquired water stage surfaces from the everglades depth estimation network eden http sofia usgs gov eden for each day of sampling in 2002 and subtracted the measured water depth from the stage measurement at each site to obtain elevation of each sample point we only used 2002 water depth data n 1131 to avoid any changes in elevation associated with walking transects and disturbing peat 2 1 peat accumulation mechanism to address the applicability of the peat accumulation mechanism to sub tropical peatlands such as the everglades we tested for evidence of bimodality in elevation and biomass modality was tested by comparing the fit of our data to a unimodal and bimodal normal distribution eppinga et al 2008 watts et al 2010 with the statistical software r version 3 0 1 package mixsmsn except in the case of biomass biomass data was heavily right tailed so we used a package that could model skewed distributions a skewed t distribution and determined fit by bayes information

accumulation mechanism to examine the applicability of the nutrient accumulation mechanism to sub tropical patterned peatlands we tested for differences in nutrient concentrations between ridge and sloughs using nutrient data collected for a prior study examining the effects of enrichment throughout all of water conservation area 3a bruland et al 2007 levene s statistic for data restricted to our study site wca3as indicated that variances were not homogenous so we compared nutrient concentrations in the top 10 cm of peat with a kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance test to determine significant differences between community types ridge prairie and slough n 184 we analyzed phosphorus instead of a suite of nutrients because the everglades is an extremely phosphorus limited system mccormick et al 1996 2 3 peat accumulation model we developed a closed form peat accretion model for the rsl in systems thinking experimental learning laboratory with animation stella v 10 0 4 isee systems lebanon new hampshire usa for two purposes one to understand how different species within vegetation communities contribute to peat deposition and elevation including belowground biomass and two to model the difference between peat deposition and elevation when the nutrient accumulation mechanism is applied to determine if this feedback was reflected in the everglades landscape our stella models were built from the conceptualization of the mechanics fig 2 of peat deposition in three different vegetation communities typical to the rsl ridge wet prairie and slough these simulate peat deposition at an annual time step and as a function of above and belowground biomass for each particular species within each community type within a 30 m 30 m area each model only had a few dominant species available for production and growth the ridge community contained c jamaicense and bacopa caroliniana as an edge species wet prairie and slough models contained the same species but were initialized with different biomasses nymphaea odorata utricularia spp b caroliniana eleocharis cellulosa and eleocharis elongata we developed two types of dynamic simulations one with nutrient accumulation to capture scale dependent feedback and one without any nutrient differences between vegetation communities to reflect only hydrodynamic control the main driving state variable was biomass which was a function of production belowground biomass was estimated as a simple ratio of aboveground biomass aboveground biomass b began as an initial condition defined as the average mass of the species in the community from our field data annual production p was simulated as a logistic function grace 2001 of biomass and what we suggest are critical environmental scalars air temperature hydroperiod maximum water depth and minimum water depth inundation i was only applied to c jamaicense and eleocharis spp fig 2 but at varying water depths for the different vegetation types eleocharis spp was configured to be less affected by deeper water than c jamaicense for simplicity the environmental scalars for production i ns t t shydro smin and smax table 1 were combined into one term denoted by scal in the equation below production for each species was summed for community p then is added to standing biomass b p b s c a l 1 b b m a x s c a l senescence s controled the flow from b

gaseous dissolved transport decomposition 2 particulate transport and 3 accretion these three processes were dependent on the species in the community as they differ in their lability and lignin content osborne et al 2007 particulate transport was a transformation term for flocculent material that was then moved out of the area by flow a flow of materials would come to bear in a spatial model gaseous dissolved transport was governed by temperature hydroperiod anoxic status and nutrient status 10 production for ridge center 8 for ridge edge and 5 for wet prairie peat was deposited from the below and aboveground accretion processes but had one outflow oxidation o accreted peat can be oxidized by exposure to air and by microbial processes so some proportion of peat was lost to oxidation each year depending on the hydrologic conditions we ran the model 200 times to capture random variance within the model for 100 years under three different hydrologic scenarios historic 90 of historic depths and 110 of historic depths we used the last 20 years of hydrologic data from site 64 in wca3as eden and repeated it four times to create a 100 year hydrologic dataset which causes some periodicity in the data site 64 represents the hydrology of the best conserved area of the rsl watts et al 2010 differences between hydrology for vegetation communities were calculated by adding 10 cm to site 64 depth data in a slough for wet prairie and 20 cm for the ridge so the same rainfall water management pattern would produce different hydroperiods minimums and maximums although low 20 cm is within the range of microtopological differences between ridge and slough in wca3as watts et al 2010 and typical of our dataset wet prairie was assumed to be in between these elevations at 10 cm below the ridge of the environmental scalars for production i ns t t shydro smin and smax all but t and t were affected by the different hydrologic regimes we did not test the sensitivity of the model to temperature as typical temperatures for our area do not normally fall higher than t or lower than t we did want to have temperature as part of the model for future climate scenarios to examine the difference between aboveground and aboveground belowground biomass as a surface element in a bimodal analysis for the peat accumulation mechanism we also ran each peat deposition model ridge prairie slough 50 times with randomly assigned initial biomasses for each species the random biomasses were selected from field data values and the initial species ratios were consistent with previous model runs as with the field data above we fit uni or bimodal normal distributions to the aboveground only data and the aboveground belowground ratio data to test for evidence of sharp microtopographical differences and to determine if adding belowground biomass would influence modality 3 results 3 1 peat accumulation mechanism 3 1 1 elevation data the lowest elevations occurred in the se quadrant near 190 cm above sea level with the highest elevations occurring in the north quadrants fig 3 overall the pooled landscape elevation data fit a bimodal distribution model better than unimodal distribution and that trend continued for the nw ne and sw quadrants table 2 in the se the most impounded and lowest of the quadrants the elevation data was distinctly unimodal fig 3 3 1 2 biomass data the biomass data distribution was heavily right tailed with the highest density of data points occurring between 0 and 10 g 0 25 m2 for all quadrants fig 4 and could not be modeled to fit a normal distribution bimodal or unimodal model fit analyses for a skewed t distribution indicated that biomass was unimodal in the northern quadrants and bimodal in the se table 3 the Î´bic for model fit in the sw was less than 1 0 and evidence for one model over the other is not strong kass and raftery 1995 separating vegetation communities fig 5 demonstrates that the heavy right tail of the biomass distribution is caused by sawgrass ridges and that they have relatively even distributed weights 3 2 nutrient accumulation mechanism there was a significant difference kruskal wallis test p 0 001 in total phosphorus between ridge average 0 43 mg kg 0 013 se and slough 0 35 mg kg 0 015 se but not between either ridge or slough and prairie 0 36 mg kg 0 043 se there were only 8 prairie samples which could account for the higher standard error in the prairie data the difference between total phosphorus in ridge and slough communities was statistically significant but has not shown to have a significant effect on vegetation production chambers and pederson 2006 ewe et al 2006 between the two communities this was reflected in the nutrient status runs of the dynamic simulation 3 3 peat accumulation model annual biomass estimates litter fall and production by species were within realistic ranges one standard deviation from the average table 4 of our field data and also within the ranges in published literature craft et al 1995 davis et al 2006 miao and zou 2012 serna et al 2013 providing model validation in the historic hydrology model sawgrass ridges deposited twice the amount of peat fig 6 a than wet prairie or slough kruskal wallis p 0 001 and the wet prairie and slough were not significantly different from each other in the nutrient runs fig 6b the middle of the ridge had increased production and increased decomposition from the non status runs the edge had some increased production wet prairies even less and sloughs had no increased production the ridge edge and middle were not significantly different from each other kruskal wallis p 0 16 and the wet prairie 0 0078 mm yr 0 00045 se produced approximately the same as the slough 0 0080 mm yr 0 00041 se the 110 hydrology was similar to the hydrology in the impounded se corner of wca3as and wet prairie produced the most biomass and peat deposition while this seemed counterintuitive it appears to be due to a species shift the community composition of this wet prairie at the end of 100 years of high water depths was more similar to the definition of slough than any other community fig 7 the model was able to simulate a transformation between communities under certain conditions but only wet prairie and slough because they shared model species this also provided validation of the model design as it captured the prairie species decline in biomass with wet conditions and slough species increase zweig and kitchens 2008 in the analysis of modeled aboveground versus aboveground belowground biomass the aboveground biomass fit a unimodal normal distribution better than a bimodal Î´bic 15 and the aboveground belowground biomass ratio with a skewed t distribution also fit a unimodal distribution Î´bic 19 the addition of belowground biomass did not affect the modality of the data 4 discussion while there was initial evidence that sub tropical patterned peatlands processes were similar to boreal patterned peatlands watts et al 2010 our ecological understanding of the rsl sub tropical system zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 zweig and kitchens 2014 indicated that differences in climate should significantly affect structuring processes and these patterned peatlands would not conform to current patterning theories most existing literature focuses on the theory of scale dependent feedback specifically the peat and nutrient accumulation mechanisms to describe both microtopographical differences and distinctive patterns in flat peatlands belyea and clymo 2001 eppinga et al 2009a rietkerk et al 2004 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 we used a combination of field data and modeling to ascertain their applicability in sub tropical patterned peatlands 4 1 peat accumulation mechanism according to the peat accumulation mechanism eppinga et al 2008 rietkerk et al 2004 distinct states in ridge and hollow landscapes should be evident from the bimodality of surface characteristics eppinga et al 2008 eppinga et al 2009b van de koppel et al 2001 elevation data representing peat depth from across the landscape within wca3as indicated that there are sharp microtopographical differences fig 3 in the three less inundated quadrants nw ne and sw and no statistically significant bimodality in the quadrant with the highest impoundment se this concurs with other rsl studies watts et al 2010 zweig et al 2011 and provides additional evidence of the degradation of the rsl pattern by impoundment and sustained high water however aboveground biomass another surface characteristic was unimodal even though it seemed logical to assume that a sawgrass dominated ridge would have more standing biomass than deep sloughs similar to boreal peatlands eppinga et al 2008 the biomass bimodality tests had to include skewed distributions not the typical normal distributions eppinga et al 2008 as the data was heavily right tailed even with a skewed t distribution which was a better model fit than a normal distribution the only bimodal quadrant was the southeast this southeastern impounded end of the rsl has lost a majority of its wet prairies zweig and kitchens 2014 zweig et al 2011 and it may be the wet prairie biomass bridging the lower biomass of the sloughs and higher biomass of the ridges that creates a unimodal distribution in rsl field data fig 5 we investigated the possibility that aboveground biomass while easier to collect is not appropriate as a surface characteristic and that we were missing critical information by not including belowground biomass however our peat accumulation model analysis determined that it was not a lack of data that created a unimodal distribution and the addition of belowground biomass did not affect its modality 4 2 reasons for deviations 4 2 1 disturbance there are two likely ecological reasons as to why biomass did not reflect the peat accumulation mechanism through bimodality within the everglades first is landscape instability and anthropogenic disturbance the lack of agreement between bimodality of elevation and biomass in the rsl might be indicative of degradation in the landscape pattern first seen in the vegetation and later through peat deposition in elevation like many wetlands large sections of the everglades rsl have been both over drained and inundated for extensive time periods davis and ogden 1994 givnish et al 2008 sklar and van der valk 2002 troxler and richards 2009 each having a similar effect on the landscape pattern namely a reduction of elevation differences between ridge and slough givnish et al 2008 mcvoy et al 2011 watts et al 2010 zweig et al 2011 literature has pointed to the presence of wet prairies on the landscape as an artifact of hydrologic degradation not a true community state in the rsl prairies are referred to as a transitional community between more stable ridges and sloughs heffernan et al 2013 mcvoy et al 2011 watts et al 2010 arising when sloughs are over drained and short stature emergent vegetation can dominate if this hypothesis is correct then the current observed unimodal nature of aboveground biomass is a precursor to microtopographical collapse where a feedback of drier conditions that encourage wet prairie growth and increased peat deposition from wet prairies will reduce the elevational difference between ridge and slough however according to the peat deposition model for either type of historic hydrology scale dependent or not wet prairies deposited approximately the same amount of peat as a slough in 100 years but much less than a ridge maintaining their position and stability on the landscape relative to the other communities if more water were added to the system as has been suggested to mimic a pre drainage everglades system mcvoy et al 2011 areas of wet prairie are expected to transition to slough mcvoy et al 2011 but according to the peat deposition models here the disappearance of wet prairies could be followed by a microtopographical collapse like the southeastern quadrant of wca3as fig 6 wet prairies may not be a transitional community between two stable states but a stable state of its own capable of maintaining its position on the landscape drying events that encourage the presence of wet prairies have occurred within wca3as but the most constant disturbance factor for the last 90 years has been inundation from pooling against the southern eastern levees zweig et al 2011 pooling is particularly apparent in the southeastern quadrant which has the additive effect even over the southwest quadrant of lower elevations decreased peat accretion on the ridges from decreased sawgrass productivity under a flooded regime childers et al 2006 and increased peat accretion in the sloughs from constant inundation and lack of flow act to reduce the elevation difference between ridge and sloughs this trend from the literature is also reflected in the unimodality of elevation in the inundated southeastern quadrant fig 3 and peat deposition model results fig 6 in the 110 historic hydrology a hydrology more similar but slightly shallower than what the southeastern quadrant of wca3as has experienced in the last 20 years the wet prairie transitions to a slough and the slough community is depositing more peat than the ridge reducing the microtopography of the system results from the dynamic simulations also suggest that the peat accumulation mechanism drier ridges produce more vascular peat biomass which increases the elevation of the ridge and encourages more plant growth that translates into sharp microtopographical differences may not apply to the rsl increased vascular plant growth on ridges does not appear to be the mechanism for increased ridge elevation according to the bimodality analysis in the peat deposition model during the historic hydrologic regime a hydrology from the middle and northern conserved watts et al 2010 sections of wca3as the ridge deposits more peat than wet prairies or sloughs enough to create a sharp microtopographical difference in ridges and slough elevation however it does not contain a sharp increase in biomass the biomass of ridges was evenly distributed fig 5 likely because c jamaicense is ubiquitous and can persist in areas where conditions are not ideal zweig and kitchens 2008 field data also shows that wet prairies contain a moderate amount of biomass fig 5 this suggests that the mechanism for sharp microtopographical differences in the rsl may be the differential decomposition of vegetation community species not differences in plant production 4 2 2 climactic differences this leads to the second underlying ecological possibility for a unimodal distribution in a rsl surface characteristic a fundamental difference between the vegetation of a sub tropical versus a boreal peatland vegetation communities seasonality nutrient dynamics and structuring process are very different between boreal and sub tropical wetlands processes in boreal peatlands are influenced by colder temperatures that slow decomposition and induce frost heaving brown 1970 moore and bellamy 1974 and they are also acidic systems eppinga et al 2009b siegel et al 2006 van breemen 1995 whose vegetation communities are largely dominated by one non vascular genus sphagnum moore and bellamy 1974 van breemen 1995 the presence of varied vascular vegetation communities in the everglades zweig and kitchens 2008 zweig and kitchens 2009 and their fate in the process of decomposition and peat production could likely to be the main factor contributing to the difference between the bimodality of elevation and biomass difference in elevation between the ridges and sloughs lies not in the amount of biomass but how that biomass above and belowground transforms into peat through decomposition a recent study serna et al 2013 suggests that decomposition rates of rsl vascular plants are influenced more by species than habitat or water depth a sharp contrast to models from the boreal peatlands where decomposition is a function of water levels eppinga et al 2009a eppinga et al 2010 rietkerk et al 2004 greater net peat production on ridges is not being reinforced by greater plant production as is suggested by the lack of bimodality of biomass but by the characteristics of the species that grow on ridges in wet and dry conditions c jamaicense was the slowest to decompose over e cellulosa and n odorata due to more recalcitrant material in live and standing dead biomass serna et al 2013 this is supported in the paleo record by greater peat accumulation during drier eras of the holocene that were a c jamaicense dominated environment jones et al 2014 slough vegetation with less recalcitrant biomass such as n odorata provide high quality substrate for microbial communities and increases decomposition rates serna et al 2013 even without sharp distinctions in the amount of biomass between ridge and slough species harvested in slough transition transects n odorata utricularia sp eleocharis sp would degrade more completely than c jamaicense debusk and reddy 1998 larsen et al 2011 penton and newman 2008 contributing to less net peat deposition and maintaining the sharp microtopographical difference in this manner not all surface elements of the rsl conform to the peat accumulation mechanism but still express a sharp difference in peat accretion between ridge and slough states 4 3 nutrient accumulation mechanism we also tested the application of the nutrient accumulation mechanism to explain pattern regularity in the sub tropical rsl evidence for this mechanism included a concentration of nutrients under ridges as higher et rates on ridges pulls in more water nutrients and concentrates them in the ridge rietkerk et al 2004 there was a significant difference between total soil phosphorus in the ridge and slough in wca3as but as with biomass the wet prairie acted as an intermediate value between the two this concurs with the nutrient accumulation mechanism as the nutrient concentrations are higher in the ridge and decrease as you move out of the ridge into the wet prairie and lowest in the sloughs this has previously been demonstrated in the everglades but for tree islands ross et al 2006 wetzel et al 2005 however in other parts of the everglades ridge and slough samples were not significantly different ross et al 2006 while the difference between total phosphorus in ridge and slough communities in wca3as is statistically significant in some areas it does not appear to have a significant effect on vegetation production chambers and pederson 2006 ewe et al 2006 between the two communities we hypothesize that nutrient differences are not necessarily due to higher et rates and accumulation but again the difference of species within the vegetation communities both c jamaicense and e cellulosa reabsorb phosphorus and nitrogen from dead leaves 40 80 before they fall efficiently retaining nutrients within the plant serna et al 2013 even without differential et concentrating extra nutrients into the ridge a community dominated by c jamaicense and or e cellulosa would have higher soil nutrients from this process what little nutrients that are lost in the litter by these species are consolidated into peat in sloughs n odorata litter contained over 50 more phosphorus than live leaves serna et al 2013 this high nutrient content encourages microbial decomposition and shortens the turnover time for phosphorus into the water column not into the soil non floc layer so while the nutrient accumulation mechanism has been demonstrated on tree islands in the rsl differences in species life histories instead of increased et and nutrient accumulation may be a better explanation for ridges wet prairies and sloughs in the rsl larsen et al 2015 found the mechanism for nutrient accumulation in the rsl to be a function of differential hydrologic exchange between ridges and sloughs during dry down periods which could compliment our theory of differential decomposition and nutrient cycling by species 5 conclusion while sub tropical patterned peatlands initially appeared to concur with current peat patterning mechanisms we have demonstrated that their underlying ecological patterning processes may be very different from boreal peatlands and requires further discussion there has been a suite of literature modeling the origin and maintenance of the rsl by hydrology and flow givnish et al 2008 heffernan et al 2013 larsen et al 2011 larsen et al 2007 our model expands on the current theories for rsl maintenance and is the first to incorporate vegetation types and life history traits into differential peat deposition that create the signature microtopographical differences there is likely no single theory to explain patterning in the rsl or other sub tropical peatlands but we have contributed an increased understanding of species influence on net peat accretion and present a deviation from current boreal based mechanisms acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge m nungesser anad s gray for their careful review
