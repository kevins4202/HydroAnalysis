10650,irrigated agriculture in the arizona low desert faces multiple threats including drought in the colorado river basin depletion of reservoirs supplying water to irrigation districts competition from growing municipal and industrial sectors and climate uncertainty improving irrigation water productivity is imperative for sustaining agricultural production in the region the objective of the study was to measure responses of cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality to variable irrigation rates and timings for the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton growing seasons at maricopa arizona four irrigation rates were used including 60 80 100 and 120 of recommended amounts from a scheduling tool the four rates were administered differentially during two time periods 1 squaring to peak bloom and 2 peak bloom to 90 open boll the experimental design incorporated 16 irrigation treatments in a randomized block design with four replications and irrigation was applied via an overhead lateral move sprinkler system with commercial site specific irrigation equipment linear mixed models could estimate cotton fiber yield seasonal evapotranspiration fiber micronaire and fiber strength with root mean squared errors of cross validation rmsecv of 11 9 1 8 6 4 and 3 6 respectively variation in irrigation water productivity and several fiber quality metrics could be explained by water applied in the second irrigation period but not in the first suggesting more opportunity in the early season for improving water productivity without sacrificing yield or fiber quality irrigation rates in the first period could be reduced up to 70 mm 6 of total water applied to the 100 100 treatment without sacrificing yield during the second irrigation period full irrigation was required to prevent yield losses and maintain high fiber quality this study provides valuable guidance on opportunities for using sprinkler irrigation to improve water productivity while maintaining acceptable cotton yield and fiber quality in the arizona low desert further effort is needed to clarify requirements for pre plant irrigation incorporate plant feedback data into in season irrigation scheduling algorithms and identify metrics to guide irrigation termination decisions keywords cotton evapotranspiration irrigation management mixed model overhead sprinkler water use efficiency 1 introduction improving the water productivity of agroecosystems is a primary objective globally particularly in arid and semi arid regions that require irrigation to supplement limited precipitation ali and talukder 2008 brauman et al 2013 for example in the water limited environment of the arizona low desert a number of factors increase the urgent need for water productivity improvements including ongoing drought in the colorado river basin prein et al 2016 depletion of lake mead which supplies colorado river water for local irrigation districts holdren and turner 2010 competition from municipalities and industries in metropolitan areas and climate uncertainty cayan et al 2010 ali and talukder 2008 described 18 techniques for improving the water productivity of agroecosystems including various improvements to irrigation and fertilization management plant breeding to increase harvest index or reduce transpiration and other agronomic considerations similarly evans and sadler 2008 described a variety of irrigation technologies with potential to improve water productivity including scientific irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation site specific irrigation microirrigation and decision support systems improvements to irrigation methods systems and management are primary solutions for improving water productivity both in the arizona low desert and worldwide howell 2001 pereira et al 2002 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a primary commodity crop in the arizona low desert with 71 000 ha planted in 2018 and an annual production value of approximately 200 million for both fiber and cottonseed usda 2019 surface irrigation management with cotton planted on raised beds between furrows is the primary cotton production system in the region mainly due to existing infrastructure for delivery of colorado river water to growers through irrigation district canals early efforts to improve irrigation management for these systems sought to optimize timings for the first post plant irrigation event steger et al 1998 and the final irrigation event of the season unruh and silvertooth 1997 tronstad et al 2003 both radin et al 1992 and hunsaker et al 1998 reported higher cotton yield and water productivity by applying smaller amounts of surface irrigation more frequently also hunsaker et al 2005 2015 developed remote sensing technologies for scientific irrigation scheduling of surface irrigated cotton systems in arizona while these studies provided general recommendations for improving cotton irrigation management they were mainly limited by the irrigation system because amounts and placement of water cannot be precisely controlled with surface irrigation more recently the direction for cotton irrigation research in arizona has shifted away from traditional surface irrigation made possible by investments in modern overhead sprinkler irrigation systems bronson et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 because sprinkler systems offer much greater control of irrigation applications as compared to surface irrigation for example with greater ability to apply smaller amounts of water more frequently and even site specifically thorp 2019 greater opportunity now exists to develop irrigation management practices and technologies that improve water productivity also the unique environment of the arizona low desert provides an added advantage for this endeavor because limited precipitation enables scientific field investigations that are not confounded by rainfall over the past several decades high quality field research in the texas high plains has led the way to use of modern irrigation equipment for clarifying impacts of irrigation management on cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality at halfway texas irrigation amounts of 40 60 80 and 100 of irrigation recommendations based on evapotranspiration et were applied to field plots at 3 5 9 and 15 day intervals using an overhead linear move sprinkler system with site specific irrigation technology bordovsky et al 1992 cotton fiber yield and irrigation water productivity iwp the ratio of irrigated yield minus dryland yield and seasonal irrigation were both significantly higher at the 3 day irrigation interval over the three year study at the same site bordovsky et al 2015 later field tested combinations of three irrigation rates applied during three distinct cotton growing periods based on accumulated growing degree days resulting in 27 irrigation management regimes results of the four year study demonstrated lower iwp and sometimes lower cotton yield for treatments that aimed to store water in the soil profile by overirrigating in the early season the later cotton growth period characterized by cotton boll filling and maturation was the most critical time for irrigation requiring sufficient water to maintain acceptable cotton fiber yield with high iwp at a lubbock texas site with a surface drip irrigation system a 12 year study tested different irrigation scheduling techniques based on canopy temperature and soil water content measurements concluding that irrigation schedules based on canopy temperature could maximize cotton fiber yield without applying excess irrigation wanjura et al 2002 at bushland texas researchers measured cotton et with large weighing lysimeters during two growing seasons concluding that cotton yield and water productivity in the northern texas high plains were similar to more highly noted cotton production regions in the united states howell et al 2004 lastly snowden et al 2013 measured effects of different irrigation rates on cotton yield boll distribution and fiber quality at lamesa and new deal texas they found that irrigation effects on fiber micronaire depended on the growing season these field studies from the texas high plains and similar studies elsewhere in the world conaty et al 2015 ghaderi far et al 2012 ibragimov et al 2007 lamb et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 have offered great inspiration for the present study the overall goal was to quantify effects of irrigation rates and timing on cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality at a research station in the arizona low desert the study was motivated by recent installation of a six span lateral move sprinkler irrigation system at the station thorp et al 2017 which was fully retrofitted with commercial site specific irrigation equipment after the 2015 cotton season the new system has enabled irrigation management research that was not previously possible at the site specific objectives were to 1 conduct a field experiment using site specific sprinkler irrigation technology to apply different irrigation rates at different times during the cotton growing season and 2 identify irrigation management practices that improve water productivity while maintaining acceptable cotton yield and fiber quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment a cotton field experiment was conducted at the university of arizona s maricopa agricultural center mac near maricopa arizona 33 079 n 111 977 w 360 m above sea level during the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton growing seasons fig 1 the experiment tested responses of cotton yield water use and fiber quality to variable irrigation rate and timing for one commercial cotton variety deltapine 1549 b2xf monsanto company st louis missouri the variety was chosen based on its performance in arizona variety trials prior to the present study the plots were relatively large 12 2 m 12 cotton rows 30 0 m and required 3 8 ha of the 5 8 ha total field area a randomized block design was used with four replicated blocks and 16 irrigation treatments per block for a total of 64 plots the blocks were typically arranged within a single span of the overhead irrigation system however the position of the easternmost block was adjusted each year to accommodate other research activities at the site fig 1 the 16 irrigation management treatments involved all the possible combinations of four irrigation rates applied during two distinct periods of the growing season the four irrigation rates were 60 80 100 and 120 of the recommendation provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the csm cropgro cotton agroecosystem model thorp et al 2017 the two irrigation periods were from first square to peak bloom approximately the first of june through mid july and from peak bloom to 90 open boll approximately mid july through the first week of september the heat units since planting for the first and second irrigation periods ranged from 480 to 1155 c days and from 1155 to 2040 c days respectively as reported by an arizona meteorological network azmet http ag arizona edu azmet weather station approximately 1 2 km from the field site the 16 irrigation management treatments led to cotton being grown with a variety of soil water status conditions fig 2 the environment for cotton production in the arizona low desert is arid and hot with daily minimum and maximum air temperatures regularly exceeding 25 and 40 c respectively from july through august corresponding to day of year doy 182 243 fig 3 this normally coincides with the time of cotton reproductive development heat stress impacts cotton yield during this time primarily by increasing flower abnormalities and abscission of bolls aged 3 5 days brown 2008 as such azmet provides daily information on level 1 and level 2 heat stress conditions based on air temperature and humidity measurements the number of days during july and august with level 1 and level 2 heat stress conditions was 31 and 16 in 2016 34 and 11 in 2017 and 23 and 21 in 2018 respectively fig 3 thus there were fewer heat stress days in 2018 but a higher number of level 2 heat stress days the cotton growing season also straddles the arizona monsoon season in july and august where relative humidity and dew point temperatures rise sharply fig 3 and precipitation amounts increase fig 2 as measured by the azmet weather station growing season precipitation from april through september doy 91 273 amounted to 42 51 and 89 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 while precipitation during the monsoon season in july and august amounted to 27 mm 65 50 mm 99 and 70 mm 78 in comparison short crop reference et eto from april through september amounted to 1364 1404 and 1372 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively thus cotton production requires irrigation to meet evaporative demand and dryland production is not a realistic possibility the soil texture at the field site was primarily sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between 0 16 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and lower limits between 0 08 and 0 11 cm3 cm 3 cover crops were grown in the winter months between cotton seasons to reduce soil nutrient variability and improve soil quality the field was prepared for cover crop planting by deep ripping disking and either planing or laser leveling annual ryegrass festuca perennis lam was planted on 3 january 2016 doy 3 and terminated with glyphosate roundup powermax monsanto st louis missouri usa on 22 february 2016 doy 53 following manufacturer s recommendations for application decisions barley hordeum vulgare l was planted on 19 december 2016 doy 354 and terminated with glyphosate on 3 march 2017 doy 63 and barley was again planted on 20 december 2017 doy 354 and terminated on 2 march 2018 doy 62 the cover crops were fully irrigated until termination but no fertilizer was applied upland cotton g hirsutum l cv deltapine 1549 b2xf was planted with a north south row orientation and row spacing of 1 02 m on 25 april 2016 doy 116 18 april 2017 doy 108 and 18 april 2018 doy 108 final plant density after emergence was 8 9 9 4 and 10 9 plants m 2 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively prior to the 2016 and 2017 season the field was ripped disked and planed in march before pre plant irrigation cotton was later planted on flat ground following field cultivation and incorporation of pre emergent herbicide containing pendimethalin prowl h2o basf florham park new jersey usa following manufacturer s recommendations for application decisions in 2018 no spring tillage was performed and cotton was planted directly into the terminated barley cover crop pre emergent herbicide was applied to the soil surface and watered in with a light 10 2 mm irrigation following irrigation termination in early september cotton was defoliated using products containing thidiazuron and diuron ginstar ec bayer cropscience monheim am rhein germany following manufacturer s recommendations for application decisions defoliant was applied on 7 october doy 281 and 24 october doy 298 in 2016 3 october doy 276 and 20 october doy 293 in 2017 and 28 september doy 271 and 19 october doy 292 in 2018 2 2 irrigation management as reported by thorp et al 2017 an overhead lateral move sprinkler irrigation system zimmatic lindsay corporation omaha nebraska was newly installed at the field site in 2014 following the 2015 cotton growing season advanced technology was added to the irrigation machine which permitted site specific irrigation applications based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine s control panel growsmart precision variable rate irrigation lindsay corporation omaha nebraska irrigation rates were computed uniquely for each drop hose using information from 1 the user provided application rate map 2 two global positioning system gps receivers on opposite ends of the lateral and 3 a database of system characteristics which included offset distances of each drop hose along the lateral the system used wireless communication among 88 nodes to relay information along the lateral and each wireless node provided individual control for four drop hoses by adjusting the duty cycles of four electronic solenoid valves the machine was equipped with 0 158 l s 1 nozzles in 2016 and 2017 12 senninger clermont florida and 0 201 l s 1 nozzles in 2018 13 5 senninger clermont florida nozzles were spaced 1 02 m apart located at the center of each cotton interrow area and positioned to emit water less than 1 0 m above the soil surface for uniform soil wetting prior to cotton emergence spray pads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5 0 m were used after cotton emergence the pads were changed to a bubbler style which emitted large droplets with a 0 3 m spray diameter at the center of each interrow area in addition to reducing water loss to evaporation the bubbler pads increased the spatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application areas delineated in the georeferenced irrigation maps spatial application error with the site specific irrigation machine was estimated to be less than 2 0 m the cotton growing season was partitioned into five distinct time periods with unique objectives for irrigation management and soil water status 1 pre season irrigation management to raise the soil water content and fill the soil profile prior to planting cotton 2 post planting irrigation to emerge the cotton crop and reduce soil crusting to prevent cotyledon breakage during emergence 3 weekly in season irrigation to apply four irrigation rates to plots from first square 480 c days after planting to peak bloom 1155 c days after planting 4 weekly in season irrigation to apply four irrigation rates to plots from peak bloom to 90 open boll 2040 c days after planting and 5 no irrigation during the field dry down period to prepare cotton for defoliant applications and harvest table 1 uniform irrigation management was used during the pre season and emergence irrigation periods in 2016 307 mm was applied in march prior to planting but pre plant irrigation amounts were reduced to 264 mm in 2017 and to 222 mm in 2018 table 1 following cotton planting light irrigation with amounts ranging from 8 to 20 mm was applied every few days to emerge the cotton crop and reduce soil surface crusting to prevent breakage of the emerging cotyledon after emergence irrigation was applied approximately weekly at rates less than 20 mm for approximately four weeks until first square traditionally little to no irrigation is applied to arizona cotton at this time to encourage root growth to deeper soil layers that hold water from pre plant irrigation and perhaps to acclimate the young plants to the hot and dry environment meeks et al 2017 total irrigation applied during the cotton emergence period was 173 136 and 127 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 prior to initiating water management treatments at first square the field average soil water content from the surface to 140 cm was 25 1 25 4 and 23 9 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively this means the effects of pre season and emergence irrigation on seasonal interaction among measured variables was likely minor regular irrigation scheduling and management commenced around first square i e the first week of june due to practical considerations for field entry labor availability and water delivery to the field site the irrigation scheduling methodology followed a weekly cycle monday and tuesday were established as dry days for field entry to collect measurements and perform any required tractor based operations irrigation scheduling algorithms were run on monday which resulted in a weekly irrigation recommendation for the 100 100 irrigation treatment and a prescription map to alter the irrigation rates for other plots via the site specific sprinkler irrigation machine a water delivery request was then submitted to the research station s water manager who required a 24 h advanced notice for water delivery each week water was requested for wednesday thursday and friday as needed pending availability of labor to 1 manage delivery of water to the field site via concrete lined canals and 2 operate the sprinkler irrigation machine analysis of soils data suggested that the field site had sufficient available water holding capacity to satisfy crop water requirements for a week or more at peak seasonal water demand thorp 2019 which made the weekly irrigation management methodology more plausible following the method of thorp et al 2017 irrigation schedules were determined using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm specifically the csm cropgro cotton model jones et al 2003 a thorough description of the model was provided by thorp et al 2014a also thorp et al 2014b and thorp et al 2017 described efforts to calibrate the model using data from other cotton field experiments at the research station prior to 2016 furthermore dejonge and thorp 2017 described recent efforts to update the et algorithms in the dssat csm model thorp et al 2017 described the methodology for combining past weather measurements and future weather predictions to conduct csm cropgro cotton simulations for in season irrigation management decisions while thorp et al 2017 based irrigation decisions only on simulated root zone soil water depletion additional model outputs were analyzed in the present study including future predictions for et and water stress factors for growth and photosynthesis the irrigation recommendation was the smallest irrigation amount that supplied model predicted et eliminated model predictions of water stress and maintained root zone soil water depletion below 45 based on average simulated responses among predictions from future weather scenarios that were estimated from historical weather data at the site this amount was assigned to plots receiving 100 of the irrigation recommendation in both the first and second irrigation periods because some plots received 120 of this amount i e 20 more the number of passes of the irrigation machine was increased to supply the extra water to these plots prior to each growing season field plots were mapped in a geographic information system qgis www qgis org based on data from field surveys with real time kinematic rtk global positioning equipment with cm level horizontal accuracy fig 1 following the randomized block experimental design a shapefile was created to delineate plot areas for site specific irrigation applications and the shapefile was loaded to the commercial software provided by the manufacturer of the site specific irrigation equipment fieldmap lindsay corporation omaha nebraska the irrigation rate percentages for each plot could be adjusted in the software however because rates could only be specified from 0 to 100 the irrigation treatments of 60 80 100 and 120 of the model based irrigation recommendation were mapped to rates of 50 0 66 7 83 3 and 100 0 in the software by adjusting the total number of irrigation passes to supply the required irrigation amount for the 120 treatment these rates ensured that plots received the intended irrigation amounts after finalizing the irrigation rates the software wrote an irrigation prescription file to a usb flash drive which was transported to the field for uploading the prescription map to the irrigation machine plot specific irrigation for the first irrigation period first square to peak bloom commenced on 8 june doy 160 1 june doy 152 and 30 may doy 150 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 rate adjustments for the second irrigation period peak bloom to 90 open boll occurred on 20 july doy 202 15 july doy 196 and 15 july doy 196 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively adjusting the irrigation rates was easily accomplished by simply changing the rate percentages for all plots in the irrigation prescription map the final irrigation of each season occurred on 9 september 2016 doy 253 8 september 2017 doy 251 and 7 september 2018 doy 250 giving a total of 16 irrigation management regimes in each cotton season fig 2 to allow for spatial application errors with the site specific irrigation equipment and to minimize impacts of overland flow between adjacent plot areas buffer regions were established in the area between plots fig 1 a 10 m buffer distance was established between plots along the row and a 2 m i e 2 row buffer distance was established between plots perpendicular to the row due to compaction from tractor tires greater potential for overland flow existed parallel to the rows thus a larger buffer distance was used impacts of overland flow were also minimized by operating the irrigation machine at full speed and making multiple passes over consecutive days to supply the weekly irrigation rates using these tactics overland flow was typically not observed in excess of 10 m from the point of application reduced visual observations of overland flow in the 2018 growing season suggested that no till management improved infiltration rates and provided increased surface residue for obstructing overland flow substantial efforts were made to identify and implement ways to reduce impacts of overland flow on the irrigation treatments based on pre plant soil sampling for soil nitrate concentration liquid urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was uniformly applied in three or four split applications amounting to seasonal nitrogen n application rates of 111 kg n ha 1 in 2016 148 kg n ha 1 in 2017 and 179 kg n ha 1 in 2018 these n amounts were based on a 1960 kg fiber ha 1 yield goal and a pre plant soil nitrate test from the soil surface to a depth of 0 9 m bronson et al 2017 in 2016 and 2017 a fertigation trailer which included a fertilizer tank metering pump and gasoline powered generator was hitched to the lateral move irrigation machine and fertilizer was injected into the overhead pipe at a rate of 0 032 l s 1 after the metering pump malfunctioned in early 2018 a metering box with a flotation switch was used to meter fertilizer into the canal immediately prior to the intake pipe of the irrigation machine during each fertigation event the irrigation machine was operated at 25 of full speed which applied n fertilizer with 16 mm of water in 2016 and 2017 and 20 mm of water in 2018 to ensure uniform fertilizer applications no site specific irrigation management was conducted during fertigation events fertilizer application dates

doy 200 in 2018 2 3 field measurements soil water content was measured weekly via a field calibrated neutron moisture meter model 503 campbell pacific nuclear martinez california after crop emergence steel access tubes were installed at the center of each plot fig 1 using a tractor mounted soil sampler model 25 ts giddings machine co windsor colorado from mid may to early october the neutron moisture meter was deployed on a weekly basis approximately 20 times per growing season to measure soil water content from 0 1 to 1 9 m in 0 2 m incremental depths at each access tube soil water content data were used to estimate et and deep seepage between successive measurement events the specific details of the et and deep seepage calculations were previously described by thorp et al 2018 based on the soil water balance approach of hunsaker et al 2005 three zones were delineated in each plot for cotton yield measurements each zone was 1 02 m i e two rows by 10 m cotton in each zone was machine harvested with a two row picker case ih 1822 case ih grand island nebraska on 1 november 2016 doy 306 8 november 2017 doy 312 and 30 october 2018 doy 303 cotton yield samples from each harvest zone were bagged and weighed separately after weighing a yield subsample of approximately 150 g was collected from each bag for moisture analysis subsamples were stored in sealed plastic bags until transfer to drying ovens with wet and dry sample weights used to calculate moisture content the remainder of the cotton yield samples was transferred to the mac ginning facility to separate fiber cottonseed and trash moisture content and fiber turnout percentages were used to correct the original bulk cotton yield sample weights to dry fiber yield fby kg ha 1 and cottonseed yield sdy kg ha 1 dry seed cotton yield scy kg ha 1 was computed as the sum of the dry fiber and dry cottonseed weights and fiber fraction frc was computed as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seed cotton yield yield measurements from the three harvest zones in each plot were averaged to obtain the plot level yield amounts used for subsequent analysis after ginning a cotton fiber subsample of approximately 10 g was obtained for each plot and sent to cotton incorporated cary nc usa for analysis of fiber quality via high volume instrument hvi methods six measurements of fiber quality were obtained including micronaire mic unitless upper half mean length uhm mm uniformity index ufi mm mm 1 fiber strength str hvi g tex 1 elongation at failure elo and short fiber content sfc seasonal crop water productivity cwp kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seasonal et based on neutron moisture meter readings from mid may to early october irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seasonal irrigation water applied from march through october table 1 thus iwp incorporated effects from pre season and emergence irrigation while cwp did not 2 4 statistical analysis data collection efforts resulted in 12 measured variables for statistical analysis fby sdy scy etc cwp iwp mic uhm ufi str elo and sfc the main water related treatment effects were quantified as the total water applied rainfall irrigation normalized by the total short crop reference et eto during the irrigation period ipeto mm mm 1 1 ipeto j 1 n r j i j j 1 n e j where n is the total number of days in the irrigation period and r j i j and e j are respectively the precipitation net irrigation and eto that occurred on day j within the period precipitation was added to irrigation rates such that measured variables could be evaluated considering the total water input to the system during each irrigation period this amount was normalized by eto to account for variation in atmospheric demand among the two irrigation periods and three growing seasons which likely resulted in differential amounts of water required the relationship between ipeto and irrigation treatment percentages is shown in fig 4 with high correlation between the two variables linear mixed models were computed using the lme4 package within the r project for statistical computing http r project org for all models the year replicate interaction was fit as a single random effect as it accounted for substantially more variability than replicate alone hierarchical modeling methods were used to identify fixed effects that explained further variation in each variable likelihood ratio tests were conducted for one model that included the fixed effect and a second model with the fixed effect removed which established whether the fixed effect in question significantly contributed to explained variability fixed effects were tested in the following order 1 year 2 ipeto for the first irrigation period from squaring to peak bloom ipeto1 3 ipeto for the second irrigation period from peak bloom to 90 open boll ipeto2 4 the year ipeto1 interaction 5 the year ipeto2 interaction 6 the ipeto1 ipeto2 interaction and 7 the year ipeto1 ipeto2 interaction if the p value for a likelihood ratio test was less the 0 05 the fixed effect was incorporated into the model for subsequent hierarchical tests and modeling analysis otherwise the fixed effect was eliminated from further consideration after selecting fixed effects via hierarchical modeling the accuracy of the final model was evaluated using leave one out cross validation visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality the final linear mixed models were applied to simulate the effects of fine adjustments to ipeto1 and ipeto2 on outcomes of each variable model input values for ipeto1 and ipeto2 were each varied from 0 56 to 1 28 with an increment of 0 01 based on the range of ipeto values encountered during the field trials this analysis extended the field data via a statistical model to permit a finer understanding of the effects of irrigation rates than could be possible with the field data alone 3 results 3 1 model construction hierarchical linear mixed modeling highlighted the fixed effects that explained significant variation in the measured variables table 2 for all variables except etc the year effect explained significant variation p 0 05 meaning variation was due to growing season conditions independent from water management as for etc the cultivar did not change and irrigation management was carefully controlled which resulted in no crop water use variability due to growing season for all cotton yield measurements etc cwp and four of six fiber quality metrics the ipeto1 fixed effect explained significant variability in the measurements notably variation in frc iwp mic and elo could not be explained by ipeto1 but variation in these metrics could be explained by ipeto2 thus frc iwp mic and elo were more determined by late season water management as compared to early season water management with the exception of ufi the ipeto2 fixed effect explained significant variability in all measurements thus water management during the boll filling period had a substantial role in most of the cotton production outcomes these results suggest that opportunities for improving iwp without sacrificing yield or fiber quality exist primarily in the early growing season the year ipeto1 and year ipeto2 interaction effects were significant for all measured variables except a few of the fiber quality metrics the sfc was the only fiber quality metric with significant results for both of these interaction effects p 0 05 overall the responses of most measured variables to water management factors depended on the year in spite of efforts to normalize applied water by cumulative eto in the irrigation period eq 1 significant interaction effects for ipeto1 ipeto2 and for year ipeto1 ipeto2 were less common among the variables notably for frc and mic the ipeto1 ipeto2 effect was significant even though the ipeto1 main effect was not significant this means ipeto1 affected these variables but only through its interaction with ipeto2 3 2 model evaluation finalized linear mixed models included only the significant fixed effects table 2 for a given variable as well as a random effect for the year replicate interaction leave one out cross validation among 192 measurements 64 plots times 3 years provided evaluations of model performance for each variable fig 5 linear mixed models estimated cotton yield and water productivity measurements including fby fig 5a sdy fig 5b scy not shown cwp not shown and iwp fig 5d with root mean squared errors of cross validation rmsecv between 10 9 and 12 5 seasonal et was estimated very well with rmsecv of 1 8 fig 5c likely because the et estimates were computed in part from irrigation amounts thorp et al 2018 which were also incorporated into the main effects of the model eq 1 all the fiber quality metrics were estimated with rmsecv less than 8 except for mic fig 5e the fiber quality data typically demonstrated clustering according to the growing season e g str shown in fig 5f which suggested that variation in these variables was primarily caused by growing season factors and was less related to water management for example the lower values for str fig 5f were all in 2018 which may be related to a higher frequency of level 2 heat stress days during boll development in that year fig 3c overall the cross validated linear mixed models estimated the measured variables with low error and were deemed reasonable for simulations to further understand the outcomes of the field study 3 3 cotton yield measured and modeled cotton yield demonstrated similar patterns of yield differences among the 16 irrigation management treatments fig 6 reducing irrigation rates to 60 of recommended values in either the first or second irrigation periods substantially reduced yield however if first period irrigation rates were dropped to 80 reasonable yield could be achieved as long as second period irrigation rates were 100 or 120 of the recommendation on the other hand if second period irrigation rates were dropped to 80 reasonable yield could be achieved only if overwatering at the 120 rate had previously occurred during the first irrigation period the results suggest that greater opportunities for water savings without substantial yield reduction exist by fine tuning irrigation rates in the first half of the growing season while full irrigation needs to be maintained during the second half modeled fiber yield was highest for the 120 120 irrigation treatment however measured data did not demonstrate a similar yield increase for this treatment thus the model tended to overestimate yield for the 120 120 treatment and the additional water applied was likely wasteful overall the irrigation scheduling algorithm which provided the recommendation for the 100 100 treatment performed adequately to achieve acceptable measured yield potential reductions to rate recommendations without substantial yield declines were no greater than 70 mm 6 of total water applied to the 100 100 treatment this would require formalizing improvements that shift recommendations from rates within the 100 100 treatment region to the 80 100 treatment region fig 6 similar figures for cottonseed yield and seed cotton yield not shown displayed nearly identical patterns as fiber yield among the irrigation treatments 3 4 water productivity increases in both measured and modeled et closely followed increases in irrigation rate fig 7 suggesting that cotton water use was highly correlated with water applied estimated deep seepage did not exceed 97 mm 11 of applied water 63 mm 9 of applied water or 46 mm 6 of applied water in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively not shown the decline in deep seepage over the three growing seasons was likely related to reductions in pre plant irrigation each year table 2 measured iwp demonstrated reduced efficiency when overwatering at the 120 rate during either the first or second irrigation periods fig 8 and reduced iwp for the 60 60 treatment was also apparent the highest mean measured iwp occurred with the 80 80 irrigation treatment and iwp with the 80 100 irrigation treatment was also higher than that for the 100 100 treatment similar to results for yield iwp improvements could be obtained by formalizing methodologies to shift irrigation recommendations from the 100 100 rate toward the 80 100 treatment and possibly the 80 80 treatment linear mixed modeling highlighted the reductions in iwp when overirrigating at the 120 rate during the second irrigation period this likely occurred due to cotton reaching cut out and therefore benefiting little from the additional water in addition to fine tuning early season irrigation rates opportunities also exist to fine tune decisions for irrigation termination optimizing both fiber yield and iwp are often conflicting objectives that require inspection of the pareto frontier fig 9 the data confirm that efforts to schedule irrigation away from the 100 100 treatment and toward the 80 100 treatment could improve iwp without reducing yield scheduling more toward the 80 120 treatment may increase both yield and iwp slightly while scheduling more toward the 80 80 may substantially increase iwp but with a moderate yield reduction mean seasonal irrigation amounts among these four treatments did not differ by more than 176 mm which means any irrigation scheduling adjustments would be constrained to within 12 6 and 1 5 of that for the 100 100 treatment 3 5 fiber quality micronaire between 3 7 and 4 2 is considered optimal for yarn spinning and growers can receive a premium price for mic within this range fiber mic for arizona cotton is often high due to high air temperatures during the arizona cotton growing season bange et al 2010 measured and modeled fiber mic was reduced i e closer to the optimal range when the 120 rate was used during the second irrigation period fig 10 on the other hand fiber mic was highest i e worst for the 60 60 and the 80 60 irrigation treatments lower canopy temperatures due to higher evaporative cooling with higher irrigation rates during boll filling may have contributed to the improvements in fiber mic with a mean value just below 4 2 over three growing seasons only the 60 120 irrigation treatment achieved fiber mic within the optimal range however due to reduced fiber yield fig 6 for this treatment it is likely an impractical management scenario optimal fiber micronaire may be difficult to achieve with this variety in arizona and increasing irrigation during boll filling to improve micronaire may therefore be wasteful other cotton varieties may demonstrate a different response other cotton fiber quality metrics demonstrated expected trends the 60 and 80 rates during the second irrigation period were both detrimental for cotton fiber str fig 11 while the 100 and 120 rates during the second irrigation period provided consistently higher fiber str two fiber quality metrics uhm and sfc not shown generally followed trends similar to etc fig 7 indicating their values were correlated with the total amount of water applied therefore more applied water generally led to longer fibers and reduced content of short fibers reductions for elo were found only when the 60 rate was used in the second irrigation period not shown otherwise elo was fairly consistent among irrigation treatments 4 discussion the greatest opportunity for fine tuning irrigation recommendations exists in the earlier half of the growing season primarily during the period of vegetative development at this time weather variability controls variation in cotton growth and development rates and soil water status impacts root growth distribution current research suggests that young cotton plants acclimate to their environment and early season irrigation management affects this acclimation process meeks et al 2017 furthermore application of growth regulating chemicals is often used to control cotton growth responses and careful early season irrigation management may affect the need for such chemicals irrigation may also be used to regulate heat stress effects on loss of squares and young bolls an issue that is particularly important for arizona cotton production thus a great opportunity is available for development of robust scientific irrigation scheduling tools to manage cotton growth and development particularly during the earlier half of the growing season thorp et al 2017 demonstrated the use of an agroecosystem model for irrigation management in cotton and this approach was further developed and tested in the present study results demonstrated that model recommendations i e the 100 100 treatment for in season irrigation management were reasonable for achieving high cotton yield fig 6 with adequate irrigation water productivity fig 8 however results also suggested that opportunities exist to improve cotton production outcomes by fine tuning recommendations from such irrigation scheduling models methods that incorporate remote or proximal sensing data from satellites unmanned aerial systems irrigation machines or ground based stations can provide in season measurements to guide recommendations from irrigation scheduling models while site specific irrigation may be useful for some fields in some regions better management of the temporal scheduling of irrigation in response to soil weather and crop feedback will likely contribute more to improving iwp in arizona thorp 2019 after the cotton crop reaches full canopy and shifts toward reproductive growth the present study showed that cotton should be fully irrigated on average cotton yield was lower for treatments that withheld water late e g 100 80 rather than early e g 80 100 fig 6 also several fiber quality metrics were improved with full 100 rate and even excess 120 rate irrigation during the second irrigation period figs 10 and 11 this result corroborated results from a previous study in the texas high plains bordovsky et al 2015 the best time to be liberal with irrigation applications is during the cotton boll filling period however further development is needed to fine tune the specific time period when irrigation is more critical a limitation of the present study was the division of the cotton season into only two growth periods with the somewhat arbitrary division at peak bloom or 1155 c days after planting as noted by brown 2008 fruit abscission due to heat stress was most common in bolls aged three to five days also in a controlled environment reddy et al 1992 found that 100 of squares abscised from cotton plants grown at 40 c daytime and 32 c nighttime air temperatures thus irrigation scheduling algorithms may require information on boll age and squaring onset as well as heat stress forecasts such that irrigation could be timed to reduce heat stress effects on fruit loss furthermore measurements of canopy temperature or leaf fluorescence during this time period may provide insights about plant stress status because overirrigation in the second irrigation period tended to reduce iwp fig 8 the decision to terminate irrigation is also critical for maintaining high water productivity information on the number of nodes above white flower or the ratio of immature to open bolls should be incorporated into irrigation scheduling algorithms and sensing technologies capable of monitoring cotton development would be useful for deducing how irrigation recommendations should adjust to plant status throughout the growing season overall the results suggest that improvements to cotton yield and iwp are possible by incorporating improved plant feedback metrics into irrigation scheduling algorithms while the results of the present study are informative a variety of opportunities exist for designing new field studies to more thoroughly evaluate options for reducing applied irrigation and improving iwp for arizona cotton production foremost the role of pre plant irrigation was not directly tested in the field experiment because the study was initiated with limited experience in managing arizona cotton using overhead sprinkler irrigation the overall strategy was to generally follow management practices for proven conventional surface irrigation methods while gradually honing approaches for improving iwp with sprinkler irrigation as such this study followed the long standing tradition to fill the entire soil profile with voluminous pre plant irrigation up to 307 mm or 23 of seasonal applied irrigation table 1 as is usually done with conventional surface irrigated cotton in arizona the traditional approach seeks to wet plant into pre irrigated soil followed by a long period without irrigation to encourage roots to follow the water down it seeks to pre load the soil with water for young seedlings because crop water use at this time is small relative to the amount of water typically applied with surface irrigation it seeks to bank water in the soil to hedge against times when the relative infrequency of surface irrigation results in periods of water stress however because the availability of an overhead sprinkler irrigation system relieves some constraints of surface irrigation systems the need for pre water irrigation must be reevaluated possibly the amount of pre water irrigation could be reduced or even eliminated when a sprinkler irrigation system is available which may substantially reduce seasonal applied irrigation and lead to improved iwp in this case post plant irrigation decisions would require much more careful consideration and scientific basis aside from improved irrigation management and technological developments further agronomic improvements may also contribute to improved iwp for arizona cotton in the final year of the present study no till cotton with overhead sprinkler irrigation was tested at mac for the first time visual evidence from the field trials suggested improved infiltration and better overall crop responses to irrigation treatments furthermore as compared to neighboring field areas with no surface residue no till greatly reduced seedling damage due to blowing sand on windy days following emergence future studies will continue to develop conservation tillage practices for cotton production under irrigation sprinklers in arizona secondly because planting dates were fairly consistent for the three growing seasons there is opportunity to assess planting date effects on cotton yield and iwp further opportunities exist to plant cotton after small grains or other winter crops in arizona reports of the practice are few wang et al 2013 but iwp could possibly be improved by planting a short season cotton variety later in the season which may avoid the timing of sensitive cotton growth stages during the high eto and high heat stress periods in june and july the length of the cotton season would likely be abbreviated and yield likely reduced but water requirements would also be lower adding the winter small grain crop would provide additional opportunity for profitability while hedging against weather and market risk further research is needed to evaluate iwp for these alternative cotton production systems in arizona overall the present study demonstrates the use of modern irrigation equipment including site specific irrigation technology to broaden and multiply the agronomic evaluation of irrigation management approaches in cotton future research can expand such tests to other varieties and crops while also incorporating tests of precision fertigation to evaluate nitrogen management impacts on iwp 5 conclusions because the irrigation treatments were established as a percentage of the recommendation from an in season irrigation scheduling model the field experiment provided important validation of irrigation recommendations by demonstrating agroecosystem outcomes when the recommendations were adjusted higher or lower during two periods of the growing season while results demonstrated that the scheduling tool generally led to reasonable outcomes for cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality the study also provided ample guidance on ways to further improve irrigation management both within and external to the scope of the study itself to continue improving cotton irrigation management with overhead sprinkler irrigation in arizona future research should clarify the requirements for pre plant and early season irrigation develop better linkages between crop growth stages crop sensing technologies and irrigation scheduling tools identify methodologies to reduce water and heat stress during reproductive growth and clarify strategies for decisions on irrigation termination conflict of interest

10650,irrigated agriculture in the arizona low desert faces multiple threats including drought in the colorado river basin depletion of reservoirs supplying water to irrigation districts competition from growing municipal and industrial sectors and climate uncertainty improving irrigation water productivity is imperative for sustaining agricultural production in the region the objective of the study was to measure responses of cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality to variable irrigation rates and timings for the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton growing seasons at maricopa arizona four irrigation rates were used including 60 80 100 and 120 of recommended amounts from a scheduling tool the four rates were administered differentially during two time periods 1 squaring to peak bloom and 2 peak bloom to 90 open boll the experimental design incorporated 16 irrigation treatments in a randomized block design with four replications and irrigation was applied via an overhead lateral move sprinkler system with commercial site specific irrigation equipment linear mixed models could estimate cotton fiber yield seasonal evapotranspiration fiber micronaire and fiber strength with root mean squared errors of cross validation rmsecv of 11 9 1 8 6 4 and 3 6 respectively variation in irrigation water productivity and several fiber quality metrics could be explained by water applied in the second irrigation period but not in the first suggesting more opportunity in the early season for improving water productivity without sacrificing yield or fiber quality irrigation rates in the first period could be reduced up to 70 mm 6 of total water applied to the 100 100 treatment without sacrificing yield during the second irrigation period full irrigation was required to prevent yield losses and maintain high fiber quality this study provides valuable guidance on opportunities for using sprinkler irrigation to improve water productivity while maintaining acceptable cotton yield and fiber quality in the arizona low desert further effort is needed to clarify requirements for pre plant irrigation incorporate plant feedback data into in season irrigation scheduling algorithms and identify metrics to guide irrigation termination decisions keywords cotton evapotranspiration irrigation management mixed model overhead sprinkler water use efficiency 1 introduction improving the water productivity of agroecosystems is a primary objective globally particularly in arid and semi arid regions that require irrigation to supplement limited precipitation ali and talukder 2008 brauman et al 2013 for example in the water limited environment of the arizona low desert a number of factors increase the urgent need for water productivity improvements including ongoing drought in the colorado river basin prein et al 2016 depletion of lake mead which supplies colorado river water for local irrigation districts holdren and turner 2010 competition from municipalities and industries in metropolitan areas and climate uncertainty cayan et al 2010 ali and talukder 2008 described 18 techniques for improving the water productivity of agroecosystems including various improvements to irrigation and fertilization management plant breeding to increase harvest index or reduce transpiration and other agronomic considerations similarly evans and sadler 2008 described a variety of irrigation technologies with potential to improve water productivity including scientific irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation site specific irrigation microirrigation and decision support systems improvements to irrigation methods systems and management are primary solutions for improving water productivity both in the arizona low desert and worldwide howell 2001 pereira et al 2002 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a primary commodity crop in the arizona low desert with 71 000 ha planted in 2018 and an annual production value of approximately 200 million for both fiber and cottonseed usda 2019 surface irrigation management with cotton planted on raised beds between furrows is the primary cotton production system in the region mainly due to existing infrastructure for delivery of colorado river water to growers through irrigation district canals early efforts to improve irrigation management for these systems sought to optimize timings for the first post plant irrigation event steger et al 1998 and the final irrigation event of the season unruh and silvertooth 1997 tronstad et al 2003 both radin et al 1992 and hunsaker et al 1998 reported higher cotton yield and water productivity by applying smaller amounts of surface irrigation more frequently also hunsaker et al 2005 2015 developed remote sensing technologies for scientific irrigation scheduling of surface irrigated cotton systems in arizona while these studies provided general recommendations for improving cotton irrigation management they were mainly limited by the irrigation system because amounts and placement of water cannot be precisely controlled with surface irrigation more recently the direction for cotton irrigation research in arizona has shifted away from traditional surface irrigation made possible by investments in modern overhead sprinkler irrigation systems bronson et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 because sprinkler systems offer much greater control of irrigation applications as compared to surface irrigation for example with greater ability to apply smaller amounts of water more frequently and even site specifically thorp 2019 greater opportunity now exists to develop irrigation management practices and technologies that improve water productivity also the unique environment of the arizona low desert provides an added advantage for this endeavor because limited precipitation enables scientific field investigations that are not confounded by rainfall over the past several decades high quality field research in the texas high plains has led the way to use of modern irrigation equipment for clarifying impacts of irrigation management on cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality at halfway texas irrigation amounts of 40 60 80 and 100 of irrigation recommendations based on evapotranspiration et were applied to field plots at 3 5 9 and 15 day intervals using an overhead linear move sprinkler system with site specific irrigation technology bordovsky et al 1992 cotton fiber yield and irrigation water productivity iwp the ratio of irrigated yield minus dryland yield and seasonal irrigation were both significantly higher at the 3 day irrigation interval over the three year study at the same site bordovsky et al 2015 later field tested combinations of three irrigation rates applied during three distinct cotton growing periods based on accumulated growing degree days resulting in 27 irrigation management regimes results of the four year study demonstrated lower iwp and sometimes lower cotton yield for treatments that aimed to store water in the soil profile by overirrigating in the early season the later cotton growth period characterized by cotton boll filling and maturation was the most critical time for irrigation requiring sufficient water to maintain acceptable cotton fiber yield with high iwp at a lubbock texas site with a surface drip irrigation system a 12 year study tested different irrigation scheduling techniques based on canopy temperature and soil water content measurements concluding that irrigation schedules based on canopy temperature could maximize cotton fiber yield without applying excess irrigation wanjura et al 2002 at bushland texas researchers measured cotton et with large weighing lysimeters during two growing seasons concluding that cotton yield and water productivity in the northern texas high plains were similar to more highly noted cotton production regions in the united states howell et al 2004 lastly snowden et al 2013 measured effects of different irrigation rates on cotton yield boll distribution and fiber quality at lamesa and new deal texas they found that irrigation effects on fiber micronaire depended on the growing season these field studies from the texas high plains and similar studies elsewhere in the world conaty et al 2015 ghaderi far et al 2012 ibragimov et al 2007 lamb et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 have offered great inspiration for the present study the overall goal was to quantify effects of irrigation rates and timing on cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality at a research station in the arizona low desert the study was motivated by recent installation of a six span lateral move sprinkler irrigation system at the station thorp et al 2017 which was fully retrofitted with commercial site specific irrigation equipment after the 2015 cotton season the new system has enabled irrigation management research that was not previously possible at the site specific objectives were to 1 conduct a field experiment using site specific sprinkler irrigation technology to apply different irrigation rates at different times during the cotton growing season and 2 identify irrigation management practices that improve water productivity while maintaining acceptable cotton yield and fiber quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment a cotton field experiment was conducted at the university of arizona s maricopa agricultural center mac near maricopa arizona 33 079 n 111 977 w 360 m above sea level during the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton growing seasons fig 1 the experiment tested responses of cotton yield water use and fiber quality to variable irrigation rate and timing for one commercial cotton variety deltapine 1549 b2xf monsanto company st louis missouri the variety was chosen based on its performance in arizona variety trials prior to the present study the plots were relatively large 12 2 m 12 cotton rows 30 0 m and required 3 8 ha of the 5 8 ha total field area a randomized block design was used with four replicated blocks and 16 irrigation treatments per block for a total of 64 plots the blocks were typically arranged within a single span of the overhead irrigation system however the position of the easternmost block was adjusted each year to accommodate other research activities at the site fig 1 the 16 irrigation management treatments involved all the possible combinations of four irrigation rates applied during two distinct periods of the growing season the four irrigation rates were 60 80 100 and 120 of the recommendation provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the csm cropgro cotton agroecosystem model thorp et al 2017 the two irrigation periods were from first square to peak bloom approximately the first of june through mid july and from peak bloom to 90 open boll approximately mid july through the first week of september the heat units since planting for the first and second irrigation periods ranged from 480 to 1155 c days and from 1155 to 2040 c days respectively as reported by an arizona meteorological network azmet http ag arizona edu azmet weather station approximately 1 2 km from the field site the 16 irrigation management treatments led to cotton being grown with a variety of soil water status conditions fig 2 the environment for cotton production in the arizona low desert is arid and hot with daily minimum and maximum air temperatures regularly exceeding 25 and 40 c respectively from july through august corresponding to day of year doy 182 243 fig 3 this normally coincides with the time of cotton reproductive development heat stress impacts cotton yield during this time primarily by increasing flower abnormalities and abscission of bolls aged 3 5 days brown 2008 as such azmet provides daily information on level 1 and level 2 heat stress conditions based on air temperature and humidity measurements the number of days during july and august with level 1 and level 2 heat stress conditions was 31 and 16 in 2016 34 and 11 in 2017 and 23 and 21 in 2018 respectively fig 3 thus there were fewer heat stress days in 2018 but a higher number of level 2 heat stress days the cotton growing season also straddles the arizona monsoon season in july and august where relative humidity and dew point temperatures rise sharply fig 3 and precipitation amounts increase fig 2 as measured by the azmet weather station growing season precipitation from april through september doy 91 273 amounted to 42 51 and 89 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 while precipitation during the monsoon season in july and august amounted to 27 mm 65 50 mm 99 and 70 mm 78 in comparison short crop reference et eto from april through september amounted to 1364 1404 and 1372 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively thus cotton production requires irrigation to meet evaporative demand and dryland production is not a realistic possibility the soil texture at the field site was primarily sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between 0 16 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and lower limits between 0 08 and 0 11 cm3 cm 3 cover crops were grown in the winter months between cotton seasons to reduce soil nutrient variability and improve soil quality the field was prepared for cover crop planting by deep ripping disking and either planing or laser leveling annual ryegrass festuca perennis lam was planted on 3

to the 2016 and 2017 season the field was ripped disked and planed in march before pre plant irrigation cotton was later planted on flat ground following field cultivation and incorporation of pre emergent herbicide containing pendimethalin prowl h2o basf florham park new jersey usa following manufacturer s recommendations for application decisions in 2018 no spring tillage was performed and cotton was planted directly into the terminated barley cover crop pre emergent herbicide was applied to the soil surface and watered in with a light 10 2 mm irrigation following irrigation termination

irrigation management as reported by thorp et al 2017 an overhead lateral move sprinkler irrigation system zimmatic lindsay corporation omaha nebraska was newly installed at the field site in 2014 following the 2015 cotton growing season advanced technology was added to the irrigation machine which permitted site specific irrigation applications based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine s control panel growsmart precision variable rate irrigation lindsay corporation omaha nebraska irrigation rates were computed uniquely for each drop hose using information from 1 the user provided application rate map 2 two global positioning system gps receivers on opposite ends of the lateral and 3 a database of system characteristics which included offset distances of each drop hose along the lateral the system used wireless communication among 88 nodes to relay information along the lateral and each wireless node provided individual control for four drop hoses by adjusting the duty cycles of four electronic solenoid valves the machine was equipped with 0 158 l s 1 nozzles in 2016 and 2017 12 senninger clermont florida and 0 201 l s 1 nozzles in 2018 13 5 senninger clermont florida nozzles were spaced 1 02 m apart located at the center of each cotton interrow area and positioned to emit water less than 1 0 m above the soil surface for uniform soil wetting prior to cotton emergence spray pads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5 0 m were used after cotton emergence the pads were changed to a bubbler style which emitted large droplets with a 0 3 m spray diameter at the center of each interrow area in addition to reducing water loss to evaporation the bubbler pads increased the spatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application areas delineated in the georeferenced irrigation maps spatial application error with the site specific irrigation machine was estimated to be less than 2 0 m the cotton growing season was partitioned into five distinct time periods with unique objectives for irrigation management and soil water status 1 pre season irrigation management to raise the soil water content and fill the soil profile prior to planting cotton 2 post planting irrigation to emerge the cotton crop and reduce soil crusting to prevent cotyledon breakage during emergence 3 weekly in season irrigation to apply four irrigation rates to plots from first square 480 c days after planting to peak bloom 1155 c days after planting 4 weekly in season irrigation to apply four irrigation rates to plots from peak bloom to 90 open boll 2040 c days after planting and 5 no irrigation during the field dry down period to prepare cotton for defoliant applications and harvest table 1 uniform irrigation management was used during the pre season and emergence irrigation periods in 2016 307 mm was applied in march prior to planting but pre plant irrigation amounts were reduced to 264 mm in 2017 and to 222 mm in 2018 table 1 following cotton planting light irrigation with amounts ranging from 8 to 20 mm was applied every few days to emerge the cotton crop and reduce soil surface crusting to prevent breakage of the emerging cotyledon after emergence irrigation was applied approximately weekly at rates less than 20 mm for approximately four weeks until first square traditionally little to no irrigation is applied to arizona cotton at this time to encourage root growth to deeper soil layers that hold water from pre plant irrigation and perhaps to acclimate the young plants to the hot and dry environment meeks et al 2017 total irrigation applied during the cotton emergence period was 173 136 and 127 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 prior to initiating water management treatments at first square the field average soil water content from the surface to 140 cm was 25 1 25 4 and 23 9 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively this means the effects of pre season and emergence irrigation on seasonal interaction among measured variables was likely minor regular irrigation scheduling and management commenced around first square i e the first week of june due to practical considerations for field entry labor availability and water delivery to the field site the irrigation scheduling methodology followed a weekly cycle monday and tuesday were established as dry days for field entry to collect measurements and perform any required tractor based operations irrigation scheduling algorithms were run on monday which resulted in a weekly irrigation recommendation for the 100 100 irrigation treatment and a prescription map to alter the irrigation rates for other plots via the site specific sprinkler irrigation machine a water delivery request was then submitted to the research station s water manager who required a 24 h advanced notice for water delivery each week water was requested for wednesday thursday and friday as needed pending availability of labor to 1 manage delivery of water to the field site via concrete lined canals and 2 operate the sprinkler irrigation machine analysis of soils data suggested that the field site had sufficient available water holding capacity to satisfy crop water requirements for a week or more at peak seasonal water demand thorp 2019 which made the weekly irrigation management methodology more plausible following the method of thorp et al 2017 irrigation schedules were determined using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm specifically the csm cropgro cotton model jones et al 2003 a thorough description of the model was provided by thorp et al 2014a also thorp et al 2014b and thorp et al 2017 described efforts to calibrate the model using data from other cotton field experiments at the research station prior to 2016 furthermore dejonge and thorp 2017 described recent efforts to update the et algorithms in the dssat csm model thorp et al 2017 described the methodology for combining past weather measurements and future weather predictions to conduct csm cropgro cotton simulations for in season irrigation management decisions while thorp et al 2017 based irrigation decisions only on simulated root zone soil water depletion additional model outputs were analyzed in the present study including future predictions for et and water stress factors for growth and photosynthesis the irrigation recommendation was the smallest irrigation amount that supplied model predicted et eliminated model predictions of water stress and maintained root zone soil water depletion below 45 based on average simulated responses among predictions from future weather scenarios that were estimated from historical weather data at the site this amount was assigned to plots receiving 100 of the irrigation recommendation in both the first and second irrigation periods because some plots received 120 of this amount i e 20 more the number of passes of the irrigation machine was increased to supply the extra water to these plots prior to each growing season field plots were mapped in a geographic information system qgis www qgis org based on data from field surveys with real time kinematic rtk global positioning equipment with cm level horizontal accuracy fig 1 following the randomized block experimental design a shapefile was created to delineate plot areas for site specific irrigation applications and the shapefile was loaded to the commercial software provided by the manufacturer of the site specific irrigation equipment fieldmap lindsay corporation omaha nebraska the irrigation rate percentages for each plot could be adjusted in the software however because rates could only be specified from 0 to 100 the irrigation treatments of 60 80 100 and 120 of the model based irrigation recommendation were mapped to rates of 50 0 66 7 83 3 and 100 0 in the software by adjusting the total number of irrigation passes to supply the required irrigation amount for the 120 treatment these rates ensured that plots received the intended irrigation amounts after finalizing the irrigation rates the software wrote an irrigation prescription file to a usb flash drive which was transported to the field for uploading the prescription map to the irrigation machine plot specific irrigation for the first irrigation period first square to peak bloom commenced on 8 june doy 160 1 june doy 152 and 30 may doy 150 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 rate adjustments for the second irrigation period peak bloom to 90 open boll occurred on 20 july doy 202 15 july doy 196 and 15 july doy 196 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively adjusting the irrigation rates was easily accomplished by simply changing the rate percentages for all plots in the irrigation prescription map the final irrigation of each season occurred on 9 september 2016 doy 253 8 september 2017 doy 251 and 7 september 2018 doy 250 giving a total of 16 irrigation management regimes in each cotton season fig 2 to allow for spatial application errors with the site specific irrigation equipment and to minimize impacts of overland flow between adjacent plot areas buffer regions were established in the area between plots fig 1 a 10 m buffer distance was established between plots along the row and a 2 m i e 2 row buffer distance was established between plots perpendicular to the row due to compaction from tractor tires greater potential for overland flow existed parallel to the rows thus a larger buffer distance was used impacts of overland flow were also minimized by operating the irrigation machine at full speed and making multiple passes over consecutive days to supply the weekly irrigation rates using these tactics overland flow was typically not observed in excess of 10 m from the point of application reduced visual observations of overland flow in the 2018 growing season suggested that no till management improved infiltration rates and provided increased surface residue for obstructing overland flow substantial efforts were made to identify and implement ways to reduce impacts of overland flow on the irrigation treatments based on pre plant

steel access tubes were installed at the center of each plot fig 1 using a tractor mounted soil sampler model 25 ts giddings machine co windsor colorado from mid may to early october the neutron moisture meter was deployed on a weekly basis approximately 20 times per growing season to measure soil water content from 0 1 to 1 9 m in 0 2 m incremental depths at each access tube soil water content data were used to estimate et and deep seepage between successive measurement events the specific details of the et and deep seepage calculations were previously described by thorp et al 2018 based on the soil water balance approach of hunsaker et al 2005 three zones were delineated in each plot for cotton yield measurements each zone was 1 02 m i e two rows by 10 m cotton in each zone was machine harvested with a two row picker case ih 1822 case ih grand island nebraska on 1 november 2016 doy 306 8 november 2017 doy 312 and 30 october 2018 doy 303 cotton yield samples from each harvest zone were bagged and weighed separately after weighing a yield subsample of approximately 150 g was collected from each bag for moisture analysis subsamples were stored in sealed plastic bags until transfer to drying ovens with wet and dry sample weights used to calculate moisture content the remainder of the cotton yield samples was transferred to the mac ginning facility to separate fiber cottonseed and trash moisture content and fiber turnout percentages were used to correct the original bulk cotton yield sample weights to dry fiber yield fby kg ha 1 and cottonseed yield sdy kg ha 1 dry seed cotton yield scy kg ha 1 was computed as the sum of the dry fiber and dry cottonseed weights and fiber fraction frc was computed as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seed cotton yield yield measurements from the three harvest zones in each plot were averaged to obtain the plot level yield amounts used for subsequent analysis after ginning a cotton fiber subsample of approximately 10 g was obtained for each plot and sent to cotton incorporated cary nc usa for analysis of fiber quality via high volume instrument hvi methods six measurements of fiber quality were obtained including

cwp kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seasonal et based on neutron moisture meter readings from mid may to early october irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of dry fiber yield and seasonal irrigation water applied from march through october table 1 thus iwp incorporated effects from pre season and emergence irrigation while cwp did not 2 4 statistical analysis data collection efforts resulted in 12 measured variables for statistical analysis fby sdy scy etc cwp iwp mic uhm ufi str elo and sfc the main water related treatment effects were quantified as the total water applied rainfall irrigation normalized by the total short crop reference et eto during the irrigation period ipeto mm mm 1 1 ipeto j 1 n r j i j j 1 n e j where n is the total number of days in the irrigation period and r j i j and e j are respectively the precipitation net irrigation and eto that occurred on day j within the period precipitation was added to irrigation rates such that measured variables could be evaluated considering the total water input to the system during each irrigation period this amount was normalized by eto to account for variation in atmospheric demand among the two irrigation periods and three growing seasons which likely resulted in differential amounts of water required the relationship between ipeto and irrigation treatment percentages is shown in fig 4 with high correlation between the two variables linear mixed models were computed using the lme4 package within the r project for statistical computing http r project org for all models the year replicate interaction was fit as a single random effect as it accounted for substantially more variability than replicate alone hierarchical modeling methods were used to identify fixed effects that explained further variation in each variable likelihood ratio tests were conducted for one model that included the fixed effect and a second model with the fixed effect removed which established whether the fixed effect in question significantly contributed to explained variability fixed effects were tested in the following order 1 year 2 ipeto for the first irrigation period from squaring to peak bloom ipeto1 3 ipeto for the second irrigation period from peak bloom to 90 open boll ipeto2 4 the year ipeto1 interaction 5 the year ipeto2 interaction 6 the ipeto1 ipeto2 interaction and 7 the year ipeto1 ipeto2 interaction if the p value for a likelihood ratio test was less the 0 05 the fixed effect was incorporated into the model for subsequent hierarchical tests and modeling analysis otherwise the fixed effect was eliminated from further consideration after selecting fixed effects via hierarchical modeling the accuracy of the final model was evaluated using leave one out cross validation visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality the final linear mixed models were applied to simulate the effects of fine adjustments to ipeto1 and ipeto2 on outcomes of each variable model input values for ipeto1 and ipeto2 were each varied from 0 56 to 1 28 with an increment of 0 01 based on the range of ipeto values encountered during the field trials this analysis extended the field data via a statistical model to permit a finer understanding of the effects of irrigation rates than could be possible with the field data alone 3 results 3 1 model construction hierarchical linear mixed modeling highlighted the fixed effects that explained significant variation in the measured variables table 2 for all variables except etc the year effect explained significant variation p 0 05 meaning variation was due to growing season conditions independent from water management as for etc the cultivar did not change and irrigation management was carefully controlled which resulted in no crop water use variability due to growing season for all cotton yield measurements etc cwp and four of six fiber quality metrics the ipeto1 fixed effect explained significant variability in the measurements notably variation in frc iwp mic and elo could not be explained by ipeto1 but variation in these metrics could be explained by ipeto2 thus frc iwp mic and elo were more determined by late season water management as compared to early season water management with the exception of ufi the ipeto2 fixed effect explained significant variability in all measurements thus water management during the boll filling period had a substantial role in most of the cotton production outcomes these results suggest that opportunities for improving iwp without sacrificing yield or fiber quality exist primarily in the early growing season the year ipeto1 and year ipeto2 interaction effects were significant for all measured variables except a few of the fiber quality metrics the sfc was the only fiber quality metric with significant results for both of these interaction effects p 0 05 overall the responses of most measured variables to water management factors depended on the year in spite of efforts to normalize applied water by cumulative eto in the irrigation period eq 1 significant interaction effects for ipeto1 ipeto2 and for year ipeto1 ipeto2 were less common among the variables notably for frc and mic the ipeto1 ipeto2 effect was significant even though the ipeto1 main effect was not significant this means ipeto1 affected these variables but only through its interaction with ipeto2 3 2 model evaluation finalized linear mixed models included only the significant fixed effects table 2 for a given variable as well as a random effect for the year replicate interaction leave one out cross validation among 192 measurements 64 plots times 3 years provided evaluations of model performance for each variable fig 5 linear mixed models estimated cotton yield and water productivity measurements including fby fig 5a sdy fig 5b scy not shown cwp not shown and iwp fig 5d with root mean squared errors of cross validation rmsecv between 10 9 and 12 5 seasonal et was estimated very well with rmsecv of 1 8 fig 5c likely because the et estimates were computed in part from irrigation amounts thorp et al 2018 which were also incorporated into the main effects of the model eq 1 all the fiber quality metrics were estimated with rmsecv less than 8 except for mic fig 5e the fiber quality data typically demonstrated clustering according to the growing season e g str shown in fig 5f which suggested that variation in these variables was primarily caused by growing season factors and was less related to water management for example the lower values for str fig 5f were all in 2018 which may be related to a higher frequency of level 2 heat stress days during boll development in that year fig 3c overall the cross validated linear mixed models estimated the measured variables with low error and were deemed reasonable for simulations to further understand the outcomes of the field study 3 3 cotton yield measured and modeled cotton yield demonstrated similar patterns of yield differences among the 16 irrigation management treatments fig 6 reducing irrigation rates to 60 of recommended values in either the first or second irrigation periods substantially reduced yield however if first period irrigation rates were dropped to 80 reasonable yield could be achieved as long as second period irrigation rates were 100 or 120 of the recommendation on the other hand if second period irrigation rates were dropped to 80 reasonable yield could be achieved only if overwatering at the 120 rate had previously occurred during the first irrigation period the results suggest that greater opportunities for water savings without substantial yield reduction exist by fine tuning irrigation rates in the first half of the growing season while full irrigation needs to be maintained during the second half modeled fiber yield was highest for the 120 120 irrigation treatment however measured data did not demonstrate a similar yield increase for this treatment thus the model tended to overestimate yield for the 120 120 treatment and the additional water applied was likely wasteful overall the irrigation scheduling algorithm which provided the recommendation for the 100 100 treatment performed adequately to achieve acceptable measured yield potential reductions to rate recommendations without substantial yield declines were no greater than 70 mm 6 of total water applied to the 100 100 treatment this would require formalizing improvements that shift recommendations from rates within the 100 100 treatment region to the 80 100 treatment region fig 6 similar figures for cottonseed yield and seed cotton yield not shown displayed nearly identical patterns as fiber yield among the irrigation treatments 3 4 water productivity increases in both measured and modeled et closely followed increases in irrigation rate fig 7 suggesting that cotton water use was highly correlated with water applied estimated deep seepage did not exceed 97 mm 11 of applied water 63 mm 9 of applied water or 46 mm 6 of applied water in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively not shown the decline in deep seepage over the three growing seasons was likely related to reductions in pre plant irrigation each year table 2 measured iwp demonstrated reduced efficiency when overwatering at the 120 rate during either the first or second irrigation periods fig 8 and reduced iwp for the 60 60 treatment was also apparent the highest mean measured iwp occurred with the 80 80 irrigation treatment and iwp with the 80 100 irrigation treatment was also higher than that for the 100 100 treatment similar to results for yield iwp improvements could be obtained by formalizing methodologies to shift irrigation recommendations from the 100 100 rate toward the 80 100 treatment and possibly the 80 80 treatment linear mixed modeling highlighted the reductions in iwp when overirrigating at the 120 rate during the second irrigation period this likely occurred due to cotton reaching cut out and therefore benefiting little from the additional water in addition to fine tuning early season irrigation rates opportunities also exist to fine tune decisions for irrigation termination optimizing both fiber yield and iwp are often conflicting objectives that require inspection of the pareto frontier fig 9 the data confirm that efforts to schedule irrigation away from the 100 100 treatment and toward the 80 100 treatment could improve iwp without reducing yield scheduling more toward the 80 120 treatment may increase both yield and iwp slightly while scheduling more toward the 80 80 may substantially increase iwp but with a moderate yield reduction mean seasonal irrigation amounts among these four treatments did not differ by more than 176 mm which means any irrigation scheduling adjustments would be constrained to within 12 6 and 1 5 of that for the 100 100 treatment 3 5 fiber quality micronaire between 3 7 and 4 2 is considered optimal for yarn spinning and growers can receive a premium price for mic within this range fiber mic for arizona cotton is often high due to high air temperatures during the arizona cotton growing season bange et al 2010 measured and modeled fiber mic was reduced i e closer to the optimal range when the 120 rate was used during the second irrigation period fig 10 on the other hand fiber mic was highest i e worst for the 60 60 and the 80 60 irrigation treatments lower canopy temperatures due to higher evaporative cooling with higher irrigation rates during boll filling may have contributed to the improvements in fiber mic with a mean value just below 4 2 over three growing seasons only the 60 120 irrigation treatment achieved fiber mic within the optimal range however due to reduced fiber yield fig 6 for this treatment it is likely an impractical management scenario optimal fiber micronaire may be difficult to achieve with this variety in arizona and increasing irrigation during boll filling to improve micronaire may therefore be wasteful other cotton varieties may demonstrate a different response other cotton fiber quality metrics demonstrated expected trends the 60 and 80 rates during the second irrigation period were both detrimental for cotton fiber str fig 11 while the 100 and 120 rates during the second irrigation period provided consistently higher fiber str two fiber quality metrics uhm and sfc not shown generally followed trends similar to etc fig 7 indicating their values were correlated with the total amount of water applied therefore more applied water generally led to longer fibers and reduced content of short fibers reductions for elo were found only when the 60 rate was used in the second irrigation period not shown otherwise elo was fairly consistent among irrigation treatments 4 discussion the greatest opportunity for fine tuning irrigation recommendations exists in the earlier half of the growing season primarily during the period of vegetative development at this time weather variability controls variation in cotton growth and development rates and soil water status impacts root growth distribution current research suggests that young cotton plants acclimate to their environment and early season irrigation management affects this acclimation process meeks et al 2017 furthermore application of growth regulating chemicals is often used to control cotton growth responses and careful early season irrigation management may affect the need for such chemicals irrigation may also be used to regulate heat stress effects on loss of squares and young bolls an issue that is particularly important for arizona cotton production thus a great opportunity is available for development of robust scientific irrigation scheduling tools to manage cotton growth and development particularly during the earlier half of the growing season thorp et al 2017 demonstrated the use of an agroecosystem model for irrigation management in cotton and this approach was further developed and tested in the present study results demonstrated that model recommendations i e the 100 100 treatment for in season irrigation management were reasonable for achieving high cotton yield fig 6 with adequate irrigation water productivity fig 8 however results also suggested that opportunities exist to improve cotton production outcomes by fine tuning recommendations from such irrigation scheduling models methods that incorporate remote or proximal sensing data from satellites unmanned aerial systems irrigation machines or ground based stations can provide in season measurements to guide recommendations from irrigation scheduling models while site specific irrigation may be useful for some fields in some regions better management of the temporal scheduling of irrigation in response to soil weather and crop feedback will likely contribute more to improving iwp in arizona thorp 2019 after the cotton crop reaches full canopy and shifts toward reproductive growth the present study showed that cotton should be fully irrigated on average cotton yield was lower for treatments that withheld water late e g 100 80 rather than early e g 80 100 fig 6 also several fiber quality metrics were improved with full 100 rate and even excess 120 rate irrigation during the second irrigation period figs 10 and 11 this result corroborated results from a previous study in the texas high plains bordovsky et al 2015 the best time to be liberal with irrigation applications is during the cotton boll filling period however further development is needed to fine tune the specific time period when irrigation is more critical a limitation of the present study was the division of the cotton season into only two growth periods with the somewhat arbitrary division at peak bloom or 1155 c days after planting as noted by brown 2008 fruit abscission due to heat stress was most common in bolls aged three to five days also in a controlled environment reddy et al 1992 found that 100 of squares abscised from cotton plants grown at 40 c daytime and 32 c nighttime air temperatures thus irrigation scheduling algorithms may require information on boll age and squaring onset as well as heat stress forecasts such that irrigation could be timed to reduce heat stress effects on fruit loss furthermore measurements of canopy temperature or leaf fluorescence during this time period may provide insights about plant stress status because overirrigation in the second irrigation period tended to reduce iwp fig 8 the decision to terminate irrigation is also critical for maintaining high water productivity information on the number of nodes above white flower or the ratio of immature to open bolls should be incorporated into irrigation scheduling algorithms and sensing technologies capable of monitoring cotton development would be useful for deducing how irrigation recommendations should adjust to plant status throughout the growing season overall the results suggest that improvements to cotton yield and iwp are possible by incorporating improved plant feedback metrics into irrigation scheduling algorithms while the results of the present study are informative a variety of opportunities exist for designing new field studies to more thoroughly evaluate options for reducing applied irrigation and improving iwp for arizona cotton production foremost the role of pre plant irrigation was not directly tested in the field experiment because the study was initiated with limited experience in managing arizona cotton using overhead sprinkler irrigation the overall strategy was to generally follow management practices for proven conventional surface irrigation methods while gradually honing approaches for improving iwp with sprinkler irrigation as such this study followed the long standing tradition to fill the entire soil profile with voluminous pre plant irrigation up to 307 mm or 23 of seasonal applied irrigation table 1 as is usually done with conventional surface irrigated cotton in arizona the traditional approach seeks to wet plant into pre irrigated soil followed by a long period without irrigation to encourage roots to follow the water down it seeks to pre load the soil with water for young seedlings because crop water use at this time is small relative to the amount of water typically applied with surface irrigation it seeks to bank water in the soil to hedge against times when the relative infrequency of surface irrigation results in periods of water stress however because the availability of an overhead sprinkler irrigation system relieves some constraints of surface irrigation systems the need for pre water irrigation must be reevaluated possibly the amount of pre water irrigation could be reduced or even eliminated when a sprinkler irrigation system is available which may substantially reduce seasonal applied irrigation and lead to improved iwp in this case post plant irrigation decisions would require much more careful consideration and scientific basis aside from improved irrigation management and technological developments further agronomic improvements may also contribute to improved iwp for arizona cotton in the final year of the present study no till cotton with overhead sprinkler irrigation was tested at mac for the first time visual evidence from the field trials suggested improved infiltration and better overall crop responses to irrigation treatments furthermore as compared to neighboring field areas with no surface residue no till greatly reduced seedling damage due to blowing sand on windy days following emergence future studies will continue to develop conservation tillage practices for cotton production under irrigation sprinklers in arizona secondly because planting dates were fairly consistent for the three growing seasons there is opportunity to assess planting date effects on cotton yield and iwp further opportunities exist to plant cotton after small grains or other winter crops in arizona reports of the practice are few wang et al 2013 but iwp could possibly be improved by planting a short season cotton variety later in the season which may avoid the timing of sensitive cotton growth stages during the high eto and high heat stress periods in june and july the length of the cotton season would likely be abbreviated and yield likely reduced but water requirements would also be lower adding the winter small grain crop would provide additional opportunity for profitability while hedging against weather and market risk further research is needed to evaluate iwp for these alternative cotton production systems in arizona overall the present study demonstrates the use of modern irrigation equipment including site specific irrigation technology to broaden and multiply the agronomic evaluation of irrigation management approaches in cotton future research can expand such tests to other varieties and crops while also incorporating tests of precision fertigation to evaluate nitrogen management impacts on iwp 5 conclusions because the irrigation treatments were established as a percentage of the recommendation from an in season irrigation scheduling model the field experiment provided important validation of irrigation recommendations by demonstrating agroecosystem outcomes when the recommendations were adjusted higher or lower during two periods of the growing season while results demonstrated that the scheduling tool generally led to reasonable outcomes for cotton yield water productivity and fiber quality the study also provided ample guidance on ways to further improve irrigation management both within and external to the scope of the study itself to continue improving cotton irrigation management with overhead sprinkler irrigation in arizona future research should clarify the requirements for pre plant and early season irrigation develop better linkages between crop growth stages crop sensing technologies and irrigation scheduling tools identify methodologies to reduce water and heat stress during reproductive growth and clarify strategies for decisions on irrigation termination conflict of interest

solutions to water scarcity in this study a numerical simulation method is applied to investigate the factors that affect seepage from earthen channels seep w software was used to generate finite element method fem solutions of the seepage flow equations 246 numerical models including different sections of trapezoidal rectangular and triangular earthen channels were studied using fem numerical results are compared to available observation data from zayandeh rud irrigation channels in iran non linear regression equations for the four empirical seepage equations are obtained from the spss statistical software the results show that nonlinear multivariate regression relationships provide a suitable match for estimating seepage discharge the accuracy of the suggested nonlinear regression equation in terms of r2 and re are 0 928 and 2 42 respectively comparison of the seepage discharge with the empirical relationships showed that the empirical relationships have excessive error keywords seepage earthen channel numerical method boundary condition regression 1 introduction in irrigation systems channels are often used to transfer water from reservoirs to agricultural land in addition water might be used to meet industrial and urban needs in most cases the actual amount of water at the end of the channel is significantly less than the amount that entered channels the most important cause of the decrease is water seepage from the channels consequently diagnosing and quantifying seepage from channels is critically important for the protection of water resources management of surface water and groundwater determining the severity of seepage related loss and for the assessment of the potential technical and fiscal benefits of seepage reduction techniques and technologies martin and gates 2014 for downstream agricultural uses water conveyance should be based on a reasonable irrigation system efficiency the most prevalent methods to calculate seepage losses from channels mainly include field experiments empirical formulas and numerical methods field experiments include the inflow outflow measurement method ponding tests the point measurement method and the double ring infiltration test the first three methods are the most widespread at present the inflow outflow method is applied to calculate channel seepage losses by measuring the discharge between the upstream and downstream cross sections of the channel the advantage of this method is that seepage losses can be measured under normal operating conditions of the channel however for small amounts of seepage loss this method produces lower precision and satisfactory test results are hard to achieve zhang et al 2017 compared to the inflow outflow method measurements results using a ponding test are more accurate the seepage rate can be used to calculate channel seepage losses during the irrigation season or throughout the year the significant impediment in using the ponding method is the requirement for a heavy workload with a large number of workers resulting in higher overall costs consequently it is rarely applied to large irrigation channels or channels with various branches and sharp slopes many research teams have estimated seepage losses from unlined irrigation the already mentioned ponding method was used in studies by zhang et al 2017 and iqbal et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 noted that when the kostiakov formula is employed to calculate canal seepage losses the parameter values may differ significantly from the actual conditions thus a large difference exists between the calculation results and those of the field experiment the study of iqbal et al 2002 relates to canals in 13 irrigation districts in southern alberta canada the ponding method was applied to determine seepage losses at 29 sites poly lined earth plugs at both ends of 150 m long straight canal segments were utilized in the experiments the researchers filled water to their operational depth and the time required to drop water from a full supply level to 80 of the designed depth was recorded the annual seepage within the irrigation districts in 1999 was about 91 106 m3 of water eshetu and alamirew 2018 investigated seepage loss through lined and unlined irrigation canals of tendaho a sugar estate in ethiopia seepage losses were determined by the inflow outflow method for primary secondary and tertiary canals water velocity was determined using a current meter the average seepage losses were 0 55 per 100 m 0 0126 lit s m2 for lined primary canals and 0 84 per 100 m 0 0180 lit s m2 for unlined primary canals seepage losses for secondary and tertiary canals were 3 65 per 100 m 0 0391 lit s m2 and 4 27 per 100 m 0 0248 lit s m2 respectively noori mohammadiyeh et al 2010 studied the experimental methods for determining water losses in the earthen channels they compared observation field data with empirical formulas such as ingham davis wilson moleswerth and yennidumia and misra and moritz kraatz 1977 the results revealed that the misra and moritz s method was most capable of estimating seepage rates in the qazvin plain of iran applying numerical methods swamee and kashyap 2001 determined seepage from channels while the groundwater level was infinite in depth their research resulted in generalized diagrams which were later elaborated on by kacimov 2003 salemi and sepaskhah 2006 used empirical equations on the borkhar plain in isfahan province iran to estimate the water seepage from the earthen channels in a irrigation network they noticed that the most appropriate equations to estimate water seepage from the channels of this irrigation network are first the davis wilson s equation and next moleswerth and yennidumia s formula bahramlu 2011 studied seepage losses from irrigated channels with rock cement and concrete lining in cold regions and their impact on water resource reserves in hamedan province iran the results showed no significant difference between the average losses of seepage from the concrete channels and the rock cement cover an analytical method to evaluate the seepage from trapezoidal channels was developed by chahar 2007 based on his study the method was shown to be effective in determining the seepage rate for that shape and it is possible to use the method to calculate the rate of artificial recharge of groundwater kinzli et al 2010 applied adcp acoustic doppler current profilers devices to estimate the seepage rate from irrigation channels based on the geometric characteristics of the channels and the fluid velocity they were able to estimate the rate of the seepage pognant et al 2013 applied electromagnetic induction methods to measure seepage from irrigation channels and the results indicated that this method is suitable for estimating the seepage rate in field surveys swamee et al 2000 applied the relationships developed by harr 1962 and morel seytoux 1964 and developed an explicit relationship to calculate seepage from trapezoidal channels the proposed explicit equation for estimation of the seepage is valid only for trapezoidal channels with side slopes z that ranged from 0 5 z 5 and ratio of channel bed width to water depth ranging from 0 5 b y 10 they used a nonlinear optimization of the channel cross section to minimize seepage losses they also analyzed the economic design of the channel and examined the cost of penetration and evaporation losses their approach was also used to optimize the channel design wachyan and rushton 1987 investigated the effect of hydraulic conductivity on channel seepage in their study soil with lower hydraulic conductivity was laid under soil with a higher hydraulic conductivity they concluded that if the bed of the channel is lined and the walls are unlined the seepage is reduced by 4 compared to an unlined channel if the walls are lined and the bed is unlined the seepage is reduced by 2 compared to the unlined state not only is water seepage an important issue for irrigation canal conveyance but it is also an important factor in the design of hydraulic structures seepage from channels is related to some factors which were investigated by akkuzu 2012 a high seepage rate may cause piping or may undermine hydraulic structures these problems can be controlled by using filters downstream of the structure ahmed et al 2014 or cutoff walls can be employed under the structure jain and reddi 2011 over the past few years various researchers have provided empirical relationships for calculating the seepage of water from the channels now four of the most well known will be discussed davis and wilson suggested the following empirical equation for calculating seepage discharge from channels kraatz and mahajan 1975 1 q 0 45 c p w l 4 10 6 3650 v h w 1 3 the value of the coefficient c varies from 1 to 70 depending on the channel cover and is equal to 1 0 for concrete channels the parameter pw m is the wetted perimeter l is length of the channel m v is the average velocity in the channel m s hw shows depth of water in the channel m and q is seepage from the channel along the channel length m3 s moritz proposed eq 2 to estimate the seepage losses kraatz and mahajan 1975 2 q 0 0186 c q v 0 5 where c is a constant and for clay and clay loam soil it is 0 41 for sandy loam it is 0 66 the parameter q is the channel seepage rate over one kilometer m3 s v is the velocity of the water in the channel m s and q is the amount of discharge m3 s in the channel it should be noted that the length of the channel does not appear in eq 2 because seepage is presented for estimation over a one kilometer distance eq 3 was developed by moleswerth and yennidumia and it is used by the egyptian irrigation authority to estimate seepage from channels kraatz and mahajan 1975 3 q 86 4 c r here q is the water seepage flux m3 m2 day r is the hydraulic radius m and c is a coefficient which is 0 0015 for clay soils and 0 003 for sandy soils finally eq 4 is from ingham kraatz and mahajan 1975 4 q 0 55 c p l 10 6 h 0 5 where q is the seepage m3 s p is the wetted perimeter m l is the channel length m h is the depth of the water in the channel m and c is a coefficient that depends on the type of the soil the value of the c varies between 1 5 and 5 5 the use of the aforementioned empirical relationships are inadequate due to the wide range of coefficients found in the equations most often the coefficients in these equations are defined for specific local conditions and they have to be re determined for other conditions using soil hydraulic conductivity as a variable would make a constant coefficient c unnecessary for empirical relationships and this approach will be taken here the present study considers soil hydraulic conductivity as well as channel geometry and hydraulic properties in the analysis verification of the numerical model is obtained from the available data from the zayandeh rud irrigation channels isfahan province iran three shapes trapezoidal rectangular and triangular sections are investigated and in total 246 numerical models are constructed most of the channels including natural or manmade can be approximated with one of these three shapes regression relations will be presented to make the numerical model findings more applicable for seepage prediction the accuracy of the regression relations will be compared to available data from zayandeh rud irrigation channels in iran this investigation is aimed at enhancing knowledge and improving the water management of the

the gavkhuni swamp the main river of the central iranian plateau along with its tributaries serves an area of 107 000 ha the river s length is about 270 km and its width varies from 10 to 800 m modern surface irrigation started with the construction of major diversion weirs at nekouabad and abshar each diversion weir controls both a left bank and right bank main canal fig 2 the main canals have been designed for automatic upstream control so that canal water levels are maintained at a constant level irrespective of the actual demand typically there is a two season cropping pattern for all irrigation systems in the zayandeh rud basin summer crops include potatoes rice onions and vegetables while winter crops are dominated by wheat barley and vegetables in addition there are some annual and perennial crops including alfalfa orchards and sugarcane table 3 2 3 the mathematical model discharge in the soil follows the darcy s law which is expressed as 7 q k a h x here q is discharge seepage m3 s k is permeability m s a is the cross section of the water flow m² and h x indicates the hydraulic gradient m m of the flow the equation governing the flow of water in a porous medium is the poisson equation which is the generalized form of the laplace equation 8 k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 q here kx and ky are the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in the horizontal and vertical directions m s respectively the term h is the water potentiality in the soil m and q indicates the flow rate at the inlet or the outlet to the soil mass m3 s per unit soil volume eq 8 is applicable for the steady state flow for unsteady flow the equation is 9 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t in which θ t is the volumetric change in water content in time solving poisson s equation is extremely challenging and typically requires computational methods the seep w software solves poisson s equation by employing the finite element method in the simulated earthen channel the total number of elements ranges from 19 450 to 51 674 in general the average size of the elements are 0 2 m images of the computational mesh are provided in fig 3 2 4 the boundary conditions following the creation of the computational mesh and the characterization of the permeable substrate the boundary conditions can be defined in the model in general the boundary conditions can be divided into two categories boundaries with the specified flow potential boundaries with specified input output discharge or with a specified hydraulic gradient boundary conditions in a channel are shown in figs 4 and 5 the bottom of the channel and the channel walls have boundary conditions of specified potential head 13 m the boundary conditions of the model walls left and right sides and the bottom of the model assuming they are not penetrating are assigned a flux of zero that is q x 0 for both left and right sides and q y 0 at the bottom of the canal 2 5 evaluation criteria the coefficient of determination

discussion 3 1 numerical simulation performance verification the velocity vectors represent the amount and the direction of water flow and the flow lines represent the direction of the movement of the water within the porous medium figs 6 and 7 show flow lines and velocity vectors for a trapezoidal channel respectively similarly figs 8 and 9 represent the potential lines and flow lines and the seepage for the rectangular and triangular earthen channels the blue dotted line in figs 6 9 represents the plane used for determination of water seepage to verify the accuracy of the seep w software data from some of the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels were used table 4 the side slope of the studied channels were similar the channel section shapes of the zayandeh rud irrigation network are nearly trapezoidal with side slopes of z 1 5 field measurements were carried out for these seven earthen channels table 4 but the numerical simulation will cover a broader range of channels side slopes including z 0 1 1 5 2 2 5 as described previously in table 1 the input output flow measurement method was applied to calculate the seepage from the channel velocities were measured at upstream and downstream locations using a velocity current meter from these measurements the discharge rates were calculated the average hydraulic characteristics of the selected channels from 22 may to 21 june are given in the table 2 the hydraulic conductivity listed in the table 3 has been obtained related to the soil constitution of the studied earthen channels furthermore the fixed coefficient c used in the empirical equations is given in the table 5 only earthen channels were investigated in this study and the hydraulic conductivity of the channel lining and the soil are equal and assumed to be 2 10 5 m s which is approximately equal to the average of the hydraulic conductivity listed in the table 4 equal to 0 72 cm h in table 6 the statistical parameters obtained from different methods for estimating seepage from the zayandeh rud irrigation network are presented it is obvious that the experimental methods of davis wilson moleswerth yennidumia moritz and ingham did not provide a satisfactory seepage estimation while the moritz s method demonstrated a better performance the comparison between the seep w model and the seepage measurement data in the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels indicates the accuracy of the seep w numerical model the last row of the table 6 it should be mentioned that in order to obtain the numbers in the second and third columns of the table 6 the characteristics of soil texture of the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels were used 3 2 derivation of regression equations the relations between three dimensionless parameters q ky vs y p and z are shown in fig 10 the figure represents dimensionless seepage rate q ky for three earthen channel sections of trapezoidal rectangular and triangular shapes for each z a separate nonlinear trend of q ky is observed for y p 0 15 the relative seepage rate q ky is found to be independent of z this shows that for narrow channels with high y or low p the channel side slope z does not have a significant effect on seepage but for y p 0 15 five different curves can be observed for z 0 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 respectively next nonlinear regression equations were produced using spss software these equations with and their statistical metrics are provided in table 7 table 7 shows that the best non regression equation for estimating relative seepage in channels is eq 14 with r2 0 928 and reaverage 2 42 comparison charts are provided for the best fitting model in the fig 11 a c fig 12 provides contour of q ky with variation in y p and z the values of y p are multiplied by 10 so that the scales of the two axes are similar to simplify viewing fig 12 shows that the effect of z is considerable only for low y p values low y p values imply a wide channel while larger values of y p values signify a narrower channel for narrow channels the effect of z values is very small large values for q ky occur for low y p and high z this implies that wide channels with a mild side slope will have more discharge seepage than narrow channels with sharp side slopes 4 concluding remarks this study investigates the effect of hydraulic and geometric parameters on seepage discharge qs in earthen channels the investigated parameters include water depth in the channel y the channel wetted perimeter p channel side slope z and hydraulic conductivity of the soil k underneath the channel arranging dimensionless parameters yields q ky as a dependent variable and y p and z as two independent variables this study used the finite element method fem to perform the numerical simulations in 2d a total of 246 numerical models were computed for trapezoidal rectangular and triangular sections these are the common shapes for water conveyance channels the following summary of conclusions are provided four nonlinear regression equations were tested for their ability to estimate relative seepage qs ky from the channels the best case achieved an accuracy characterized by r2 0 928 and reaverage 2 42 the comparison of the seepage discharge with the empirical relationships showed that the empirical relationships have too much error in the seepage estimation although the moritz s relation with the smaller rmse 12 356 and the larger determination coefficient 0 373 were better than the rest this proves that every empirical relationship principally depends on its local condition the effect of z is considerable only for low y p values wide channels wide channels with mild side slopes will have more discharge seepage than that of a narrow channel with sharp side slopes other minor parameters are groundwater depth and non isotropy of the soil for the future studies investigation of the effect of groundwater depth under the channel bed and also non isotropy of the soil on the seepage discharge from the channel are recommended kx ky is the case with the recent study and anisotropy will impact the seepage ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with

10651,seepage losses from unlined channels are a major contributor to water loss in the agricultural sector quantification of seepage losses can improve water conveyance efficiency and provide solutions to water scarcity in this study a numerical simulation method is applied to investigate the factors that affect seepage from earthen channels seep w software was used to generate finite element method fem solutions of the seepage flow equations 246 numerical models including different sections of trapezoidal rectangular and triangular earthen channels were studied using fem numerical results are compared to available observation data from zayandeh rud irrigation channels in iran non linear regression equations for the four empirical seepage equations are obtained from the spss statistical software the results show that nonlinear multivariate regression relationships provide a suitable match for estimating seepage discharge the accuracy of the suggested nonlinear regression equation in terms of r2 and re are 0 928 and 2 42 respectively comparison of the seepage discharge with the empirical relationships showed that the empirical relationships have excessive error keywords seepage earthen channel numerical method boundary condition regression 1 introduction in irrigation systems channels are often used to transfer water from reservoirs to agricultural land in addition water might be used to meet industrial and urban needs in most cases the actual amount of water at the end of the channel is significantly less than the amount that entered channels the most important cause of the decrease is water seepage from the channels consequently diagnosing and quantifying seepage from channels is critically important for the protection of water resources management of surface water and groundwater determining the severity of seepage related loss and for the assessment of the potential technical and fiscal benefits of seepage reduction techniques and technologies martin and gates 2014 for downstream agricultural uses water conveyance should be based on a reasonable irrigation system efficiency the most prevalent methods to calculate seepage losses from channels mainly include field experiments empirical formulas and numerical methods field experiments include the inflow outflow measurement method ponding tests the point measurement method and the double ring infiltration test the first three methods are the most widespread at present the inflow outflow method is applied to calculate channel seepage losses by measuring the discharge between the upstream and downstream cross sections of the channel the advantage of this method is that seepage losses can be measured under normal operating conditions of the channel however for small amounts of seepage loss this method produces lower precision and satisfactory test results are hard to achieve zhang et al 2017 compared to the inflow outflow method measurements results using a ponding test are more accurate the seepage rate can be used to calculate channel seepage losses during the irrigation season or throughout the year the significant impediment in using the ponding method is the requirement for a heavy workload with a large number of workers resulting in higher overall costs consequently it is rarely applied to large irrigation channels or channels with various branches and sharp slopes many research teams have estimated seepage losses from unlined irrigation the already mentioned ponding method was used in studies by zhang et al 2017 and iqbal et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 noted that when the kostiakov formula is employed to calculate canal seepage losses the parameter values may differ significantly from the actual conditions thus a large difference exists between the calculation results and those of the field experiment the study of iqbal et al 2002 relates to canals in 13 irrigation districts in southern alberta canada the ponding method was applied to determine seepage losses at 29 sites poly lined earth plugs at both ends of 150 m long straight canal segments were utilized in the experiments the researchers filled water to their operational depth and the time required to drop water from a full supply level to 80 of the designed depth was recorded the annual seepage within the irrigation districts in 1999 was about 91 106 m3 of water eshetu and alamirew 2018 investigated seepage loss through lined and unlined irrigation canals of tendaho a sugar estate in ethiopia seepage losses were determined by the inflow outflow method for primary secondary and tertiary canals water velocity was determined using a current meter the average seepage losses were 0 55 per 100 m 0 0126 lit s m2 for lined primary canals and 0 84 per 100 m 0 0180 lit s m2 for unlined primary canals seepage losses for secondary and tertiary canals were 3 65 per 100 m 0 0391 lit s m2 and 4 27 per 100 m 0 0248 lit s m2 respectively noori mohammadiyeh et al 2010 studied the experimental methods for determining water losses in the earthen channels they compared observation field data with empirical formulas such as ingham davis wilson moleswerth and yennidumia and misra and moritz kraatz 1977 the results revealed that the misra and moritz s method was most capable of estimating seepage rates in the qazvin plain of iran applying numerical methods swamee and kashyap 2001 determined seepage from channels while the groundwater level was infinite in depth their research resulted in generalized diagrams which were later elaborated on by kacimov 2003 salemi and sepaskhah 2006 used empirical equations on the borkhar plain in isfahan province iran to estimate the water seepage from the earthen channels in a irrigation network they noticed that the most appropriate equations to estimate water seepage from the channels of this irrigation network are first the davis wilson s equation and next moleswerth and yennidumia s formula bahramlu 2011 studied seepage losses from irrigated channels with rock cement and concrete lining in cold regions and their impact on water resource reserves in hamedan province iran the results showed no significant difference between the average losses of seepage from the concrete channels and the rock cement cover an analytical method to evaluate the seepage from trapezoidal channels was developed by chahar 2007 based on his study the method was shown to be effective in determining the seepage rate for that shape and it is possible to use the method to calculate the rate of artificial recharge of groundwater kinzli et al 2010 applied adcp acoustic doppler current profilers devices to estimate the seepage rate from irrigation channels based on the geometric characteristics of the channels and the fluid velocity they were able to estimate the rate of the seepage pognant et al 2013 applied electromagnetic induction methods to measure seepage from irrigation channels and the results indicated that this method is suitable for estimating the seepage rate in field surveys swamee et al 2000 applied the relationships developed by harr 1962 and morel seytoux 1964 and developed an explicit relationship to calculate seepage from trapezoidal channels the proposed explicit equation for estimation of the seepage is valid only for trapezoidal channels with side slopes z that ranged from 0 5 z 5 and ratio of channel bed width to water depth ranging from 0 5 b y 10 they used a nonlinear optimization of the channel cross section to minimize seepage losses they also analyzed the economic design of the channel and examined the cost of penetration and evaporation losses their approach was also used to optimize the channel design wachyan and rushton 1987 investigated the effect of hydraulic conductivity on channel seepage in their study soil with lower hydraulic conductivity was laid under soil with a higher hydraulic conductivity they concluded that if the bed of the channel is lined and the walls are unlined the seepage is reduced by 4 compared to an unlined channel if the walls are lined and the bed is unlined the seepage is reduced by 2 compared to the unlined state not only is water seepage an important issue for irrigation canal conveyance but it is also an important factor in the design of hydraulic structures seepage from channels is related to some factors which were investigated by akkuzu 2012 a high seepage rate may cause piping or may undermine hydraulic structures these problems can be controlled by using filters downstream of the structure ahmed et al 2014 or cutoff walls can be employed under the structure jain and reddi 2011 over the past few years various researchers have provided empirical relationships for calculating the seepage of water from the channels now four of the most well known will be discussed davis and wilson suggested the following empirical equation for calculating seepage discharge from channels kraatz and mahajan 1975 1 q 0 45 c p w l 4 10 6 3650 v h w 1 3 the value of the coefficient c varies from 1 to 70 depending on the channel cover and is equal to 1 0 for concrete channels the parameter pw m is the wetted perimeter l is length of the channel m v is the average velocity in the channel m s hw shows depth of water in the channel m and q is seepage from the channel along the channel length m3 s moritz proposed eq 2 to estimate the seepage losses kraatz and mahajan 1975 2 q 0 0186 c q v 0 5 where c is a constant and for clay and clay loam soil it is 0 41 for sandy loam it is 0 66 the parameter q is the channel seepage rate over one kilometer m3 s v is the velocity of the water in the channel m s and q is the amount of discharge m3 s in the channel it should be noted that the length of the channel does not appear in eq 2 because seepage is presented for estimation over a one kilometer distance eq 3 was developed by moleswerth and yennidumia and it is used by the egyptian irrigation authority to estimate seepage from channels kraatz and mahajan 1975 3 q 86 4 c r here q is the water seepage flux m3 m2 day r is the hydraulic radius m and c is a coefficient which is 0 0015 for clay soils and 0 003 for sandy soils finally eq 4 is from ingham kraatz and mahajan 1975 4 q 0 55 c p l 10 6 h 0 5 where q is the seepage m3 s p is the wetted perimeter m l is the channel length m h is the depth of the water in the channel m and c is a coefficient that depends on the type of the soil the value of the c varies between 1 5 and 5 5 the use of the aforementioned empirical relationships are inadequate due to the wide range of coefficients found in the equations most often the coefficients in these equations are defined for specific local conditions and they have to be re determined for other conditions using soil hydraulic conductivity as a variable would make a constant coefficient c unnecessary for empirical relationships and this approach will be taken here the present study considers soil hydraulic conductivity as well as channel geometry and hydraulic properties in the analysis verification of the numerical model is obtained from the available data from the zayandeh rud irrigation channels isfahan province iran three shapes trapezoidal rectangular and triangular sections are investigated and in total 246 numerical models are constructed most of the channels including natural or manmade can be approximated with one of these three shapes regression relations will be presented to make the numerical model findings more applicable for seepage prediction the accuracy of the regression relations will be compared to available data from zayandeh rud irrigation channels in iran this investigation is aimed at enhancing knowledge and improving the water management of the earthen channels 2 material and methods 2 1 effective parameters various factors influence seepage from the earthen channels these factors include channel geometry and hydraulic conditions as seen in eq 5 the seepage discharge per channel unit length qs is a function of the width of the channel bed b the channel side slope z the depth of water in the channel y the channel wetted perimeter p and the soil hydraulic conductivity k of the soil below the channel 5 q s f y p b z k for a rectangular cross section z 0 and for a triangular cross section b 0 fig 1 the channel wetted perimeter p is defined as b 2 y 1 z 2 thus the dimensionless function of the related variables can be written as eq 6 6 q s k y f y p z combination of the effective parameters b z y k results in 246 models these models were numerically simulated and seepage rates qs were obtained for each channel table 1 lists values of the investigated geometric and hydraulic parameters while table 2 shows the statistical parameters of dimensions for earthen channels y p and z are independent variables and q ky is a dependent variable 2 2 field measurement data field measurement data from seven water channels of the zayandeh rud irrigation channels located in isfahan province iran the zayandeh rud channel is the lifeline of esfahan it originates in the zagros mountains and flows southeast where it dissipates in the gavkhuni swamp the main river of the central iranian plateau along with its tributaries serves an area of 107 000 ha the river s length is about 270 km and its width varies from 10 to 800 m modern surface irrigation started with the construction of major diversion weirs at nekouabad and abshar each diversion weir controls both a left bank and right bank main canal fig 2 the main canals have been designed for automatic upstream control so that canal water levels are maintained at a constant level irrespective of the actual demand typically there is a two season cropping pattern for all irrigation systems in the zayandeh rud basin summer crops include potatoes rice onions and vegetables while winter crops are dominated by wheat barley and vegetables in addition there are some annual and perennial crops including alfalfa orchards and sugarcane table 3 2 3 the mathematical model discharge in the soil follows the darcy s law which is expressed as 7 q k a h x here q is discharge seepage m3 s k is permeability m s a is the cross section of the water flow m² and h x indicates the hydraulic gradient m m of the flow the equation governing the flow of water in a porous medium is the poisson equation which is the generalized form of the laplace equation 8 k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 q here kx and ky are the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in the horizontal and vertical directions m s respectively the term h is the water potentiality in the soil m and q indicates the flow rate at the inlet or the outlet to the soil mass m3 s per unit soil volume eq 8 is applicable for the steady state flow for unsteady flow the equation is 9 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t in which θ t is the volumetric change in water content in time solving poisson s equation is extremely challenging and typically requires computational methods the seep w software solves poisson s equation by employing the finite element method in the simulated earthen channel the total number of elements ranges from 19 450 to 51 674 in general the average size of the elements are 0 2 m images of the computational mesh are provided in fig 3 2 4 the boundary conditions following the creation of the computational mesh and the characterization of the permeable substrate the boundary conditions can be defined in the model in general the boundary conditions can be divided into two categories boundaries with the specified flow potential boundaries with specified input output discharge or with a specified hydraulic gradient boundary conditions in a channel are shown in figs 4 and 5 the bottom of the channel and the channel walls have boundary conditions of specified potential head 13 m the boundary conditions of the model walls left and right sides and the bottom of the model assuming they are not penetrating are assigned a flux of zero that is q x 0 for both left and right sides and q y 0 at the bottom of the canal 2 5 evaluation criteria the coefficient of determination

discussion 3 1 numerical simulation performance verification the velocity vectors represent the amount and the direction of water flow and the flow lines represent the direction of the movement of the water within the porous medium figs 6 and 7 show flow lines and velocity vectors for a trapezoidal channel respectively similarly figs 8 and 9 represent the potential lines and flow lines and the seepage for the rectangular and triangular earthen channels the blue dotted line in figs 6 9 represents the plane used for determination of water seepage to verify the accuracy of the seep w software data from some of the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels were used table 4 the side slope of the studied channels were similar the channel section shapes of the zayandeh rud irrigation network are nearly trapezoidal with side slopes of z 1 5 field measurements were carried out for these seven earthen channels table 4 but the numerical simulation will cover a broader range of channels side slopes including z 0 1 1 5 2 2 5 as described previously in table 1 the input output flow measurement method was applied to calculate the seepage from the channel velocities were measured at upstream and downstream locations using a velocity current meter from these measurements the discharge rates were calculated the average hydraulic characteristics of the selected channels from 22 may to 21 june are given in the table 2 the hydraulic conductivity listed in the table 3 has been obtained related to the soil constitution of the studied earthen channels furthermore the fixed coefficient c used in the empirical equations is given in the table 5 only earthen channels were investigated in this study and the hydraulic conductivity of the channel lining and the soil are equal and assumed to be 2 10 5 m s which is approximately equal to the average of the hydraulic conductivity listed in the table 4 equal to 0 72 cm h in table 6 the statistical parameters obtained from different methods for estimating seepage from the zayandeh rud irrigation network are presented it is obvious that the experimental methods of davis wilson moleswerth yennidumia moritz and ingham did not provide a satisfactory seepage estimation while the moritz s method demonstrated a better performance the comparison between the seep w model and the seepage measurement data in the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels indicates the accuracy of the seep w numerical model the last row of the table 6 it should be mentioned that in order to obtain the numbers in the second and third columns of the table 6 the characteristics of soil texture of the zayandeh rud irrigation network channels were used 3 2 derivation of regression equations the relations between three dimensionless parameters q ky vs y p and z are shown in fig 10 the figure represents dimensionless seepage rate q ky for three earthen channel sections of trapezoidal rectangular and triangular shapes for each z a separate nonlinear trend of q ky is observed for y p 0 15 the relative seepage rate q ky is found to be independent of z this shows that for narrow channels with high y or low p the channel side slope z does not have a significant effect on seepage but for y p 0 15 five different curves can be observed for z 0 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 respectively next nonlinear regression equations were produced using spss software these equations with and their statistical metrics are provided in table 7 table 7 shows that the best non regression equation for estimating relative seepage in channels is eq 14 with r2 0 928 and reaverage 2 42 comparison charts are provided for the best fitting model in the fig 11 a c fig 12 provides contour of q ky with variation in y p and z the values of y p are multiplied by 10 so that the scales of the two axes are similar to simplify viewing fig 12 shows that the effect of z is considerable only for low y p values low y p values imply a wide channel while larger values of y p values signify a narrower channel for narrow channels the effect of z values is very small large values for q ky occur for low y p and high z this implies that wide channels with a mild side slope will have more discharge seepage than narrow channels with sharp side slopes 4 concluding remarks this study investigates the effect of hydraulic and geometric parameters on seepage discharge qs in earthen channels the investigated parameters include water depth in the channel y the channel wetted perimeter p channel side slope z and hydraulic conductivity of the soil k underneath the channel arranging dimensionless parameters yields q ky as a dependent variable and y p and z as two independent variables this study used the finite element method fem to perform the numerical simulations in 2d a total of 246 numerical models were computed for trapezoidal rectangular and triangular sections these are the common shapes for water conveyance channels the following summary of conclusions are provided four nonlinear regression equations were tested for their ability to estimate relative seepage qs ky from the channels the best case achieved an accuracy characterized by r2 0 928 and reaverage 2 42 the comparison of the seepage discharge with the empirical relationships showed that the empirical relationships have too much error in the seepage estimation although the moritz s relation with the smaller rmse 12 356 and the larger determination coefficient 0 373 were better than the rest this proves that every empirical relationship principally depends on its local condition the effect of z is considerable only for low y p values wide channels wide channels with mild side slopes will have more discharge seepage than that of a narrow channel with sharp side slopes other minor parameters are groundwater depth and non isotropy of the soil for the future studies investigation of the effect of groundwater depth under the channel bed and also non isotropy of the soil on the seepage discharge from the channel are recommended kx ky is the case with the recent study and anisotropy will impact the seepage ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with

10652,a proper prediction of the water table wt depth in hydrological models highly depends on the accuracy of evapotranspiration et estimation in this study the response of wt fluctuations to changes in et was investigated involving the drainmod water management model the wt depth data were measured during three canola growing seasons 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 in a paddy field with two subsurface drainage systems drain depth of 65 cm with two spacing of 15 m and 30 m in the north of iran for the growing seasons et was estimated through 17 equations including five temperature based four radiation based three pan evaporation based four combination based and one mass transfer based equations the estimated et values was then applied in the calibrated drainmod model to simulate the corresponding wt depths in the drainage systems the reliability of various et estimation methods and the model predictions were evaluated using determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse

comparison with the thornthwaite method which is a default method for et calculation in the model based on the results the rohwer and fao 24 pan equations are recommended as suitable methods for estimating et in the drainmod model for the study area keywords paddy fields subsurface drainage mazandaran thornthwaite equation 1 introduction agriculture continues to play a significant role in production and employment despite the growth of industry and change in land use cervantes godoy and dewbre 2010 rice fields covering one third of the world s agricultural lands play an important role in the production of foods davoodi et al 2019 most rice fields in humid regions are under cultivation only in a certain period of the year and in other times lack suitable conditions for cultivation because of the waterlogging and ponding problems due to several reasons such as increased population reduced profitable lands and the need to improve food security improving the productivity of these lands and providing suitable conditions for annual cropping is highly important from water management viewpoints installing subsurface drainage systems can be considered to meet such conditions darzi naftchali et al 2013 designing drainage systems should be done by taking into account soil characteristics topography climate crops grown and trafficability conditions as well as the interaction of each of these factors taking all of these into account requires testing different scenarios through field pilots which requires a lot of time and cost singh et al 2006 if an appropriate calibration and validation is made computer simulation models while reducing costs and shortening the time to achieve the results can reasonably quantify the effects of various factors wang et al 2006 different simulation models are used to describe the performance of water management systems including subsurface and surface drainage and irrigation practices the drainmod model is one of the most practical models which is able to simulate different soil water balance components skaggs 1980 the balance in this model is classified into two parts of surface water balance and subsurface water balance which include deep percolation rainfall surface runoff and evapotranspiration et among different water balance components et is a key part of the hydrological cycle in terrestrial ecosystems which have a direct influence on crop yield therefore an appropriate estimation of et is essential for the development of eco hydrology models tian et al 2015 in the drainmod model et can be considered in two ways using the thornthwaite method and introducing evapotranspiration values directly luo et al 2009 introduced et as an input parameter affecting the drainage discharge simulation in the drainmod model and demonstrated the importance of the precise estimation of et in the application of this model niaghi et al 2017 investigated the impact of reference et on the accuracy of water table depth simulation in the drainmod model in north dakota continental climate the study revealed that by increasing the precision of evapotranspiration a significant improvement was observed in the water table depth simulation indicating that the performance of the model was highly sensitive to et recently davoodi et al 2019 evaluated the ability of drainmod s to predict drainage dater salinity and groundwater table depth in a subsurface drained paddy field in the north of iran the study revealed that the model did not capture well the wt fluctuations especially during frequent rainfall periods with shallow wt depths this failure may be due to the inadequacy of thornthwaite method to provide suitable estimations of et in the region with humid climate some previous studies have reported that

valipour 2017 had a good performance for estimating et in humid areas based on the literature review there is a lack of a comprehensive study quantifying the performance of such methods in the drainmod model as subsurface drainage development is in its infancy in the northern provinces of iran using rapid and low cost methods to evaluate drainage design parameters is a challenge in drainage studies with this regard the drainmod model could help to assess different combinations of drain depth and spacing to find the best one darzi naftchally et al 2014 due to the high dependency of drainmod predicted wt depths to the et values in this research firstly the accuracy of 17 et estimation methods was evaluated compared with the fao penman monteith then by introducing et values calculated using different et methods into the drainmod model the accuracy of the simulated wt depths was assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field data needed for this study were obtained from a 4 5 ha subsurface drainage pilot of paddy fields in north of iran located at the sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university sanru 36 39 n and 53 04 e fig 1 based on a 17 year meteorological data of the area the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation in the region are 653 6 and 1186 1 mm respectively minimum mean and maximum temperature recorded in this area are 6 17 7 and 42 5 c on average 114 days of year are rainy mainly during autumn and winter season with low evaporation resulting waterlogging and ponding problems table 1 presents some of the climatic parameters of the area agricultural production in the region is mainly relies on tajan irrigation and drainage network covering about 53 thousand ha cropping area with the representative climatic condition of the coastal areas of northern iran however due to inadequacy of surface drainage canals and consequent waterlogging and ponding problems during autumn and winter seasons the area is generally only under rice cultivation during spring and summer seasons the sanru drainage pilot consisted of 4 subsurface drainage systems with two drain depths 0 65 and 0 90 m and two drain spacing 15 and 30 m was implemented in july 2011 to provide annual cropping condition after the introduction of the drainage systems the rice canola rotation was adopted as a suitable cropping system in the pilot area detailed description about the study field the drainage systems and the drainage design parameters could be found in darzi naftchali et al 2016 and jafari talukolaee et al 2018 2 2 field data and management before design and implementation of the drainage systems various soil data including textural class saturated hydraulic conductivity and characteristic curve were determined as described in davoodi et al 2019 the data of two subsurface drainage systems with drain depth d of 0 65 m and drain spacing l of 15 and 30 m d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 were used in this study in this area the soil texture is silty clay to a depth of 150 cm and clay in 150 300 cm depth during three canola growing seasons 28 november 2011 8 may 2012 3 october 2015 4 may 2016 2 october 2016 20 may 2017 the water table depth was measured daily in 1 m deep observation wells located at the midway between the two adjacent drains of the drainage systems fig 1 besides the first growing season when no tillage practice was adopted due to frequent rainfall conventional practices were done in the two other growing seasons by an experienced local grower 6 8 and 8 kg ha 1 of canola seeds were cropped in 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing seasons respectively under rainfed condition 2 3 estimating reference evapotranspiration in this study 17 et calculation models were selected including 5

evaporation based methods snyder cuenca fao 24 pan fpan equations 4 combination based methods fao penman monteith 56 fpm penman 63 p63 fao ppp 17 fao 17 and penman kimberley pk equations and one mass transfer method rohwer equation these equations are summarized in table 2 notably that the fpm equation was considered as a basis for comparison moreover the tw method which is based on monthly average temperature trajkovic et al 2019 is the default model considered in the drainmod model to calculate et 2 4 drainmod input data the drainmod simulation model a water management model for shallow water table soils was developed for comprehensive drainage management analysis in agricultural fields skaggs et al 2012 this model is capable of simulating water table depth and water balance as well as the movement or transfer of salinity and nitrogen in the soil wahba et al 2002 weather soil drainage design and crop information are needed as drinmod input data a 17 year period 2001 2017 weather data of the region were used including minimum and maximum air temperatures and daily rainfall for the same period the calculated et values by different methods unless the tw method were also used as input data the model can calculate et by the tw method based on latitude mean monthly temperature and heat index i this index was calculated for the period and its monthly average 83 4 was applied in the model soil data required in the drainmod model include soil water characteristic and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity of each soil layer the green ampt infiltration equation parameters and the volume drained wt relationship and upward flux wt relationship are additional soil required data which were determined through utility option of the model these data were adapted from the study of davoodi et al 2019 the drainage design parameters used in the model include drain depth 65 cm drain spacing 1500 and 3000 cm effective radius of drains 5 8 cm the actual distance from surface to impermeable layer 2 m drainage coefficient 0 3 cm d 1 initial depth to groundwater table 30 cm maximum surface storage 0 7 cm and kirkham s depth for flow to drains 0 5 cm 2 5 calibration and validation of the drainmod model the model was calibrated using the data of the d0 65l30 system by changing the values of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity kirkham s depth for flow to drains s1 maximum surface storage sm and pet factors as a result the saturated hydraulic conductivity of different soil layers was selected as 2 25 1 75 2 1 and 0 5 cm h 1 respectively for 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 200 cm soil layers also due to the condition of surface drainage in the study field and based on the values presented in the drainmod reference model report skaggs 1980 different values were used for maximum surface storage and micro storage in the calibration process finally the values of 0 7 and 0 5 cm were selected as the most suitable values for the two parameters respectively then the capability of the calibrated model was evaluated to simulate water table depth in the d0 65l15 system 2 6 evaluation criteria to evaluate the efficiency of the drainmod model and the accuracy of various et methods different criteria including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse error percentage pe wang et al 2006 and mean absolute deviation mad legates and mccabe 1999 were used these statistics are defined as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 pe i 1 n p i i 1 n o i i 1 n o i 100 4 mad i 1 n o i p i n in these equations oi and pi are respectively the observed and predicted values at time t n is the number of observations o is the average of observed values and p is the average of predicted values 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of et estimation methods the evaluation criteria obtained from the comparison of the daily et of the different methods with the method of fpm are presented in table 3 the best methods for et estimation were frad bc and fpan respectively the turc fao 17 and p63 methods had the most errors the most accurate temperature based method was bc r2 0 93 rmse 0 38 mm d 1 mad 0 76 mm d 1 and pe 6 24 and the weakest simulation in this group belonged to the turc method with the highest error tabari et al 2013 also reported that the bc method resulted the best performance among temperature based methods in a humid region comparing the accuracy of bc fpm penman har makkink and turc with lysimeter measurements by babaee et al 2019 showed that the bc method had the highest accuracy even more than the fpm method for estimating rice et in sari mazandaran iran confirming the results of the present study the reliability of the bc method was also demonstrated by zarei and mahmoudi 2017 in a study in iran involving climatic data of 17 synoptic stations with different climatic conditions the bc equation slightly overestimated et 0 19 mm d 1 while har ham and turc methods underestimated it 0 6 1 3 and 1 9 mm d 1 respectively compared with the fpm method with the daily average et of 3 36 mm d 1 these results are in line with the results reported in some previous studies zhai et al 2010 song et al 2019 total annual et related to the bc har ham and turc methods were respectively 1303 991 2 736 and 403 8 mm compared with 1226 3 mm for fpm indicating the bc method can be used in the study area because of its simplicity and no need for much data compared to the fpm however comparison of the daily variation of et data not shown showed increased errors of the bc method during the major part spring and summer of the common cultivation period in the region the method overestimated 0 55 mm d 1 et in this period while the rest temperature based methods underestimated it the study of liu et al 2017 in a semi arid climate demonstrated increased differences between temperature based methods and the fpm method during the warmer months of the year during autumn and winter seasons these methods yielded more satisfactory results with the best predictions for bc consistent with the results of liu et al 2017 in a semi arid area in china frad with r2 0 90 rmse 0 31 mm d 1 mad 0 71 mm d 1 and pe 0 95 was the most accurate one among radiation based methods in this group of equations unless the pt method all equations underestimated 0 73 mm d 1 the annual et total annual predicted et values through irmak ritchie frad and pt equations were 1090 2 1001 8 1214 6 and 1472 2 mm respectively pan evaporation based methods almost had the same results and underestimated annual et 0 8 mm d 1 with the best performance related to fpan r2 0 86 rmse 0 45 mm d 1 mad 0 80 mm d 1 and pe 16 18 in a study under sub humid climate of india poddar et al 2018 showed that the pan based methods underestimated et to about 0 7 mm d 1 compared with the fpm method the daily average of et values of snyder cuenca and fpan methods were respectively 2 43 2 33 and 2 81 mm compared with 3 36 mm related to fpm generally this group of equations performed same as fpm during april august period and then underestimated the daily et this period coincides with a major part of the growing season in the study area indicating the methods could be applied to determine irrigation requirement with low bias the differences between fpm and these methods were high during autumn and winter months also known as non irrigation periods on the other hand there is no need to compute et in this period for irrigation purposes comparison of combination methods showed that the pk method had the highest accuracy while fao 17 had the most error the better performance of pk was also reported by ahmadipour et al 2019 at the zabol of iran however all combination based methods overestimated 1 15 mm d 1 on average et compared with fpm total annual overestimation of fao 17 p63 and pk were 476 5 423 6 and 366 1 mm respectively these methods had usually similar deviations 1 1 3 mm d 1 related to fpm throughout the year on the other hand the fao 17 p63 and pk methods did not provide suitable estimations of et to apply for irrigation scheduling in the study region the rohwer mass transfer based method with r2 0 94 rmse 0 37 mm d 1 mad 0 76 mm d 1 and pe 21 75 resulted in 302 3 mm underestimation in annual et compared to fpm this result is in line with the study of xu and singh 2002 in switzerland where the rohwer mass transfer method underestimated et in april may and june as well as the yearly value this method provided approximately the same results to fpm for the period of march jun beyond this period rohwer always underestimated the daily et with the worst situation related to winter months 3 2 assessment of the water table depth simulation accuracy figs 2 and 3 show the variations of the actual wt depth and that simulated by the drainmod model in the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 drainage systems for different et estimation methods for all temperature based methods the accuracy of the simulation reduced where sudden change occurred in the actual wt depth on the other hand the model estimated the wt depth as zero in most of the times after rainfall events while such a case was not observed in the field resulting increased errors in simulating the rise and fall pattern of the wt depth the inability of the model to capture the realistic behavior of the wt depth variation after rainfall events was demonstrated by davoodi et al 2019 generally among the temperature based methods the ham and bc methods were the most accurate followed by tw method which is the default equation considered in the model the average errors of ham bc and tw methods during the whole simulation period for both drainage systems was 2 6 8 2 and 11 cm d 1 respectively the ham method did not provide accurate et compared to fpm however as it can be seen the accuracy of the ham method for wt depth prediction was much higher than the tw method mainly due to increased errors in simulating higher wt depths through the tw method in some cases where the actual wt depth was less than 30 cm the corresponding values simulated by the tw method were about zero according to tian et al 2015 the drainmod forest model had the ability to estimate et using tw method with suitable accuracy in north carolina with a semi wet and humid climate where the model was developed one of the reasons for such a difference between the results of the present study and that of tian et al 2015 is that the tw method may provide suitable estimations of et in north carolina while it was not appropriate for the study area among the temperature based methods the turc and har equations resulted in the weakest simulation of the wt depths with a mean error of 13 2 and 15 9 cm d 1 generally the har method overestimated the wt depth and the turc method underestimated it in both drainage systems part of such over or under estimation may originate from the over or under estimation of et by these methods the average of total et calculated through har and turc methods during the 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing seasons were 357 and 125 mm while for the ham equation as the most accurate one in this group it was 212 mm comparing these values with the average of pan evaporation in the period 205 mm indicate that the ham may provide better estimations of et in the region unless the pt method none of the radiation based methods obviated the deficiency of the tw method in simulating the shallow wt depth under frequent rainfall the pt methods resulted in relatively well predictions of the wt depth during high rainfall periods of 2011 12 while overestimated high wt depths in 2015 16 and 2016 17 under less frequent rainfall among radiation based methods ritchie had the least errors followed by frad irmak and pt methods with the mean error of 5 8 6 8 11 8 and 26 5 cm d 1 respectively irmak and frad methods had similar simulations and in most cases the pt method resulted in the highest overestimations compared with the other radiation based methods mainly due to overestimating et which also demonstrated by liu et al 2017 the pt method showed the highest error in december 2015 october 2016 february 2017 and march 2017 when the wt depth increased the ritchie method was most accurate in february 2012 and 2016 when the wt depth was low due to frequent rainfall generally radiation based methods were more accurate in the estimation of et during high rainfall periods resulting in more accurate estimations of the wt depth on the other hand in situation with reduced rainfall frequency and consequently higher wt depths for radiation based methods the differences between measured and simulated wt depths increased liu et al 2017 showed that in general radiation based methods were more accurate for estimating et in the days with less sunny hours which may a reason for better performance of the methods during rainy periods especially during 2011 12 the daily average of sunny hours during 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 canola growing seasons were 3 7 4 6 and 4 9 hours respectively resulting in higher et during 2015 16 and 2016 17 the average of estimated et through 4 radiation based methods during these growing seasons were 276 5 mm 2 3 mm d 1 on average 464 1 mm 2 7 mm d 1 on average and 484 4 mm 2 7 mm d 1 on average respectively as expected the simulation accuracy of the three pan evaporation based methods was suitable and their results were almost consistent the mean error of fpan cuenca and snyder s methods in the whole period was 9 7 11 9 and 12 3 cm d 1 respectively for both drainage systems the simulation accuracy of these methods was lower during less frequent rainfall periods or when the wt depth was high tabari et al 2013 indicated increased accuracy of pan evaporation methods for et estimation under lower humidity in the humid climate of northern iran which finally influence on the wt predictions by the drainmod model the performance of this group of equations was almost better than temperature based ones both under shallow and high water table depths comparison of the wt depth variation in temperature and pan evaporation based methods indicated that applying fpan could substantially increase the reliability of the drainmod predictions in the study area the accuracy of combination based methods for the wt depth prediction was less than that of the other methods same as their abilities to predict et on the other hand overestimation of the et well reflected in the predicted wt by the drainmod model in contrast with the findings of this study by comparing the simulated and measured meteorological data aouissi et al 2016 showed the suitability of the fpm method to estimate et in the swat hydrologic model among these methods the fpm method had the closest simulation to the measured values followed by pk p63 and fao 17 methods respectively the mean error of the mentioned methods in the study period was 11 3 23 4 27 6 and 31 5 cm day 1 respectively the combination based methods were more accurate in the 2011 12 growing season than 2015 16 and 2016 17 on the other hand these methods responded better to more frequent rainfall condition in 2011 12 the inability of combination based methods for prediction wt during 2015 16 and 2016 17 is mainly related to their weakness to provide suitable estimation of et on average total et estimated trough these methods during 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 were 208 557 and 584 mm respectively these values seem to be high compared with total pan evaporation during these growing seasons 154 202 and 258 mm respectively the combination based methods were reported to be sensitive to air temperature tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2014 gong et al 2006 eslamian et al 2011 as can be seen in table 1 this climate variable was significantly higher in 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing periods than that in 2011 12 the rohwer method was generally captured well the wt depth variation unless providing some over or under estimations of shallow or high wt depths respectively this method often simulated the wt depth as zero equal to the ground level in cases where the actual wt depth was less than 20 cm however the observed trend of the wt depth variation was better captured by rohwer than tw the daily and seasonal et predicted through the rohwer equation were comparable with actual pan evaporation data during the 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing periods the daily averages of ets calculated by this method were 1 3 1 3 and 1 3 mm compared with 1 3 1 2 and 1 4 mm respectively obtained from pan evaporation the evaluation criteria as well as average of the simulated wt depth values in the d0 65l30 and d0 65l15 drainage systems are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively comparison of the evaluation statistics indicated that generally the rohwer ham fpan bc turc fpm and irmak methods resulted in the best simulation of the wt depth respectively compared to the tw method these methods increased simulation accuracy the weakest simulations were obtained by the methods of fao 17 p63 pt pk and har generally the maximum determination coefficient was related to rohwer and pan evaporation based methods 0 7 0 8 followed by temperature based methods 0 5 0 7 radiation based methods 0 3 0 7 and combination based methods 0 5 0 6 these values of r2 are less than the value of 0 967 reported by malota and senzanje 2015 and are comparable with the range 0 58 0 63 reported by niaghi et al 2017 the least pe was attributed to rohwer 23 2 to 5 2 followed by pan evaporation based methods 37 3 to 10 radiation based methods 15 5 to 61 2 temperature based methods 40 7 to 46 5 and combination based methods 22 5 to 70 4 the rohwer equation resulted the best mad 10 1 12 7 cm d 1 and rmse 13 5 15 3 cm d 1 followed by pan evaporation based methods mad 12 2 17 7 cm d 1 rmse 15 7 21 cm d 1 the combination and temperature based equations showed the least accuracy in the view point of mad and rmse indices during the study period the average of the measured wt depths in the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 drainage systems was 49 and 44 cm respectively the average of the simulated wt depths in d0 65l30 was in the range of 26 53 8 cm for temperature based methods 43 9 70 7 cm for radiation based methods 29 5 37 5 cm for pan evaporation based methods and 53 7 74 8 cm for combination based methods under the d0 65l15 drainage system the average of the simulated wt depths ranged from 40 6 71 cm 5 4 75 6 cm 39 9 44 1 cm and 62 81 3 cm respectively for these methods when the rohwer equation was used the average of predicted wt depths in d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 found to be 45 6 and 33 7 cm respectively for the hum rohwer bc frad ritchie fpan and tw methods the differences between measured and simulated wt depths were 2 65 6 40 8 25 8 50 8 55 9 70 and 11 cm respectively which are comparable with some reported values such as 15 cm wahba et al 2002 and 7 cm yang 2008 4 conclusions this study was conducted to find a suitable et estimation method for north of iran to use in the drainmod model among 17 et estimation methods including temperature radiation pan evaporation combination and mass transfer based equations the fao 24 radiation blaney criddle irmak and fao 24 pan performed well compared with the reference method fao penman montieth equation analyzing the wt fluctuations involving drainmod revealed that the best methods for et estimation were not performed as well for wt prediction the rohwer and pan evaporation based equations which underestimated et compared to the reference method provided the best predictions of the wt depths and substantially improved the accuracy of the model in relation to the default method for et estimation in the model the results of this study demonstrated the reliability of the drainmod model to evaluate drainage design parameters in northern iran s paddy fields if calculated et data through the rohwer and fao 24 pan methods were introduced in the model instead of using the

10652,a proper prediction of the water table wt depth in hydrological models highly depends on the accuracy of evapotranspiration et estimation in this study the response of wt fluctuations to changes in et was investigated involving the drainmod water management model the wt depth data were measured during three canola growing seasons 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 in a paddy field with two subsurface drainage systems drain depth of 65 cm with two spacing of 15 m and 30 m in the north of iran for the growing seasons et was estimated through 17 equations including five temperature based four radiation based three pan evaporation based four combination based and one mass transfer based equations the estimated et values was then applied in the calibrated drainmod model to simulate the corresponding wt depths in the drainage systems the reliability of various et estimation methods and the model predictions were evaluated using determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse error percentage pe and mean absolute deviation mad compared to the fao penman monteith equation the fao 24 radiation r2 0 90 rmse 0 31 mm d 1 mad 0 71 mm d 1 and pe 0 95 blaney criddle r2 0 93 rmse 0

et however the best prediction of the wt depths were obtained for the rohwer and pan evaporation based equations these methods considerably improved the reliability of the drainmod predictions in comparison with the thornthwaite method which is a default method for et calculation in the model based on the results the rohwer and fao 24 pan equations are recommended as suitable methods for estimating et in the drainmod model for the study area keywords paddy fields subsurface drainage mazandaran thornthwaite equation 1 introduction agriculture continues to play a significant role in production and employment despite the growth of industry and change in land use cervantes godoy and dewbre 2010 rice fields covering one third of the world s agricultural lands play an important role in the production of foods davoodi et al 2019 most rice fields in humid regions are under cultivation only in a certain period of the year and in other times lack suitable conditions for cultivation because of the waterlogging and ponding problems due to several reasons such as increased population reduced profitable lands and the need to improve food security improving the productivity of these lands and providing suitable conditions for annual cropping is highly important from water management viewpoints installing subsurface drainage systems can be considered to meet such conditions darzi naftchali et al 2013 designing drainage systems should be done by taking into account soil characteristics topography climate crops grown and trafficability conditions as well as the interaction of each of these factors taking all of these into account requires testing different scenarios through field pilots which requires a lot of time and cost singh et al 2006 if an appropriate calibration and validation is made computer simulation models while reducing costs and shortening the time to achieve the results can reasonably quantify the effects of various factors wang et al 2006 different simulation models are used to describe the performance of water management systems including subsurface and surface drainage and irrigation practices the drainmod model is one of the most practical models which is able to simulate different soil water balance components skaggs 1980 the balance in this model is classified into two parts of surface water balance and subsurface water balance which include deep percolation rainfall surface runoff and evapotranspiration et among different water balance components et is a key part of the hydrological cycle in terrestrial ecosystems which have a direct influence on crop yield therefore an appropriate estimation of et is essential for the development of eco hydrology models tian et al 2015 in the drainmod model et can be considered in two ways using the thornthwaite method and introducing evapotranspiration values directly luo et al 2009 introduced et as an input parameter affecting the drainage discharge simulation in the drainmod model and demonstrated the importance of the precise estimation of et in the application of this model niaghi et al 2017 investigated the impact of reference et on the accuracy of water table depth simulation in the drainmod model in north dakota continental climate the study revealed that by increasing the precision of evapotranspiration a significant improvement was observed in the water table depth simulation indicating that the performance of the model was highly sensitive to et recently davoodi et al 2019 evaluated the ability of drainmod s to predict drainage dater salinity and groundwater table depth in a subsurface drained paddy field in the north of iran the study revealed that the model did not capture well the wt fluctuations especially during frequent rainfall periods with shallow wt depths this failure may be due to the inadequacy of thornthwaite method to provide suitable estimations of et in the region with humid climate some previous studies have reported that the equations of blaney criddle tabari et al 2013 liu et al 2017 hargreaves tabari et al 2013 liu et al 2017 hamon lu et al 2005 alkaeed et al 2006 irmak tabari et al 2013 ritchie tabari et al 2013

valipour 2017 had a good performance for estimating et in humid areas based on the literature review there is a lack of a comprehensive study quantifying the performance of such methods in the drainmod model as subsurface drainage development is in its infancy in the northern provinces of iran using rapid and low cost methods to evaluate drainage design parameters is a challenge in drainage studies with this regard the drainmod model could help to assess different combinations of drain depth and spacing to find the best one darzi naftchally et al 2014 due to the high dependency of drainmod predicted wt depths to the et values in this research firstly the accuracy of 17 et estimation methods was evaluated compared with the fao penman monteith then by introducing et values calculated using different et methods into the drainmod model the accuracy of the simulated wt depths was assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field data needed for this study were obtained from a 4 5 ha subsurface drainage pilot of paddy fields in north of iran located at the sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university sanru 36 39 n and 53 04 e fig 1 based on a 17 year meteorological data of the area the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation in the region are 653 6 and 1186 1 mm respectively minimum mean and maximum temperature recorded in this area are 6 17 7 and 42 5 c on average 114 days of year are rainy mainly during autumn and winter season with low evaporation resulting waterlogging and ponding problems table 1 presents some of the climatic parameters of the area agricultural production in the region is mainly relies on tajan irrigation and drainage network covering about 53 thousand ha cropping area with the representative climatic condition of the coastal areas of northern iran however due to inadequacy of surface drainage canals and consequent waterlogging and ponding problems during autumn and winter seasons the area is generally only under rice cultivation during spring and summer seasons the sanru drainage pilot consisted of 4 subsurface drainage systems with two drain depths 0 65 and 0 90 m and two drain spacing 15 and 30 m was implemented in july 2011 to provide annual cropping condition after the introduction of the drainage systems the rice canola rotation was adopted as a suitable cropping system in the pilot area detailed description about the study field the drainage systems and the drainage design parameters could be found in darzi naftchali et al 2016 and jafari talukolaee et al 2018 2 2 field data and management before design and implementation of the drainage systems various soil data including textural class saturated hydraulic conductivity and characteristic curve were determined as described in davoodi et al 2019 the data of two subsurface drainage systems with drain depth d of 0 65 m and drain spacing l of 15 and 30 m d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 were used in this study in this area the soil texture is silty clay to a depth of 150 cm and clay in 150 300 cm depth during three canola growing seasons 28 november 2011 8 may 2012 3 october 2015 4 may 2016 2 october 2016 20 may 2017 the water table depth was measured daily in 1 m deep observation wells located at the midway between the two adjacent drains of the drainage systems fig 1 besides the first growing season when no tillage practice was adopted due to frequent rainfall conventional practices were done in the two other growing seasons by an experienced local grower 6 8 and 8 kg ha 1 of canola seeds were cropped in 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing seasons respectively under rainfed condition 2 3 estimating reference evapotranspiration in this study 17 et calculation models were selected including 5

evaporation based methods snyder cuenca fao 24 pan fpan equations 4 combination based methods fao penman monteith 56 fpm penman 63 p63 fao ppp 17 fao 17 and penman kimberley pk equations and one mass transfer method rohwer equation these equations are summarized in table 2 notably that the fpm equation was considered as a basis for comparison moreover the tw method which is based on monthly average temperature trajkovic et al 2019 is the default model considered in the drainmod model to calculate et 2 4 drainmod input data the drainmod simulation model a water management model for shallow water table soils was developed for comprehensive drainage management analysis in agricultural fields skaggs et al 2012 this model is capable of simulating water table depth and water balance as well as the movement or transfer of salinity and nitrogen in the soil wahba et al 2002 weather soil drainage design and crop information are needed as drinmod input data a 17 year period 2001 2017 weather data of the region were used including minimum and maximum air temperatures and daily rainfall for the same period the calculated et values by different methods unless the tw method were also used as input data the model can calculate et by the tw method based on latitude mean monthly temperature and heat index i this index was calculated for the period and its monthly average 83 4 was applied in the model soil data required in the drainmod model include soil water characteristic and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity of each soil layer the green ampt infiltration equation parameters and the volume drained wt relationship and upward flux wt relationship are additional soil required data which were determined through utility option of the model these data were adapted from the study of davoodi et al 2019 the drainage design parameters used in the model include drain depth 65 cm drain spacing 1500 and 3000 cm effective radius of drains 5 8 cm the actual distance from surface to impermeable layer 2 m drainage coefficient 0 3 cm d 1 initial depth to groundwater table 30 cm maximum surface storage 0 7 cm and kirkham s depth for flow to drains 0 5 cm 2 5 calibration and validation of the drainmod model the model was calibrated using the data of the d0 65l30 system by changing the values of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity kirkham s depth for flow to drains s1 maximum surface storage sm and pet factors as a result the saturated hydraulic conductivity of different soil layers was selected as 2 25 1 75 2 1 and 0 5 cm h 1 respectively for 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 200 cm soil layers also due to the condition of surface drainage in the study field and based on the values presented in the drainmod reference model report skaggs 1980 different values were used for maximum surface storage and micro storage in the calibration process finally the values of 0 7 and 0 5 cm were selected as the most suitable values for the two parameters respectively then the capability of the calibrated model was evaluated to simulate water table depth in the d0 65l15 system 2 6 evaluation criteria to evaluate the efficiency of the drainmod model and the accuracy of various et methods different criteria including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse error percentage pe wang et al 2006 and mean absolute deviation mad legates and mccabe 1999 were used these statistics are defined as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 pe i 1 n p i i 1 n o i i 1 n o i 100 4 mad i 1 n o i p i n in these equations oi and pi are respectively the observed and predicted values at time t n is the number of observations o is the average of observed values and p is the average of predicted values 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of et estimation methods the evaluation criteria obtained from the comparison of the daily et of the different methods with the method of fpm are presented in table 3 the best methods for et estimation were frad bc and fpan respectively the turc fao 17 and p63 methods had the most errors the most accurate temperature based method was bc r2 0 93 rmse 0 38 mm d 1 mad 0 76 mm d 1 and pe 6 24 and the weakest simulation in this group belonged to the turc method with the highest error tabari et al 2013 also reported that the bc method resulted the best performance among temperature based methods in a humid region comparing the accuracy of bc fpm penman har makkink and turc with lysimeter measurements by babaee et al 2019 showed that the bc method had the highest accuracy even more than the fpm method for estimating rice et in sari mazandaran iran confirming the results of the present study the reliability of the bc method was also demonstrated by zarei and mahmoudi 2017 in a study in iran involving climatic data of 17 synoptic stations with different climatic conditions the bc equation slightly overestimated et 0 19 mm d 1 while har ham and turc methods underestimated it 0 6 1 3 and 1 9 mm d 1 respectively compared with the fpm method with the daily average et of 3 36 mm d 1 these results are in line with the results reported in some previous studies zhai et al 2010 song et al 2019 total annual et related to the bc har ham and turc methods were respectively 1303 991 2 736 and 403 8 mm compared with 1226 3 mm for fpm indicating the bc method can be used in the study area because of its simplicity and no need for much data compared to the fpm however comparison of the daily variation of et data not shown showed increased errors of the bc method during the major part spring and summer of the common cultivation period in the region the method overestimated 0 55 mm d 1 et in this period while the rest temperature based methods underestimated it the study of liu et al 2017 in a semi arid climate demonstrated increased differences between temperature based methods and the fpm method during the warmer months of the year during autumn and winter seasons these methods yielded more satisfactory results with the best predictions for bc consistent with the results of liu et al 2017 in a semi arid area in china frad with r2 0 90 rmse 0 31 mm d 1 mad 0 71 mm d 1 and pe 0 95 was the most accurate one among radiation based methods in this group of equations unless the pt method all equations underestimated 0 73 mm d 1 the annual et total annual predicted et values through irmak ritchie frad and pt equations were 1090 2 1001 8 1214 6 and 1472 2 mm respectively pan evaporation based methods almost had the same results and underestimated annual et 0 8 mm d 1 with the best performance related to fpan r2 0 86 rmse 0 45 mm d 1 mad 0 80 mm d 1 and pe 16 18 in a study under sub humid climate of india poddar et al 2018 showed that the pan based methods underestimated et to about 0 7 mm d 1 compared with the fpm method the daily average of et values of snyder cuenca and fpan methods were respectively 2 43 2 33 and 2 81 mm compared with 3 36 mm related to fpm generally this group of equations performed same as fpm during april august period and then underestimated the daily et this period coincides with a major part of the growing season in the study area indicating the methods could be applied to determine irrigation requirement with low bias the differences between fpm and these methods were high during autumn and winter months also known as non irrigation periods on the other hand there is no need to compute et in this period for irrigation purposes comparison of combination methods showed that the pk method had the highest accuracy while fao 17 had the most error the better performance of pk was also reported by ahmadipour et al 2019 at the zabol of iran however all combination based methods overestimated 1 15 mm d 1 on average et compared with fpm total annual overestimation of fao 17 p63 and pk were 476 5 423 6 and 366 1 mm respectively these methods had usually similar deviations 1 1 3 mm d 1 related to fpm throughout the year on the other hand the fao 17 p63 and pk methods did not provide suitable estimations of et to apply for irrigation scheduling in the study region the rohwer mass transfer based method with r2 0 94 rmse 0 37 mm d 1 mad 0 76 mm d 1 and pe 21 75 resulted in 302 3 mm underestimation in annual et compared to fpm this result is in line with the study of xu and singh 2002 in switzerland where the rohwer mass transfer method underestimated et in april may and june as well as the yearly value this method provided approximately the same results to fpm for the period of march jun beyond this period rohwer always underestimated the daily et with the worst situation related to winter months 3 2 assessment of the water table depth simulation accuracy figs 2 and 3 show the variations of the actual wt depth and that simulated by the drainmod model in the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 drainage systems for different et estimation methods for all temperature based methods the accuracy of the simulation reduced where sudden change occurred in the actual wt depth on the other hand the model estimated the wt depth as zero in most of the times after rainfall events while such a case was not observed in the field resulting increased errors in simulating the rise and fall pattern of the wt depth the inability of the model to capture the realistic behavior of the wt depth variation after rainfall events was demonstrated by davoodi et al 2019 generally among the temperature based methods the ham and bc methods were the most accurate followed by tw method which is the default equation considered in the model the average errors of ham bc and tw methods during the whole simulation period for both drainage systems was 2 6 8 2 and 11 cm d 1 respectively the ham method did not provide accurate et compared to fpm however as it can be seen the accuracy of the ham method for wt depth prediction was much higher than the tw method mainly due to increased errors in simulating higher wt depths through the tw method in some cases where the actual wt depth was less than 30 cm the corresponding values simulated by the tw method were about zero according to tian et al 2015 the drainmod forest model had the ability to estimate et using tw method with suitable accuracy in north carolina with a semi wet and humid climate where the model was developed one of the reasons for such a difference between the results of the present study and that of tian et al 2015 is that the tw method may provide suitable estimations of et in north carolina while it was not appropriate for the study area among the temperature based methods the turc and har equations resulted in the weakest simulation of the wt depths with a mean error of 13 2 and 15 9 cm d 1 generally the har method overestimated the wt depth and the turc method underestimated it in both drainage systems part of such over or under estimation may originate from the over or under estimation of et by these methods the average of total et calculated through har and turc methods during the 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing seasons were 357 and 125 mm while for the ham equation as the most accurate one in this group it was 212 mm comparing these values with the average of pan evaporation in the period 205 mm indicate that the ham may provide better estimations of et in the region unless the pt method none of the radiation based methods obviated the deficiency of the tw method in simulating the shallow wt depth under frequent rainfall the pt methods resulted in relatively well predictions of the wt depth during high rainfall periods of 2011 12 while overestimated high wt depths in 2015 16 and 2016 17 under less frequent rainfall among radiation based methods ritchie had the least errors followed by frad irmak and pt methods with the mean error of 5 8 6 8 11 8 and 26 5 cm d 1 respectively irmak and frad methods had similar simulations and in most cases the pt method resulted in the highest overestimations compared with the other radiation based methods mainly due to overestimating et which also demonstrated by liu et al 2017 the pt method showed the highest error in december 2015 october 2016 february 2017 and march 2017 when the wt depth increased the ritchie method was most accurate in february 2012 and 2016 when the wt depth was low due to frequent rainfall generally radiation based methods were more accurate in the estimation of et during high rainfall periods resulting in more accurate estimations of the wt depth on the other hand in situation with reduced rainfall frequency and consequently higher wt depths for radiation based methods the differences between measured and simulated wt depths increased liu et al 2017 showed that in general radiation based methods were more accurate for estimating et in the days with less sunny hours which may a reason for better performance of the methods during rainy periods especially during 2011 12 the daily average of sunny hours during 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 canola growing seasons were 3 7 4 6 and 4 9 hours respectively resulting in higher et during 2015 16 and 2016 17 the average of estimated et through 4 radiation based methods during these growing seasons were 276 5 mm 2 3 mm d 1 on average 464 1 mm 2 7 mm d 1 on average and 484 4 mm 2 7 mm d 1 on average respectively as expected the simulation accuracy of the three pan evaporation based methods was suitable and their results were almost consistent the mean error of fpan cuenca and snyder s methods in the whole period was 9 7 11 9 and 12 3 cm d 1 respectively for both drainage systems the simulation accuracy of these methods was lower during less frequent rainfall periods or when the wt depth was high tabari et al 2013 indicated increased accuracy of pan evaporation methods for et estimation under lower humidity in the humid climate of northern iran which finally influence on the wt predictions by the drainmod model the performance of this group of equations was almost better than temperature based ones both under shallow and high water table depths comparison of the wt depth variation in temperature and pan evaporation based methods indicated that applying fpan could substantially increase the reliability of the drainmod predictions in the study area the accuracy of combination based methods for the wt depth prediction was less than that of the other methods same as their abilities to predict et on the other hand overestimation of the et well reflected in the predicted wt by the drainmod model in contrast with the findings of this study by comparing the simulated and measured meteorological data aouissi et al 2016 showed the suitability of the fpm method to estimate et in the swat hydrologic model among these methods the fpm method had the closest simulation to the measured values followed by pk p63 and fao 17 methods respectively the mean error of the mentioned methods in the study period was 11 3 23 4 27 6 and 31 5 cm day 1 respectively the combination based methods were more accurate in the 2011 12 growing season than 2015 16 and 2016 17 on the other hand these methods responded better to more frequent rainfall condition in 2011 12 the inability of combination based methods for prediction wt during 2015 16 and 2016 17 is mainly related to their weakness to provide suitable estimation of et on average total et estimated trough these methods during 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 were 208 557 and 584 mm respectively these values seem to be high compared with total pan evaporation during these growing seasons 154 202 and 258 mm respectively the combination based methods were reported to be sensitive to air temperature tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2014 gong et al 2006 eslamian et al 2011 as can be seen in table 1 this climate variable was significantly higher in 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing periods than that in 2011 12 the rohwer method was generally captured well the wt depth variation unless providing some over or under estimations of shallow or high wt depths respectively this method often simulated the wt depth as zero equal to the ground level in cases where the actual wt depth was less than 20 cm however the observed trend of the wt depth variation was better captured by rohwer than tw the daily and seasonal et predicted through the rohwer equation were comparable with actual pan evaporation data during the 2011 12 2015 16 and 2016 17 growing periods the daily averages of ets calculated by this method were 1 3 1 3 and 1 3 mm compared with 1 3 1 2 and 1 4 mm respectively obtained from pan evaporation the evaluation criteria as well as average of the simulated wt depth values in the d0 65l30 and d0 65l15 drainage systems are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively comparison of the evaluation statistics indicated that generally the rohwer ham fpan bc turc fpm and irmak methods resulted in the best simulation of the wt depth respectively compared to the tw method these methods increased simulation accuracy the weakest simulations were obtained by the methods of fao 17 p63 pt pk and har generally the maximum determination coefficient was related to rohwer and pan evaporation based methods 0 7 0 8 followed by temperature based methods 0 5 0 7 radiation based methods 0 3 0 7 and combination based methods 0 5 0 6 these values of r2 are less than the value of 0 967 reported by malota and senzanje 2015 and are comparable with the range 0 58 0 63 reported by niaghi et al 2017 the least pe was attributed to rohwer 23 2 to 5 2 followed by pan evaporation based methods 37 3 to 10 radiation based methods 15 5 to 61 2 temperature based methods 40 7 to 46 5 and combination based methods 22 5 to 70 4 the rohwer equation resulted the best mad 10 1 12 7 cm d 1 and rmse 13 5 15 3 cm d 1 followed by pan evaporation based methods mad 12 2 17 7 cm d 1 rmse 15 7 21 cm d 1 the combination and temperature based equations showed the least accuracy in the view point of mad and rmse indices during the study period the average of the measured wt depths in the d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 drainage systems was 49 and 44 cm respectively the average of the simulated wt depths in d0 65l30 was in the range of 26 53 8 cm for temperature based methods 43 9 70 7 cm for radiation based methods 29 5 37 5 cm for pan evaporation based methods and 53 7 74 8 cm for combination based methods under the d0 65l15 drainage system the average of the simulated wt depths ranged from 40 6 71 cm 5 4 75 6 cm 39 9 44 1 cm and 62 81 3 cm respectively for these methods when the rohwer equation was used the average of predicted wt depths in d0 65l15 and d0 65l30 found to be 45 6 and 33 7 cm respectively for the hum rohwer bc frad ritchie fpan and tw methods the differences between measured and simulated wt depths were 2 65 6 40 8 25 8 50 8 55 9 70 and 11 cm respectively which are comparable with some reported values such as 15 cm wahba et al 2002 and 7 cm yang 2008 4 conclusions this study was conducted to find a suitable et estimation method for north of iran to use in the drainmod model among 17 et estimation methods including temperature radiation pan evaporation combination and mass transfer based equations the fao 24 radiation blaney criddle irmak and fao 24 pan performed well compared with the reference method fao penman montieth equation analyzing the wt fluctuations involving drainmod revealed that the best methods for et estimation were not performed as well for wt prediction the rohwer and pan evaporation based equations which underestimated et compared to the reference method provided the best predictions of the wt depths and substantially improved the accuracy of the model in relation to the default method for et estimation in the model the results of this study demonstrated the reliability of the drainmod

10653,leaf temperature tl is tightly coupled with the rate of transpirational water loss from the leaf the temperatures of wet and dry reference leaf surfaces twet and tdry respectively are commonly used to normalize temperature measurements for current environmental conditions and then calculate a crop water stress index cwsi since it is often impractical to directly measure tdry and twet the goals of this work were to i determine a suitable artificial reference surface that makes application of the cwsi faster and easier in the field ii develop a model for tdry and twet based on the reference surface temperature that allows for calculation of standard cwsis iii test the technique for a range of weather conditions and tree species and iv analyze the sensitivity of these two models to tdry and twet and their impact on the estimation of four different cwsis our results showed that both tdry and twet are linearly related to the thermal temperature of green paper across a wide range of environmental conditions although there was a significant effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet the same models could be used in both the sun and shade to relate tdry and twet to tref moreover results indicated that a new cwsi dependent only on tl and twet was least sensitive to errors in twet but most sensitive to tl keywords irrigation scheduling crop water status thermal imaging prunus dulcis 1 introduction thermal imaging can be used to measure leaf or canopy temperatures which can then be used to estimate plant water status and therefore aid in irrigation scheduling of various crops jones et al 2002 ballester et al 2013 struthers et al 2015 gerhards et al 2016 craparo et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 gutiérrez et al 2018 plants lose large amounts of water through their stomatal pores while taking up co2 for photosynthesis when plant water availability declines stomata close to conserve water hopkins 2003 reducing evaporative cooling and increasing leaf temperature thermal imaging can then be employed to measure leaf temperature responses to water stress conditions and thereby infer impacts on transpiration and stomatal behavior in addition thermal imaging provides measurements of the temperature of the whole canopy and thus has the potential for fast spatio temporal measurements and water status assessment on a whole plant basis however the interpretation of thermal imagery is complicated by the fact that it aggregates many leaves with different environmental conditions and orientations which may affect the measurement in addition to transpiration rate canopy temperature is also strongly influenced by the local environmental conditions e g air temperature wind speed radiation campbell and norman 1998 in order to remove the effects of environmental conditions from leaf temperature measurements and isolate water status effects the temperature must be normalized which is commonly performed using both well watered and non transpiring reference crop temperatures idso 1982 the well watered and non transpiring crop temperatures respectively provide a theoretical lower and upper bound for possible actual leaf surface temperatures given identical environmental conditions these reference temperatures allow for the formulation of a dimensionless temperature index commonly called the crop water stress index or cwsi many cwsis have been proposed that use some combination of wet and dry reference surface temperatures each with the goal of increasing sensitivity of the index to water stress while decreasing sensitivity to environmental conditions e g jones 1999 grant et al 2007 costa et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2016 cohen et al 2017 poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 while theoretically convenient it is rarely possible in practice to have access to well watered and non transpiring crop temperatures for the same crop under identical environmental conditions jones et al 2002 thus compared various types of surfaces to replace the reference crop temperatures and concluded that the temperatures of real leaves from the same plant sprayed with water twet or covered in petroleum jelly to stop transpiration tdry provided effective reference temperatures because of the similar radiometric and aerodynamic properties as the actual leaves being studied since wet reference leaves dry out quickly maes et al 2016 presented and evaluated a new artificial wet reference surface that could stay wet for several days the reference leaf was fabricated by knitting a cotton cloth around a steel wire frame where the bottom part of the cloth was put in a water bottle wrapped with aluminum foil to act as a wick to avoid having to perform reference temperature measurements altogether previous workers have modelled the values of twet and tdry either arbitrarily by adding x c an empirical estimate dependent on vapor pressure deficit or a constant offset to the air temperature cohen et al 2005 2017 bellvert et al 2015 or theoretically by using the energy balance equation alchanatis et al 2010 möller et al 2007 the theoretical energy balance approach requires knowledge of complex parameters e g net radiation of the leaf the resistance to convective heat transfer the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve in practical application of this approach the experimenters or producers are often unable to provide input variables in the model without expensive equipment that requires technical expertise the primary objective of this work was to determine a surrogate reference surface temperature that could be used along with a model to more easily estimate tdry and twet values without any additional measurements any error in the estimation of tdry and twet will propagate to the calculation of the cwsi thus we studied four different cwsi formulations including two new cwsis to determine whether certain cwsi formulations were able to minimize sensitivity to errors in the estimation of tdry and twet while maximizing sensitivity to water status the specific novel aims of this study were i to develop a model that relates the temperature of a suitable artificial reference surface tref to tdry and twet thus making the application of a cwsi faster and easier in the field ii to test the model for a wide range of weather conditions and tree species and iii to analyze the sensitivity of these models for tdry and twet and their impact on the estimation of four different cwsis 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material this study was performed in 2018 on twelve almond trees prunus dulcis mill cv non pareil grafted onto krymsk 86 rootstock n 12 that were four years old in an experimental orchard at the university of california davis located in northern california average altitude 23 m 38 32 16 n 121 47 42 w at the experimental site full bloom occurred during week 7 of the calendar year 16 feb 2018 the almond trees were watered once per week between saturday and sunday with a micro sprinkler system to verify the general applicability of the model several additional woody species with hypostomatous leaves were selected prunus persica nerium oleander quercus sp olea europaea l and ulmus hybrid frontier these species were all located on the campus of the university of california davis within a 3 7 km radius of the above mentioned almond orchard 2 2 sampling strategy a number of thermal measurements were performed on six fully developed leaves with approximately the same orientation and size for each of the tree species three in the shaded zone inside the canopy 10 par 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and three in the sunny zone outside the canopy 700 par 1750 μmol photons m 2 s 1 on each day of measurements six new leaves were selected measurements were performed during four periods 15 june 2018 julian day number jdn 166 on u hybrid frontier only from 18 june 2018 to 22 june 2018 jdn 169 173 on p persica n oleander q sp and o europaea l u hybrid frontier from 30 july 2018 to 3 august 2018 jdn 211 215 all species and from 27 august 2018 to 31 august 2018 jdn 239 243 p dulcis only all measurements were collected uniformly in the morning between 9 00 am and 12 00 pm we chose this time period because the environmental conditions covered a wide range of values over a relatively short time period this high variability was desirable because it increased the domain of model validity 2 3 thermal imaging leaf temperatures were measured using thermal images obtained using a flir camera flirone pro for ios flir wilsonville or usa that was connected to an iphone 6 apple usa the camera produces thermal images of 480 640 pixels horizontal vertical with an accuracy of 3 c horizontal and vertical fields of view for the thermal images are 55 1 and 43 1 respectively for the same leaves two thermal pictures were collected one from the top surface and one from the bottom surface of the leaves in order to maximize thermal contrast between the leaf and background while minimizing influence of the background on the temperature of the leaf the background surfaces were chosen to be a sheet of black paper canford card 8 5 11 jet black for shady conditions and uncrumpled aluminum foil for sunny conditions fig 1 the reflectance temperature required for calibration of the thermal image was estimated to be the radiative temperature of a crumpled aluminum foil sheet placed next to the object being viewed with its emissivity set at 1 0 thermal images were processed using flir tools software version 6 4 18039 1003 flir wilsonville or usa the effective leaf emissivity was measured using the method described in detail in the user s manual of flir ets3xx series camera flir 2017 the average emissivity from several replicate measurements yielded the following values 0 87 for p persica n 11 0 61 for p dulcis n 13 0 81 for u hybrid frontier n 6 and q sp n 6 0 94 for n oleander n 6 and 0 98 for o europaea l n 6 the measured leaf emissivity value was also used for all objects in the picture to build the model although specifying the correct emissivity for each surface is important for accurate measurement of absolute temperature the fact that the same emissivity was used for all surfaces in the image meant that the emissivity value cancels out when developing the model to relate the leaf temperature to reference temperatures in the image it was verified that changing emissivity values had no effect on the final model results 2 4 wet and dry leaf reference surface temperatures the reference surface temperatures under wet and dry conditions were determined by measuring the temperature of an adjacent leaf that was sprayed with water on both sides approximately 1 min before the imaging the dry leaf reference surface tdry was prepared by covering an adjacent leaf in petroleum jelly vaseline 100 pure petroleum jelly unilever us on both sides of the leaf jones et al 2002 for each picture three adjacent leaves were chosen two representing the reference surface temperature twet and tdry and one representing the temperature of the leaf of interest tl several types of surfaces were selected as candidates for the approximation of twet and tdry the temperatures of sheets of paper tref of color green trefgreen canford card 8 5 11 emerald green black canford card 8 5 11 jet black and white canford card 8 5 11 snow white paper were measured to test their ability to represent the true wet and dry temperatures fig 1 2 5 crop water stress indices several potential crop water stress indices cwsis were considered in this study the different formulations of the cwsi were based on different normalizations of tl based on twet and tdry these different normalizations change the influence of the environmental conditions on the cwsi value poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 which could also change the impact of errors in estimation of twet and tdry on the calculated cwsi a first cwsi based only on tdry and tl was calculated as follows poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 1 c w s i 1 t d r y t l t d r y where tdry is the temperature of a dry reference leaf surface non transpiring leaf oc and tl is the temperature of the leaf of interest oc since tdry tl cwsi 1 0 with cwsi 1 0 for a non transpiring leaf and cwsi 1 increasing as the leaf becomes increasingly hydrated a second cwsi was calculated as follows also called cwsini fi by grant et al 2007 2 c w s i 2 t d r y t l t d r y t w e t where twet is the temperature of a wet reference leaf surface oc since tl twet and tdry tl 0 cwsi 2 1 in theory however unless liquid water is present on the exterior of the leaf under investigation e g rain dew or the vapor pressure deficit is zero tl will usually be significantly greater than twet and thus cwsi 2 is unlikely to reach a value of 1 in a fully irrigated crop a third cwsi based only on twet and tl was calculated as follows poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 3 c w s i 3 t l t w e t t w e t using this approach cwsi 3 0 in theory with cwsi 3 increasing as the crop dries out finally a fourth cwsi derived by jones et al 2002 is defined as follows 4 i g t d r y t l t l t w e t a strength of this formulation is that it is theoretically proportional to stomatal conductance jones et al 2002 thus making its interpretation in a relative sense straightforward it also has the same lower theoretical bounds as cwsi 2 but has upper bounds of infinity i e 0 i g between 9 00 am and 12 00 pm the environmental conditions varied strongly and have a high influence on the real value of the cwsi for this reason the percentage of the variation of the cwsi is considered rather than the absolute value 2 6 meteorological data although not directly used in the calculation of cwsis local meteorological data were collected and reported to characterize the climate at the experimental site and ambient environmental conditions during the thermal measurements daily average relative humidity rh daily minimum and maximum air temperatures min tair and max tair c were obtained from weather station n 6 of the california irrigation management information system cimis network cimis water ca gov which was located about 1 6 km from the experimental site for p dulcis and about 2 1 km from the other species in order to characterize the range of environmental conditions under which the models for twet and tdry were developed and tested data were collected adjacent to the leaf the air temperature tair c and the relative humidity of the air adjacent to the leaf were measured a few seconds after the thermal imaging with a thermo hygrometer probe for smartphones model 800014 tfa dostmann gmbh co kg wertheim germany in order to characterize the environment in the vicinity of the leaf fig 2 5 g 5 h and to correct the thermal images for absorption of longwave radiation due to the atmosphere 2 7 statistical analysis linear and nonlinear regressions between tdry twet and the reference paper surface temperature black green or white or tair were fitted to the data using sigmaplot version 13 0 for windows spss inc san josé ca usa the goodness of fit of the resulting

to see what effect this produces on the output pianosi et al 2016 this method involves changing one input variable keeping others at their baseline nominal values then returning the variable to its nominal value and repeating for each of the other inputs in the same way for our models we changed only the thermal temperature of the reference surface measured by thermal imaging to see its effect on the outputs tdry twet and cwsi tl remained fixed in the oat method and its value is the measured data rstudio version 1 1 463 was used to calculate the sensitivity indices the main first order and the total effects of sobol sensitivity analysis monte carlo estimation of sobol indices formulas of martinez 2011 martinez 2011 baudin et al 2016 for the parameters in the sobol sensitivity analysis we took the ranges of temperature values 20 45 oc that are typical for the california usa region where almond trees are cultivated we assumed that the parameters used to calculate the cwsis are independent the number of model evaluations was equal to 106 3 results 3 1 air temperature and relative humidity during the experimental period variations of daily average relative humidity daily

the light conditions and the side of the leaf on tdry and twet for p dulcis at each date of measurement no significant effect p 0 05 of the side of the leaf upper or lower was observed for tdry and twet thus the same model can be used for either side of the leaf to simulate the thermal temperature of non transpiring tdry or wet twet reference leaves as expected there was a significant effect of the light sun and shade on tdry and twet p 0 0001 anova n 12 in sunny conditions tdry and twet reached about 34 3 c and 20 1 c on average across all samples respectively in shady condition tdry and twet reached about 23 1 c and 14 7 c on average respectively 3 3 comparison of the relationship between tdry twet tref and tair fig 5 compares the relationships between tdry twet and tair and between tdry twet and tref the relationship between tdry and tref was nearly linear with linear and quadratic regression models both providing an r2 adj value greater than 0 84 for the paper colors considered similarly the relationship between twet and tref was nearly linear where the linear model gave an r2 adj 0 71 and the quadratic model gave r2 adj 0 72 table 2 and 3 sun shade models prediction of tdry and twet based on tref was much better than basing the model on tair linear and quadratic models of tdry based on tair both yielded an r2 adj of 0 32 and linear and quadratic models of twet based on tair yielded an r2 adj of 0 28 and 0 30 respectively fig 5g shows that the line tdry tair 5 c estimation of tdry with a constant offset use by cohen et al 2005 over estimates tdry in shaded conditions and gives high variability given that a single value of tair corresponds to many different values of tdry 3 4 choice of the reference surface the results of the covariance analysis used to study the effect of light conditions side of the leaf and thermal temperature of the reference surface are shown in table 1 these results allow for a determination of whether one model can be used for both light conditions in the prediction of tdry or twet for tdry and twet no significant interaction p 0 05 between input variables was found between the factors thus the slopes of the models are homogeneous for green and white reference surfaces a main significant effect p 0 001 was found with the thermal t oc of the reference surface only thus there is no difference in the y intercept as a result only this variable was used in formulating the model and the same model was proposed for both light conditions for the black reference surface main effects were found for light and thermal t oc of the reference factors thus the y intercepts are different between shady and sunny conditions and two models were studied one for sunny conditions and one for shady conditions however we have also proposed a single model for both light conditions with the black reference surface to verify if a single model is adequate 3 5 calibration and validation of the model for twet and tdry table 2

between the linear model r2 adj 0 9009 d 0 9736 rmse 2 6598 and the quadratic model r2 adj 0 9046 d 0 9750 rmse 2 5954 thus we have chosen to continue our study with the linear model no1 the simplest

and 0 9674 for tdry and twet respectively 3 7 sensitivity analysis of four crop water stress indices cwsis figs 8 a sunlit and 8b shaded show the effect of varying the temperature of the green reference surface trefgreen on four cwsis with tl fixed over the range of 10 to 10 and for the two light conditions the four indices vary significantly p 0 001 fig 8a and 8b in the sun i g was the index most influenced by a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen 129 and cwsi 3 the least influenced index 66 p 0 012 for a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen cwsi 3 was the least influenced index 79 p 0 001 as opposed to 94 94 102 for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 i g respectively fig 8a in the shade i g was also the index most influenced by a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen 358 p 0 047 and cwsi 3 the least influenced index 47 p 0 009 for a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen cwsi 3 was the least influenced index 56 p 0 001 as opposed to 110 for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and i g no significative difference between these three cwsis p 0 89 fig 8b fig 8c shows the results of the sobol sensitivity analysis with the formulas of martinez 2011 for four cwsis with variation of parameters trefgreen and tl sobol s method determines the contribution of each input parameter trefgreen and tl to overall output variance first order sensitivity index and their interactions total order sensitivity index for cwsi 1 and cwsi 2 the results indicate that trefgreen is the most important parameter individually contributing to around 50 of both outputs cwsi and tl contributing to around 48 and 46 of the output respectively in other words most of the variation in these cwsis was due to trefgreen for cwsi 3 the result indicates that tl is the most important parameter individually contributing to around 52 of the output cwsi in other words most of the variation in this cwsi was due to tl on the other hand cwsi 3 presents the biggest difference between the first order sensitivity indices of trefgreen and tl 46 and 52 respectively for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and cwsi 3 both the first order sensitivity indices and the total order sensitivity indices have similar values which indicates no significant second order interaction between trefgreen and tl i g trefgreen and tl have no main effects first order sensitivity index of i g 0 05 for both parameters however the values of the total order sensitivity indices are close to 1 indicating that the variance of i g was driven mainly by the second order interaction between trefgreen and tl fig 8c as illustrated graphically in fig 8c the ratio between the sensitivity of cwsi to tl and trefgreen is largest for cwsi 3 this means that cwsi 3 is likely to be least sensitive in a relative sense to errors in the estimation of reference temperatures via trefgreen 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet our results indicated a significant effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet and the fit of the model is better for the data recorded in the shade than in the sun which is in agreement with previously reported results ansari and loomis 1959 atkin et al 2000 niesenbaum and kluger 2006 for example dhillon et al 2014 found an analogous result for a multiple linear regression model for leaf temperature as a function of mid day stem water potential and environmental variables in which the r2 was better for shaded leaves than for sunlit leaves they suggested that the influence of factors such as sun angle and leaf orientation were stronger in the case of sunlit leaves as par was found to be significant in all sunlit leaf models other previous studies also indicated that at a low irradiance i e shade the variance in temperature declines to low levels and at the high irradiance i e full sun the variance is amplified by decreasing irradiance within the canopy ngao et al 2017 more diffuse irradiance homogenizes the leaf temperatures because shaded leaves receive proportionally more radiative energy under those conditions woods et al 2018 that could explain the differences observed in the fit of the models in the sun and shade although light has a strong effect on the temperature of the well watered and non transpiring leaves tdry and twet the model that relates the reference temperature to tdry and twet is the same this has important practical implications particularly if the method is applied to a whole tree plant that contains both sunlit and shaded leaves in one image 4 2 effect of the side of the leaf on tdry and twet almond leaves are hypostomatous palasciano et al 2005 i e the stomata are mostly on the lower side of the leaf our results showed that the thermal temperature of the leaf is approximately the same on both sides of the leaf for tdry and twet pallas et al 1967 found that in cotton plants gossypiunt hirsutum l differences in temperature between the upper and lower leaf surfaces could reach 2 c where the upper surface was warmer than the lower when the leaf was well hydrated and the converse was true under drought stress conditions they also reported that the temperature differences between the upper and lower surfaces were only significant under high light conditions the authors attributed these differences to a combination of differential heating due to radiation differential cooling due to radiation and changes in leaf angle mediated by turgor changes however their results could also be explained by radiation error of the thermocouple which has been reported to cause similar magnitude errors bailey et al 2016 combined with varying leaf angle that could change the nature of the radiation error the ability to assume the same temperature for upper and lower faces of the leaf is potentially important for application of thermal imaging in whole plants or canopies because any given view of the vegetation may contain both upper and lower leaf surfaces if as our results suggest differences in leaf temperature between upper and lower leaf faces are small then this eliminates an additional variable that would need to be accounted for when processing the thermal images 4 3 model of tdry and twet to increase ease of use one goal of this work was to determine artificial reference surfaces that could be easily used without any further measurement to estimate tdry and twet and thus make the cwsi approach easier to apply in the field particularly by growers we developed simple models to predict tdry and twet during the growing season based only on the temperature of a green paper reference surface trefgreen under the same conditions as the leaf being examined the proposed models are relatively simple in that they are linear equations with only trefgreen as the independent variable the models were calibrated validated and tested with data recorded under a wide range of air temperature and relative humidity conditions fig 2 although it was not possible to test the model for all possible environmental conditions it was shown to perform well at three different times during the growing season and across six different species it is perhaps surprising the wet reference temperature can be estimated using the temperature of a dry piece of paper because it would seemingly lack the effect of evaporation poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 showed that when in sunlight twet is only weakly dependent on relative humidity as with tdry twet is driven primarily by air temperature and wind speed in direct sunlight since the green reference surface also includes these environmental factors a model based on trefgreen is able to explain most of the variation in twet a common approach for estimating tdry is to assume that tdry is a constant offset above the air temperature e g tdry tair 5 c cohen et al 2005 this approach presents several possible problems several environmental variables such as the light the wind speed or the relative humidity can influence the difference between the surface temperature of the leaf reference and the air temperature indeed if the constant temperature offset approach is applied fig 5g shows that the values of tdry are over estimated in the shade also high variability of tdry was observed for the same value of tair which is not present for the models based on trefgreen some studies such as meron et al 2010 in cotton or garcía tejero et al 2012 in almond trees developed an empirical methodology for canopy temperature extraction using thermal images and air temperature the proposed methodology was based on the separation of the canopy related pixels in the thermal image from those of the soil and other objects by upper and lower thresholds to air temperature our results indicate that it would probably be better to use tref in this step of processing images indeed if tair is used in the upper and lower thresholds a significant amount of interesting data would be deleted during the pixel filtering process fig 5g h less data would be lost with tref fig 5a b furthermore by using temperature measurements from different instruments in the cwsi systematic errors in the temperature measurements will not necessarily cancel such as absolute errors in the thermographic measurement the method proposed in this work requires only slightly more effort to apply than the constant temperature offset method but it also takes into account important environmental variables that influence tdry and twet 4 4 performance of these new models in the estimation of four crop water stress indices for almond trees previous work does not exist in the literature regarding thorough analysis of the sensitivity of cwsis to errors in estimation of tdry and twet reference temperatures our new results suggest that i g is the most sensitive index to the variation of input trefgreen fig 8a b and the output value is influenced by the interaction between trefgreen and tl fig 8c in the definition of this index tdry is only in the numerator and thus its influence is much more important in the other indices tdry is present in the numerator and denominator of the equation cwsi 1 and cwsi 2 or absent altogether cwsi 3 which limits the ultimate influence of tdry on the estimation of the crop water stress index the sensitivity to i g was markedly different from the other three because tl is present in both the numerator and denominator which means that its influence on the cwsi comes in through relative interactions with twet and tdry the sensitivity analysis showed that cwsi 3 was most sensitive to tl out of cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and i g its evolution seems to better reflect the changes of the leaf temperature since the estimation of reference surface temperatures will always incur some error in estimating cwsis we seek a cwsi that has maximum sensitivity to tl which is directly measured and minimum sensitivity to the reference temperature in our case estimated from trefgreen thus based on our sensitivity analysis cwsi 3 appears most suitable because it has both of these characteristics additional experiments are necessary to verify if cwsi 3 can be used to estimate the water needs and manage the irrigation of the almond trees 5 conclusion the present study proposes a methodology for modeling the reference temperatures tdry and twet commonly used in cwsis it was determined that tdry and twet could be related to the temperature of a green piece of paper using simple linear models this approach was developed using almond trees and tested on five other species we also analyzed the sensitivity of these models in the estimation of four cwsis including a new cwsi denoted as cwsi 3 based only on tl and twet a sensitivity analysis indicated that cwsi 3 appeared promising in that it had the highest sensitivity to tl but had the lowest sensitivity to the temperature of the reference paper trefgreen our study is an initial step toward improving the accessibility and adoption of thermography based irrigation management tools by growers by making them easier to use and less expensive additional work is needed to evaluate the performance of the new index cwsi 3 in estimating tree water status and associated irrigation needs and to further evaluate the approach over seasonal time periods there is potential to scale up the approach to the field level using airborne sensing platforms by placing a large

10653,leaf temperature tl is tightly coupled with the rate of transpirational water loss from the leaf the temperatures of wet and dry reference leaf surfaces twet and tdry respectively are commonly used to normalize temperature measurements for current environmental conditions and then calculate a crop water stress index cwsi since it is often impractical to directly measure tdry and twet the goals of this work were to i determine a suitable artificial reference surface that makes application of the cwsi faster and easier in the field ii develop a model for tdry and twet based on the reference surface temperature that allows for calculation of standard cwsis iii test the technique for a range of weather conditions and tree species and iv analyze the sensitivity of these two models to tdry and twet and their impact on the estimation of four different cwsis our results showed that both tdry and twet are linearly related to the thermal temperature of green paper across a wide range of environmental conditions although there was a significant effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet the same models could be used in both the sun and shade to relate tdry and twet to tref moreover results indicated that a new cwsi dependent only on tl and twet was least sensitive to errors in twet but most sensitive to tl keywords irrigation scheduling crop water status thermal imaging prunus dulcis 1 introduction thermal imaging can be used to measure leaf or canopy temperatures which can then be used to estimate plant water status and therefore aid in irrigation scheduling of various crops jones et al 2002 ballester et al 2013 struthers et al 2015 gerhards et al 2016 craparo et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 gutiérrez et al 2018 plants lose large amounts of water through their stomatal pores while taking up co2 for photosynthesis when plant water availability declines stomata close to conserve water hopkins 2003 reducing evaporative cooling and increasing leaf temperature thermal imaging can then be employed to measure leaf temperature responses to water stress conditions and thereby infer impacts on transpiration and stomatal behavior in addition thermal imaging provides measurements of the temperature of the whole canopy and thus has the potential for fast spatio temporal measurements and water status assessment on a whole plant basis however the interpretation of thermal imagery is complicated by the fact that it aggregates many leaves with different environmental conditions and orientations which may affect the measurement in addition to transpiration rate canopy temperature is also strongly influenced by the local environmental conditions e g air temperature wind speed radiation campbell and norman 1998 in order to remove the effects of environmental conditions from leaf temperature measurements and isolate water status effects the temperature must be normalized which is commonly performed using both well watered and non transpiring reference crop temperatures idso 1982 the well watered and non transpiring crop temperatures respectively provide a theoretical lower and upper bound for possible actual leaf surface temperatures given identical environmental conditions these reference temperatures allow for the formulation of a dimensionless temperature index commonly called the crop water stress index or cwsi many cwsis have been proposed that use some combination of wet and dry reference surface temperatures each with the goal of increasing sensitivity of the index to water stress while decreasing sensitivity to environmental conditions e g jones 1999 grant et al 2007 costa et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2016 cohen et al 2017 poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 while theoretically convenient it is rarely possible in practice to have access to well watered and non transpiring crop temperatures for the same crop under identical environmental conditions jones et al 2002 thus compared various types of surfaces to replace the reference crop temperatures and concluded that the temperatures of real leaves from the same plant sprayed with water twet or covered in petroleum jelly to stop transpiration tdry provided effective reference temperatures because of the similar radiometric and aerodynamic properties as the actual leaves being studied since wet reference leaves dry out quickly maes et al 2016 presented and evaluated a new artificial wet reference surface that could stay wet for several days the reference leaf was fabricated by knitting a cotton cloth around a steel wire frame where the bottom part of the cloth was put in a water bottle wrapped with aluminum foil to act as a wick to avoid having to perform reference temperature measurements altogether previous workers have modelled the values of twet and tdry either arbitrarily by adding x c an empirical estimate dependent on vapor pressure deficit or a constant offset to the air temperature cohen et al 2005 2017 bellvert et al 2015 or theoretically by using the energy balance equation alchanatis et al 2010 möller et al 2007 the theoretical energy balance approach requires knowledge of complex parameters e g net radiation of the leaf the resistance to convective heat transfer the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve in practical application of this approach the experimenters or producers are often unable to provide input variables in the model without expensive equipment that requires technical expertise the primary objective of this work was to determine a surrogate reference surface temperature that could be used along with a model to more easily estimate tdry and twet values without any additional measurements any error in the estimation of tdry and twet will propagate to the calculation of the cwsi thus we studied four different cwsi formulations including two new cwsis to determine whether certain cwsi formulations were able to minimize sensitivity to errors in the estimation of tdry and twet while maximizing sensitivity to water status the specific novel aims of this study were i to develop a model that relates the temperature of a suitable artificial reference surface tref to tdry and twet thus making the application of a cwsi faster and easier in the field ii to test the model for a wide range of weather conditions and tree species and iii to analyze the sensitivity of these models for tdry and twet and their impact on the estimation of four different cwsis 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material this study was performed in 2018 on twelve almond

average altitude 23 m 38 32 16 n 121 47 42 w at the experimental site full bloom occurred during week 7 of the calendar year 16 feb 2018 the almond trees were watered once per week between saturday and sunday with a micro sprinkler system to verify the general applicability of the model several additional woody species with hypostomatous leaves were selected prunus persica nerium oleander quercus sp olea europaea l and ulmus hybrid frontier these species were all located on the campus of the university of california davis within a 3 7 km radius of the above mentioned almond orchard 2 2 sampling strategy a number of thermal measurements were performed on six fully developed leaves with approximately the same orientation and size for each of the tree species three in the shaded zone inside the canopy 10 par 300 μmol photons m 2 s 1 and three in the sunny zone outside the canopy 700 par 1750 μmol photons m 2 s 1 on each day of measurements six new leaves were selected measurements were performed during four periods 15 june 2018 julian day number jdn 166 on u hybrid frontier only from 18 june 2018 to 22 june 2018 jdn 169 173 on p persica n oleander q sp and o europaea l u hybrid frontier from 30 july 2018 to 3 august 2018 jdn 211 215 all species and from 27 august 2018 to 31 august 2018 jdn 239 243 p dulcis only all measurements were collected uniformly in the morning between 9 00 am and 12 00 pm we chose this time period because the environmental conditions covered a wide range of values over a relatively short time period this high variability was desirable because it increased the domain of model validity 2 3 thermal imaging leaf temperatures were measured using thermal images obtained using a flir camera flirone pro for ios flir wilsonville or usa that was connected to an iphone 6 apple usa the camera produces thermal images of 480 640 pixels horizontal vertical with an accuracy of 3 c horizontal and vertical fields of view for the thermal images are 55 1 and 43 1 respectively for the same leaves two thermal pictures were collected one from the top surface and one from the bottom surface of the leaves in order to maximize thermal contrast between the leaf and background while minimizing influence of the background on the temperature of the leaf the background surfaces were chosen to be a sheet of black paper canford card 8 5 11 jet black for shady conditions and uncrumpled aluminum foil for sunny conditions fig 1 the reflectance temperature required for calibration of the thermal image was estimated to be the radiative temperature of a crumpled aluminum foil sheet placed next to the object being viewed with its emissivity set at 1 0 thermal images were processed using flir tools software version 6 4 18039 1003 flir wilsonville or usa the effective leaf emissivity was measured using the method described in detail in the user s manual of flir ets3xx series camera flir 2017 the average emissivity from several replicate measurements yielded the following values 0 87 for p persica n 11 0 61 for p dulcis n 13 0 81 for u hybrid frontier n 6 and q sp n 6 0 94 for n oleander n 6 and 0 98 for o europaea l n 6 the measured leaf emissivity value was also used for all objects in the picture to build the model although specifying the correct emissivity for each surface is important for accurate measurement of absolute temperature the fact that the same emissivity was used for all surfaces in the image meant that the emissivity value cancels out when developing the model to relate the leaf temperature to reference temperatures in the image it was verified that changing emissivity values had no effect on the final model results 2 4 wet and dry leaf reference surface temperatures the reference surface temperatures under wet and dry conditions were determined by measuring the temperature of an adjacent leaf that was sprayed with water on both sides approximately 1 min before the imaging the dry leaf reference surface tdry was prepared by covering an adjacent leaf in petroleum jelly vaseline 100 pure petroleum jelly unilever us on both sides of the leaf jones et al 2002 for each picture three adjacent leaves were chosen two representing the reference surface temperature twet and tdry and one representing the temperature of the leaf of interest tl several types of surfaces were selected as candidates for the approximation of twet and tdry the temperatures of sheets of paper tref of color green trefgreen canford card 8 5 11 emerald green black canford card 8 5 11 jet black and white canford card 8 5 11 snow white paper were measured to test their ability to represent the true wet and dry temperatures fig 1 2 5 crop water stress indices several potential crop water stress indices cwsis were considered in this study the different formulations of the cwsi were based on different normalizations of tl based on twet and tdry these different normalizations change the influence of the environmental conditions on the cwsi value poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 which could also change the impact of errors in estimation of twet and tdry on the calculated cwsi a first cwsi based only on tdry and tl was calculated as follows poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 1 c w s i 1 t d r y t l t d r y where tdry is the temperature of a dry reference leaf surface non transpiring leaf oc and tl is the temperature of the leaf of interest oc since tdry tl cwsi 1 0 with cwsi 1 0 for a non transpiring leaf and cwsi 1 increasing as the leaf becomes increasingly hydrated a second cwsi was calculated as follows also called cwsini fi by grant et al 2007 2 c w s i 2 t d r y t l t d r y t w e t where twet is the temperature of a wet reference leaf surface oc since tl twet and tdry tl 0 cwsi 2 1 in theory however unless liquid water is present on the exterior of the leaf under investigation e g rain dew or the vapor pressure deficit is zero tl will usually be significantly greater than twet and thus cwsi 2 is unlikely to reach a value of 1 in a fully irrigated crop a third cwsi based only on twet and tl was calculated as follows poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 3 c w s i 3 t l t w e t t w e t using this approach cwsi 3 0 in theory with cwsi 3 increasing as the crop dries out finally a fourth cwsi derived by jones et al 2002 is defined as follows 4 i g t d r y t l t l t w e t a strength of this formulation is that it is theoretically proportional to stomatal conductance jones et al 2002 thus making its interpretation in a relative sense straightforward it also has the same lower theoretical bounds as cwsi 2 but has upper bounds of infinity i e 0 i g between 9 00 am and 12 00 pm the environmental conditions varied strongly and have a high influence on the real value of the cwsi for this reason the percentage of the variation of the cwsi is considered rather than the absolute value 2 6 meteorological data although not directly used in the calculation of cwsis local meteorological data were collected and reported to characterize the climate at the experimental site and ambient environmental conditions during the thermal measurements daily average relative humidity rh daily minimum and maximum air temperatures min tair and max tair c were obtained from weather station n 6 of the california irrigation management information system cimis network cimis water ca gov which was located about 1 6 km from the experimental site for p dulcis and about 2 1 km from the other species in order to characterize the range of environmental conditions under which the models for twet and tdry were developed and tested data were collected adjacent to the leaf the air temperature tair c and the relative humidity of the air adjacent to the leaf were measured a few seconds after the thermal imaging with a thermo hygrometer probe for smartphones model 800014 tfa dostmann gmbh co kg wertheim germany in order to characterize the environment in the vicinity of the leaf fig 2 5 g 5 h and to correct the thermal images for absorption of longwave radiation due to the atmosphere 2 7 statistical analysis linear and nonlinear regressions between tdry twet and the reference paper surface temperature black green or white or tair were fitted to the data using sigmaplot version 13 0 for windows spss inc san josé ca usa the goodness of fit of the resulting regressions models were evaluated using the following three statistics 1 the coefficient of determination adjusted for estimated parameters hill and lewicki 2007 dinçer and topuz 2015 to yield an

variance anova tukey test for model parameterization we used three quarters of the presented data for p dulcis three trees of p dulcis were chosen at random n 96 the rest of the data the remaining tree of p dulcis n 32 and measurements from other species p persica n oleander q sp o europaea u hybrid frontier n 102 were used for a model validation the models predictive capacity was evaluated by performing validation based on data sets that were not used to parameterize the model see above and quantifying errors using the same three indices r2 adj d and rmse hereafter referred to as the rmse of prediction rmsep and d of the prediction dp respectively 2 8 sensitivity analysis microsoft excel was used to study the sensitivity of the cwsis by changing one factor at a time ofat or oat method to see what effect this produces on the output pianosi et al 2016 this method involves changing one input variable keeping others at their baseline nominal values then returning the variable to its nominal value and repeating for each of the other inputs in the same way for our models we changed only the thermal temperature of the reference surface measured by thermal imaging to see its effect on the outputs tdry twet and cwsi tl remained fixed in the oat method and its value is the measured data rstudio version 1 1 463 was used to calculate the sensitivity indices the main first order and the total effects of sobol sensitivity analysis monte carlo estimation of sobol indices formulas of martinez 2011 martinez 2011 baudin et al 2016 for the parameters in the sobol sensitivity analysis we took the ranges of temperature values 20 45 oc that are typical for the california usa region where almond trees are cultivated we assumed that the parameters used to calculate the cwsis are independent the number of model evaluations was equal to 106 3 results 3 1 air temperature and relative humidity during the experimental period variations of daily average relative humidity daily minimum and maximum air temperatures average rh min tair and max tair between 1 february 2018 julian day number jdn 32 and 31 august 2018 jdn 243 are shown in fig 3 in 2018 full bloom took place around 16 february 2018 just before a period of freezing from jdn 50 to jdn 63 after that period of freezing the minimum and maximum air temperatures increased the maximum temperature of 39 3 c was reached on jdn 206 the average daily minimum and maximum air temperatures during the experimental period from jdn 166 to jdn 243 were 14 1 2 1 c n 78 and 32 9 3 5 c n 78 respectively mean standard deviation the average relative humidity was 54 1 8 5 from jdn 166 to jdn 243 n 78 the daily maximum air temperature was above 37 5 c between jdn 199 and 206 from jdn 166 to jdn 243 the difference between the daily high and low temperatures was 18 8 2 9 c n 78 and the difference between the daily high and low relative humidity was 51 8 9 1 n 78 after jdn 216 the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures began to decrease fig 2 shows the values and the range of the air temperature and relative humidity recorded near the leaves microclimate during each of the measurement periods the air temperatures varied from 20 7 c to 38 4 c the relative humidity varied from 26 8 to 61 2 3 2 effect of the light conditions and the side of the leaf on twet and tdry fig 4 illustrates the effect of the light conditions and the side of the leaf on tdry and twet for p dulcis at each date of measurement no significant effect p 0 05 of the side of the leaf upper or lower was observed for tdry and twet thus the same model can be used for either side of the leaf to simulate the thermal temperature of non transpiring tdry or wet twet reference leaves as expected there was a significant effect of the light sun and shade on tdry and twet p 0 0001 anova n 12 in sunny conditions tdry and twet reached about 34 3 c and 20 1 c on average across all samples respectively in shady condition tdry and twet reached about 23 1 c and 14 7 c on average respectively 3 3 comparison of the relationship between tdry twet tref and tair fig 5 compares the relationships between tdry twet and tair and between tdry twet and tref the relationship between tdry and tref was nearly linear with linear and quadratic regression models both providing an r2 adj value greater than 0 84 for the paper colors considered similarly the relationship between twet and tref was nearly linear where the linear model gave an r2 adj 0 71 and the quadratic model gave r2 adj 0 72 table 2 and 3 sun shade models prediction of tdry and twet based on tref was much better than basing the model on tair linear and quadratic models of tdry based on tair both yielded an r2 adj of 0 32 and linear and quadratic models of twet based on tair yielded an r2 adj of 0 28 and 0 30 respectively fig 5g shows that the line tdry tair 5 c estimation of tdry with a constant offset use by cohen et al 2005 over estimates tdry in shaded conditions and gives high variability given that a single value of tair corresponds to many different values of tdry 3 4 choice of the reference surface the results of the covariance analysis used to study the effect of light conditions side of the leaf and thermal temperature of the reference surface are shown in table 1 these results allow for a determination of whether one model can be used for both light conditions in the prediction of tdry or twet for tdry and twet no significant interaction p 0 05 between input variables was found between the factors thus the slopes of the models are homogeneous for green and white reference surfaces a main significant effect p 0 001 was found with the thermal t oc of the reference surface only thus there is no difference in the y intercept as a result only this variable was used in formulating the model and the same model was proposed for both light conditions for the black reference surface main effects were found for light and thermal t oc of the reference factors thus the y intercepts are different between shady and sunny conditions and two models were studied one for sunny conditions and one for shady conditions however we have also proposed a single model for both light conditions with the black reference surface to verify if a single model is adequate 3 5 calibration and validation of the model for twet and tdry table 2 presents and compares five linear models and five quadratic models the simplest non linear models without interaction used to predict tdry for p dulcis according to the three reference surfaces the models that use the green reference surface temperature are the best models for tdry linear and quadratic models table 2 furthermore the three error metrics showed only a very slight difference between the linear model r2 adj 0 9009 d 0 9736 rmse 2 6598 and the quadratic model r2 adj 0 9046 d 0 9750 rmse 2 5954 thus we have chosen to continue our study with the linear model no1 the simplest model that uses the green reference surface as the independent variable 9 tdry 0 9717 trefgreen 1 2213 where trefgreen is the thermal temperature of the green paper reference surface oc for p dulcis the linear model explained a high percentage of the variance r2 adj 0 9009 with a highly significant effect of trefgreen p 0 0001 the rmse and d were 2 66 c and 0 97 respectively over values ranging from 14 c to 48 c fig 6 a table 2 the rmsep and dp were similar at 2 59 c and 0 97 respectively over values ranging from 13 c to 44 c showing good predictive performance fig 6b table 2 table 3 presents and compares five linear models and five quadratic models the simplest non linear models without interaction used to predict twet according to three reference surfaces green black and white for p dulcis the models that use the green reference surface temperature are also the best models for twet linear and quadratic models table 3 the three error metrics showed only a very slight difference between the linear model r2 adj 0 7609 d 0 9284 rmse 2 8827 and the quadratic model r2 adj 0 7686 d 0 9321 rmse 2 8209 likewise we have chosen to continue our study with the linear model no11 the simplest model that uses the green reference surface as the independent variable 10 twet 0 6238 trefgreen 2 4803 for p dulcis the linear model explained a large percentage of the variance r2 adj 0 7609 with a highly significant effect of trefgreen p 0 0001 the rmse and d were acceptable at 2 88 c and 0 93 respectively over values ranging from 11 c to 33 c fig 6c table 3 the rmsep and dp were also acceptable at 2 26 c and 0 95 respectively over values ranging from 10 c to 30 c showing the applicability for data independent of that used to build it fig 6d table 3 for all studied models the fit of the models of tdry and twe t was better for the shady conditions than the sunny conditions table 2 and table 3 3 6 generalization to other species we tested the previous models model n 1 and model n 11 on additional data to evaluate the generalization of the models to other hypostomatous species and at other nearby locations fig 7 shows the relationship between measured and modelled tdry and twet for n oleander o europaea p persica q sp and u hybrid frontier for model n 1 model of tdry the overall of rmsep and dp were 2 52 c and 0 96 respectively over values ranging from 12 c and 43 c table 4 which was very close to the 2 59 c rmsep value found for p dulcis table 2 for model n 11 model of twet the overall rmsep and dp were 2 41 c and 0 93 respectively over values ranging from 9 c to 29 c table 4 which was close to the 2 26 c rmsep value found for p dulcis table 3 these results showed the generalization of the linear models to other species and other locations as mentioned previously the fit of the models is better for the shady conditions than the sunny conditions among the other studies species p persica showed the best r2 adj and dp r2 adj 0 9423 and 0 9209 dp 0 9828 and 0 9674 for tdry and twet respectively 3 7 sensitivity analysis of four crop water stress indices cwsis figs 8 a sunlit and 8b shaded show the effect of varying the temperature of the green reference surface trefgreen on four cwsis with tl fixed over the range of 10 to 10 and for the two light conditions the four indices vary significantly p 0 001 fig 8a and 8b in the sun i g was the index most influenced by a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen 129 and cwsi 3 the least influenced index 66 p 0 012 for a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen cwsi 3 was the least influenced index 79 p 0 001 as opposed to 94 94 102 for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 i g respectively fig 8a in the shade i g was also the index most influenced by a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen 358 p 0 047 and cwsi 3 the least influenced index 47 p 0 009 for a variation of 10 of the input trefgreen cwsi 3 was the least influenced index 56 p 0 001 as opposed to 110 for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and i g no significative difference between these three cwsis p 0 89 fig 8b fig 8c shows the results of the sobol sensitivity analysis with the formulas of martinez 2011 for four cwsis with variation of parameters trefgreen and tl sobol s method determines the contribution of each input parameter trefgreen and tl to overall output variance first order sensitivity index and their interactions total order sensitivity index for cwsi 1 and cwsi 2 the results indicate that trefgreen is the most important parameter individually contributing to around 50 of both outputs cwsi and tl contributing to around 48 and 46 of the output respectively in other words most of the variation in these cwsis was due to trefgreen for cwsi 3 the result indicates that tl is the most important parameter individually contributing to around 52 of the output cwsi in other words most of the variation in this cwsi was due to tl on the other hand cwsi 3 presents the biggest difference between the first order sensitivity indices of trefgreen and tl 46 and 52 respectively for cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and cwsi 3 both the first order sensitivity indices and the total order sensitivity indices have similar values which indicates no significant second order interaction between trefgreen and tl i g trefgreen and tl have no main effects first order sensitivity index of i g 0 05 for both parameters however the values of the total order sensitivity indices are close to 1 indicating that the variance of i g was driven mainly by the second order interaction between trefgreen and tl fig 8c as illustrated graphically in fig 8c the ratio between the sensitivity of cwsi to tl and trefgreen is largest for cwsi 3 this means that cwsi 3 is likely to be least sensitive in a relative sense to errors in the estimation of reference temperatures via trefgreen 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet our results indicated a significant effect of the light conditions on tdry and twet and the fit of the model is better for the data recorded in the shade than in the sun which is in agreement with previously reported results ansari and loomis 1959 atkin et al 2000 niesenbaum and kluger 2006 for example dhillon et al 2014 found an analogous result for a multiple linear regression model for leaf temperature as a function of mid day stem water potential and environmental variables in which the r2 was better for shaded leaves than for sunlit leaves they suggested that the influence of factors such as sun angle and leaf orientation were stronger in the case of sunlit leaves as par was found to be significant in all sunlit leaf models other previous studies also indicated that at a low irradiance i e shade the variance in temperature declines to low levels and at the high irradiance i e full sun the variance is amplified by decreasing irradiance within the canopy ngao et al 2017 more diffuse irradiance homogenizes the leaf temperatures because shaded leaves receive proportionally more radiative energy under those conditions woods et al 2018 that could explain the differences observed in the fit of the models in the sun and shade although light has a strong effect on the temperature of the well watered and non transpiring leaves tdry and twet the model that relates the reference temperature to tdry and twet is the same this has important practical implications particularly if the method is applied to a whole tree plant that contains both sunlit and shaded leaves in one image 4 2 effect of the side of the leaf on tdry and twet almond leaves are hypostomatous palasciano et al 2005 i e the stomata are mostly on the lower side of the leaf our results showed that the thermal temperature of the leaf is approximately the same on both sides of the leaf for tdry and twet pallas et al 1967 found that in cotton plants gossypiunt hirsutum l differences in temperature between the upper and lower leaf surfaces could reach 2 c where the upper surface was warmer than the lower when the leaf was well hydrated and the converse was true under drought stress conditions they also reported that the temperature differences between the upper and lower surfaces were only significant under high light conditions the authors attributed these differences to a combination of differential heating due to radiation differential cooling due to radiation and changes in leaf angle mediated by turgor changes however their results could also be explained by radiation error of the thermocouple which has been reported to cause similar magnitude errors bailey et al 2016 combined with varying leaf angle that could change the nature of the radiation error the ability to assume the same temperature for upper and lower faces of the leaf is potentially important for application of thermal imaging in whole plants or canopies because any given view of the vegetation may contain both upper and lower leaf surfaces if as our results suggest differences in leaf temperature between upper and lower leaf faces are small then this eliminates an additional variable that would need to be accounted for when processing the thermal images 4 3 model of tdry and twet to increase ease of use one goal of this work was to determine artificial reference surfaces that could be easily used without any further measurement to estimate tdry and twet and thus make the cwsi approach easier to apply in the field particularly by growers we developed simple models to predict tdry and twet during the growing season based only on the temperature of a green paper reference surface trefgreen under the same conditions as the leaf being examined the proposed models are relatively simple in that they are linear equations with only trefgreen as the independent variable the models were calibrated validated and tested with data recorded under a wide range of air temperature and relative humidity conditions fig 2 although it was not possible to test the model for all possible environmental conditions it was shown to perform well at three different times during the growing season and across six different species it is perhaps surprising the wet reference temperature can be estimated using the temperature of a dry piece of paper because it would seemingly lack the effect of evaporation poirier pocovi and bailey 2020 showed that when in sunlight twet is only weakly dependent on relative humidity as with tdry twet is driven primarily by air temperature and wind speed in direct sunlight since the green reference surface also includes these environmental factors a model based on trefgreen is able to explain most of the variation in twet a common approach for estimating tdry is to assume that tdry is a constant offset above the air temperature e g tdry tair 5 c cohen et al 2005 this approach presents several possible problems several environmental variables such as the light the wind speed or the relative humidity can influence the difference between the surface temperature of the leaf reference and the air temperature indeed if the constant temperature offset approach is applied fig 5g shows that the values of tdry are over estimated in the shade also high variability of tdry was observed for the same value of tair which is not present for the models based on trefgreen some studies such as meron et al 2010 in cotton or garcía tejero et al 2012 in almond trees developed an empirical methodology for canopy temperature extraction using thermal images and air temperature the proposed methodology was based on the separation of the canopy related pixels in the thermal image from those of the soil and other objects by upper and lower thresholds to air temperature our results indicate that it would probably be better to use tref in this step of processing images indeed if tair is used in the upper and lower thresholds a significant amount of interesting data would be deleted during the pixel filtering process fig 5g h less data would be lost with tref fig 5a b furthermore by using temperature measurements from different instruments in the cwsi systematic errors in the temperature measurements will not necessarily cancel such as absolute errors in the thermographic measurement the method proposed in this work requires only slightly more effort to apply than the constant temperature offset method but it also takes into account important environmental variables that influence tdry and twet 4 4 performance of these new models in the estimation of four crop water stress indices for almond trees previous work does not exist in the literature regarding thorough analysis of the sensitivity of cwsis to errors in estimation of tdry and twet reference temperatures our new results suggest that i g is the most sensitive index to the variation of input trefgreen fig 8a b and the output value is influenced by the interaction between trefgreen and tl fig 8c in the definition of this index tdry is only in the numerator and thus its influence is much more important in the other indices tdry is present in the numerator and denominator of the equation cwsi 1 and cwsi 2 or absent altogether cwsi 3 which limits the ultimate influence of tdry on the estimation of the crop water stress index the sensitivity to i g was markedly different from the other three because tl is present in both the numerator and denominator which means that its influence on the cwsi comes in through relative interactions with twet and tdry the sensitivity analysis showed that cwsi 3 was most sensitive to tl out of cwsi 1 cwsi 2 and i g its evolution seems to better reflect the changes of the leaf temperature since the estimation of reference surface temperatures will always incur some error in estimating cwsis we seek a cwsi that has maximum sensitivity to tl which is directly measured and minimum sensitivity to the reference temperature in our case estimated from trefgreen thus based on our sensitivity analysis cwsi 3 appears most suitable because it has both of these characteristics additional experiments are necessary to verify if cwsi 3 can be used to estimate the water needs and manage the irrigation of the almond trees 5 conclusion the present study proposes a methodology for modeling the reference temperatures tdry and twet commonly used in cwsis it was determined that tdry and twet could be related to the temperature of a green piece of paper using simple linear models this approach was developed using almond trees and tested on five other species we also analyzed the sensitivity of these models in the estimation of four cwsis including a new cwsi denoted as cwsi 3 based only on tl and twet a sensitivity analysis indicated that cwsi 3 appeared promising in that it had the highest sensitivity to tl but had the lowest sensitivity to the temperature of the reference paper trefgreen our study is an initial step toward improving the accessibility and adoption of thermography based irrigation management tools by growers by making them easier to use and less expensive additional work is needed to evaluate the performance of the new index cwsi 3 in estimating tree water status and associated irrigation needs and to further evaluate the approach over seasonal time periods there is potential to scale up the approach to the field level using airborne sensing platforms by placing a large green surface of paper in the orchard and using the new models of tdry and twet to define the wet and dry leaf reference surface temperatures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

treatment values of the soil organic carbon was increased 0 8 2 2 folds than the pre treatment values available n p and k content of the post treatment at table tops and gully beds was also significantly increased by 18 3 25 5 5 6 20 9 and 2 6 17 4 respectively overall results highlighted that the sct density of 417 trenches ha 1 was the best conservation practices under horti pastoral land use system however the optimum and economical sct density was found to be 375 trenches ha 1 by optimizing the net profit per unit cost of the system the findings of this study will be helpful to

dendrocalamus strictus 1 introduction agricultural land based needs for human population is shrinking in many parts of the world lambin et al 2013 and pose a serious threat to regional socio ecological balance in india availability of agricultural land has shrunk to 0 12 ha capita i e from 0 34 in 1961 to 0 12 ha in 2015 world bank 2015 over 1 billion hectare of the world s lands is subjected to different kinds of degradation cai et al 2011 gibbs and salmon 2015 land degradation due to ravine is one of the extreme forms of terrain deformation and degradation which makes lands an unproductive and non sustainable pani and carling 2013 ravine infested landscapes are also known in different vernacular name such as lavaba french vossoroca or bocoroea brazilian and arroyo central russia and south west america haigh 1984 the ravine lands significantly affect sustainable food production and hardship to inhabitants of areas across asia africa canada europe and usa gallart et al 2013 ranga et al 2015 degraded lands often considered globally as a solution for land scarcity and food security to meet food fuel and fodder demand for ever rising human population in india ravine lands occupy 2 06 million ha which are commonly developed on deep fertile alluvial soils of major river systems icar naas 2010 these lands are extremely vulnerable to high and intense runoff due to highly undulating topography with steep and multi directional slopes as a consequence it accelerates severe water induced erosion loss of soil fertility poor plant growth and crop productivity and ingress of gullies into adjoining table top lands reduction of environmental land quality and its value unsustainable productivity and farmers income ali et al 2017 moreover these lands have high production potential the conservation and restoration of these lands to an optimum production level with low reclamation cost are inevitable to provide sustainable life support system environmental security and maintaining socio economic balance for local community the productivity of ravine lands would be significantly improved if managed and adopted with cost effective soil and water conservation and management swcm practices the swcm practices usually reduce runoff to the barest minimum and increase the infiltration opportunity time which minimize and avert the problems of ravine lands the swcm practices include bunds check dams trenches micro catchments pits vegetative barriers and plantations on ravine lands singh et al 2012 taye et al 2013 singh et al 2014 the success of the swcm practices on degraded lands has been well documented in literatures chaturvedi et al 2014 mishra et al 2016 the staggered contour trenching sct is one of the swcm practices commonly used under different land use systems lenka et al 2012 in fact many investigators reported that trenching helps to improve quantity and quality of green and blue waters sustained production systems land quality and income reduce runoff and soil and nutrients losses and arrest further degradation and expansion of ravine land into arable lands panigrahi et al 2009 madhu et al 2011 chaturvedi et al 2014 ali et al 2017 furthermore most of the earlier studies lack information on optimum and economical trenching density for a land use system methodology for estimation of trenching density for a given watershed size of the trench and impacts of different trenching densities on various attributes of degraded ravine lands such as improvement in rainfall use efficiency saturated hydraulic conductivity sorptivity soil organic carbon soc available npk and economics this study addressed these issues and bridges the research gaps in the trenching studies thus the present study was conducted for a long term i e 11 years on degraded ravine land based on the paired watershed concept which is hardly applied in degraded ravine lands in many parts of the world including india the hypothesis of this study is that watershed treated with different staggered contour trenches sct would have better attributes and resource conservation of degraded ravine land than that of the watershed without trenches sct therefore study was aimed 1 to investigate effects of three different trenching densities i e 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 coupled with horti pastoral system on various attributes of ravine lands of chambal river basin of india 2 to identify the best sct density by comparing performances of these trenching densities on different attributes of ravine lands and 3 to identify the optimum and economical trenching density utilizing the observed net benefit per unit cost of the horti pastoral system moreover understanding of impacts of different sct densities on various attributes of ravine lands help to develop the best and cost effective practices for reclaiming and managing degraded ravine lands in india as well as in the other parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

physico chemical properties i e soil texture bulk density ph ec soil organic carbon and available npk were given in ali et al 2017 2 3 treatment and management details after the calibration of the mini watersheds the wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds were treated with three sct densities in june 2006 while wc was kept without trench as control the sct densities for the wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds were estimated 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 based on 25 50 and 75 runoff trapping potential of treatment mini watersheds respectively ali et al 2017 the detailed methodology for the estimation of trenching density is given in ali et al 2017 a brief description of methodology for estimating the trenching densities is presented herein ali et al 2017 as 1 n t p r q w a w 10 v t

long 0 45 m wide and 0 45 m deep i e 3 00 0 45 0 45 m the estimated number of trenches are adjusted by the spacing them at regular horizontal interval in the respective watersheds a uniform horti pastoral land use system consisting of phylanthus emblica indian gooseberry dendrocalamus strictus bamboo and cenchrus ciliaris buffel grass was put into practice in the mini watersheds the spacing of phylanthus emblica dendrocalamus strictus and cenchrus ciliaris were also kept uniform as 6 6 m 5 5 m and 0 3 0 3 m respectively and corresponding number of plants were 278 plants ha 1 400 clums ha 1 and 111 111 grass slips ha 1 the details of package of practices of plantations and grass are reported by ali et al 2017 2 4 data collection and analysis 2 4 1 soil sampling and analysis soil samplings for determination of particle size distributions bulk density soc and available npk av npk were conducted before treatment in october 2004 and post treatment in may 2014 three representative soil samples for surface soil 0 15 cm depth were collected from table top and slopes and beds of gullies in each mini watershed the sampling locations of table tops were selected randomly while for gully bed and slope were at their respective top middle and bottom particle size distributions bulk density and available npk were determined using standard methods walkley and black 1934 subbiah and asija 1956 the details of soil sampling and parameters determination methods were given by ali et al 2017 the soc content was determined by adopting wet digestion method of walkley and black 1934 the soc pool was calculated from the organic carbon concentration for each soil depth from the expression lal et al 1998 4 s o c p o o l s o c a w d b d 1000 where socpool soil organic carbon pool mg ha 1

of phylanthus emblica fruit dendrocalamus strictus and cenchrus ciliaris under horti pastoral system were recorded during treatment period 2006 2014 for the estimation of yield of phylanthus emblica fruit yield five plants were selected randomly in a given mini watershed and then harvested all fruits from each plant and weighted the total fruits phylanthus emblica fruits yield was calculated 5 y

phylanthus emblica fruits of the all sampled plants g plant 1 the grass yield was estimated from three representative sites quadrants of 4 m2 2 2 m in each mini watershed the grasses were cut manually at 5 cm height from above ground level the harvested grass was then air dried for a period of 2 weeks and weighed the average yield of air dried grass was calculated for the quadrants and same was converted to per hectare for estimating the yield of dendrocalamus strictus five clumps were selected randomly in a given mini watershed number of culms in each clump was then counted the yield of dendrocalamus strictus culms ha 1 was estimated as the product of total number of clump per hectare in a given mini watershed and an average number of culms clump in that mini watershed the average height and dry weight of dendrocalamus strictus were recorded 5 5 m culm 1 and 0 0075 mg culm 1 respectively the overall productivity of each mini watershed in term of phylanthus emblica equivalent

lands rainfall use efficiency rue was calculated the rue is defined as the ratio of total biomass yield of a land use system to the rainfall over the system bai et al 2008 dardel et al 2014 the concept of the rue is increasingly used to analyze the variability in production potential of a land use system especially in water limiting environments where rainfall is a major limiting factor for plant growth and bio mass production it also helps in identifying the effectiveness of water conservation measures and cropping systems for the assessment of rue in different ecosystems investigators used the mean annual and or seasonal rainfall ruppert et al 2012 dardel et al 2014 in ravine lands there is usually high runoff and severe soil erosion due to complex gully networks soil type and vegetation conditions ali et al 2017 thus in this study we used the effective rainfall concept for the estimation of the rue instead of mean annual seasonal rainfall and hereafter called as effective rainfall use efficiency mathematically effective rainfall use efficiency is defined 7 r u e e y p e e p e where ruee is the effective rainfall use efficiency mg ha 1 mm 1 pe is the effective rainfall mm and ypee is defined earlier the effective rainfall is defined as the part of rainfall that infiltrates into soil and is available to meet consumptive use and recharging the groundwater table the effective rainfall is calculated valher 2013 8 p e p q w where p is the rainfall over the watershed l and qw and pe are the runoff from the watershed and effective rainfall for the corresponding rainfall p respectively rainfall and runoff data were collected after every rain storm from rain gauge and runoff measuring devices respectively the details of measurement rainfall and runoff of this study had given in ali et al 2017 total effective rainfall was obtained as the sum of the all effective rainfall events in the monsoon season the rainfall and runoff events in the mini watersheds were measured june to september for 9 years study period 2006 2014 2 6 saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity of soil the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity are important infiltration parameters of soil these parameters are usually estimated by calibrating infiltration equation with the field infiltration data ali et al 2011 in order to estimate these soil physical parameters infiltration tests were conducted in the mini watersheds before imposing treatment june 2004 and post treatment may 2014 using a double ring infiltrometer infiltration tests were conducted at three randomly selected locations on the ravine table top and along gully beds in all mini watersheds the pooled infiltration test data were fitted to green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911

worked out using three economic assessment techniques namely benefit cost b c ratio net present value npv and payback period pb techniques the b c ratio and npv were calculated pande et al 2012 12 b c r t 1 n b t 1 r t t 1 n c t 1 r t 13 n p v t 1 n b t c t 1 r t where bcr benefit cost ratio npv net present value us bt benefit in a given years us ct cost incurred in a given years us r interest discount rate t project duration as t 1 2 3 n year and n number of years of project the payback period was estimated as time period when cumulative npv becomes positive the considered costs were 1 capital costs as excavation of trenches and pits pits preparation procurement of seedling of phylanthus emblica dendrocalamus strictus and cenchrus ciliaris gap filling 20 mortality in 2nd years and re sodding of grasses in 1 3 area in every five years and 2 operational cost as basin preparation and repairs weeding and hoeing application of fym fertilizer and plant protection measures three times life saving irrigation during first summer season may june 2007 man days for harvesting the yields of horti pastoral system and maintenance man days required for harvesting the cenchrus ciliaris dendrocalamus strictus phylanthus emblica were considered 2 3 and 4 man days ha 1 yr 1 respectively twenty five percent of the good culms of dendrocalamus strictus were considered for harvesting for first four years after starting the harvest and 40 every year thereafter the rate of earth works involved in trenching and pits were taken from the delhi schedules of rate 2016 cpwd 2016 the unit price rate of other cost items as well as selling price was based on the local market rate of the study area during 2016 2 8 optimum and economical trenching density for horti pastoral system an effort was also made to find the optimum and economical trenching density for the system by utilizing the long term field experiment data the optimum and economical trenching density is hereby defined as trenching density for that the net benefit per unit cost of the system is maximum for this study the objective function of the optimization of the net benefit per unit cost of the horti pastoral system subject to trenching density constraint 0 n 556 and decision variable n is defined as 14 max n t y n t where y nt is the net benefit per unit cost for the system nt is the trenching density trenches ha 1 as defined previously and numerical values 0 and 556 are the limits of trenching density derived from the eq 3 at 0 and 100 runoff trapping potential respectively in this study the best fitted non linear regression nlr model for the net benefit per unit cost of the system was developed using two step nonlinear curve fitting approach ali and islam 2018 as described below an approximate the best fitted nlr model was first derived using the least square technique by considering the net benefit per unit cost of the system as dependent variable and productive age of the horti pastoral system and the trenching densities of the treatments as independent variables which defined 15 y a p n t a p n t where y ap nt is the net benefit per unit cost of the system which is a function of the ap and nt ap is the productive age of the horti pastoral system year and nt is defined previously the productive age was considered as the years of horti pastoral system that started giving substantial net benefit from the system in this study 4th 2009 to 9th 2014 year after the treatment was considered as the productive ages of the system the treatment trenching densities were 0 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 for the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 treatment mini watersheds respectively the next nlr model between the predicted net benefit per unit cost and trenching density was also modeled by curve fitting technique using the predicted values of the net benefit per unit cost across the productive years at the different trenching density 0 n 556 using first approximate nlr model eq 15 the final best fitted net benefit per unit cost production model for the best fitted curve was defined 16 y n t n t where y nt is the net benefit per unit cost across the productive ages which is a function of nt 2 9 statistical analyses the all recorded data sets were analysed for descriptive statistic as minimum maximum mean and standard deviation the significant differences among the means are calculated using paired t test the f test was used to check the variability in data sets sigmaplot 10 software package systat 2006 was used to determine the all statistical tests all tests were performed at 1 significant level p 0 01 the optimum and economical trenching density of the derived optimization net benefit per unit cost prediction model was obtained using the ampl non linear programming software fourer et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of staggered trench densities on yield response of horti pastoral system the yield of cenchrus ciliaris phylanthus emblica fruits and dendrocalamus strictus started in 1st 3rd and 5th years after plantation respectively in all mini watersheds fig 1 a c however productive yield of phylanthus emblica started after 4th years of plantation fig 1 a the highest yield of cenchrus ciliaris and dendrocalamus strictus were recorded in 4th and 7th years respectively after planting in all mini watersheds except for control mini watershed for dendrocalamu strictus yield fig 1 b c however yield of phylanthus emblica was still progressive even after 9th years of plantation the grass yield was reduced substantially in 2012 as it crossed its productive age i e 4th year the highest phylanthus emblica equivalent yield was recorded in 2013 which is due to the higher yields of the phylanthus emblica fruit and dendrocalamus strictus fig 1 d the mean annual yields of phylanthus emblica in the wc no trench wt1 139 trenches ha 1 wt2 278 trenches ha 1 and wt3 417 trenches ha 1 mini watersheds were worked out 2 5 2 8 3 8 and 5 7 mg ha 1 respectively while cenchrus ciliaris yield was respectively 6 7 7 3 8 1 and 8 6 mg ha 1 respectively table 1 the dendrocalamus strictus yield was of 5480 6440 7420 and 10 240 culm ha 1 in the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds respectively however overall productivity of the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds in term of mean phylanthus emblica equivalent yields was of 124 0 145 5 168 0 and 231 5 mg ha 1 respectively table 1 the yields of horti pastoral system in mini watersheds with different sct densities varied distinctly during the study years fig 2 a d this year to year variation was mainly ascribed due to yielding potential of the horti pastoral system and climatic variability in that year and some inherent property of the mini watershed however deviations in yield among the treatment mini watersheds were attributed owing to the influences of different trenching densities analyses of variance of the yields of horti pastoral system are presented in box plot graph fig 2 a d the paired t test indicated that the sct densities significantly p 0 01 affected mean yields over control table 2 it was also found that yields differed significantly among the sct densities p 0 01 except the yield of dendrocalamus strictus and phylanthus emblica equivalent yields between wt1 and wt2 the variability in yields among mini watersheds do not differ significantly p 0 01 as indicated by f test table 2 the increase in yields of horti pastoral system during the treatment periods also varied from one year to another year fig 3 a d the highest increase in mean yield of the phylanthus emblica fruits 126 3 cenchrus ciliaris 28 9 and dendrocalamus strictus 86 9 were observed in wt3 followed by wt2 50 0 phylanthus emblica 21 9 cenchrus ciliaris and 35 4 dendrocalamus strictus over wc mini watershed the lowest increase was recorded in the wt1 over the wc mini watershed i e 11 4 phylanthus emblica 10 3 cenchrus ciliaris and 17 5 dendrocalamus strictus a similar trend was also recorded for increase in overall productivity of ravine lands in term of mean phylanthus emblica equivalent yields as wt3 84 4 wt2 34 9 wt1 16 4 fig 3 a d the highest increase of horti pastoral system yield was in the wt3 which was mainly due to retention of more rainfall in trenches 417 trenches ha 1 compare to the 278 wt2 and 139 trenches ha 1 wt1 some studies reported yields of horti pastoral system with or without conservation measures on degraded lands singh et al 2012 2014 pande et al 2012 found that the yield of dendrocalamus strictus in degraded lands of mahi and yamuna rivers of india ranged between 1200 and 1600 culm ha 1 yr 1 which was little lower than that of the present study results das et al 2011 reported the yield of phylanthus emblica in rainfed degraded calciorthent lands in india was of 7 18 mg ha 1 the yield of dry matter of cenchrus ciliaris ranged from 6 0 to 11 4 mg ha 1 patidar and rajora 2009 3 2 effect of staggered trench densities on effective rainfall use efficiency the sct densities in combination with horti pastoral system had noticeable influence on the runoff effective rainfall and effective rainfall use efficiency ruee fig 4 shows an overview of characteristic behavior of the effective rainfall in control and treated watersheds during the calibration periods the runoff reduction in treated mini watersheds was considerably higher compared to the control mini watershed wc however effective rainfall and ruee of the treated mini watersheds were increased over the control mini watershed table 3 the average monsoon season s rainfall was 708 2 mm which ranged from 392 9 to 1054 0 mm the mean monsoon season s measured runoff and estimated effective rainfall in the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watershed during treatment periods 2006 14 were 120 1 and 565 8 84 9 and 593 4 51 6 and 621 3 and 23 2 and 644 3 mm respectively table 3 the estimated ruee for wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds varied from 0 0023 to 0 0789 0 0024 to 0 0843 and 0 0026 to 0 1183 mg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 3 however in case of wc ruee ranged between 0 0022 and 0 0779 mg ha 1 mm 1 the ruee of the treated mini watersheds was found to be low in initial years of the treatment 2006 08 the low ruee was possibly ascribed to high runoff and no and or very little yields of horti pastoral system as grass and plantations were on their initial stages of establishment during third and fourth years of experimentation as the grass and tree plantation had better establishment helped in reducing runoff and increasing yield of horti pastoral system consequently high ruee table 3 fig 5 shows the variance of the ruee during treatment periods the mean ruee in control and treated watersheds differed significantly p 0 01 table 4 however the ruee between treatments also differs statistically from each other the variability in ruee among watersheds do not differ significantly p 0 01 it was recorded that improvement in the ruee of the treated mini watersheds varied from one year to another year fig 6 the highest 53 4 increase in the mean ruee was found in the wt3 417 trenches ha 1 over wc no trench followed by the wt2 19 2 with 278 trenches ha 1 table 5 the lowest increase was recorded in wt1 139 trenches ha 1 over the wc the highest ruee in the wt1 and wt2 over control was recorded in 2014 and 2013 respectively however wt3 mini watershed recorded the highest ruee in 2009 fig 6 this was mainly due to the lower effective rainfall in the respective years over the treated mini watersheds many investigators reported increase in soil moisture under trenching madhu et al 2011 subudhi 2013 however fewer studies examined the ruee of different sct densities under horti pastoral system in ravine lands panigrahi et al 2009 reported that the sct increased soil moisture availability in root zone of citrus reticulate blanco under degraded land by 23 4 26 9 similarly patode et al 2015 have recorded increase in groundwater recharge through trenching in annona squamosa and annona atemoya plantations by 38 6 and 33 9 respectively the increase in soil moisture availability and groundwater recharge was mainly due to conservation of more rainfall in the trenches 3 3 effect of staggered trench densities on saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity mean values of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat at ravine table tops and gully beds for control and treated mini watersheds during pre treatment were ranged from 4 46 to 5 90 mm h 1 and 6 31 to 7 19 mm h 1 respectively while sorptivity s varied respectively from 40 39 46 10 mm h 0 5 to 43 08 to 45 17 mm h 0 5 table 6 however corresponding post treatment values of ksat and s for all mini watersheds increased many folds compared to pre treatment values table 6 the increase in ksat in treated mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds ranged from 1 6 to 2 4 and 2 3 to 2 6 times higher than that of the pre treatment values respectively corresponding increase in the s varied from 1 3 to 1 6 and 1 5 to 1 6 times respectively the higher values of ksat and s are interpreted as a result of sufficient leaf litter cover organic inputs root growth and decomposition of organic residues and abundant burrowing fauna in horti pastoral system under both control and treated watersheds the gully beds demonstrated higher ksat and s values than table tops in watersheds table 6 which was ascribed to the retention of more organic matters from table top and gully slopes by runoff which results in improved porosity and decreased bulk density of gully bed soils however it was found that there was no significant difference in ksat and s values among treated mini watersheds there are several studies addressing effect of land uses such as conservation structures forest pasture lawn and agriculture on ksat zimmermann et al 2006 ali et al 2011 while fewer studies examined for ravine lands agnihotri and yadav 1995 ali et al 2017 agnihotri and yadav 1995 found almost same order magnitude of ksat at near surface 0 15 cm depth in coarse textured yamuna ravine beds 124 mm h 1 forest 133 mm h 1 and agricultural 112 mm h 1 land use systems 3 4 effect of staggered trench densities on soil organic carbon and available nutrients the soils of ravine lands before imposing treatment in 2006 were low in soc content and av k and had medium status in av n and av p as reported by ali et al 2017 the post treatment i e in 2014 values of the soc in both the control and treated mini watersheds at the table tops and slopes and beds of gully ranged from 12 90 to 18 43 13 23 to 19 66 and 14 80 to 24 43 mg ha 1 respectively table 7 which was 0 8 0 9 1 0 2 2 and 1 1 1 6 times higher than the pre treatment values respectively table 7 the av npk values of the post treatment in the mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds were significantly increased by trenching densities under horti pastoral land use systems and decreased at gully slopes table 7 the increase in av n values in treated mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds was varied from18 3 to 25 5 and 22 5 to 23 4 and av p increased from 5 6 to 20 9 and 6 9 to 11 1 for the table tops and gully beds of treated mini watersheds respectively in gully slopes av npk values decreased in across all mini watersheds except the wt2 mini watershed the higher values of the soc and av npk at gully bed could be ascribed to accumulation of leaf litter of dendrocalamus strictus and transported biomass of phylanthus emblicaas well as cenchrus ciliaris and nutrients through runoff from table tops and gully slopes which caused enrichment of gully beds variation in the soc under different land uses systems has also been reported in many earlier studies haung et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the most of the earlier field studies specially in india panigrahi et al 2009 madhu et al 2011 were mainly focused on the runoff soil and nutrients losses and yields of different land use systems under trenching research and lack the information on the status of the soc and available npk at the post implementation of the sct the findings of this study would be helpful in maintaining the sustainable land use systems under different trenching densities 3 5 economic evaluation of different management practices the total cost and gross income during study periods ranged from 35 wc to 42 wt3 us ha 1 and 77 wc

ecological balance in india availability of agricultural land has shrunk to 0 12 ha capita i e from 0 34 in 1961 to 0 12 ha in 2015 world bank 2015 over 1 billion hectare of the world s lands is subjected to different kinds of degradation cai et al 2011 gibbs and salmon 2015 land degradation due to ravine is one of the extreme forms of terrain deformation and degradation which makes lands an unproductive and non sustainable pani and carling 2013 ravine infested landscapes are also known in different vernacular name such as lavaba french vossoroca or bocoroea brazilian and arroyo central russia and south west america haigh 1984 the ravine lands significantly affect sustainable food production and hardship to inhabitants of areas across asia africa canada europe and usa gallart et al 2013 ranga et al 2015 degraded lands often considered globally as a solution for land scarcity and food security to meet food fuel and fodder demand for ever rising human population in india ravine lands occupy 2 06 million ha which are commonly developed on deep fertile alluvial soils of major river systems icar naas 2010 these lands are extremely vulnerable to high and intense runoff due to highly undulating topography with steep and multi directional slopes as a consequence it accelerates severe water induced erosion loss of soil fertility poor plant growth and crop productivity and ingress of gullies into adjoining table top lands reduction of environmental land quality and its value unsustainable productivity and farmers income ali et al 2017 moreover these lands have high production potential the conservation and restoration of these lands to an optimum production level with low reclamation cost are inevitable to provide sustainable life support system environmental security and maintaining socio economic balance for local community the productivity of ravine lands would be significantly improved if managed and adopted with cost effective soil and water conservation and management swcm practices the swcm practices usually reduce runoff to the barest minimum and increase the infiltration opportunity time which minimize and avert the problems of ravine lands the swcm practices include bunds check dams trenches micro catchments pits vegetative barriers and plantations on ravine lands singh et al 2012 taye et al 2013 singh et al 2014 the success of the swcm practices on degraded lands has been well documented in literatures chaturvedi et al 2014 mishra et al 2016 the staggered contour trenching sct is one of the swcm practices commonly used under different land use systems lenka et al 2012 in fact many investigators reported that trenching helps to improve quantity and quality of green and blue waters sustained production systems land quality and income reduce runoff and soil and nutrients losses and arrest further degradation and expansion of ravine land into arable lands panigrahi et al 2009 madhu et al 2011 chaturvedi et al 2014 ali et al 2017 furthermore most of the earlier studies lack information on optimum and economical trenching density for a land use system methodology for estimation of trenching density for a given watershed size of the trench and impacts of different trenching densities on various attributes of degraded ravine lands such as improvement in rainfall use efficiency saturated hydraulic conductivity sorptivity soil organic carbon soc available npk and economics this study addressed these issues and bridges the research gaps in the trenching studies thus the present study was conducted for a long term i e 11 years on degraded ravine land based on the paired watershed concept which is hardly applied in degraded ravine lands in many parts of the world including india the hypothesis of this study is that watershed treated with different staggered contour trenches sct would have better attributes and resource conservation of degraded ravine land than that of the watershed without trenches sct therefore study was aimed 1 to investigate effects of three different trenching densities i e 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 coupled with horti pastoral system on various attributes of ravine lands of chambal river basin of india 2 to identify the best sct density by comparing performances of these trenching densities on different attributes of ravine lands and 3 to identify the optimum and economical trenching density utilizing the observed net benefit per unit cost of the horti pastoral system moreover understanding of impacts of different sct densities on various attributes of ravine lands help to develop the best and cost effective practices for reclaiming and managing degraded ravine lands in india as well as in the other parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

samplings for determination of particle size distributions bulk density soc and available npk av npk were conducted before treatment in october 2004 and post treatment in may 2014 three representative soil samples for surface soil 0 15 cm depth were collected from table top and slopes and beds of gullies in each mini watershed the sampling locations of table tops were selected randomly while for gully bed and slope were at their respective top middle and bottom particle size distributions bulk density and available npk were determined using standard methods walkley and black 1934 subbiah and asija 1956 the details of soil sampling and parameters determination methods were given by ali et al 2017 the soc content was determined by adopting wet digestion method of walkley and black 1934 the

of phylanthus emblica fruit dendrocalamus strictus and cenchrus ciliaris under horti pastoral system were recorded during treatment period 2006 2014 for the estimation of yield of phylanthus emblica fruit yield five plants were selected randomly in a given mini watershed and then harvested all fruits from each plant and weighted the total fruits phylanthus emblica fruits yield was calculated 5 y

at 5 cm height from above ground level the harvested grass was then air dried for a period of 2 weeks and weighed the average yield of air dried grass was calculated for the quadrants and same was converted to per hectare for estimating the yield of dendrocalamus strictus five clumps were selected randomly in a given mini watershed number of culms in each clump was then counted the yield of

lands rainfall use efficiency rue was calculated the rue is defined as the ratio of total biomass yield of a land use system to the rainfall over the system bai et al 2008 dardel et al 2014 the concept of the rue is increasingly used to analyze the variability in production potential of a land use system especially in water limiting environments where rainfall is a major limiting factor for plant growth and bio mass production it also helps in identifying the effectiveness of water conservation measures and cropping systems for the assessment of rue in different ecosystems investigators used the mean annual and or seasonal rainfall ruppert et al 2012 dardel et al 2014 in ravine lands there is usually high runoff and severe soil erosion due to complex gully networks soil type and vegetation conditions ali et al 2017 thus in this study we used the effective rainfall concept for the estimation of the rue instead of mean annual seasonal rainfall and hereafter called as effective rainfall use efficiency mathematically effective rainfall use efficiency is defined 7 r u e e y p e e p e where ruee is the effective rainfall use efficiency mg ha 1 mm 1 pe is the effective rainfall mm and ypee is defined earlier the effective rainfall is defined as the part of rainfall that infiltrates into soil and is available to meet consumptive use and recharging the groundwater table the effective rainfall is calculated valher 2013 8 p e p q w where p is the rainfall over the watershed l and qw and pe are the runoff from the watershed and effective rainfall for the corresponding rainfall p respectively rainfall and runoff data were collected after every rain storm from rain gauge and runoff measuring devices respectively the details of measurement rainfall and runoff of this study had given in ali et al 2017 total effective rainfall was obtained as the sum of the all effective rainfall events in the monsoon season the rainfall and runoff events in the mini watersheds were measured june to september for 9 years study period 2006 2014 2 6 saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity of soil the saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity are important infiltration parameters of soil these parameters are usually estimated by calibrating infiltration equation with the field infiltration data ali et al 2011 in order to estimate these soil physical parameters infiltration tests were conducted in the mini watersheds before imposing treatment june 2004 and post treatment may 2014 using a double ring infiltrometer infiltration tests were conducted at three randomly selected locations on the ravine table top and along gully beds in all mini watersheds the pooled infiltration test data were fitted to green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911

worked out using three economic assessment techniques namely benefit cost b c ratio net present value npv and payback period pb techniques the b c ratio and npv were calculated pande et al 2012 12 b c r t 1 n b t 1 r t t 1 n c t 1 r t 13 n p v t 1 n b t c t 1 r t where bcr benefit cost ratio npv net present value us bt benefit in a given years us ct cost incurred in a given years us r interest discount rate t project duration as t 1 2 3 n year and n number of years of project the payback period was estimated as time period when cumulative npv becomes positive the considered costs were 1 capital costs as excavation of trenches and pits pits preparation procurement of seedling of phylanthus emblica dendrocalamus strictus and cenchrus ciliaris gap filling 20 mortality in 2nd years and re sodding of grasses in 1 3 area in every five years and 2 operational cost as basin preparation and repairs weeding and hoeing application of fym fertilizer and plant protection measures three times life saving irrigation during first summer season may june 2007 man days for harvesting the yields of horti pastoral system and maintenance man days required for harvesting the cenchrus ciliaris dendrocalamus strictus phylanthus emblica were considered 2 3 and 4 man days ha 1 yr 1 respectively twenty five percent of the good culms of dendrocalamus strictus were considered for harvesting for first four years after starting the harvest and 40 every year thereafter the rate of earth works involved in trenching and pits were taken from the delhi schedules of rate 2016 cpwd 2016 the unit price rate of other cost items as well as selling price was based on the local market rate of the study area during 2016 2 8 optimum and economical trenching density for horti pastoral system an effort was also made to find the optimum and economical trenching density for the system by utilizing the long term field experiment data the optimum and economical trenching density is hereby defined as trenching density for that the net benefit per unit cost of the system is maximum for this study the objective function of the optimization of the net benefit per unit cost of the horti pastoral system subject to trenching density constraint 0 n 556 and decision variable n is defined as 14 max n t y n t where y nt is the net benefit per unit cost for the system nt is the trenching density trenches ha 1 as defined previously and numerical values 0 and 556 are the limits of trenching density derived from the eq 3 at 0 and 100 runoff trapping potential respectively in this study the best fitted non linear regression nlr model for the net benefit per unit cost of the system was developed using two step nonlinear curve fitting approach ali and islam 2018 as described below an approximate the best fitted nlr model was first derived using the least square technique by considering the net benefit per unit cost of the system as dependent variable and productive age of the horti pastoral system and the trenching densities of the treatments as independent variables which defined 15 y a p n t a p n t where y ap nt is the net benefit per unit cost of the system which is a function of the ap and nt ap is the productive age of the horti pastoral system year and nt is defined previously the productive age was considered as the years of horti pastoral system that started giving substantial net benefit from the system in this study 4th 2009 to 9th 2014 year after the treatment was considered as the productive ages of the system the treatment trenching densities were 0 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 for the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 treatment mini watersheds respectively the next nlr model between the predicted net benefit per unit cost and trenching density was also modeled by curve fitting technique using the predicted values of the net benefit per unit cost across the productive years at the different trenching density 0 n 556 using first approximate nlr model eq 15 the final best fitted net benefit per unit cost production model for the best fitted curve was defined 16 y n t n t where y nt is the net benefit per unit cost across the productive ages which is a function of nt 2 9 statistical analyses the all recorded data sets were analysed for descriptive statistic as minimum maximum mean and standard deviation the significant differences among the means are calculated using paired t test the f test was used to check the variability in data sets sigmaplot 10 software package systat 2006 was used to determine the all statistical tests all tests were performed at 1 significant level p 0 01 the optimum and economical trenching density of the derived optimization net benefit per unit cost prediction model was obtained using the ampl non linear programming software fourer et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of staggered trench densities on yield response of horti pastoral system the yield of cenchrus ciliaris phylanthus emblica

watershed for dendrocalamu strictus yield fig 1 b c however yield of phylanthus emblica was still progressive even after 9th years of plantation the grass yield was reduced substantially in 2012 as it crossed its productive age i e 4th year the highest phylanthus emblica equivalent yield was recorded in 2013 which is due to the higher yields of the phylanthus emblica fruit and dendrocalamus strictus fig 1 d the mean annual yields of phylanthus emblica in the wc no trench wt1 139 trenches ha 1 wt2 278 trenches ha 1 and wt3 417 trenches ha 1 mini watersheds were worked out 2 5 2 8 3 8 and

the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds respectively however overall productivity of the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds in term of mean phylanthus emblica equivalent yields was of 124 0 145 5 168 0 and 231 5 mg ha 1 respectively table 1 the yields of horti pastoral system in mini watersheds with different sct densities varied distinctly during the study years fig 2 a d this year to year variation was mainly ascribed due to yielding potential of the horti pastoral system and climatic variability in that year and some inherent property of the mini watershed however deviations in yield among the treatment mini watersheds were attributed owing to the influences of different trenching densities analyses of variance of the yields of horti pastoral system are presented in box plot graph fig 2 a d the paired t test indicated that the sct densities significantly p 0 01 affected mean yields over control table 2 it was also found that yields differed significantly among the sct densities p 0 01 except the yield of dendrocalamus strictus and phylanthus emblica equivalent yields between wt1 and wt2 the variability in yields among mini watersheds do not differ significantly p 0 01 as indicated by f test table 2 the increase in yields of horti pastoral system during the treatment periods also varied from one year to another year fig 3 a d the highest increase in mean yield of the phylanthus emblica fruits 126 3 cenchrus ciliaris 28 9 and dendrocalamus strictus 86 9 were observed in wt3 followed by wt2 50 0 phylanthus emblica 21 9 cenchrus ciliaris and 35 4 dendrocalamus strictus over wc mini watershed the lowest increase was recorded in the wt1 over the wc mini watershed i e 11 4 phylanthus emblica 10 3 cenchrus ciliaris and 17 5 dendrocalamus strictus a similar trend was also recorded for increase in overall productivity of ravine lands in term of mean phylanthus emblica equivalent yields as wt3 84 4 wt2 34 9 wt1 16 4 fig 3 a d the highest increase of horti pastoral system yield was in the wt3 which was mainly due to retention of more rainfall in trenches 417 trenches ha 1 compare to the 278 wt2 and 139 trenches ha 1 wt1 some studies reported yields of horti pastoral system with or without conservation measures on degraded lands singh et al 2012 2014 pande et al 2012 found that the yield of dendrocalamus strictus in degraded lands of mahi and yamuna rivers of india ranged between 1200 and 1600 culm ha 1 yr 1 which was little lower than that of the present study results das et al 2011 reported the yield of phylanthus emblica in rainfed degraded calciorthent lands in india was of 7 18 mg ha 1 the yield of dry matter of cenchrus ciliaris ranged from 6 0 to 11 4 mg ha 1 patidar and rajora 2009 3 2 effect of staggered trench densities on effective rainfall use efficiency the sct densities in combination with horti pastoral system had noticeable influence on the runoff effective rainfall and effective rainfall use efficiency ruee fig 4 shows an overview of characteristic behavior of the effective rainfall in control and treated watersheds during the calibration periods the runoff reduction in treated mini watersheds was considerably higher compared to the control mini watershed wc however effective rainfall and ruee of the treated mini watersheds were increased over the control mini watershed table 3 the average monsoon season s rainfall was 708 2 mm which ranged from 392 9 to 1054 0 mm the mean monsoon season s measured runoff and estimated effective rainfall in the wc wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watershed during treatment periods 2006 14 were 120 1 and 565 8 84 9 and 593 4 51 6 and 621 3 and 23 2 and 644 3 mm respectively table 3 the estimated ruee for wt1 wt2 and wt3 mini watersheds varied from 0 0023 to 0 0789 0 0024 to 0 0843 and 0 0026 to 0 1183 mg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 3 however in case of wc ruee ranged between 0 0022 and 0 0779 mg ha 1 mm 1 the ruee of the treated mini watersheds was found to be low in initial years of the treatment 2006 08 the low ruee was possibly ascribed to high runoff and no and or very little yields of horti pastoral system as grass and plantations were on their initial stages of establishment during third and fourth years of experimentation as the grass and tree plantation had better establishment helped in reducing runoff and increasing yield of horti pastoral system consequently high ruee table 3 fig 5 shows the variance of the ruee during treatment periods the mean ruee in control and treated watersheds differed significantly p 0 01 table 4 however the ruee between treatments also differs statistically from each other the variability in ruee among watersheds do not differ significantly p 0 01 it was recorded that improvement in the ruee of the treated mini watersheds varied from one year to another year fig 6 the highest 53 4 increase in the mean ruee was found in the wt3 417 trenches ha 1 over wc no trench followed by the wt2 19 2 with 278 trenches ha 1 table 5 the lowest increase was recorded in wt1 139 trenches ha 1 over the wc the highest ruee in the wt1 and wt2 over control was recorded in 2014 and 2013 respectively however wt3 mini watershed recorded the highest ruee in 2009 fig 6 this was mainly due to the lower effective rainfall in the respective years over the treated mini watersheds many investigators reported increase in soil moisture under trenching madhu et al 2011 subudhi 2013 however fewer studies examined the ruee of different sct densities under horti pastoral system in ravine lands panigrahi et al 2009 reported that the sct increased soil moisture availability in root zone of citrus reticulate blanco under degraded land by 23 4 26 9 similarly patode et al 2015 have recorded increase in groundwater recharge through trenching in annona squamosa and annona atemoya plantations by 38 6 and 33 9 respectively the increase in soil moisture availability and groundwater recharge was mainly due to conservation of more rainfall in the trenches 3 3 effect of staggered trench densities on saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity mean values of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat at ravine table tops and gully beds for control and treated mini watersheds during pre treatment were ranged from 4 46 to 5 90 mm h 1 and 6 31 to 7 19 mm h 1 respectively while sorptivity s varied respectively from 40 39 46 10 mm h 0 5 to 43 08 to 45 17 mm h 0 5 table 6 however corresponding post treatment values of ksat and s for all mini watersheds increased many folds compared to pre treatment values table 6 the increase in ksat in treated mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds ranged from 1 6 to 2 4 and 2 3 to 2 6 times higher than that of the pre treatment values respectively corresponding increase in the s varied from 1 3 to 1 6 and 1 5 to 1 6 times respectively the higher values of ksat and s are interpreted as a result of sufficient leaf litter cover organic inputs root growth and decomposition of organic residues and abundant burrowing fauna in horti pastoral system under both control and treated watersheds the gully beds demonstrated higher ksat and s values than table tops in watersheds table 6 which was ascribed to the retention of more organic matters from table top and gully slopes by runoff which results in improved porosity and decreased bulk density of gully bed soils however it was found that there was no significant difference in ksat and s values among treated mini watersheds there are several studies addressing effect of land uses such as conservation structures forest pasture lawn and agriculture on ksat zimmermann et al 2006 ali et al 2011 while fewer studies examined for ravine lands agnihotri and yadav 1995 ali et al 2017 agnihotri and yadav 1995 found almost same order magnitude of ksat at near surface 0 15 cm depth in coarse textured yamuna ravine beds 124 mm h 1 forest 133 mm h 1 and agricultural 112 mm h 1 land use systems 3 4 effect of staggered trench densities on soil organic carbon and available nutrients the soils of ravine lands before imposing treatment in 2006 were low in soc content and av k and had medium status in av n and av p as reported by ali et al 2017 the post treatment i e in 2014 values of the soc in both the control and treated mini watersheds at the table tops and slopes and beds of gully ranged from 12 90 to 18 43 13 23 to 19 66 and 14 80 to 24 43 mg ha 1 respectively table 7 which was 0 8 0 9 1 0 2 2 and 1 1 1 6 times higher than the pre treatment values respectively table 7 the av npk values of the post treatment in the mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds were significantly increased by trenching densities under horti pastoral land use systems and decreased at gully slopes table 7 the increase in av n values in treated mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds was varied from18 3 to 25 5 and 22 5 to 23 4 and av p increased from 5 6 to 20 9 and 6 9 to 11 1 for the table tops and gully beds of treated mini watersheds respectively in gully slopes av npk values decreased in across all mini watersheds except the wt2 mini watershed the higher values of the soc and av npk at gully bed could be ascribed to accumulation of leaf litter of dendrocalamus strictus and transported biomass of phylanthus emblicaas well as cenchrus ciliaris and nutrients through runoff from table tops and gully slopes which caused enrichment of gully beds variation in the soc under different land uses systems has also been reported in many earlier studies haung et al 2015 xu et al 2015 the most of the earlier field studies specially in india panigrahi et al 2009 madhu et al 2011 were mainly focused on the runoff soil and nutrients losses and yields of different land use systems under trenching research and lack the information on the status of the soc and available npk at the post implementation of the sct the findings of this study would be helpful in maintaining the sustainable land use systems under different trenching densities 3 5 economic evaluation of different management practices the total cost and gross income during study periods ranged from 35 wc to 42 wt3 us ha 1 and 77 wc to171 wt3 us ha 1 respectively table 8 the payback period was found to be vary between 5 wt2 and wt3 and 7 wc years the net present value npv varied from us 1145 wc to 4575 ha 1 wt3 table 8 the b c ratio revealed that the wt3 mini watershed gave the best return with b c ratio of 3 05 followed by the wt2 2 53 and wt1 2 22 and the least was for the wc 1 59 similar results were also reported in earlier studies by the investigators madhu et al 2011 pande et al 2012 rejani and yadukumar 2010 reported the b c ratio ranged from 2 86 1 to 3 62 1 for the different conservation measures under cashew plantations on degraded steep slopes in puttur karnataka india similarly the b c ratio of 1 85 1 and 1 86 1 for the dendrocalamus strictus without conservation practice in the ravine lands of mahi and yamuna rivers was reported by pande et al 2012 3 6 optimum and economical trenching density of horti pastoral system making the use of the observed values of the net benefit per unit cost for the horti pastoral land use system at different productive ages 4 9 year and trenching densities 0 139 278 and 417 trenches ha 1 first approximate best fitted non linear regression nlr model was developed of the three conceived nlr models i e power exponential polynomial second order polynomial nlr model was found to be the best fitted model as 17 y a p n t 0 444 a p 0 012 a p 2 0 032 n t 0 000043 n t 2 1 709 the first approximate best fitted nlr model had moderate value of the coefficient of determination r2 0 5463 and slightly higher value of standard error of estimate se 2 63 the next approximation was also modeled by curve fitting technique using the derived curves for the predicted net benefit per unit cost across the productive ages 4 9 years versus trenching densities 0 556 trenches ha 1 fig 7 the values of the predicted net benefit per unit cost across the productive ages 4 9 years at trenching densities 0 556 trenches ha 1 were computed using the first approximate nlr model eq 17 the values of the predicted net benefit per unit cost across the productive ages at different trenching densities first increases monotonically as trench density increases and reached at a maximum at certain trenching density after attaining a maximum net benefit per unit cost decreases as at trench density increases up to maximum limit of trenching density 556 trenches ha 1 fig 7 the best derived final nlr model for the best fitted curve using the nonlinear curve fitting was 5 y n 1288 90 exp 0 5 n 374 45 3867 68 2 1280 88 the best fitted model showed the high value of the f test compare to the critical values fcal ftable signified that the final nlr prediction model was highly significant at the probability level p 0 0001 the higher value of the decision variables as r2 0 8034 and lower value of the standard error of estimate se 0 87 suggested the better prediction model this validated that final derived net benefit per unit cost prediction model was useful for deriving the optimum and economical trenching density the optimum and economical trenching can be obtained from the best fitted curve fig 7 as the trenching density corresponding to which net benefit per unit cost is maximum however in this study the optimum and economical trenching density was obtained by maximizing the objective function of the net benefit per unit cost of the system using derived prediction model as 18 max n 1288 90 exp 0 5 n 374 45 3867 68 2 1280 88 the optimum and economical trenching density from the net benefit per unit cost optimization model eq 18 subject to trenching density constraint 0 n 556 trenches ha 1 and decision variable n was worked out to be 375 trenches ha 1 using the ampl non linear programming software result of analysis showed the optimum and economical sct density 375 trenches ha 1 is nearly 11 lower that of the hypothesized maximum trenching density 417 trenches ha 1 for the horti pastoral land use system in the ravine land of india 4 conclusions we investigated the long term impacts of staggered contour trenching sct densities coupled with horti pastoral system on yields rainfall use efficiency saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat sorptivity s available npk av npk soil organic carbon soc economics and optimum and economical trenching density under degraded ravine lands in chambal river of india four small ravine mini watersheds were treated with different sct densities and designated as wc no trench wt1 139 trenches ha 1 wt2 278 trenches ha 1 and wt3 417 trenches ha 1 we found that the sct with trenching density of 417 trenches ha 1 was the best in various hydrological and yield attributes of the horti pastoral land use system of the degraded ravine land followed by the trenching density of 278 and 139 trenches ha 1 the improvement in the yields of phylanthus emblica cenchrus ciliaris grass and dendrocalamus strictus for the best identified trenching density 417 trenches ha 1 was 126 3 28 9 and 86 9 over the no trench respectively it was also recorded that trenching density of 417 trenches ha 1 improved mean ruee by 53 4 over control the post treatment values of ksat and the s at table tops and gully beds of the in watersheds with trenching density of 417 trenches ha 1 was significantly improved compared control mini watershed the av npk values of post treatment in mini watersheds at table tops and gully beds were significantly increased with trenching densities and decreased at gully slopes results indicated that soc content significantly improved in mini watershed with trenching density of 417 trenches ha 1 at table tops gully slopes and gully beds it is also evident from benefit cost analysis that the trenching density of 417 trenches ha 1 gave the best return with b c ratio of 3 05 the result of analysis indicated that the sct density with 417 trenches ha 1 under horti pastoral land use system appeared to be very effective compare to the other sct densities i e 278 and 139 trenches ha 1 in term of improving yields of the horti pastoral land use system ruee soc and av npk however the optimum and economical trenching density for the horti pastoral was found to be 375 trenches ha 1 which is slightly lower than the hypothesized maximum trenching density 417 trenches ha 1 the findings of the study highlight that the ravine lands have a high production potential if suitable manageable and cost effective conservation practices as sct with trenching density of 375 or 417 trenches ha 1 are adopted the findings of this study will be helpful to watershed managers and policy makers for conserving the green water reclaiming restoring and maintaining the sustainable production potential of degraded ravine lands and other areas having similar kind of land degradation problems in india as well as abroad the results also help in improving the livelihood security of water and food for the local community in degraded ravine lands areas appendix a supplementary data
