23375,storms play a significant role in coastal zone hydrodynamics morphodynamics and flooding the us northeast is influenced by both extratropical e g nor easters and tropical cyclones which produce extreme winds storm surges and waves and as a result erosion and coastal damage in this study simulations of 100 of the most severe historical extratropical cyclones in this region were used to evaluate a new rapid numerical wave model that is a candidate model for ensemble forecasting and hazard assessment the main tool used was a coupled hydrodynamic wave model forced by wind and pressure from preexisting meteorological reanalysis datasets the coupled models were the stevens institute estuarine and coastal ocean hydrodynamic model secom and the mellor et al 2008 hereafter mdo wave model and includes several important physical interactions e g wave setup wave model results were compared to offshore buoy observational data from 1980 to 2012 and a sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate important model parameters results show that the wave model is very accurate for wave height h s with an average rmse of 0 92 m and skill ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 results were less accurate for average wave period t avg with an average rmse of 1 97 s and skill ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 however a comparison with a more widely used existing rapid wave model shows a substantial improvement over those t avg results large waves approach the coast in massachusetts bay during extratropical cyclones leading to important wave impacts including setup and modeled storm surge is shown to have good accuracy and no bias at boston these results demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the model for rapid simulations of waves under history s most extreme extratropical cyclones and the

winds storm surges and wave driven flooding which can produce extensive erosion and catastrophic damage of coastlines butman et al 1979 chang 2001 the us northeast is severely affected by both extratropical e g nor easters and tropical cyclones e g hurricane and therefore is vulnerable to coastal floods and waves colle et al 2008 herrington and miller 2010 vulnerability to these storms and their effects on coastal beaches buildings and infrastructure in the us northeast has increased enormously in recent years owing to the quick growth in coastal population and property keim et al 2004 the abovementioned cyclones i e extratropical and tropical differ in their timing track and impact on the nearshore region dolan and davis 1992 while tropical cyclones tcs typically can be more intense extratropical cyclones etcs are more frequent and have longer duration such that they can extend over multiple tidal cycles etcs are large powerful systems and have an important non negligible influence on the seasonality and intensity of flood risk in the us northeast orton et al 2012 2016 because of their large wind fetch and waves etcs can drive coastal erosion of a similar or greater magnitude than tcs hondula and dolan 2010 a useful tool for better understanding of coastal impacts of etcs is numerical modeling generally three main types of numerical models are employed for hydrodynamic simulations for extratropical storm events mellor 2003 xie et al 2016 i ocean general circulation models ogcms or tide surge models bernier and thompson 2007 ii wind wave models panchang et al 2008 and iii coupled wave models and ocean circulation models chen et al 2013 while ogcms are the most advanced tools existing for simulating the ocean motions it is crucial to couple wave and ocean models for momentum exchange between surface waves and currents donelan et al 2012 three different generations of wave models have been used to simulate wave motions during storms swamp 1985

generation models that include most of physical aspects of wave motions in 2d e g swan model booij et al 1999 several researchers have investigated the ocean surface waves during the storms in the east coast of us cardone et al 1996 applied four spectral wave models owiig resio2g wam4 and owi3g to the western north atlantic basin using meteorological reanalysis data they evaluated wave height and dominant wave period and suggested that further study is required to isolate the contribution of wind field errors and model physics and numeric to the prediction of hydrodynamic characteristics under extreme storms xie et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic response for etc in the gulf of maine using swan and adcirc models they postulated that the storm surges and waves simulations in the area are challenging because of the nonlinearity of surge wave interactions and the effects of wave action on coastal damage jensen et al 2016 studied regional wave modeling and evaluation for the north atlantic coast comprehensive study naccs using wam model and concluded that wam generally provided accurate wave estimations orton et al 2012 2016 conducted model validation physical process experiments and flood hazard assessment for historical and hypothetical tropical and extratropical storm tide events in the new york ny bight region the spatial structure and directional spectrum of hurricane induced ocean waves using a coupled atmosphere wave ocean model uwin cm and observations in the northeastern atlantic were examined by chen and curcic 2016 their results showed that waves near landfall become more multifaceted than in the open ocean because of the variations in water depth and wind fields that are based on storm characteristics their results show that there remain many challenging aspects for simulating storms near landfall hitherto none of the existing numerical models can accurately calculate all hydrodynamic characteristics during etcs xie et al 2016 wave modeling is a vital tool for operational flood forecasting systems such as stevens flood advisory system http stevens edu sfas these systems provide information of meteorological and oceanographic conditions in real time as well as in forecasts of up to several days probabilistic flood forecasting requires simulation of an ensemble of possible events requiring hundreds of simulations per hour and rapid hydrodynamic wave modeling can be valuable if it is accurate even though third generation wave models can simulate the detailed wave fields simplified wave models exist like the great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl model and the mdo model which are as a result less computationally expensive for wind wave predictions lin et al 2002 as these models are currently either in use or candidate models for forecasting and hazard assessment a comprehensive validation is warranted to quantify model accuracy in this study the coupling between a well established ocean model secom and rapid wave solvers for the us northeast under etcs is used and the wave model is validated then the validated wave model is applied to investigate how historical storms waves have varied back to the 1930s a sensitivity analysis is also carried out to assess the effects of a few important model parameters on the model performance in addition to a parametric model wave model glerl that has been used in the new york harbor observing and prediction system nyhops a new fast wave model i e mdo is evaluated in comparison to the glerl model mdo includes more comprehensive spectral wave physics swell propagation and contains wave induced radiation stress the numerical results of secom and wave models are compared with the available field observations of national data buoy center ndbc that were produced by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the model formulation and numerical scheme are briefly discussed in section 2 section 3 of the paper consists of a presentation and discussion of the numerical results including model validation sensitivity analysis and the demonstration of the model performance on the observational measurements for historical etcs section 4 concludes the paper 2 model descriptions in this study we use a hydrodynamic model coupled with two different wave models that are described in section 2 1 the hydrodynamic model is the three dimensional stevens institute estuarine and coastal ocean hydrodynamic model secom the secom model blumberg et al 1999 blumberg and georgas 2008 georgas 2010 has been developed based on the princeton ocean model pom blumberg and mellor 1987 and its version for shallow water environment ecomsed model blumberg et al 1999 here the coupled model is applied on the stevens northwest atlantic predictions snap domain on which it has recently been used and validated for hurricanes and etcs with good accuracy georgas et al 2016 orton et al 2016 snap covers the area from the gulf of st lawrence to cape hatteras about 1800 km alongshore and about 1200 km offshore fig 1 this domain is chosen to capture the large wind fetch from mid atlantic bight out to the nova scotia shelf during nor easters the size of all grid cells are constant at 6 km by 4 km 2 1 wave models second and third generation wave models consider more physical processes compared to first generation wave models and therefore these models are computationally more demanding ensemble forecasting and hazard assessment are two increasingly common applications of wave models that require a two orders of magnitude increase in the number of model simulations e g georgas et al 2016 orton et al 2016 and therefore these applications can benefit from a more computationally inexpensive wave model that can be combined with 3d ocgms two good candidates as fast wave models are the national oceanic and atmospheric administration glerl model donelan 1977 schwab et al 1984 and the mdo wave model mellor et al 2008 marsooli et al 2017 in addition to being fast the mdo and glerl models have been shown to be reasonably consistent with existing observations in prior studies especially for predicting the wave heights schwab et al 1984 lin et al 2002 orton et al 2012 marsooli et al 2017 the focus of this paper is on evaluating the relatively new mdo model a rapid spectral wave model with a parameterized spectral shape the model s energy distribution in frequency space is parameterized using a spectrum shape which includes elements of the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum donelan et al 1985 in addition the wave model includes wave radiation stress and wave setup setdown mellor et al 2008 which can be important for accurate prediction of inner shelf currents and wave and flood impacts e g beardsley et al 2013 marsooli et al 2017 mdo solves the wave energy equation on an arakawa c orthogonal curvilinear grid with a sigma vertical coordinate a detailed description of mdo is given by mellor et al 2008 and marsooli et al 2017 2 2 model setup boundary conditions and meteorological forcing the offshore boundary condition obc for water elevation is derived from local atmospheric pressure inverse barometer and uses the inverted reid and bodine approach reid and bodine 1968 the obc for waves is always zero wave height the internal mode baroclinic and external mode barotropic time steps in secom are 40 s and 4 s respectively and the time step in the wave model is 20 s the bottom drag coefficient is 0 003 wind and pressure reanalysis data from the naccs study are applied as surface boundary forcing precipitation and stream flow are not included in the simulations meteorological data wind and surface pressure fields for 100 severe etcs from 1938 to 2012 were produced by oceanweather inc owi and utilized by us army corps of engineers nadal caraballo et al 2015 cialone et al 2015 with the owi datasets there are two datasets per storm i a large scale dataset at lower resolution wave information study wis level ii wind fields on a 0 25 grid for the domain 22 48 n 82 52 w and ii a coastal zone dataset with higher resolution 0 125 deg domain for the domain 36 45 n 78 66 w fig 1b shows working grids used in the naccs study as well as snap domain in order to provide offshore and input condition information to drive the secom simulations the owi data are projected onto the snap model grid fig 1 secom is run with wind and pressure forcing on the snap grid capturing storm surge and wind driven currents and no tides are imposed as such the simulations and model validations do not focus on estuarine and nearshore areas where tidal currents can significantly influence the waves model output at each grid point consists of significant wave height wave period and average wave direction the simulation period in all model runs for etcs is 8 days and model results are stored every 10 min a spin up period of 6 days prior to the storm landfall is used to remove initial condition effects the coupled model uses a finite difference scheme on a staggered grid with sigma vertical coordinate and orthogonal curvilinear arakawa c grid the simulations were run on 4 16 core nodes using the high performance computing hpc cluster a linux based computing system at cuny high performance computing center the model run time for each storm on one core using the glerl and mdo models are about 6 h and 30 h respectively we note here that secom has been parallelized for the stevens forecasting system jordi et al 2017 and we intend to parallelize secom mdo for much faster simulation times 2 3 wave observations in this study the calculated wave characteristics are compared with the available field observations of ndbc at different sites from maine to virginia for the etcs in the naccs study due to the unavailability of wave data for the earlier periods 1930 70s only the model validations for recent storms 1979 2012 are presented table 1 the nbdc data including wave height and wave period recorded at 77 wave stations are used for comparison with numerical results off the us northeast coastal zone 3 results and discussion the mdo wave model was evaluated to confirm that results satisfactorily simulated wave parameters and variability during etcs here we present time series comparisons of wave heights and wave periods at different stations for various storms as well as summary validation results statistics maps for all locations and storms fig 2 shows the number of years of data for which a given buoy had data based on available data sets and fig 2 twelve stations were selected for model validation table 2 and fig 2b fig 3 shows the mdo modeled temporal maximum a wave heights and b storm surges for 100 historical etcs three locations with different geomorphology conditions i e buoy 44025 in southern long island offshore buoy 44065 at the ny harbor entrance inner shelf and sandy hook estuary were selected fig 3 confirms that for all etcs when waves move from offshore buoy 44025 into the inner shelf buoy 44065 and then estuary wave heights reduce and storm surges increase the ratio of wave height to storm surge is a useful qualitative metric for identifying the relative influence of waves and surge in nearshore areas where waves are breaking the ratio was computed for each storm via dividing the temporal maximum wave height by temporal maximum storm surge and then the average of these was computed at each model grid cell fig 4 in coastal areas where this ratio is high waves are likely to be important to coastal flooding due to driving wave setup and wave runup the importance of these processes has been observed and modeled for example for massachusetts bay chen et al 2013 which has a high ratio however in the areas where this ratio is low waves are relatively less important one of the coastal areas where this ratio is low is ny bight this ratio demonstrates the locations where typical etc conditions lead to important wave effects and can be useful for determining the importance of processes like wave setup and runup see section 3 3 for more discussion 3 1 model validation the etc wave modeling validation was done by comparing hourly time series of model results i e wave height and wave period and observations for the period with wave observations 1979 2012 for the wave period validation part average wave period t avg was used for each storm an 11 panel h s validation figure and similar 11 panel t avg validation figure is shown the model validation i e detailed time series views and statistics maps of h s and t avg for etc storms as well as sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed in 3 1 1 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 respectively in 3 1 4 the numerical results and wave evolution for the reference case perfect storm 1991 are presented in addition to the features of the glerl model the mdo model includes shallow water effects refraction explicit wave dissipation and exchange of current and stokes drift momentum therefore first we present the mdo results 3 1 and then compare our results with glerl 3 2 3 1 1 model validation wave height in this section the model results are evaluated for storms from 1979 to 2012 the model results i e detailed time series views and statistics maps of h s and t avg were compared with field measurements for a statistical comparison between observations and model results the skill the peak error on peak the root mean square error rmse and the bias were calculated expressions for these statistics are shown below willmott 1981 1 p e a k max p i max o i 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 s k i l l 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o m o i o m 2 4 b i a s 1 n i 1 n p i o i where o m is the observational mean value o i are the observational values p i are the predicted values and n is the number of observations rmse and bias are measures of the accuracy of the model peak is a measure of its accuracy in reproducing the temporal maximum and skill is measure of the model s ability to capture variability it includes standardization of model error variance hetland 2006 fig 5 shows comparisons of mdo model results and field data for significant wave height for three recent severe historical etcs and the perfect storm and in 11 stations in us northeast and mid atlantic regions in addition fig 5 gives skill and rmse of observational and numerical results for each storm and station the measures on all panels were calculated over 1 day from the time of maximum h s during each storm in order to focus attention on the central part of the storms near the peak of h s the grey shading areas were added to figures as illustrated in fig 5 model results and field observations agree qualitatively the temporal pattern of variation in h s is well predicted with most rmse below 1 5 m and skill ranging from 0 72 to 0 96 which provides confidence for wave modeling the phase and amplitude of the h s time series are well reproduced the small discrepancies between modeled and observed values may be due to errors in the wind setup water surface roughness length and bottom friction coefficient in addition to time dependent statistical measures it would be very useful to have the spatial information of statistics as it can lead us to conclusions on the domain size and wind fetch or on the model accuracy in inner shelf versus offshore regions therefore to have the geographic sense of the results and data in this section statistical measures are presented spatially averaged statistics rmse peak bias and skill of observational data and numerical results of h s that summarize all available storms and stations are shown in fig 6 as the model simulations during the peak of the extreme storms are the most important for us the aforementioned measures were computed over 1 day from the time of maximum h s during each storm fig 6 shows the results for the stations with at least four storms wave heights simulations were generally very accurate near the peak of each storm with typical rmse below 1 3 m and peak ranging from 0 8 to 0 7 m panel c properly demonstrates that model performance is in general accurate where almost all data points have skill values from 0 7 to 0 9 based on eq 3 perfect agreement gives a skill of one fig 7 depicts the comparison between observed and mdo modeled wave heights for all storms and also for four selected storms i e 2012 2009 2006 and perfect storm while fig 7a shows scatter on both sides of the line of perfect fit a slight negative bias is evident for panels b e it means that the model mostly underestimated significant wave heights 3 1 2 model validation average wave period ndbc reports dominant and average wave periods but here the later was used for model comparison in the mdo model the average wave period t avg is calculated as follows 5 t a v g e t π π σ θ e θ d θ 1 where σ θ and θ are the frequency and wave direction e θ and e t are the directional spectrum of kinematic energy and total kinematic wave energy per unit surface area respectively the glerl wave model computes wave period t g based on jonswap empirical relations as schwab et al 1984 6 t g 2 π c p g where c p is the phase velocity of the active component of the wave field the model s capacity to calculate t avg is not as good as its ability to compute h s but the model can usually accurately reproduce the t avg during the storms temporal variations of observational and predicted t avg at various stations for different etcs are shown in fig 8 the measures were computed during the storm period defined as 1 day from the time of the peak wave height the model skill in many panels is higher than 0 7 the overall pattern of the time series match and discrepancies are mostly smaller than 30 the trend and magnitude of the resulting t avg are fine and the model produces reasonable results however panel d shows disagreement between modeled and observed t avg in some stations which could be related to the swell as can be seen from this figure generally model results during the storms within 1 day of peak wave height are reasonable while during the more quiescent periods they are less accurate panels b and d of fig 8 statistical measures show that the model is moderately accurate in computing values of t avg measured by rmse but less accurate in capturing the variability measured by skill fig 9 displays statistics rmse peak bias and skill of observed and predicted t avg for all stations and storms t avg results have typical rmse around 0 5 1 8 s and skill ranging from 0 45 to 0 7 near the peak of each storm albeit some differences can be seen between observations and numerical simulations t avg errors were usually below 1 5 s and in many locations the error is smaller than 1 2 s fig 9a the errors in the peak are between 1 s and 1 s fig 9b furthermore for most of the stations the model results for t avg were under estimated as measured by skill the t avg results are not as good as h s for the h s simulations skill 0 7 to 0 9 is much larger than those of the t avg skill 0 45 to 0 70 skill measures the capacity of the model to capture variability so this reflects a poorer capacity to simulate the t avg variations likely due to often not capturing remotely generated swell in order to evaluate model performance for some individual etc simulations table 3 shows statistical results of the h s and t avg for recent storms at buoy 44013 east of boston ma where waves likely to be most important for driving wave setup fig 4 comparison of the calculated skill values shows that generally the accuracy of the numerical model for predicting h s is better than that of the t avg however the skill values of t avg for two storms i e 2008 and 2007 are higher than skill values of h s based on skill s value the lowest performing storm was 2009 for both h s and t avg the peak s values of h s for all selected storms are negative from 0 08 to 3 20 m indicating a small underestimation of maximum wave height during the storms in general less accuracy of calculated t avg compared to the h s is also seen in other wave models e g dietrich et al 2011 sun et al 2013 the fact that mdo modeled h s is more accurate than t avg may be due to the equations and constants used in the latter which were calibrated from the jonswap empirical relations and might not be very suitable for the t avg predictions under extreme storms the jonswap spectrum was derived from fetch limited data which are characteristic of the great lakes schwab et al 1984 jensen et al 2016 provided possible explanation of the disagreement between modeled and observed t avg stating that these discrepancies could be induced by dissimilarities in levels of energy throughout combined wind sea surface waves that are generated by local winds and swell that are not substantially affected by the local wind conditions and the exchange of these two types of waves fig 10 depicts the comparison between observed and mdo modeled t avg for all storms and also for four selected storms i e 2012 2009 2006 and 1991 while fig 10a shows scatter on both sides of the line of perfect fit a slight negative bias is evident on average however it is also noteworthy that the densest accumulation of points shows a trend where the model is slightly overestimating t avg the big discrepancies between modeled and observed values can be seen for the shorter wave heights for larger waves during the peak of the extreme storms as that is of most interest for forecasting waves and erosion the bias is positive and model prediction is much better there is a small slope difference between the modeled and measured t avg characteristics as a function of wave height this type of behavior overestimating periods at low wave heights and underestimating periods at larger wave heights typically indicates a problem in the source terms in the wave model but we note for the purposes of this paper that the slope bias is small and the mdo model gave a substantial improvement in wave period rmse skill and peak bias at all regions relative to glerl table 5 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects of breaker parameter γ and the number of directional bins used in mdo on the model performance the mdo wave model takes into account energy dissipation due to depth induced breaking using the method of battjes and janssen 1978 mdo includes the following sink term s θ bdis in the wave energy equation 7 s θ bdis e θ e t g σ θ 8 π q b h m 2 where e θ is frequency integrated energy a function of spatial coordinates time and wave direction θ π θ π e t is total wave energy g is gravitational acceleration σ θ is wave frequency and q b is the fraction of breaking waves determined by 8 q b 1 ln q b 8 e t g h m 2 where h m is the maximum wave height that can exist at a given depth the maximum wave height is determined as h m γd where d is the water depth and γ is an empirical breaker parameter battjes and stive 1985 reanalyzed wave data from laboratory and field experiments and found that the breaker parameter varies between 0 6 and 0 83 depending on the bathymetry an average value of 0 70 is set as the breaker parameter γ in mdo here in order to determine the breaker parameter γ the empirical equation of ruessink et al 2003 was adapted in mdo ruessink et al 2003 proposed an empirical formula for γ by an inverse modeling of γ from a high resolution dataset collected at duck nc usa they found that the wave height profiles modeled based on their empirical formula are in better agreement with measurements than model results using a constant γ their formula is applicable to both barred and non barred beaches ruessink et al 2003 related the breaker parameter γ to the local wavenumber k and water depth d as 9 γ 0 29 0 76 k d the coupled secom mdo model has so far been utilized here and in marsooli et al 2017 with discretization of the directional space into 24 bins 15 balancing model accuracy and model cost here results were compared using the model with 36 directional bins the model with more directional bins did not much affect the model results but increased the computational time this finding is consistent with sensitivity analysis of gibbs et al 2012 for the gulf of mexico that showed increasing the resolution from 24 to 36 bins in swan did not have much effect on their results therefore two different scenarios with different breaker parameters were compared scenario 1 with constant γ and scenario 2 with γ according to eq 9 all other parameters and run controls were set constant sensitivity of the model performance to breaker parameter is presented in table 4 in order to better evaluate the model the study area was divided to three regions i shallow shelf d 30 m ii deep shelf 30 d 200 m and iii deep ocean d 200 m in the shallow shelf the wave heights calculated by the models with a constant γ and locally varying γ show nearly similar accuracy in other regions the varying γ significantly improves the accuracy in the calculated wave heights for example the calculated wave height peaks in the deep shelf and deep ocean are improved up to 69 and 82 percent respectively our results here showed that implementation of the locally varying γ improves h rms predictions however the results show that the varying γ has little impact on the calculated wave height in shallow waters shallow shelf this can be due to the low resolution of the sanp grid in the shallow shelf specified here the water depth and the wave characteristics such as the wave number which together are used to compute the varying γ from eq 9 change within a small spatial scale whereas the snap grid averages these parameters in a computational cell with grid spacing of 6 km by 4 km in contrast to the wave height in all regions the model with a constant γ calculates more accurate wave periods than the model with varying γ the empirical eq 9 for varying γ was calibrated based on the wave heights ruessink et al 2003 proposed this empirical equation to improve the accuracy of the predicted wave heights across inner bar troughs in shallow waters whereas they did not consider the influence of their varying γ on the calculated wave periods 3 1 4 wave motions of perfect storm october 1991 reference case the perfect storm a severe hybrid combined etc and tc event affected the us northeast from 28 october to 2 november 1991 this storm was initially an etc off the canadian maritimes then moved westward toward new england then southwestward well off the mid atlantic coast it returned northeastward and absorbed hurricane grace and finally became a small hurricane towards the end of its life cycle and made landfall west of halifax canada finally the storm dissipated after passing over prince edward island it is useful case study for the wave model because it was a very large storm and caused large waves over the entire model domain however it is also a difficult challenge for the model because it had multi directional winds and a mixture of wind seas and swell extratropical cyclones often showed higher model skill and lower rms errors figs 5 and 8 likely due to having more unidirectional winds and locally generated wind seas figs 11 and 12 depict the snapshots of the geographic distribution of modeled h s and t avg before panels a c near panel d and after panel e the time of spatio temporal maximum wave height on the snap grid the wind velocities reach their maxima near the storm center and the maximum wind velocity is from the southeast shoreward into gulf of maine near station 44024 northeast channel just northeast of georges bank the maximum wind speed continuously happens in the area near the storm center where the strongest atmospheric pressure gradient occurs the h s and t avg reach their maxima near the storm center southeast of nantucket on 30 october 1991 the distributions of wave characteristics off the us northeast during the perfect storm show a complex pattern around the rotational storm center due to the multi directional wind field spiraling around the moving storm on october 30 panel d of figs 11 and 12 winds to the north of the storm center were blowing at 25 33 ms 1 in the middle of domain with atmospheric pressure falling to a minimum of 985 hpa at the center of storm fig 11d as shown in figs 11d and 12d the storm created h s and t avg exceed 6 m and 9 s over the most part of the model domain the wave height rms errors are from 0 65 to 3 2 relative to observed peak wave heights of 4 13 m across all stations and model skill ranges are from 0 52 to 0 82 fig 5 the region with the highest h s and t avg is located near the buoy 44402 southeast block canyon the maximum h s is 14 m with a t avg of 15 s the wave period rms errors are from 0 68 to 3 8 relative to peak observed wave periods of 7 12 s and model skill ranges from 0 27 to 0 70 fig 8 the t avg model skill scores are actually lower for this storm compared with other etcs likely due to the challenge of capturing a mixture of wind seas and long distance traveling swell a comparison of figs 11 and 12 shows that a relationship and same geographic distribution pattern exist between h s and t avg time series during the etcs as wave height increases the wave period increases with the same ratio this directly results from the theoretical background of the wave model within the assumed spectral shape 3 2 comparing different fast wave models besides the observational data the model results secom mdo model were compared with those of the secom glerl model the glerl wave model is currently being used in the stevens nyhops forecasting system glerl is a parametric model of wind wave growth propagation and frictional decay and solves the two dimensional momentum conservation equations donelan 1977 glerl considers the generation and propagation of unidirectional waves while the spectral evolution is described by jonswap spectral shape however the model does not consider depth and current induced refraction nor radiation stress and wave setup induced by wave breaking table 5 gives the statistics for model observation comparisons for both the glerl and mdo wave models based upon these results summarized below we may conclude that mdo is clearly the better model for t avg whereas there are accurate results and no clear winner for h s for wave height the skill for mdo is slightly lower 0 75 and 0 76 for mdo and glerl respectively and rmse is slightly higher 0 75 and 0 73 m for mdo and glerl it can be seen that for mdo the h s is underestimated peak values while for glerl it is slightly overestimated for t avg the skill of mdo is substantially better than that of glerl 0 60 and 0 44 for mdo and glerl in addition mdo has relatively small biases whereas glerl is biased high finally the rmse of mdo 1 39 s is lower than that of glerl 2 36 s in addition table 5 shows the statistics of observational data and numerical results for glerl and mdo wave models over the different regions of the domain shallow shelf deep shelf and deep ocean the results show that mdo is obviously the better model for t avg while glerl is very slightly better for h s in the shallow shelf the h s calculated by the mdo and glerl show nearly similar accuracy however in the deep shelf and deep ocean regions glerl and mdo are more accurate for h s modeling respectively performance of the wave model depends strongly on the extent to which the physical processes are specified and energy is explicitly tracked by the model consequently more accurate wave modeling is possible as the numerical results have shown both mdo and glerl are very accurate for h s but less accurate for measures of t avg in addition glerl excludes refraction shallow water influences and current and stokes drift momentum exchange mellor et al 2008 a possible solution to obtain better results for t avg is re doing the analysis using a newer and more complex wave model there are a number of third generation numerical wave models that can be implemented for wind wave estimates in coastal areas e g swan however as one of the main goals of this study is to provide the rapid validated model for ocean forecasting and hazard assessment systems and as the third generated wave model is relatively slow still mdo can be one of the best options the rapid wave models mdo and glerl are much more computationally efficient for wind wave predictions due to their simplicity lin et al 2002 although mdo wave model is slower than glerl wave model the term fast is appropriate because it is a relative term contrasting it to the commonly used third generation 3g models the model is fundamentally much faster than 3g models because there are far fewer computations needed and smaller datasets to pass mdo and glerl have been shown to be relatively consistent with buoy data and observations in a few investigations and comparable to those obtained with the 3g model swan e g lin et al 1998 mellor et al 2008 marsooli et al 2017 the model results of mdo for hurricane katrina showed that the accuracy of the modeled wave properties is comparable to buoy data and the results produced by a 3g wave model mellor et al 2008 to further investigate the speed of mdo compared to a full spectrum 3g wave model marsooli et al 2017 applied mdo and swan to an idealized case study of wind generated waves and compared their computational costs they found that while both models produce nearly similar results swan is about 58 times more expensive than mdo marsooli et al 2017 we ran the same experiment using swan in its 2g mode that uses simplified parametric wave wave interactions and found the model was also slower than mdo in this case by a factor of 42 3 3 application of rapid wave models to simulation of waves and coastal flooding our interest in using mdo in place of glerl in our coupled modeling e g the stevens nyhops domain has been driven by a desire to include more aspects of wave physics in particular multidirectional waves refraction and wave setup and runup an additional related benefit is the substantial increase in accuracy for t avg that is observed with mdo table 5 and fig 10 the wave model results are moderately important for their effects on storm surges which is a primary focus of our forecasting and hazard assessment work one way the waves affect the storm surges is through wind stress which with secom mdo depends on wave age and with secom glerl depends on wave slope both the h s and t avg play an important role here and the use of an assumed spectral shape and focus on storm driven wind waves is reasonable the sea surface roughness for wave slope or wave age dependent wind drag formulations responds more to the small scale young wave field than the long period swell e g orton et al 2012 the results shown in this paper suggest a good accuracy with respect to these model results and likely good accuracy in their impacts on surge mdo is likely somewhat better in this regard due to its significantly smaller errors in t avg another important influence of the waves on storm tides is though the wave current combined bed stress which is included in both coupled models signell et al 1990 marsooli et al 2017 the assumed spectral shapes with these two rapid models may be a deficiency for cases where there is mixed swell and wind seas as the model will underestimate the wave influence on bed stress except for shallow water waves longer period waves have a larger influence on near bed currents in this paper we focus on powerful etcs which usually have a long relatively unidirectional wind fetch and rarely have a bimodal spectrum for tcs there is often a wider range of wind directions and this will often be a more significant weakness again mdo should be superior to glerl in its estimation of bed stress due to its better accuracy on t avg incorporation of wave setup can improve the representation of storm tides at harbor areas e g marsooli et al 2017 and beaches as hurricane sandy simulations revealed that wave setup caused increases in storm tide inside new york harbor of up to 26 cm as discussed at the start of the results section and shown in fig 4 the wave height to surge ratio is highest and waves are likely to be important for driving wave setup near the western gulf of maine coast however in new york bight this ratio is relatively low and waves are less important this may explain the past accuracy of the nyhops system e g georgas and blumberg 2009 orton et al 2012 in spite of using the coupled secom glerl model that neglects wave setup massachusetts bay is an example of an area where it is expected that wave setup has a larger role for coastal flooding beardsley et al 2013 chen et al 2013 as implied in fig 4 by a high wave height to surge ratio near the coast and we find that using the mdo wave model gives a significant improvement in surge estimates there fig 13 displays a validation scatterplot for observed and modeled surge for boston s tide gauge for all storms mdo results have mean bias around zero about 1 mm whereas the mean bias for glerl model is 8 4 cm an important underestimation that is likely driven by the lack of modeling of wave setup effects in addition to the prior results for new york harbor these results back up our expectation that in areas that wave setup is large secom mdo will outperform secom glerl for estimation of storm surge this expands upon the prior evidence that wave setup can be important for hurricane sandy storm surge at new york harbor marsooli et al 2017 in conclusion we can conclude that the mdo wave model is eventually a better candidate for rapid wave modeling and storm surge than the glerl wave model because it outperforms glerl in predicting wave period and storm surge use of the secom mdo model also opens the door to capturing the detailed influences of waves at beaches in principle the model can capture wave setup influences on water levels at beaches and wave runup can be computed using simulated wave height wavelength and foreshore beach slope e g stockdon et al 2006 wave runup estimates are already being added to storm tides by noaa usgs pilot study to forecast total water level usgs 2017 the accuracy of wave height and wavelength implied by wave period demonstrated in this paper shows that these computations are possible however the snap and nyhops grids used in the stevens flood advisory system sfas ensemble flood forecasting system do not have sufficient resolution to capture wave breaking zone processes in most these areas as these model grids were not developed with the goal of simulating wave affected coastal processes the present work may inspire creation of regional grids with improved nearshore resolution opening the door to useful improvements to forecasting capabilities and accuracy at wave affected shorelines 4 summary and concluding remarks historical extratropical cyclone wave modeling for the us northeast coastal ocean was performed with the 3d secom hydrodynamic model coupled with two rapid wave models i e mdo and glerl the model used pressure and wind reanalysis data to simulate 100 severe historical etcs the model results of h s and t avg were compared to the nbdc data at 77 sites off the us northeast coast the evaluation focused on the period within one day before and after the time of the peak wave height during each storm as that is of most interest for forecasting waves and erosion mdo is a spectral wave model with a parameterized spectral shape and results revealed good agreement for most storms with field observations for h s and moderate agreement for t avg wave height had an average rmse of 0 92 m and skill ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 wave period had an average rmse of 1 97 s and skill ranging from 0 5 to 0 70 the results showed that mdo is clearly a better model for t avg than glerl while both mdo and glerl are very accurate for h s nevertheless being a relatively new model the mdo model may benefit from more evaluation prior to operational use a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects of the breaker parameter and the number of directional bins used in mdo on the model performance the model results showed that increasing the directional bins does not much affect the model results but increases the computational time in the shallow shelf area the best statistical measures for h s and t avg are attained for the constant breaker parameter yet in the deep shelf and deep ocean areas the model with constant breaker parameter is superior in simulation of t avg while the model with variable breaker parameter has better results for h s this validated mdo wave model contains more aspects than the glerl model of wave physics that are relevant to storm tides e g wave setup and wave driven coastal damages e g multi directional waves and refraction it captures the most important processes related to storm related hazards yet its parameterization of the spectral shape enables it to be well over an order of magnitude faster than second and third generation spectral wave models this gives it promise for use in operational ensemble forecasting systems and to increase their capacity to resolve detailed wave driven processes such as wave setup runup whereas ensemble probabilistic flood forecasts have been found to be more helpful than deterministic forecasts for decision making it is crucial that all important physical processes are incorporated to facilitate an unbiased prediction of coastal impacts mdo provides a unique model fitting this purpose independent of the purpose of the third generation models which are more advanced and versatile yet much slower and often not usable for our purposes of ensemble forecasting and probabilistic assessment in closing we note that the application of the mdo model in deep water and even more so in shallow water remains a topic of research after considerable additional testing in a wide range of conditions the model may be useful for operational applications the validated mdo wave model was used here to investigate how historical storms waves have varied within the past century the results were used to demonstrate the locations where typical etc conditions lead to relatively important wave driven effects on coastal hazards demonstrating where the accurate incorporation of these wave effects with models like mdo will be most

23375,storms play a significant role in coastal zone hydrodynamics morphodynamics and flooding the us northeast is influenced by both extratropical e g nor easters and tropical cyclones which produce extreme winds storm surges and waves and as a result erosion and coastal damage in this study simulations of 100 of the most severe historical extratropical cyclones in this region were used to evaluate a new rapid numerical wave model that is a candidate model for ensemble forecasting and hazard assessment the main tool used was a coupled hydrodynamic wave model forced by wind and pressure from preexisting meteorological reanalysis datasets the coupled models were the stevens institute estuarine and coastal ocean hydrodynamic model secom and the mellor et al 2008 hereafter mdo wave model and includes several important physical interactions e g wave setup wave model results were compared to offshore buoy observational data from 1980 to 2012 and a sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate important model parameters results show that the wave model is very accurate for wave height h s with an average rmse of 0 92 m and skill ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 results were less accurate for average wave period t avg with an average rmse of 1 97 s and skill ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 however a comparison with a more widely used existing rapid wave model shows a substantial improvement over those t avg results large waves approach the coast in massachusetts bay during extratropical cyclones leading to important wave impacts including setup and modeled storm surge is shown to have good accuracy and no bias at boston these results demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the model for rapid simulations of waves under history s most extreme extratropical cyclones and the

winds storm surges and wave driven flooding which can produce extensive erosion and catastrophic damage of coastlines butman et al 1979 chang 2001 the us northeast is severely affected by both extratropical e g nor easters and tropical cyclones e g hurricane and therefore is vulnerable to coastal floods and waves colle et al 2008 herrington and miller 2010 vulnerability to these storms and their effects on coastal beaches buildings and infrastructure in the us northeast has increased enormously in recent years owing to the quick growth in coastal population and property keim et al 2004 the abovementioned cyclones i e extratropical and tropical differ in their timing track and impact on the nearshore region dolan and davis 1992 while tropical cyclones tcs typically can be more intense extratropical cyclones etcs are more frequent and have longer duration such that they can extend over multiple tidal cycles etcs are large powerful systems and have an important non negligible influence on the seasonality and intensity of flood risk in the us northeast orton et al 2012 2016 because of their large wind fetch and waves etcs can drive coastal erosion of a similar or greater magnitude than tcs hondula and dolan 2010 a useful tool for better understanding of coastal impacts of etcs is numerical modeling generally three main types of numerical models are employed for hydrodynamic simulations for extratropical storm events mellor 2003 xie et al 2016 i ocean general circulation models ogcms or tide surge models bernier and thompson 2007 ii wind wave models panchang et al 2008 and iii coupled wave models and ocean circulation models chen et al 2013 while ogcms are the most advanced tools existing for simulating the ocean motions it is crucial to couple wave and ocean models for momentum exchange between surface waves and currents donelan et al 2012 three different generations of wave models have been used to simulate wave motions during storms swamp 1985

east coast of us cardone et al 1996 applied four spectral wave models owiig resio2g wam4 and owi3g to the western north atlantic basin using meteorological reanalysis data they evaluated wave height and dominant wave period and suggested that further study is required to isolate the contribution of wind field errors and model physics and numeric to the prediction of hydrodynamic characteristics under extreme storms xie et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic response for etc in the gulf of maine using swan and adcirc models they postulated that the storm surges and waves simulations in the area are challenging because of the nonlinearity of surge wave interactions and the effects of wave action on coastal damage jensen et al 2016 studied regional wave modeling and evaluation for the north atlantic coast comprehensive study naccs using wam model and concluded that wam generally provided accurate wave estimations orton et al 2012 2016 conducted model validation physical process experiments and flood hazard assessment for historical and hypothetical tropical and extratropical storm tide events in the new york ny bight region the spatial structure and directional spectrum of hurricane induced ocean waves using a coupled atmosphere wave ocean model uwin cm and observations in the northeastern atlantic were examined by chen and curcic 2016 their results showed that waves near landfall become more multifaceted than in the open ocean because of the variations in water depth and wind fields that are based on storm characteristics their results show that there remain many challenging aspects for simulating storms near landfall hitherto none of the existing numerical models can accurately calculate all hydrodynamic characteristics during etcs xie et al 2016 wave modeling is a vital tool for operational flood forecasting systems such as stevens flood advisory system http stevens edu sfas these systems provide information of meteorological and oceanographic conditions in real time as well as in forecasts of up to several days probabilistic flood forecasting requires simulation of an ensemble of possible events requiring hundreds of simulations per hour and rapid hydrodynamic wave modeling can be valuable if it is accurate even though third generation wave models can simulate the detailed wave fields simplified wave models exist like the great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl model and the mdo model which are as a result less computationally expensive for wind wave predictions lin et al 2002 as these models are currently either in use or candidate models for forecasting and hazard assessment a comprehensive validation is warranted to quantify model accuracy in this study the coupling between a well established ocean model secom and rapid wave solvers for the us northeast under etcs is used and the wave model is validated then the validated wave model is applied to investigate how historical storms waves have varied back to the 1930s a sensitivity analysis is also carried out to assess the effects of a few important model parameters on the model performance in addition to a parametric model wave model glerl that has been used in the new york harbor observing and prediction system nyhops a new fast wave model i e mdo is evaluated in comparison to the glerl model mdo includes more comprehensive spectral wave physics swell propagation and contains wave induced radiation stress the numerical results of secom and wave models are compared with the available field observations of national data buoy center ndbc that were produced by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the model formulation and numerical scheme are briefly discussed in section 2 section 3 of the paper consists of a presentation and discussion of the numerical results including model validation sensitivity analysis and the demonstration of the model performance on the observational measurements for historical etcs section 4 concludes the paper 2 model descriptions in this study we use a hydrodynamic model coupled with two different wave models that are described in section 2 1 the hydrodynamic model is the three dimensional stevens institute estuarine and coastal ocean hydrodynamic model secom the secom model blumberg et al 1999 blumberg and georgas 2008 georgas 2010 has been developed based on the princeton ocean model pom blumberg and mellor 1987 and its version for shallow water environment ecomsed model blumberg et al 1999 here the coupled model is applied on the stevens northwest atlantic predictions snap domain on which it has recently been used and validated for hurricanes and etcs with good accuracy georgas et al 2016 orton et al 2016 snap covers the area from the gulf of st lawrence to cape hatteras about 1800 km alongshore and about 1200 km offshore fig 1 this domain is chosen to capture the large wind fetch from mid atlantic bight out to the nova scotia shelf during nor easters the size of all grid cells are constant at 6 km by 4 km 2 1 wave models second and third generation wave models consider more physical processes compared to first generation wave models and therefore these models are computationally more demanding ensemble forecasting and hazard assessment are two increasingly common applications of wave models that require a two orders of magnitude increase in the number of model simulations e g georgas et al 2016 orton et al 2016 and therefore these applications can benefit from a more computationally inexpensive wave model that can be combined with 3d ocgms two good candidates as fast wave models are the national oceanic and atmospheric administration glerl model donelan 1977 schwab et al 1984 and the mdo wave model mellor et al 2008 marsooli et al 2017 in addition to being fast the mdo and glerl models have been shown to be reasonably consistent with existing observations in prior studies especially for predicting the wave heights schwab et al 1984 lin et al 2002 orton et al 2012 marsooli et al 2017 the focus of this paper is on evaluating the relatively new mdo model a rapid spectral wave model with a parameterized spectral shape the model s energy distribution in frequency space is parameterized using a spectrum shape which includes elements of the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum donelan et al 1985 in addition the wave model includes wave radiation stress and wave setup setdown mellor et al 2008 which can be important for accurate prediction of inner shelf currents and wave and flood impacts e g beardsley et al 2013 marsooli et al 2017 mdo solves the wave energy equation on an arakawa c orthogonal curvilinear grid with a sigma vertical coordinate a detailed description of mdo is given by mellor et al 2008 and marsooli et al 2017 2 2 model setup boundary conditions and meteorological forcing the offshore boundary condition obc for water elevation is derived from local atmospheric pressure inverse barometer and uses the inverted reid and bodine approach reid and bodine 1968 the obc for waves is always zero wave height the internal mode baroclinic and external mode barotropic time steps in secom are 40 s and 4 s respectively and the time step in the wave model is 20 s the bottom drag coefficient is 0 003 wind and pressure reanalysis data from the naccs study are applied as surface boundary forcing precipitation and stream flow are not included in the simulations meteorological data wind and surface pressure fields for 100 severe etcs from 1938 to 2012 were produced by oceanweather inc owi and utilized by us army corps of engineers nadal caraballo et al 2015 cialone et al 2015 with the owi datasets there are two datasets per storm i a large scale dataset at lower resolution wave information study wis level ii wind fields on a 0 25 grid for the domain 22 48 n 82 52 w and ii a coastal zone dataset with higher resolution 0 125 deg domain for the domain 36 45 n 78 66 w fig 1b shows working grids used in the naccs study as well as snap domain in order to provide offshore and input condition information to drive the secom simulations the owi data are projected onto the snap model grid fig 1 secom is run with wind and pressure forcing on the snap grid capturing storm surge and wind driven currents and no tides are imposed as such the simulations and model validations do not focus on estuarine and nearshore areas where tidal currents can significantly influence the waves model output at each grid point consists of significant wave height wave period and average wave direction the simulation period in all model runs for etcs is 8 days and model results are stored every 10 min a spin up period of 6 days prior to the storm landfall is used to remove initial condition effects the coupled model uses a finite difference scheme on a staggered grid with sigma vertical coordinate and orthogonal curvilinear arakawa c grid the simulations were run on 4 16 core nodes using the high performance computing hpc cluster a linux based computing system at cuny high performance computing center the model run time for each storm on one core using the glerl and mdo models are about 6 h and 30 h respectively we note here that secom has been parallelized for the stevens forecasting system jordi et al 2017 and we intend to parallelize secom mdo for much faster simulation times 2 3 wave observations in this study the calculated wave characteristics are compared with the available field observations of ndbc at different sites from maine to virginia for the etcs in the naccs study due to the unavailability of wave data for the earlier periods 1930 70s only the model validations for recent storms 1979 2012 are presented table 1 the nbdc data including wave height and wave period recorded at 77 wave stations are used for comparison with numerical results off the us northeast coastal zone 3 results and discussion the mdo wave model was evaluated to confirm that results satisfactorily simulated wave parameters and variability during etcs here we present time series comparisons of wave heights and wave periods at different stations for various storms as well as summary validation results statistics maps for all locations and storms fig 2 shows the number of years of data for which a given buoy had data based on available data sets and fig 2 twelve stations were selected for model validation table 2 and fig 2b fig 3 shows the mdo modeled temporal maximum a wave heights and b storm surges for 100 historical etcs three locations with different geomorphology conditions i e buoy 44025 in southern long island offshore buoy 44065 at the ny harbor entrance inner shelf and sandy hook estuary were selected fig 3 confirms that for all etcs when waves move from offshore buoy 44025 into the inner shelf buoy 44065 and then estuary wave heights reduce and storm surges increase the ratio of wave height to storm surge is a useful qualitative metric for identifying the relative influence of waves and surge in nearshore areas where waves are breaking the ratio was computed for each storm via dividing the temporal maximum wave height by temporal maximum storm surge and then the average of these was computed at each model grid cell fig 4 in coastal areas where this ratio is high waves are likely to be important to coastal flooding due to driving wave setup and wave runup the importance of these processes has been observed and modeled for example for massachusetts bay chen et al 2013 which has a high ratio however in the areas where this ratio is low waves are relatively less important one of the coastal areas where this ratio is low is ny bight this ratio demonstrates the locations where typical etc conditions lead to important wave effects and can be useful for determining the importance of processes like wave setup and runup see section 3 3 for more discussion 3 1 model validation the etc wave modeling validation was done by comparing hourly time series of model results i e wave height and wave period and observations for the period with wave observations 1979 2012 for the wave period validation part average wave period t avg was used for each storm an 11 panel h s validation figure and similar 11 panel t avg validation figure is shown the model validation i e detailed time series views and statistics maps of h s and t avg for etc storms as well as sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed in 3 1 1 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 respectively in 3 1 4 the numerical results and wave evolution for the reference case perfect storm 1991 are presented in addition to the features of the glerl model the mdo model includes shallow water effects refraction explicit wave dissipation and exchange of current and stokes drift momentum therefore first we present the mdo results 3 1 and then compare our results with glerl 3 2 3 1 1 model validation wave height in this section the model results are evaluated for storms from 1979 to 2012 the model results i e detailed time series views and statistics maps of h s and t avg were compared with field measurements for a statistical comparison between observations and model results the skill the peak error on peak the root mean square error rmse and the bias were calculated expressions for these statistics are shown below willmott 1981 1 p e a k max p i max o i 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 s k i l l 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o m o i o m 2 4 b i a s 1 n i 1 n p i o i where o m is the observational mean value o i are the observational values p i are the predicted values and n is the number of observations rmse and bias are measures of the accuracy of the model peak is a measure of its accuracy in reproducing the temporal maximum and skill is measure of the model s ability to capture variability it includes standardization of model error variance hetland 2006 fig 5 shows comparisons of mdo model results and field data for significant wave height for three recent severe historical etcs and the perfect storm and in 11 stations in us northeast and mid atlantic regions in addition fig 5 gives skill and rmse of observational and numerical results for each storm and station the measures on all panels were calculated over 1 day from the time of maximum h s during each storm in order to focus attention on the central part of the storms near the peak of h s the grey shading areas were added to figures as illustrated in fig 5 model results and field observations agree qualitatively the temporal pattern of variation in h s is well predicted with most rmse below 1 5 m and skill ranging from 0 72 to 0 96 which provides confidence for wave modeling the phase and amplitude of the h s time series are well reproduced the small discrepancies between modeled and observed values may be due to errors in the wind setup water surface roughness length and bottom friction coefficient in addition to time dependent statistical measures it would be very useful to have the spatial information of statistics as it can lead us to conclusions on the domain size and wind fetch or on the model accuracy in inner shelf versus offshore regions therefore to have the geographic sense of the results and data in this section statistical measures are presented spatially averaged statistics rmse peak bias and skill of observational data and numerical results of h s that summarize all available storms and stations are shown in fig 6 as the model simulations during the peak of the extreme storms are the most important for us the aforementioned measures were computed over 1 day from the time of maximum h s during each storm fig 6 shows the results for the stations with at least four storms wave heights simulations were generally very accurate near the peak of each storm with typical rmse below 1 3 m and peak ranging from 0 8 to 0 7 m panel c properly demonstrates that model performance is in general accurate where almost all data points have skill values from 0 7 to 0 9 based on eq 3 perfect agreement gives a skill of one fig 7 depicts the comparison between observed and mdo modeled wave heights for all storms and also for four selected storms i e 2012 2009 2006 and perfect storm while fig 7a shows scatter on both sides of the line of perfect fit a slight negative bias is evident for panels b e it means that the model mostly underestimated significant wave heights 3 1 2 model validation average wave period ndbc reports dominant and average wave periods but here the later was used for model comparison in the mdo model the average wave period t avg is calculated as follows 5 t a v g e t π π σ θ e θ d θ 1 where σ θ and θ are the frequency and wave direction e θ and e t are the directional spectrum of kinematic energy and total kinematic wave energy per unit surface area respectively the glerl wave model computes wave period t g based on jonswap empirical relations as schwab et al 1984 6 t g 2 π c p g where c p is the phase velocity of the active component of the wave field the model s capacity to calculate t avg is not as good as its ability to compute h s but the model can usually accurately reproduce the t avg during the storms temporal variations of observational and predicted t avg at various stations for different etcs are shown in fig 8 the measures were computed during the storm period defined as 1 day from the time of the peak wave height the model skill in many panels is higher than 0 7 the overall pattern of the time series match and discrepancies are mostly smaller than 30 the trend and magnitude of the resulting t avg are fine and the model produces reasonable results however panel d shows disagreement between modeled and observed t avg in some stations which could be related to the swell as can be seen from this figure generally model results during the storms within 1 day of peak wave height are reasonable while during the more quiescent periods they are less accurate panels b and d of fig 8 statistical measures show that the model is moderately accurate in computing values of t avg measured by rmse but less accurate in capturing the variability measured by skill fig 9 displays statistics rmse peak bias and skill of observed and predicted t avg for all stations and storms t avg results have typical rmse around 0 5 1 8 s and skill ranging from 0 45 to 0 7 near the peak of each storm albeit some differences can be seen between observations and numerical simulations t avg errors were usually below 1 5 s and in many locations the error is smaller than 1 2 s fig 9a the errors in the peak are between 1 s and 1 s fig 9b furthermore for most of the stations the model results for t avg were under estimated as measured by skill the t avg results are not as good as h s for the h s simulations skill 0 7 to 0 9 is much larger than those of the t avg skill 0 45 to 0 70 skill measures the capacity of the model to capture variability so this reflects a poorer capacity to simulate the t avg variations likely due to often not capturing remotely generated swell in order to evaluate model performance for some individual etc simulations table 3 shows statistical results of the h s and t avg for recent storms at buoy 44013 east of boston ma where waves likely to be most important for driving wave setup fig 4 comparison of the calculated skill values shows that generally the accuracy of the numerical model for predicting h s is better than that of the t avg however the skill values of t avg for two storms i e 2008 and 2007 are higher than skill values of h s based on skill s value the lowest performing storm was 2009 for both h s and t avg the peak s values of h s for all selected storms are negative from 0 08 to 3 20 m indicating a small underestimation of maximum wave height during the storms in general less accuracy of calculated t avg compared to the h s is also seen in other wave models e g dietrich et al 2011 sun et al 2013 the fact that mdo modeled h s is more accurate than t avg may be due to the equations and constants used in the latter which were calibrated from the jonswap empirical relations and might not be very suitable for the t avg predictions under extreme storms the jonswap spectrum was derived from fetch limited data which are characteristic of the great lakes schwab et al 1984 jensen et al 2016 provided possible explanation of the disagreement between modeled and observed t avg stating that these discrepancies could be induced by dissimilarities in levels of energy throughout combined wind sea surface waves that are generated by local winds and swell that are not substantially affected by the local wind conditions and the exchange of these two types of waves fig 10 depicts the comparison between observed and mdo modeled t avg for all storms and also for four selected storms i e 2012 2009 2006 and 1991 while fig 10a shows scatter on both sides of the line of perfect fit a slight negative bias is evident on average however it is also noteworthy that the densest accumulation of points shows a trend where the model is slightly overestimating t avg the big discrepancies between modeled and observed values can be seen for the shorter wave heights for larger waves during the peak of the extreme storms as that is of most interest for forecasting waves and erosion the bias is positive and model prediction is much better there is a small slope difference between the modeled and measured t avg characteristics as a function of wave height this type of behavior overestimating periods at low wave heights and underestimating periods at larger wave heights typically indicates a problem in the source terms in the wave model but we note for the purposes of this paper that the slope bias is small and the mdo model gave a substantial improvement in wave period rmse skill and peak bias at all regions relative to glerl table 5 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects of breaker parameter γ and the number of directional bins used in mdo on the model performance the mdo wave model takes into account energy dissipation due to depth induced breaking using the method of battjes and janssen 1978 mdo includes the following sink term s θ bdis in the wave energy equation 7 s θ bdis e θ e t g σ θ 8 π q b h m 2 where e θ is frequency integrated energy a function of spatial coordinates time and wave direction θ π θ π e t is total wave energy g is gravitational acceleration σ θ is wave frequency and q b is the fraction of breaking waves determined by 8 q b 1 ln q b 8 e t g h m 2 where h m is the maximum wave height that can exist at a given depth the maximum wave height is determined as h m γd where d is the water depth and γ is an empirical breaker parameter battjes and stive 1985 reanalyzed wave data from laboratory and field experiments and found that the breaker parameter varies between 0 6 and 0 83 depending on the bathymetry an average value of 0 70 is set as the breaker parameter γ in mdo here in order to determine the breaker parameter γ the empirical equation of ruessink et al 2003 was adapted in mdo ruessink et al 2003 proposed an empirical formula for γ by an inverse modeling of γ from a high resolution dataset collected at duck nc usa they found that the wave height profiles modeled based on their empirical formula are in better agreement with measurements than model results using a constant γ their formula is applicable to both barred and non barred beaches ruessink et al 2003 related the breaker parameter γ to the local wavenumber k and water depth d as 9 γ 0 29 0 76 k d the coupled secom mdo model has so far been utilized here and in marsooli et al 2017 with discretization of the directional space into 24 bins 15 balancing model accuracy and model cost here results were compared using the model with 36 directional bins the model with more directional bins did not much affect the model results but increased the computational time this finding is consistent with sensitivity analysis of gibbs et al 2012 for the gulf of mexico that showed increasing the resolution from 24 to 36 bins in swan did not have much effect on their results therefore two different scenarios with different breaker parameters were compared scenario 1 with constant γ and scenario 2 with γ according to eq 9 all other parameters and run controls were set constant sensitivity of the model performance to breaker parameter is presented in table 4 in order to better evaluate the model the study area was divided to three regions i shallow shelf d 30 m ii deep shelf 30 d 200 m and iii deep ocean d 200 m in the shallow shelf the wave heights calculated by the models with a constant γ and locally varying γ show nearly similar accuracy in other regions the varying γ significantly improves the accuracy in the calculated wave heights for example the calculated wave height peaks in the deep shelf and deep ocean are improved up to 69 and 82 percent respectively our results here showed that implementation of the locally varying γ improves h rms predictions however the results show that the varying γ has little impact on the calculated wave height in shallow waters shallow shelf this can be due to the low resolution of the sanp grid in the shallow shelf specified here the water depth and the wave characteristics such as the wave number which together are used to compute the varying γ from eq 9 change within a small spatial scale whereas the snap grid averages these parameters in a computational cell with grid spacing of 6 km by 4 km in contrast to the wave height in all regions the model with a constant γ calculates more accurate wave periods than the model with varying γ the empirical eq 9 for varying γ was calibrated based on the wave heights ruessink et al 2003 proposed this empirical equation to improve the accuracy of the predicted wave heights across inner bar troughs in shallow waters whereas they did not consider the influence of their varying γ on the calculated wave periods 3 1 4 wave motions of perfect storm october 1991 reference case the perfect storm a severe hybrid combined etc and tc event affected the us northeast from 28 october to 2 november 1991 this storm was initially an etc off the canadian maritimes then moved westward toward new england then southwestward well off the mid atlantic coast it returned northeastward and absorbed hurricane grace and finally became a small hurricane towards the end of its life cycle and made landfall west of halifax canada finally the storm dissipated after passing over prince edward island it is useful case study for the wave model because it was a very large storm and caused large waves over the entire model domain however it is also a difficult challenge for the model because it had multi directional winds and a mixture of wind seas and swell extratropical cyclones often showed higher model skill and lower rms errors figs 5 and 8 likely due to having more unidirectional winds and locally generated wind seas figs 11 and 12 depict the snapshots of the geographic distribution of modeled h s and t avg before panels a c near panel d and after panel e the time of spatio temporal maximum wave height on the snap grid the wind velocities reach their maxima near the storm center and the maximum wind velocity is from the southeast shoreward into gulf of maine near station 44024 northeast channel just northeast of georges bank the maximum wind speed continuously happens in the area near the storm center where the strongest atmospheric pressure gradient occurs the h s and t avg reach their maxima near the storm center southeast of nantucket on 30 october 1991 the distributions of wave characteristics off the us northeast during the perfect storm show a complex pattern around the rotational storm center due to the multi directional wind field spiraling around the moving storm on october 30 panel d of figs 11 and 12 winds to the north of the storm center were blowing at 25 33 ms 1 in the middle of domain with atmospheric pressure falling to a minimum of 985 hpa at the center of storm fig 11d as shown in figs 11d and 12d the storm created h s and t avg exceed 6 m and 9 s over the most part of the model domain the wave height rms errors are from 0 65 to 3 2 relative to observed peak wave heights of 4 13 m across all stations and model skill ranges are from 0 52 to 0 82 fig 5 the region with the highest h s and t avg is located near the buoy 44402 southeast block canyon the maximum h s is 14 m with a t avg of 15 s the wave period rms errors are from 0 68 to 3 8 relative to peak observed wave periods of 7 12 s and model skill ranges from 0 27 to 0 70 fig 8 the t avg model skill scores are actually lower for this storm compared with other etcs likely due to the challenge of capturing a mixture of wind seas and long distance traveling swell a comparison of figs 11 and 12 shows that a relationship and same geographic distribution pattern exist between h s and t avg time series during the etcs as wave height increases the wave period increases with the same ratio this directly results from the theoretical background of the wave model within the assumed spectral shape 3 2 comparing different fast wave models besides the observational data the model results secom mdo model were compared with those of the secom glerl model the glerl wave model is currently being used in the stevens nyhops forecasting system glerl is a parametric model of wind wave growth propagation and frictional decay and solves the two dimensional momentum conservation equations donelan 1977 glerl considers the generation and propagation of unidirectional waves while the spectral evolution is described by jonswap spectral shape however the model does not consider depth and current induced refraction nor radiation stress and wave setup induced by wave breaking table 5 gives the statistics for model observation comparisons for both the glerl and mdo wave models based upon these results summarized below we may conclude that mdo is clearly the better model for t avg whereas there are accurate results and no clear winner for h s for wave height the skill for mdo is slightly lower 0 75 and 0 76 for mdo and glerl respectively and rmse is slightly higher 0 75 and 0 73 m for mdo and glerl it can be seen that for mdo the h s is underestimated peak values while for glerl it is slightly overestimated for t avg the skill of mdo is substantially better than that of glerl 0 60 and 0 44 for mdo and glerl in addition mdo has relatively small biases whereas glerl is biased high finally the rmse of mdo 1 39 s is lower than that of glerl 2 36 s in addition table 5 shows the statistics of observational data and numerical results for glerl and mdo wave models over the different regions of the domain shallow shelf deep shelf and deep ocean the results show that mdo is obviously the better model for t avg while glerl is very slightly better for h s in the shallow shelf the h s calculated by the mdo and glerl show nearly similar accuracy however in the deep shelf and deep ocean regions glerl and mdo are more accurate for h s modeling respectively performance of the wave model depends strongly on the extent to which the physical processes are specified and energy is explicitly tracked by the model consequently more accurate wave modeling is possible as the numerical results have shown both mdo and glerl are very accurate for h s but less accurate for measures of t avg in addition glerl excludes refraction shallow water influences and current and stokes drift momentum exchange mellor et al 2008 a possible solution to obtain better results for t avg is re doing the analysis using a newer and more complex wave model there are a number of third generation numerical wave models that can be implemented for wind wave estimates in coastal areas e g swan however as one of the main goals of this study is to provide the rapid validated model for ocean forecasting and hazard assessment systems and as the third generated wave model is relatively slow still mdo can be one of the best options the rapid wave models mdo and glerl are much more computationally efficient for wind wave predictions due to their simplicity lin et al 2002 although mdo wave model is slower than glerl wave model the term fast is appropriate because it is a relative term contrasting it to the commonly used third generation 3g models the model is fundamentally much faster than 3g models because there are far fewer computations needed and smaller datasets to pass mdo and glerl have been shown to be relatively consistent with buoy data and observations in a few investigations and comparable to those obtained with the 3g model swan e g lin et al 1998 mellor et al 2008 marsooli et al 2017 the model results of mdo for hurricane katrina showed that the accuracy of the modeled wave properties is comparable to buoy data and the results produced by a 3g wave model mellor et al 2008 to further investigate the speed of mdo compared to a full spectrum 3g wave model marsooli et al 2017 applied mdo and swan to an idealized case study of wind generated waves and compared their computational costs they found that while both models produce nearly similar results swan is about 58 times more expensive than mdo marsooli et al 2017 we ran the same experiment using swan in its 2g mode that uses simplified parametric wave wave interactions and found the model was also slower than mdo in this case by a factor of 42 3 3 application of rapid wave models to simulation of waves and coastal flooding our interest in using mdo in place of glerl in our coupled modeling e g the stevens nyhops domain has been driven by a desire to include more aspects of wave physics in particular multidirectional waves refraction and wave setup and runup an additional related benefit is the substantial increase in accuracy for t avg that is observed with mdo table 5 and fig 10 the wave model results are moderately important for their effects on storm surges which is a primary focus of our forecasting and hazard assessment work one way the waves affect the storm surges is through wind stress which with secom mdo depends on wave age and with secom glerl depends on wave slope both the h s and t avg play an important role here and the use of an assumed spectral shape and focus on storm driven wind waves is reasonable the sea surface roughness for wave slope or wave age dependent wind drag formulations responds more to the small scale young wave field than the long period swell e g orton et al 2012 the results shown in this paper suggest a good accuracy with respect to these model results and likely good accuracy in their impacts on surge mdo is likely somewhat better in this regard due to its significantly smaller errors in t avg another important influence of the waves on storm tides is though the wave current combined bed stress which is included in both coupled models signell et al 1990 marsooli et al 2017 the assumed spectral shapes with these two rapid models may be a deficiency for cases where there is mixed swell and wind seas as the model will underestimate the wave influence on bed stress except for shallow water waves longer period waves have a larger influence on near bed currents in this paper we focus on powerful etcs which usually have a long relatively unidirectional wind fetch and rarely have a bimodal spectrum for tcs there is often a wider range of wind directions and this will often be a more significant weakness again mdo should be superior to glerl in its estimation of bed stress due to its better accuracy on t avg incorporation of wave setup can improve the representation of storm tides at harbor areas e g marsooli et al 2017 and beaches as hurricane sandy simulations revealed that wave setup caused increases in storm tide inside new york harbor of up to 26 cm as discussed at the start of the results section and shown in fig 4 the wave height to surge ratio is highest and waves are likely to be important for driving wave setup near the western gulf of maine coast however in new york bight this ratio is relatively low and waves are less important this may explain the past accuracy of the nyhops system e g georgas and blumberg 2009 orton et al 2012 in spite of using the coupled secom glerl model that neglects wave setup massachusetts bay is an example of an area where it is expected that wave setup has a larger role for coastal flooding beardsley et al 2013 chen et al 2013 as implied in fig 4 by a high wave height to surge ratio near the coast and we find that using the mdo wave model gives a significant improvement in surge estimates there fig 13 displays a validation scatterplot for observed and modeled surge for boston s tide gauge for all storms mdo results have mean bias around zero about 1 mm whereas the mean bias for glerl model is 8 4 cm an important underestimation that is likely driven by the lack of modeling of wave setup effects in addition to the prior results for new york harbor these results back up our expectation that in areas that wave setup is large secom mdo will outperform secom glerl for estimation of storm surge this expands upon the prior evidence that wave setup can be important for hurricane sandy storm surge at new york harbor marsooli et al 2017 in conclusion we can conclude that the mdo wave model is eventually a better candidate for rapid wave modeling and storm surge than the glerl wave model because it outperforms glerl in predicting wave period and storm surge use of the secom mdo model also opens the door to capturing the detailed influences of waves at beaches in principle the model can capture wave setup influences on water levels at beaches and wave runup can be computed using simulated wave height wavelength and foreshore beach slope e g stockdon et al 2006 wave runup estimates are already being added to storm tides by noaa usgs pilot study to forecast total water level usgs 2017 the accuracy of wave height and wavelength implied by wave period demonstrated in this paper shows that these computations are possible however the snap and nyhops grids used in the stevens flood advisory system sfas ensemble flood forecasting system do not have sufficient resolution to capture wave breaking zone processes in most these areas as these model grids were not developed with the goal of simulating wave affected coastal processes the present work may inspire creation of regional grids with improved nearshore resolution opening the door to useful improvements to forecasting capabilities and accuracy at wave affected shorelines 4 summary and concluding remarks historical extratropical cyclone wave modeling for the us northeast coastal ocean was performed with the 3d secom hydrodynamic model coupled with two rapid wave models i e mdo and glerl the model used pressure and wind reanalysis data to simulate 100 severe historical etcs the model results of h s and t avg were compared to the nbdc data at 77 sites off the us northeast coast the evaluation focused on the period within one day before and after the time of the peak wave height during each storm as that is of most interest for forecasting waves and erosion mdo is a spectral wave model with a parameterized spectral shape and results revealed good agreement for most storms with field observations for h s and moderate agreement for t avg wave height had an average rmse of 0 92 m and skill ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 wave period had an average rmse of 1 97 s and skill ranging from 0 5 to 0 70 the results showed that mdo is clearly a better model for t avg than glerl while both mdo and glerl are very accurate for h s nevertheless being a relatively new model the mdo model may benefit from more evaluation prior to operational use a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects of the breaker parameter and the number of directional bins used in mdo on the model performance the model results showed that increasing the directional bins does not much affect the model results but increases the computational time in the shallow shelf area the best statistical measures for h s and t avg are attained for the constant breaker parameter yet in the deep shelf and deep ocean areas the model with constant breaker parameter is superior in simulation of t avg while the model with variable breaker parameter has better results for h s this validated mdo wave model contains more aspects than the glerl model of wave physics that are relevant to storm tides e g wave setup and wave driven coastal damages e g multi directional waves and refraction it captures the most important processes related to storm related hazards yet its parameterization of the spectral shape enables it to be well over an order of magnitude faster than second and third generation spectral wave models this gives it promise for use in operational ensemble forecasting systems and to increase their capacity to resolve detailed wave driven processes such as wave setup runup whereas ensemble probabilistic flood forecasts have been found to be more helpful than deterministic forecasts for decision making it is crucial that all important physical processes are incorporated to facilitate an unbiased prediction of coastal impacts mdo provides a unique model fitting this purpose independent of the purpose of the third generation models which are more advanced and versatile yet much slower and often not usable for our purposes of ensemble forecasting and probabilistic assessment in closing we note that the application of the mdo model in deep water and even more so in shallow water remains a topic of research after considerable additional testing in a wide range of conditions the model may be useful for operational applications the validated mdo wave model was used here to investigate how historical storms waves have varied within the past century the results were used to demonstrate the locations where typical etc conditions lead to relatively important wave driven effects on coastal hazards demonstrating where the accurate incorporation of these wave effects with models like mdo will be most

23376,liquefaction of fine particle cargoes such as unprocessed nickel ore and iron ore resulting in cargo shift and loss of stability of ships has caused the loss of many lives in marine casualties over the recent few years in the paper the dem liquefaction model is presented followed by experimental data to validate the model by given three assumptions each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain according to the stress on the particles in pfc based on the ubcsand model various friction coefficients are used to represent various moisture contents the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model to capture the characteristics of the cargo from initial state to liquefied state and the interaction between cargo shift and the response of the 2d rectangular structure a parametric investigation is undertaken to identify the key parameters frequency amplitude and moisture content that trigger cargo liquefaction keywords solid bulk cargo cargo liquefaction dem liquefaction model 1 introduction over the past few years the risk of cargo liquefaction on ship safety has risen sharply the liquefaction of mineral ores such as iron ore and nickel ore can result in cargo displacement cargo shift and loss of ship stability which has been a major cause of marine casualties the ship s motion and the engine vibration during passage may cause particle re arrangement and compaction the gaps between the particles become smaller in the process with the corresponding pore pressure progressively increasing as a result the water holding ability of particles and the friction coefficient between cargoes decreases in particular the water in the interstellar spaces comes together to form a liquid layer that allows the cargo above to move relative to the cargo below as if the two layers were part of a liquid and hence the term liquefaction such a transition during ocean carriage can cause a sudden loss of stability of the carrying vessel in the last ten years more than ten ships capsized and sank due to a loss of hull stability attributed to the cargo liquefaction ju et al 2013 2017 especially stellar daisy from south korea capsized due to cargo liquefaction in march 2017 the above tragic accident is not the only one of its kind and unfortunately it will not be the last unless immediate and comprehensive action is taken by the industry to address the granular material liquefaction phenomena experimental works have been conducted by researchers the effects of soil water saturation on the liquefaction of hostun rf sand was designed and indicated that a low saturation level will increase liquefaction resistance arab et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 liquefaction of granular materials in a rectangular container has also been experimentally investigated and the authors developed some insights into how the liquefaction phenomenon related to the duration of liquefaction and intensity of excitation on a rectangular container based on two different materials sand and olive pomace containing various moisture contents koromila et al 2013 the experiments indicate that homogeneous cargo loading can lead to substantial loss of stability after cargo liquefaction even at small dynamic stresses on particles with sufficient periods of vibration the cargoes will lose effective stress and reach a state of failure unno et al 2006 most liquefaction models are based on continuum methods based on finite element method fem this effective stress model describes the stress strain behavior for saturated soils in soil dynamics terzaghi 1936 effective stress σ acting on soil is calculated from two parameters total stress σ and pore water pressure u following this many researchers have proposed different methods based on the effective model biot 1941 nurand and byerlee 1971 σ σ u since the application of the effective stress concept has made a great

unsaturated soil behavior jennings 1961 coleman 1962 blight 1967 sun et al 2007 bian 2007 the ubcsand model is widely used to predict soil liquefaction one of the first uses of the ubcsand model was to predict the behavior of the canlex canadian liquefaction experiment embankments puebla et al 1997 the fills were rapidly constructed on loose tailing deposits to create a liquefaction response this model was soon adapted to seismic evaluations and applied to the response analysis of the wildlife site and the superstition hills earthquake of 1987 beaty and byrne 1998 the liquefaction model based on commercial software plaxis was used to describe the mechanical behavior of soils under cyclic shear ju et al 2016 most of the methods for liquefaction are based on the effective stress model to establish a constitutive equation this lacks the study of discrete characteristics of cargo flow cargoes like iron ore and nickel ore behave like soils thus the dem modelling approach is widely used in the soil response analysis zhou et al 2009 dabeet et al 2012 2014 xue et al 2014 to study ship stability due to cargo movement a molecular dynamics method can be used to predict cargo shift and ship response in a holistic way spandonidis and spyrou 2013 2016 ju et al 2017 liu et al 2009 2011 the particles interact with each other and also with the ship hold in waves in a comprehensive manner which is a cargo sea ship problem and cannot be investigated separately with this in mind a simulation approach based on dem code is developed in the paper to identify the key parameters frequency amplitude and moisture content that trigger cargo liquefaction the approach can simulate the cargo shift and the interaction with ship hold especially the liquefaction process this approach will provide a better understanding of the cargo liquefaction problem which could possibly support a suitable regulatory framework for assessing the ship stability due to cargo shift so that decision making during the design loading and transport could be effective to avoid the ship capsize and casualties 2 numerical models the adopted modelling approach is explained in this part the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model to capture the characteristics of the cargo from initial state to liquefied state and the interaction between cargo shift and the response of the 2d rectangular structure based on the dem theory the flow of the particles can be simulated by the newton s second law to obtain the dynamic stress on each sphere accordingly elastic plastic strain of each particle can be calculated by the ubcsand model and the pore water pressure can be obtained by the hydraulic model based on the assumptions that each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles the elastic plastic strain can be calculated by obtaining the stress on the particles as described in section 2 2 then the radius of ball can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain by changing the size of particles at the end of every time step the flow characteristics of cargoes in various moisture content can be approximately modelled by according friction coefficient the dem liquefaction model will be developed the commercial software particle flow code pfc is based on dem which simulates the movement of granular particles and the interaction between particles the particles are rigid which move independently translate and rotate the interaction between particles is based on the means of pair wise contacts contact mechanics is embodied in particle interaction laws that update the internal forces and moments the time evolution of this system is computed which provides an explicit dynamic solution to newton s laws of motion pfc help manual elastic plastic strain of particles will be formed during compaction according to the dynamic stress on particles the elastic plastic strain can be identified based on the ubcsand model with the deformation of each particle the degree of saturation can be obtained and the pore water pressure can be calculated according to the soil water characteristic curve swcc when conducting the laboratory experiments the pore water pressure can be tested by the pressure sensor to validate the model the cycle sequence is the sequence of operations that are executed during a single pfc cycle these operations include fig 1 1 timestep determination the dem method requires a valid finite timestep to ensure the numerical stability of the model and that all contacts are created between pieces prior to the point that forces moments develop between interacting bodies 2 law of motion the position and velocity of each ball is updated according to newton s laws of motion using the current timestep and the forces moments calculated during the previous cycle 3 strain calculation based on ubcsand model the dynamic stress on one sphere is calculated based on the equation in section 2 2 françois nicot et al 2013 according to the stress on the particles the elastic plastic strain is updated by scaling the radius of each particle using the yield surface then degree of saturation will be calculated 4 contact properties with the updated degree of saturation the contact properties are updated through changing the friction coefficient of each ball 5 advance time the model time is advanced by adding the current timestep to the previous model time 6 contact detection contacts are dynamically created deleted based on the current piece positions 7 force displacement law the forces moments developing at each contact are updated using the current state of the pieces 2 1 contact force and stress the force acting on each sphere due to interaction with all its neighbouring particles is calculated based on the rolling resistance linear model in the pfc pfc help manual it has advantages in describing the granular particles motion and the angles of repose which incorporates rolling torque to control the roll motion acting on the contacting particles the internal force and moment f c and m c act at the contact location in an equal and opposite sense on the two pieces the relative displacement increment of each particle during a time step is given according to the force displacement law which consists of the following steps 1 update the linear normal force and the linear shear force 2 update the dashpot normal force and the dashpot shear force 3 update the rolling resistance moment f c f l f d m c m r both forces are resolved into normal and shear forces f l f n l f s l f d f n d f s d f s l μ f n l the rolling resistance moment is expressed by m r μ r r f n l f l the linear force f d the dashpot force m r the rolling resistance moment r the contact effective radius μ the friction coefficient μ r the rolling resistance coefficient the dynamic stress of each particle is defined and calculated during shaking for granular assemblies in a dynamic regime a definition of a mean stress tensor is more disputable a consistent definition must involve not only contact forces between particles but also inertia effects of grains subjected to dynamic effects fortin et al 2003

cargo liquefaction will go through a longer term process during carriage the pore water pressure can be calculated according to the soil water characteristic curve swcc which relates to the water content or degree of saturation to pore water pressure 2 4 model input parameters the principal framework will address the ship cargo liquefaction problem based on the dem the model input parameters include three parts deformation parameters hydraulic parameters and contact model parameters as shown in table 1 according to contact force and moment the particle movement will be updated according to newton s second law during the same time step in calculating the stress on the particles the strain of particles will be identified based on the ubcsand model with the development of the degree of saturation the pore water pressure and contact model parameter particularly the friction coefficient at various moisture contents degree of saturation will be updated therefore cargo displacement due to cargo liquefaction can be regarded in a holistic manner which can offer the unique capability to model the liquefaction problem 3 assumptions the particle flow code pfc cannot achieve the elastic plastic strain as the ball is considered as a rigid body further the moisture between particles cannot be presented based on the code therefore some assumptions are specified before using the dem to address the liquefaction problem 1 in the commercial pfc software particles are assumed to be spheres if one sphere is regarded as one particle of the cargo it is difficult to initialize the hypothetical porosity of particles the size distribution and monitor the pore water pressure therefore each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles including many solid particles water and air the porosity of the particles is also a hypothetical porosity during compaction the air will be expelled when the unsaturated state becomes saturated the volume of air becomes nil and the water will attach the specific solid particles permanently which cannot flow out water and air cannot be transferred to neighbouring artificial particles as a result of exerted elastic plastic strain 2 the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain to change the size at the end of every time step according to the stress on the particles in pfc based on the ubcsand model the amplitude of the strain depends on the artificial deformation parameters 3 various friction coefficients can be used to represent various moisture contents cargo behavior at different mcs can be described by the appropriate friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient if the friction coefficient can be identified at different mcs by laboratory experiments the flow characteristics of cargoes can be approximately modelled taking no account of moisture the friction coefficient will be updated in the liquefaction model during compaction according to the existing fitting equations between friction coefficient and moisture content based on the assumptions above the dem liquefaction model can predict the cargo flow deformation and liquefaction phenomenon some validations are presented in the following section based on the dem liquefaction model however the interaction between water air and solid skeleton are neglected which may decrease the accuracy of the prediction 4 contact properties the moisture content of a cargo is vitally important to transportation safety as a matter of fact the cargo in nature contains certain moisture more or less and it is the moisture that leads to cargo shift which results in a large angle of heel although the moisture in the cargo is not visibly wet in appearance classnk conducted the laboratory experiment that the behavior of the nickel ore stored in the container was observed by inclining the container statically up to the maximum inclined angle of 50 fig 3 at low moisture content mc nickel ore shows great inertia along with the increasing of mc nickel ore begins to show the characters of fluid therefore mc is the key factor which cannot be neglected in the simulations according to the assumption above mc of the cargo is described by correspondent friction coefficient the static incline test is simulated by pfc2d software to identify the contact properties of nickel ore at various mc fig 3 with the quantitative comparison of numerical results with experimental data by changing the friction coefficient of the particle the state of the cargo inside the container is compared with the experimental data from classnk to identify the relation between the friction coefficient and mc table 2 shows the correspondent friction coefficient between particles at various mc from it can be seen that when the moisture content is close to 0 36 0 37 the friction coefficient has the abrupt change from 0 7 to 0 3 the possible reason is that when the friction coefficient is larger than 0 3 the friction can resist the flow of the particles at the inclined angle of 50 if the friction coefficient reaches 0 3 the particles begins to flow because of the angle of repose on account of the assumption above dem can effectively simulate the flow characteristic of the moist bulk cargo ju et al 2017 5 numerical validation 5 1 dem numerical validation a prescribed sway oscillation test is conducted to identify the sensitivities of the particle size and time step size in pfc software sway oscillations of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm with amplitude of 0 3 m and frequency of 0 5hz are investigated to identify the influence of the container motion on cargo shift see fig 4 details of overall particle size and time step size are listed in table 3 the same mass of cargo with 201 06 kg is applied in the simulations and the density of the particle is 2500 kg m 3 the time history curves of the fluctuation force on the container and the gravity center in fig 5 and fig 6 indicates that the results on different particle numbers and different time step sizes show little difference which demonstrates that pfc software shows good computational stability the measuring process of the fluctuation force is to identify the contact particles with container wall firstly then calculate the global contact force according to the contact models during the rolling motion the porosity of the cargo decreases resulting in a slight motion in vertical direction the fluctuation force on the container and the gravity centre of cargoes with the particle numbers of 2844 and the time step size of 0 0001s during the oscillation test almost coincide with those with the particle numbers of 256 and the time step size of 0 001s considering an increased computing time as list in tab 3 the time step size of 0 0001s is used in the following simulations and the particle size is dependent on the situation 5 2 simple shear test the simple shear test is a laboratory testing method used to directly determine the shear modulus of soil the principle of the test is inducing simple shear in a cylindrical soil sample usually peat the cylindrical soil sample is confined by a flexible wire reinforced rubber membrane usually inside metal rings the sample is placed between the base pedestal and the top cap vertical stress is applied to the sample from the top cap the sample is sheared by moving the rings from side to side this vertical load creates a total normal stress σ in the simple shear test the shearing takes places over the entire height of the sample therefore the shearing strain γ can be measured in the simple shear test as jean louis briaud 2013 γ δ x h 0 where δ x is the difference in horizontal movement between the top and the bottom of the sample and h 0 is the initial height of the sample the shear stress τ is measured as the shear force divided by the cross sectional area of the sample thus the simple shear test gives the shear stress strain curve for the sample and therefore a shear modulus g if for the unsaturated state the testing procedure is the same except for the measurement of the water stress such as a tensiometer a dss specimen filled with balls is considered for the pfc simulations first balls are first randomly generated inside the specimen consolidation of the simulated specimen is performed by displacing the top and bottom boundaries in the negative and positive y direction respectively to achieve a desired vertical effective stress σ v for example the value of 100 kpa in the simple shear test spin velocity is 0 01 l m s l is the length of the shearing specimen cuomo et al 2016 conducted simple shear tests on the unsaturated soil and saturated soil the soil is loose and has a metastable structure along steep slope the soil specific gravity gs is equal to 2 55 two experimental tests with saturated condition and unsaturated condition were conducted as shown in table 4 and the samples in pfc are shown in fig 7 the experimental conditions and model parameters used in the simulation are given in table 5 the mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils is related to matric suction and water content or degree of saturation fig 8 as shown in fig 9 when shearing to a certain extent the specimens lose shear strength which causes destruction the simulation data shows good agreement with experimental data 5 3 cyclic shear test the model parameters used in cyclic shear test are given in table 5 fig 10 presents the typical stress path and stress strain response for a simulation with cyclic stress ratio csr shear stress vertical effective stress of 0 08 and vertical effective stress of 100 kpa a gradual drop of vertical effective stress is observed from an initial value of 100 kpa with the application of cyclic shear until it reaches σ v c a value of about 50 kpa followed by a sudden overall drop of σ v c during the last two cycles this is associated with the development of relatively large shear strains during the last two cycles of loading during the shearing progress the bulk modulus and shear modulus of the specimen decrease according to the ubcsand liquefaction model at the last two cycles the deformation of cargoes is obvious due to the low bulk modulus and shear modulus after many cyclic shearing causing a sudden drop of vertical effective stress during cyclic shearing a constant volume condition is enforced it has been shown that the vertical stress acting on the top and bottom boundaries decreases gradually based on the dem liquefaction model developed in the paper at a constant of confining pressure 100 kpa and initial degree of saturation of 100 specimen gradually is sheared and the effective stress decreases when the shear modulus decreases to some extent the shear strain suddenly becomes obvious especially at the last several shearing cycles which is similar to the experiment phenomenon indicating shear failure compared to the experimental results this further shows that the modelling approach presented in the paper is suitable for addressing the cyclic behavior of the specimen and the liquefaction behavior of cargoes 6 liquefaction test according to the numerical validations this dem liquefaction model can simulate the simple and cyclic shear stress strain responses of the sample during the voyage the material is exposed to mechanical agitation and energy input resulting in a gradual settling and compaction of the cargo the cargo turns into a viscous fluid gradually by specifying the movement of container or ship hold the whole process of liquefaction can be determined by this liquefaction model in the form of time domain analysis section 2 introduced contact parameters deformation parameters and hydraulic parameters which need to be identified based on experimental methods when studying ship response due to cargo shift energy input like wave parameters also need to be provided based on the liquefaction model developed in the paper parametric investigation can be undertaken to identify the key parameters that trigger cargo instabilities to investigate the root causes as well as those that trigger the liquefaction phenomenon in order to address the problem in a comprehensive manner before applying this liquefaction model properties of cargo need to be identified by laboratory experiments including the friction coefficient at different moisture contents contact model parameters bulk strengths deformation parameters and swccs hydraulic parameters 1 contact model parameters during compaction the contact properties like friction coefficient will be updated according to section 4 the flow characteristic varying with the degree of saturation or mc needs to be determined by the static incline test 2 deformation parameters according to the stress on the particles the elastic plastic strain of particles can be calculated deformation parameters will be obtained by simple shear and cyclic shear tests using an experimental approach meanwhile with the deformation parameters simple shear and cyclic shear tests will further verify the numerical method 3 hydraulic parameters the soil water characteristic curves swccs relate the water content or degree of saturation to the pore water pressure matrix suction of a granular material according to the initial degree of saturation and the elastic plastic strain during compaction the updated degree of saturation of particles will be calculated the contact properties like friction coefficient can be determined to update the movement of the particles meantime according to the swcc the pore water pressure can be validated by the pressure sensor in the experiment employing the liquefaction model with the given parameters above some information related to cargo liquefaction can be determined 1 evolution of the degree of saturation of each particle 2 liquefied percentage for all particles 3 liquefaction zone 4 the fluctuation forces on the hold or container 6 1 hypothetical property of a cargo given a hypothetical property of a cargo see table 6 we can identify what factors such as amplitude frequency or moisture trigger cargo liquefaction during the carriage the cargoes may experience compaction although the moisture content does not change the degree of saturation increases during the compaction therefore according to table 2 the density of the particle 2500 kg m 3 and the relation between moisture content and degree of saturation as followed below the friction coefficient related to dos is calculated dos mc r s e r w n e 1 e dos degree of saturation mc moisture content r s unit weight of the particle r w unit weight of water n porosity e void ratio in fact when the degree of saturation increases the friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient decrease therefore the relation of friction coefficient to the degree of saturation should be identified by the experimental approach before the assessment of cargo liquefaction two fitting equations are presented to describe the relation between the friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient and the degree of saturation according to the simulation data and the equation above from classnk which can be implemented into the dem liquefaction model as shown in fig 11 deformation parameters and hydraulic parameters also need to be determined by laboratory experiment in the following liquefaction simulations the validation properties in tab 6 will be used f r i c 0 9 0 d o s 48 0 8 48 d o s 69 599492 e ˆ 18 95 d o s 69 d o s 100 r f r i c 0 6 0 d o s 71 8 0 d o s 6 45 71 d o s 80

packed granular material into a highly viscous liquid the phenomenon occurs when fine grain ore cargoes with sufficient amounts of moisture in their mass excited by ship motions and vibration under cyclic or impulsive loading the material concentrates due to micro scale particle movement which yields a reduction of the pore space inside the soil skeleton and increases the pore water pressure if the water cannot be migrated by means of a drainage system the increased pore pressure will reduce the shear strength of the granular material the hexapod tests conducted by consulting firm marin of australia twg 2013 as shown in fig 12 which showed that at high moisture contents cracks will occur in the cargo surface free surface apparent in the corners of the ship hold can be shaped after shaking and a considerable compaction has occurred from the initial state the water flows out to the bottom to form the wet base the peak pile of cargoes turns to the flat pile which is the typical process during liquefaction as described above the dem liquefaction model based on pfc2d commercial software is used to simulate the whole process of liquefaction in a 2d rectangular structure 0 2 m 0 2 m as shown in fig 13 as seen from the simulation results and compared with fig 12 this model used in the paper can fully describe the liquefaction phenomenon from the initial state to liquefied state the size of the particle is scaled by obtaining the elastic plastic strain according to the stress on the particles based on the ubcsand model roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 0 2 m 0 2 m with an amplitude of 0 3 rad and frequency of 1hz is investigated to identify the influence of the structure motion on cargo shift especially to address the liquefaction phenomenon from fig 14 shown below the cargoes close to the wall are liquefied first small size when cargoes liquefy they have enough space to move resulting in more severe collisions as seen in fig 15 taking one ball with id 106 in consideration the degree of saturation increases to 100 from an initial degree of 50 at 20s note that some balls liquefy in a very short period of time according to the stress placed on them at 50s the liquefied percent reaches 100 which means all of particles liquefy the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the container increases suddenly 6 3 liquefaction assessment criterion liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil are reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid loading generally if the effective stress of the soil decreases to zero the soil turns liquefied as defined in soil mechanics when compaction occurs the water will accumulate the pore water pressure which presses the particles apart however in consideration of the actual application of cargo liquefaction in a cargo ship cargo behavior in the whole process should be captured for the coupled motion between the cargo shift and ship motion in waves the model used in the paper can address the problem of transitioning from unsaturated state to saturated state and fulfilling engineering application requests from fig 15 when the liquefied percentage reaches 100 the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the container increases suddenly and behaves like a fluid therefore regarding the 100 degree of saturation defined as the liquefaction criteria is reasonable 7 dynamic response analysis roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm varying in amplitude frequency and initial degree of saturation of cargoes is investigated to identify the influence of the container s motion on cargo shift especially in order to predict the liquefaction phenomenon see fig 16 roll oscillation with varying initial degrees of saturation of cargoes is tested see fig 17 fig 18 fig 19 following this roll oscillation with the frequency of 1hz and the initial degree of saturation of 50 varying by amplitudes is tested see fig 20 and fig 21 roll oscillation with the amplitude of 0 3 rad and the initial degree of saturation of 50 varying by frequencies is tested see fig 22 and fig 23 roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm varying in amplitude frequency and initial degree of saturation of cargoes is investigated to address the liquefaction phenomenon it can be concluded that cargoes have a high tendency to flow with higher initial mcs of cargoes and higher frequencies and amplitudes of external loading as discussed below 1 as shown in fig 18 the ball id 106 with an initial degree of saturation of 50 liquefied at 20s while the ball with an initial degree of saturation of 60 and 70 liquefied in several seconds according to the liquefaction model the bulk modulus and shear modulus are small with a high level of initial degree of saturation at the same external energy input the cargoes with a higher degree of saturation have lower liquefaction resistance thus the cargoes containing a low level of degree of saturation will experience a longer time to reach a liquefied state 2 if the amplitude and the frequency are constant the flowability of cargoes at the initial degree of saturation of 50 is more evident than at the initial degree of saturation of 60 or 70 the reason is that when the degree of saturation is high the air contained in the sample is low therefore it can be seen from fig 19 that the radius of liquefied cargoes is larger at the degree of saturation of 50 than others however if under the same initial conditions it can be seen that cargoes with a high initial degree of saturation will have large flowability as shown in fig 19 cargoes with an initial degree of saturation of 50 contribute small fluctuation force on the container as the cargoes have large shear strength to restrain cargo shift when the cargoes reach the liquefied percentage of 100 this causes cargoes to behave like liquid gradually similarly cargo is less resistant to liquefaction with high energy input on the container see figs 20 23 8 conclusions a dem liquefaction model was developed to address the liquefaction phenomenon the granular material is considered as moist material by applying various friction coefficients the dem combined with the ubcsabnd model can effectively capture the cyclic shear behavior liquefaction phenomena and discrete characteristics of granular materials based on the assumptions the validations were carried out to confirm the accuracy of the dem liquefaction model time domain analysis of cargo liquefaction was conducted to identify the evolution of the degree of saturation of each particle liquefied percentage for all particles liquefaction zone and the fluctuation forces on the ship hold when the liquefied percentage reaches 100 the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the ship hold shaped container will increase suddenly therefore the definition of 100 degree of saturation liquefied cargoes in the model regarded as the liquefaction criteria is effective and reasonable it is also concluded that the higher initial degree of saturation of cargoes higher frequency and amplitude of the external loading on the container leads to less liquefaction resistance of the cargoes the simulation results indicate that the dem liquefaction model can predict the liquefaction phenomenon of the cargoes after comparing with experimental data the assumptions are the novel features of this new approach but they need to be further validated by more laboratory experiments based on the approach developed it will provide a better understanding of the liquefaction phenomenon of solid bulk cargo that interacts with ship vessel motion identification and quantification of the controlling parameters acknowledgements this

23376,liquefaction of fine particle cargoes such as unprocessed nickel ore and iron ore resulting in cargo shift and loss of stability of ships has caused the loss of many lives in marine casualties over the recent few years in the paper the dem liquefaction model is presented followed by experimental data to validate the model by given three assumptions each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain according to the stress on the particles in pfc based on the ubcsand model various friction coefficients are used to represent various moisture contents the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model to capture the characteristics of the cargo from initial state to liquefied state and the interaction between cargo shift and the response of the 2d rectangular structure a parametric investigation is undertaken to identify the key parameters frequency amplitude and moisture content that trigger cargo liquefaction keywords solid bulk cargo cargo liquefaction dem liquefaction model 1 introduction over the past few years the risk of cargo liquefaction on ship safety has risen sharply the liquefaction of mineral ores such as iron ore and nickel ore can result in cargo displacement cargo shift and loss of ship stability which has been a major cause of marine casualties the ship s motion and the engine vibration during passage may cause particle re arrangement and compaction the gaps between the particles become smaller in the process with the corresponding pore pressure progressively increasing as a result the water holding ability of particles and the friction coefficient between cargoes decreases in particular the water in the interstellar spaces comes together to form a liquid layer that allows the cargo above to move relative to the cargo below as if the two layers were part of a liquid and hence the term liquefaction such a transition during ocean carriage can cause a sudden loss of stability of the carrying vessel in the last ten years more than ten ships capsized and sank due to a loss of hull stability attributed to the cargo liquefaction ju et al 2013 2017 especially stellar daisy from south korea capsized due to cargo liquefaction in march 2017 the above tragic accident is not the only one of its kind and unfortunately it will not be the last unless immediate and comprehensive action is taken by the industry to address the granular material liquefaction phenomena experimental works have been conducted by researchers the effects of soil water saturation on the liquefaction of hostun rf sand was designed and indicated that a low saturation level will increase liquefaction resistance arab et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 liquefaction of granular materials in a rectangular container has also been experimentally investigated and the authors developed some insights into how the liquefaction phenomenon related to the duration of liquefaction and intensity of excitation on a rectangular container based on two different materials sand and olive pomace containing various moisture contents koromila et al 2013 the experiments indicate that homogeneous cargo loading can lead to substantial loss of stability after cargo liquefaction even at small dynamic stresses on particles with sufficient periods of vibration the cargoes will lose effective stress and reach a state of failure unno et al 2006 most liquefaction models are based on continuum methods based on finite element method fem this effective stress model describes the stress strain behavior for saturated soils in soil dynamics terzaghi 1936 effective stress σ acting on soil is calculated from two parameters total stress σ and pore water pressure u following this many researchers have proposed different methods based on the effective model biot 1941 nurand and byerlee 1971 σ σ u since the application of the effective stress concept has made a great

unsaturated soil behavior jennings 1961 coleman 1962 blight 1967 sun et al 2007 bian 2007 the ubcsand model is widely used to predict soil liquefaction one of the first uses of the ubcsand model was to predict the behavior of the canlex canadian liquefaction experiment embankments puebla et al 1997 the fills were rapidly constructed on loose tailing deposits to create a liquefaction response this model was soon adapted to seismic evaluations and applied to the response analysis of the wildlife site and the superstition hills earthquake of 1987 beaty and byrne 1998 the liquefaction model based on commercial software plaxis was used to describe the mechanical behavior of soils under cyclic shear ju et al 2016 most of the methods for liquefaction are based on the effective stress model to establish a constitutive equation this lacks the study of discrete characteristics of cargo flow cargoes like iron ore and nickel ore behave like soils thus the dem modelling approach is widely used in the soil response analysis zhou et al 2009 dabeet et al 2012 2014 xue et al 2014 to study ship stability due to cargo movement a molecular dynamics method can be used to predict cargo shift and ship response in a holistic way spandonidis and spyrou 2013 2016 ju et al 2017 liu et al 2009 2011 the particles interact with each other and also with the ship hold in waves in a comprehensive manner which is a cargo sea ship problem and cannot be investigated separately with this in mind a simulation approach based on dem code is developed in the paper to identify the key parameters frequency amplitude and moisture content that trigger cargo liquefaction the approach can simulate the cargo shift and the interaction with ship hold especially the liquefaction process this approach will provide a better understanding of the cargo liquefaction problem which could possibly support a suitable regulatory framework for assessing the ship stability due to cargo shift so that decision making during the design loading and transport could be effective to avoid the ship capsize and casualties 2 numerical models the adopted modelling approach is explained in this part the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model to capture the characteristics of the cargo from initial state to liquefied state and the interaction between cargo shift and the response of the 2d rectangular structure based on the dem theory the flow of the particles can be simulated by the newton s second law to obtain the dynamic stress on each sphere accordingly elastic plastic strain of each particle can be calculated by the ubcsand model and the pore water pressure can be obtained by the hydraulic model based on the assumptions that each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles the elastic plastic strain can be calculated by obtaining the stress on the particles as described in section 2 2 then the radius of ball can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain by changing the size of particles at the end of every time step the flow characteristics of cargoes in various moisture content can be approximately modelled by according friction coefficient the dem liquefaction model will be developed the commercial software particle flow code pfc is based on dem which simulates the movement of granular particles and the interaction between particles the particles are rigid which move independently translate and rotate the interaction between particles is based on the means of pair wise contacts contact mechanics is embodied in particle interaction laws that update the internal forces and moments the time evolution of this system is computed which provides an explicit dynamic solution to newton s laws of motion pfc help manual elastic plastic strain of particles will be formed during compaction according to the dynamic stress on particles the elastic plastic strain can be identified based on the ubcsand model with the deformation of each particle the degree of saturation can be obtained and the pore water pressure can be calculated according to the soil water characteristic curve swcc when conducting the laboratory experiments the pore water pressure can be tested by the pressure sensor to validate the model the cycle sequence is the sequence of operations that are executed during a single pfc cycle these operations include fig 1 1 timestep determination the dem method requires a valid finite timestep to ensure the numerical stability of the model and that all contacts are created between pieces prior to the point that forces moments develop between interacting bodies 2 law of motion the position and velocity of each ball is updated according to newton s laws of motion using the current timestep and the forces moments calculated during the previous cycle 3 strain calculation based on ubcsand model the dynamic stress on one sphere is calculated based on the equation in section 2 2 françois nicot et al 2013 according to the stress on the particles the elastic plastic strain is updated by scaling the radius of each particle using the yield surface then degree of saturation will be calculated 4 contact properties with the updated degree of saturation the contact properties are updated through changing the friction coefficient of each ball 5 advance time the model time is advanced by adding the current timestep to the previous model time 6 contact detection contacts are dynamically created deleted based on the current piece positions 7 force displacement law the forces moments developing at each contact are updated using the current state of the pieces 2 1 contact force and stress the force acting on each sphere due to interaction with all its neighbouring particles is calculated based on the rolling resistance linear model in the pfc pfc help manual it has advantages in describing the granular particles motion and the angles of repose which incorporates rolling torque to control the roll motion acting on the contacting particles the internal force and moment f c and m c act at the contact location in an equal and opposite sense on the two pieces the relative displacement increment of each particle during a time step is given according to the force displacement law which consists of the following steps 1 update the linear normal force and the linear shear force 2 update the dashpot normal force and the dashpot shear force 3 update the rolling resistance moment f c f l f d m c m r both forces are resolved into normal and shear forces f l f n l f s l f d f n d f s d f s l μ f n l the rolling resistance moment is expressed by m r μ r r f n l f l the linear force f d the dashpot force m r the rolling resistance moment r the contact effective radius μ the friction coefficient μ r the rolling resistance coefficient the dynamic stress of each particle is defined and calculated during shaking for granular assemblies in a dynamic regime a definition of a mean stress tensor is more disputable a consistent definition must involve not only contact forces between particles but also inertia effects of grains subjected to dynamic effects fortin et al 2003

to newton s second law during the same time step in calculating the stress on the particles the strain of particles will be identified based on the ubcsand model with the development of the degree of saturation the pore water pressure and contact model parameter particularly the friction coefficient at various moisture contents degree of saturation will be updated therefore cargo displacement due to cargo liquefaction can be regarded in a holistic manner which can offer the unique capability to model the liquefaction problem 3 assumptions the particle flow code pfc cannot achieve the elastic plastic strain as the ball is considered as a rigid body further the moisture between particles cannot be presented based on the code therefore some assumptions are specified before using the dem to address the liquefaction problem 1 in the commercial pfc software particles are assumed to be spheres if one sphere is regarded as one particle of the cargo it is difficult to initialize the hypothetical porosity of particles the size distribution and monitor the pore water pressure therefore each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles including many solid particles water and air the porosity of the particles is also a hypothetical porosity during compaction the air will be expelled when the unsaturated state becomes saturated the volume of air becomes nil and the water will attach the specific solid particles permanently which cannot flow out water and air cannot be transferred to neighbouring artificial particles as a result of exerted elastic plastic strain 2 the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain to change the size at the end of every time step according to the stress on the particles in pfc based on the ubcsand model the amplitude of the strain depends on the artificial deformation parameters 3 various friction coefficients can be used to represent various moisture contents cargo behavior at different mcs can be described by the appropriate friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient if the friction coefficient can be identified at different mcs by laboratory experiments the flow characteristics of cargoes can be approximately modelled taking no account of moisture the friction coefficient will be updated in the liquefaction model during compaction according to the existing fitting equations between friction coefficient and moisture content based on the assumptions above the dem liquefaction model can predict the cargo flow deformation and liquefaction phenomenon some validations are presented in the following section based on the dem liquefaction model however the interaction between water air and solid skeleton are neglected which may decrease the accuracy of the prediction 4 contact properties the moisture content of a cargo is vitally important to transportation safety as a matter of fact the cargo in nature contains certain moisture more or less and it is the moisture that leads to cargo shift which results in a large angle of heel although the moisture in the cargo is not visibly wet in appearance classnk conducted the laboratory experiment that the behavior of the nickel ore stored in the container was observed by inclining the container statically up to the maximum inclined angle of 50 fig 3 at low moisture content mc nickel ore shows great inertia along with the increasing of mc nickel ore begins to show the characters of fluid therefore mc is the key factor which cannot be neglected in the simulations according to the assumption above mc of the cargo is described by correspondent friction coefficient the static incline test is simulated by pfc2d software to identify the contact properties of nickel ore at various mc fig 3 with the quantitative comparison of numerical results with experimental data by changing the friction coefficient of the particle the state of the cargo inside the container is compared with the experimental data from classnk to identify the relation between the friction coefficient and mc table 2 shows the correspondent friction coefficient between particles at various mc from it can be seen that when the moisture content is close to 0 36 0 37 the friction coefficient has the abrupt change from 0 7 to 0 3 the possible reason is that when the friction coefficient is larger than 0 3 the friction can resist the flow of the particles at the inclined angle of 50 if the friction coefficient reaches 0 3 the particles begins to flow because of the angle of repose on account of the assumption above dem can effectively simulate the flow characteristic of the moist bulk cargo ju et al 2017 5 numerical validation 5 1 dem numerical validation a prescribed sway oscillation test is conducted to identify the sensitivities of the particle size and time step size in pfc software sway oscillations of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm with amplitude of 0 3 m and frequency of 0 5hz are investigated to identify the influence of the container motion on cargo shift see fig 4 details of overall particle size and time step size are listed in table 3 the same mass of cargo with 201 06 kg is applied in the simulations and the density of the particle is 2500 kg m 3 the time history curves of the fluctuation force on the container and the gravity center in fig 5 and fig 6 indicates that the results on different particle numbers and different time step sizes show little difference which demonstrates that pfc software shows good computational stability the measuring process of the fluctuation force is to identify the contact particles with container wall firstly then calculate the global contact force according to the contact models during the rolling motion the porosity of the cargo decreases resulting in a slight motion in vertical direction the fluctuation force on the container and the gravity centre of cargoes with the particle numbers of 2844 and the time step size of 0 0001s during the oscillation test almost coincide with those with the particle numbers of 256 and the time step size of 0 001s considering an increased computing time as list in tab 3 the time step size of 0 0001s is used in the following simulations and the particle size is dependent on the situation 5 2 simple shear test the simple shear test is a laboratory testing method used to directly determine the shear modulus of soil the principle of the test is inducing simple shear in a cylindrical soil sample usually peat the cylindrical soil sample is confined by a flexible wire reinforced rubber membrane usually inside metal rings the sample is placed between the base pedestal and the top cap vertical stress is applied to the sample from the top cap the sample is sheared by moving the rings from side to side this vertical load creates a total normal stress σ in the simple shear test the shearing takes places over the entire height of the sample therefore the shearing strain γ can be measured in the simple shear test as jean louis briaud 2013 γ δ x h 0 where δ x is the difference in horizontal movement between the top and the bottom of the sample and h 0 is the initial height of the sample the shear stress τ is measured as the shear force divided by the cross sectional area of the sample thus the simple shear test gives the shear stress strain curve for the sample and therefore a shear modulus g if for the unsaturated state the testing procedure is the same except for the measurement of the water stress such as a tensiometer a dss specimen filled with balls is considered for the pfc simulations first balls are first randomly generated inside the specimen consolidation of the simulated specimen is performed by displacing the top and bottom boundaries in the negative and positive y direction respectively to achieve a desired vertical effective stress σ v for example the value of 100 kpa in the simple shear test spin velocity is 0 01 l m s l is the length of the shearing specimen cuomo et al 2016 conducted simple shear tests on the unsaturated soil and saturated soil the soil is loose and has a metastable structure along steep slope the soil specific gravity gs is equal to 2 55 two experimental tests with saturated condition and unsaturated condition were conducted as shown in table 4 and the samples in pfc are shown in fig 7 the experimental conditions and model parameters used in the simulation are given in table 5 the mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils is related to matric suction and water content or degree of saturation fig 8 as shown in fig 9 when shearing to a certain extent the specimens lose shear strength which causes destruction the simulation data shows good agreement with experimental data 5 3 cyclic shear test the model parameters used in cyclic shear test are given in table 5 fig 10 presents the typical stress path and stress strain response for a simulation with cyclic stress ratio csr shear stress vertical effective stress of 0 08 and vertical effective stress of 100 kpa a gradual drop of vertical effective stress is observed from an initial value of 100 kpa with the application of cyclic shear until it reaches σ v c a value of about 50 kpa followed by a sudden overall drop of σ v c during the last two cycles this is associated with the development of relatively large shear strains during the last two cycles of loading during the shearing progress the bulk modulus and shear modulus of the specimen decrease according to the ubcsand liquefaction model at the last two cycles the deformation of cargoes is obvious due to the low bulk modulus and shear modulus after many cyclic shearing causing a sudden drop of vertical effective stress during cyclic shearing a constant volume condition is enforced it has been shown that the vertical stress acting on the top and bottom boundaries decreases gradually based on the dem liquefaction model developed in the paper at a constant of confining pressure 100 kpa and initial degree of saturation of 100 specimen gradually is sheared and the effective stress decreases when the shear modulus decreases to some extent the shear strain suddenly becomes obvious especially at the last several shearing cycles which is similar to the experiment phenomenon indicating shear failure compared to the experimental results this further shows that the modelling approach presented in the paper is suitable for addressing the cyclic behavior of the specimen and the liquefaction behavior of cargoes 6 liquefaction test according to the numerical validations this dem liquefaction model can simulate the simple and cyclic shear stress strain responses of the sample during the voyage the material is exposed to mechanical agitation and energy input resulting in a gradual settling and compaction of the cargo the cargo turns into a viscous fluid gradually by specifying the movement of container or ship hold the whole process of liquefaction can be determined by this liquefaction model in the form of time domain analysis section 2 introduced contact parameters deformation parameters and hydraulic parameters which need to be identified based on experimental methods when studying ship response due to cargo shift energy input like wave parameters also need to be provided based on the liquefaction model developed in the paper parametric investigation can be undertaken to identify the key parameters that trigger cargo instabilities to investigate the root causes as well as those that trigger the liquefaction phenomenon in order to address the problem in a comprehensive manner before applying this liquefaction model properties of cargo need to be identified by laboratory experiments including the friction coefficient at different moisture contents contact model parameters bulk strengths deformation parameters and swccs hydraulic parameters 1 contact model parameters during compaction the contact properties like friction coefficient will be updated according to section 4 the flow characteristic varying with the degree of saturation or mc needs to be determined by the static incline test 2 deformation parameters according to the stress on the particles the elastic plastic strain of particles can be calculated deformation parameters will be obtained by simple shear and cyclic shear tests using an experimental approach meanwhile with the deformation parameters simple shear and cyclic shear tests will further verify the numerical method 3 hydraulic parameters the soil water characteristic curves swccs relate the water content or degree of saturation to the pore water pressure matrix suction of a granular material according to the initial degree of saturation and the elastic plastic strain during compaction the updated degree of saturation of particles will be calculated the contact properties like friction coefficient can be determined to update the movement of the particles meantime according to the swcc the pore water pressure can be validated by the pressure sensor in the experiment employing the liquefaction model with the given parameters above some information related to cargo liquefaction can be determined 1 evolution of the degree of saturation of each particle 2 liquefied percentage for all particles 3 liquefaction zone 4 the fluctuation forces on the hold or container 6 1 hypothetical property of a cargo given a hypothetical property of a cargo see table 6 we can identify what factors such as amplitude frequency or moisture trigger cargo liquefaction during the carriage the cargoes may experience compaction although the moisture content does not change the degree of saturation increases during the compaction therefore according to table 2 the density of the particle 2500 kg m 3 and the relation between moisture content and degree of saturation as followed below the friction coefficient related to dos is calculated dos mc r s e r w n e 1 e dos degree of saturation mc moisture content r s unit weight of the particle r w unit weight of water n porosity e void ratio in fact when the degree of saturation increases the friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient decrease therefore the relation of friction coefficient to the degree of saturation should be identified by the experimental approach before the assessment of cargo liquefaction two fitting equations are presented to describe the relation between the friction coefficient and rolling friction coefficient and the degree of saturation according to the simulation data and the equation above from classnk which can be implemented into the dem liquefaction model as shown in fig 11 deformation parameters and hydraulic parameters also need to be determined by laboratory experiment in the following liquefaction simulations the validation properties in tab 6 will be used f r i c 0 9 0 d o s 48 0 8 48 d o s 69 599492 e ˆ 18 95 d o s 69 d o s 100 r f r i c 0 6 0 d o s 71 8 0 d o s 6 45 71 d o s 80 0 02 80 d o s 100 fric friction coefficient rfric rolling friction coefficient 6 2 time domain analysis liquefaction is associated with a phase transition of initially solid water saturated loosely packed granular material into a highly viscous liquid the phenomenon occurs when fine grain ore cargoes with sufficient amounts of moisture in their mass excited by ship motions and vibration under cyclic or impulsive loading the material concentrates due to micro scale particle movement which yields a reduction of the pore space inside the soil skeleton and increases the pore water pressure if the water cannot be migrated by means of a drainage system the increased pore pressure will reduce the shear strength of the granular material the hexapod tests conducted by consulting firm marin of australia twg 2013 as shown in fig 12 which showed that at high moisture contents cracks will occur in the cargo surface free surface apparent in the corners of the ship hold can be shaped after shaking and a considerable compaction has occurred from the initial state the water flows out to the bottom to form the wet base the peak pile of cargoes turns to the flat pile which is the typical process during liquefaction as described above the dem liquefaction model based on pfc2d commercial software is used to simulate the whole process of liquefaction in a 2d rectangular structure 0 2 m 0 2 m as shown in fig 13 as seen from the simulation results and compared with fig 12 this model used in the paper can fully describe the liquefaction phenomenon from the initial state to liquefied state the size of the particle is scaled by obtaining the elastic plastic strain according to the stress on the particles based on the ubcsand model roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 0 2 m 0 2 m with an amplitude of 0 3 rad and frequency of 1hz is investigated to identify the influence of the structure motion on cargo shift especially to address the liquefaction phenomenon from fig 14 shown below the cargoes close to the wall are liquefied first small size when cargoes liquefy they have enough space to move resulting in more severe collisions as seen in fig 15 taking one ball with id 106 in consideration the degree of saturation increases to 100 from an initial degree of 50 at 20s note that some balls liquefy in a very short period of time according to the stress placed on them at 50s the liquefied percent reaches 100 which means all of particles liquefy the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the container increases suddenly 6 3 liquefaction assessment criterion liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil are reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid loading generally if the effective stress of the soil decreases to zero the soil turns liquefied as defined in soil mechanics when compaction occurs the water will accumulate the pore water pressure which presses the particles apart however in consideration of the actual application of cargo liquefaction in a cargo ship cargo behavior in the whole process should be captured for the coupled motion between the cargo shift and ship motion in waves the model used in the paper can address the problem of transitioning from unsaturated state to saturated state and fulfilling engineering application requests from fig 15 when the liquefied percentage reaches 100 the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the container increases suddenly and behaves like a fluid therefore regarding the 100 degree of saturation defined as the liquefaction criteria is reasonable 7 dynamic response analysis roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm varying in amplitude frequency and initial degree of saturation of cargoes is investigated to identify the influence of the container s motion on cargo shift especially in order to predict the liquefaction phenomenon see fig 16 roll oscillation with varying initial degrees of saturation of cargoes is tested see fig 17 fig 18 fig 19 following this roll oscillation with the frequency of 1hz and the initial degree of saturation of 50 varying by amplitudes is tested see fig 20 and fig 21 roll oscillation with the amplitude of 0 3 rad and the initial degree of saturation of 50 varying by frequencies is tested see fig 22 and fig 23 roll oscillation of a 2d rectangular structure 50 cm 50 cm varying in amplitude frequency and initial degree of saturation of cargoes is investigated to address the liquefaction phenomenon it can be concluded that cargoes have a high tendency to flow with higher initial mcs of cargoes and higher frequencies and amplitudes of external loading as discussed below 1 as shown in fig 18 the ball id 106 with an initial degree of saturation of 50 liquefied at 20s while the ball with an initial degree of saturation of 60 and 70 liquefied in several seconds according to the liquefaction model the bulk modulus and shear modulus are small with a high level of initial degree of saturation at the same external energy input the cargoes with a higher degree of saturation have lower liquefaction resistance thus the cargoes containing a low level of degree of saturation will experience a longer time to reach a liquefied state 2 if the amplitude and the frequency are constant the flowability of cargoes at the initial degree of saturation of 50 is more evident than at the initial degree of saturation of 60 or 70 the reason is that when the degree of saturation is high the air contained in the sample is low therefore it can be seen from fig 19 that the radius of liquefied cargoes is larger at the degree of saturation of 50 than others however if under the same initial conditions it can be seen that cargoes with a high initial degree of saturation will have large flowability as shown in fig 19 cargoes with an initial degree of saturation of 50 contribute small fluctuation force on the container as the cargoes have large shear strength to restrain cargo shift when the cargoes reach the liquefied percentage of 100 this causes cargoes to behave like liquid gradually similarly cargo is less resistant to liquefaction with high energy input on the container see figs 20 23 8 conclusions a dem liquefaction model was developed to address the liquefaction phenomenon the granular material is considered as moist material by applying various friction coefficients the dem combined with the ubcsabnd model can effectively capture the cyclic shear behavior liquefaction phenomena and discrete characteristics of granular materials based on the assumptions the validations were carried out to confirm the accuracy of the dem liquefaction model time domain analysis of cargo liquefaction was conducted to identify the evolution of the degree of saturation of each particle liquefied percentage for all particles liquefaction zone and the fluctuation forces on the ship hold when the liquefied percentage reaches 100 the fluctuation force due to cargo shift on the ship hold shaped container will increase suddenly therefore the definition of 100 degree of saturation liquefied cargoes in the model regarded as the liquefaction criteria is effective and reasonable it is also concluded that the higher initial degree of saturation of cargoes higher frequency and amplitude of the external loading on the container leads to less liquefaction resistance of the cargoes the simulation results indicate that the dem liquefaction model can predict the liquefaction phenomenon of the cargoes after comparing with experimental data the assumptions are the novel features of this new approach but they need to be further validated by more laboratory experiments based on the approach developed it will provide a better understanding of the liquefaction phenomenon of solid bulk cargo that interacts with ship vessel motion identification and quantification of the controlling parameters acknowledgements this

23377,the influence of the downstream water depth on dam break wave is systematically and comparatively studied by simulating the physical experiments in this study commercial cfd software package flow 3d is chosen as the simulation tool and is validated firstly three experimental cases of different initial downstream water depth including dry bed case r 0 shallow downstream water case r 0 1 and deep downstream water case r 0 4 carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 are then simulated the generation and propagation process of dam break wave is divided into two and three stages respectively for dry bed and wet bed cases and the characteristics of the dam break wave including free surface profile wave front velocity mark point movement and trajectory interface between upstream and downstream water bottom resistance and turbulent kinetic energy are compared and analyzed elaborately in each stage for each case the differences of the characteristics between different downstream water depth cases are achieved and the reasons of the differences are explored which present a comprehensive understanding of dam break wave generation and propagation keywords dam break wave flow 3d wave propagation surface profile bottom resistance turbulent kinetic energy 1 introduction dam break wave could cause catastrophic flood disaster to the downstream area due to its large velocity deep submergence and huge flux the accurate prediction of the wave characteristics i e propagation velocity submerged depth and arrival time has genuine practical significance for early warning and emergency evacuation to reduce the loss of life and property damage and it is also the basis of hydrodynamic force calculation of houses and bridges in the downstream area valuable researches in the field of dam break wave have been done through theoretical analysis experimental research and numerical calculation dam break wave propagates over dry bed and wet bed are usually studied separately in literature due to their significant differences in flow patterns ritter 1892 studied the problem of dam break wave propagates over idealized frictionless horizontal dry bed by solving the saint venant equations nonlinear shallow water equations due to the neglect of the bottom resistance velocity and surface profile of the wave front are different from reality keulegan 1950 dressler 1952 whitham 1955 lauber and hager 1998 and chanson 2006 improved ritter 1892 solution by considering the effect of bottom resistance thus the calculation accuracy has been improved greatly at the wave front stoker 1957 extended ritter 1892 solution to the wet bed condition by solving the saint venant equations through application of the method of characteristics the theories above are all deduced from shallow water equations that based on the shallow water and long wave assumptions in which the vertical velocity and acceleration are neglected and the pressure is hydrostatic experimental studies martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 stansby et al 1998 lauber and hager 1998 and çağatay and kocaman 2008 show differences in the very initial stage and the upstream edge area between the theoretical solutions ritter 1892 and stoker 1957 and real situations as the shallow water assumptions are not valid at the upstream edge area and the solution by stoker 1957 cannot describe the fluctuation evolution process and the corresponding wave front surface profile previous experimental studies either focus on the wave front velocity and surface profile martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 stansby et al 1998 bukreev and gusev 2005 oertel and bung 2012 larocque et al 2012 jánosi et al 2004 lauber and hager 1998 or focus on only dry bed case or wet bed case martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 lauber and hager 1998 arnason 2005 arnason et al 2009 oertel and bung 2012 larocque et al 2012 lobovský et al 2014 or focus on the very initial stage of dam break jánosi et al 2004 lobovský et al 2014 bukreev and gusev 2005 the comparative experimental studies on dam break wave propagation over both dry bed and wet bed are few e g ramsden 1996 stansby et al 1998 jánosi et al 2004 bukreev and gusev 2005 çağatay and kocaman 2008 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 mainly focus on the wave surface and wave height while other flow field characteristics are not included with the rapid development of computer and cfd technology the rans equations can be used to simulate the whole process of dam break wave propagation over both dry bed and wet bed accurately however numerical studies biscarini et al 2010 yang et al 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 mainly focus on the validation of accuracy of numerical model by comparing with the experimental wave velocities and wave surfaces the numerical studies on the wave characteristics are seldom e g park et al 2012 studied the effect of turbulence intensity on the bottom shear frictional resistance and wave front surface profile shigematsu et al 2004 studied the influence of the downstream water depth on the turbulence intensity for both dry bed and wet bed the difference of dam break wave propagation over dry bed and wet bed with different initial water depth cannot be ignored which will eventually introduce a significant influence on the wave characteristics however the systematical and comparative numerical studies on the influence of the downstream water depth on the wave characteristic have not been reported to our knowledge in general theoretical solutions based on shallow water and long wave assumptions cannot describe the fluctuation evolution process and the corresponding wave front surface profile previous experiments mainly focus on the wave surface and wave height and the difference of wave propagation over dry and wet beds are seldom compared numerical studies mainly focus on the verification of calculation precision but ignore the flow field analysis so this paper aims at a systematical comparative study on the influence of the downstream water depth on the flow field by simulating the three experiments carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 2 numerical method and validation commercial cfd software package flow 3d is used to simulate the dam break wave generation and propagation in this study as it has been widely used in hydrodynamic calculations choi et al 2007 chopakatla et al 2008 jin and meng 2011 chen and hsiao 2016 and dam break wave simulations bradford 2000 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 2011 2012 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 2 1 basic theory of numerical method 2 1 1 governing equations the general governing equations for newtonian incompressible fluid flow i e mass conservation and momentum conservation equations which constitute the so called rans equations can be expressed as follows 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i f i where i 1 2 3 and x i represents the x y z coordinate respectively u i is the mean velocity component a i is the fractional area open to flow g i is the body acceleration t represents time v f is the fractional volume open to flow ρ is the fluid density p is pressure and f i represents the viscous acceleration which can be expressed as follows 3 f i 1 v f τ b i ρ x j a j s i j where τ b i represents wall shear stress s i j υ υ t u j x i u i x j represents the strain rate tensor υ represents kinematic viscosity υ t represents kinematic eddy viscosity which can be calculated from turbulence model 2 1 2 turbulence model a variety of turbulence modes are available to solve the rans equations in flow 3d the three classic turbulence models namely standard k ε harlow and nakayama 1967 rng k ε yakhot and smith 1992 and k ω wilcox 1998 are compared with the experimental data comparisons show that there were no obvious differences between the three turbulence models when simulating the experiments carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 again the three classic turbulence models are compared with the experimental data presented by arnason 2005 results show that with the increase of the initial upstream water depth the k ω wilcox 1998 turbulence model shows better agreement than the other two turbulence models on the slope of wave front profile when the wave front arrives so the k ω wilcox 1998 turbulence model is employed in this study the detailed comparison figures are omitted here for brevity υ t could be determined as follows 4 υ t k ω where ω ε k k and ε represent turbulence kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate per unit mass respectively they can be solved by the following equations 5 k t 1 v f u i a i k x i 1 v f x i υ υ t σ k a i k x

u i x j u j x i 2 2 numerical model setup and validation the physical experiments carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 including dry bed and wet bed cases are employed to validate the flow 3d numerical model the setup of their experiments is detailed as follows the glass water channel is 8 90 m in length 0 30 m in width 0 30 m in height shown in fig 1 the length of the upstream and the downstream are 4 65 m and 4 25 m respectively in their experiments the upstream water depth h 1 is constant as 0 25 m while the downstream water depth h 0 is 0 m 0 025 m 0 1 m which indicates the ratio of initial downstream water depth to upstream water depth i e r h 0 h 1 is 0 0 1 0 4 respectively dam break wave is produced by lifting the gate upward extremely quickly through a pulley system a two dimensional numerical water channel with one grid in the y direction is established in flow 3d with the same dimensions as used in physical experiments also the water depths of upstream and downstream are totally the same as that in the physical experiments it assumes that the gate is smooth and removed away so quickly that the disturbance to the water body could be ignored so the remove process of gate is not simulated in numerical model and t 0 corresponds to the instant that the gate is just completely removed in physical experiments the computational domain is meshed with 142400 structural grids with grid sizes in x and y directions both are 0 005 m mesh sensitivity analysis omitted here for brevity shows the grid sizes are excellent in both precision and calculation efficiency time steps are automatically determined according to courant friedrichs lewy criterion the front and back boundaries perpendicular to the paper are set as symmetry boundaries since no flux and shear of any property across them the upstream wall downstream wall and bottom wall of the channel shown in fig 1 are set as wall boundaries with no slip condition because both the normal and tangential velocity are zero there the k ω turbulence model provides wall functions to calculate velocity distributions in the boundary layer the top of channel is set as pressure boundary to account for the atmospheric pressure the vof method by hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the free surface and zero shear force and atmospheric pressure are applied there the gmres solver flow science inc 2014 is adopted to calculate the meshes iteratively the numerical results of free surface profiles at different time for the dry bed case r 0 are compared with experimental data and theoretical solution by chanson 2006 shown in fig 2 and the numerical results for the wet bed case r 0 4 are compared with the experimental data and theoretical solution by stoker 1957 shown in fig 3 note that chanson 2006 improved ritter 1892 solution by introducing a constant resistance zone at the wave front thus the wave front velocity wave front position and wave front surface profile were greatly improved making it reasonable to be the theoretical solution of dry bed case in figs 2 and 3 the wave height h horizontal coordinate x time t is non dimensionalized as h h 1 x h 1 t t g h 1 respectively in which g is gravitation acceleration it can be observed that the numerical results agree very well with the experimental data at different time for both dry bed and wet bed cases also the numerical results are much closed to theoretical solutions by chanson 2006 in fig 2 and stoker 1957 in fig 3 for dry bed case and wet bed case respectively the above comparisons indicate that the flow 3d numerical model can accurately simulate the generation and propagation of dam break wave and is employed to simulate three physical experiments dry bed case r 0 wet bed cases r 0 1 and 0 4 carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 in the following sections 3 dam break wave propagation in dry bed case r 0 at the instant when the gate removed away completely namely t 0 the pressure field of the water body will be redistributed immediately due to gravity and atmospheric pressure the pressure contour at t 0 is shown in fig 4 the pressure at the interface between the initial gate position and the upstream water is the same as the free surface is equal to the atmospheric pressure the pressure contours are bent downward and intersect with the bottom boundary behind the initial gate position in order to analyze the generation and propagation of dam break wave the mark points 1 14 are defined and numbered in order from bottom to top as shown in fig 4 i e mark point 1 locates at the gate bottom mark points 2 11 locate at the gate mark points 12 14 locate at the top surface the spacing between these points is 0 025 m these mark points are modeled by setting several moving history probes which follows the flow as marker particles flow science inc 2014 the characteristics of flow filed change with time and could be approximately divided into two stages the very initial stage approximately 0 s t 0 1 s mark points near the gate act free falling and the vertical velocity component dominates and the relatively stable stage approximately t 0 1 s mark points gradually transit into horizontal movement and horizontal velocity component dominates at the wave front which will be discussed as follows 3 1 the very initial stage in the very initial stage the water near channel bottom flows downstream under gravity shown in fig 5 a because the pressure near channel bottom is larger shown in fig 4 the wave free surface is a smooth curve that is convex upward at both the wave front tip and the upstream edge where the velocity is approximately zero while in the middle it is concave upward the mark points start to move from their initial positions as shown in fig 5 a the mark points all locate on the surface and mark point 1 locates at the wave front followed by the rest mark points in order the vertical motions of the mark points 5 9 11 and 14 which initially located near the top of the gate are compared with the analytical solution based on asymptotic expansion method by pohle 1950 shown in fig 6 comparison shows that the present numerical results match the analytical solution by pohle 1950 very well from t 0s to t 0 1s but significant differences are observed when t 0 1s the comparison in fig 6 validates the precondition of analytical solution by pohle 1950 that is these mark points at the gate act free falling motion with gravitation acceleration g in the very initial stage until t 0 1s but with acceleration slightly smaller than g when t 0 1s also it is found that horizontal movement obtained by analytical solution of pohle 1950 is too short to be compared meaningfully with present numerical solution and is omitted here the trajectories of representative mark points are plotted in fig 7 which indicates that in the very initial stage the bottom mark point 1 moves horizontally downstream but the mark points near the top of the gate namely points 5 9 11 and 14 move downstream with a small horizontal displacement component and a large vertical displacement component generated by free falling motion the direction of the wave velocity is mainly downward especially in the area far away from the bottom as shown in fig 5 a the vertical velocity and the vertical acceleration at this moment cannot be neglected the wave front velocity increases gradually with kinetic energy converted from the potential energy in the very initial stage as shown in fig 8 and the bottom resistance is proportional to the velocity near bottom theoretically relationship between bottom resistance and wave free surface is shown in fig 9 which exactly shows that the bottom resistance increases gradually from the upstream edge to wave front at the wave front it increases sharply and reaches its maximum the turbulence kinetic energy is mainly generated by the bottom resistance and concentrates in the thin layer near the bottom similar as bottom resistance the turbulence kinetic energy increases gradually from the upstream edge to the downstream and reaches its maximum at the wave front shown in fig 10 a and its exact maximum value in propagation process is shown in fig 11 note that the maximum value itself increases from 0 at t 0 s to 0 03 at t 0 1 s at the very initial stage 3 2 the relatively stable stage the wave surface in this stage is similar as that in the very initial stage i e it is a smooth curve that convex upward at upstream edge and wave front while in the middle it is concave upward as shown in fig 5 b and c note that according to ritter 1892 shallow water solution the averaged wave height h and velocity u change with time at the downstream and the upstream area but they are constants at the gate and equal to 4 h 1 9 and 2 g h 1 3 respectively the froude number i e f r u g h 1 at the gate which represents critical flow at the gate and the froude number at the downstream and upstream of the gate is larger and smaller than 1 representing supercritical flow and subcritical flow at the downstream and upstream area respectively the bottom mark point 1 moves fastest and locates at the wave front all the time as shown in fig 5 b as time goes on the mark points 2 to 5 gradually gather in the vicinity of the wave front and then advance together with mark point 1 as compared and shown in fig 5 b and c all the mark points stay on the wave surface and their relative positions remain unchanged the trajectories of the mark points are shown in fig 7 which clearly demonstrate the horizontal trajectory of mark point 1 and a transition from vertical dominate trajectory to horizontal dominate trajectory for the other mark points in time interval 0 1s 0 5s and from t 0 5s all the points have approximately horizontal trajectories at the wave front the direction of the velocity gradually becomes horizontal and the average velocity of cross section increases from upstream to downstream as time goes on the velocity profile tends to be the same as that of uniform flow as compared in fig 5 b and c for t 0 5s and t 1 8s respectively the wave front velocity increases from t 0 1s to t 0 5s and then decreases gradually in this stage as shown in fig 8 this is because wave front resistance increases with the velocity and eventually dissipates more kinetic energy which in turn leads to the slow of wave front velocity the bottom resistance distribution in this stage t 0 5s and t 1 8s is similar to that of the very initial stage t 0 1s that is the similar distribution pattern but different slope of change and peek value shown in fig 9 by comparison of the bottom resistance peak value of different times it could be observed that the peek value increases firstly then decreases later with time as described in the very initial stage the turbulent kinetic energy in this stage is also mainly generated by the bottom resistance and concentrated in a thin layer above the bottom boundary as shown in fig 10 b and c the maximum value of turbulent kinetic energy always locates at the wave front and increases first and then decreases gradually as the wave front velocity changes shown in fig 11 the peak value is about 0 07 m s 2 occurred at t 0 5s approximately 4 dam break wave propagation in wet bed cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 similar to the case of dry bed the pressure field of the water body will redistribute under gravity and boundary atmospheric pressure at the instant when the gate removed away completely i e t 0 the pressure contours and 12 mark points for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in figs 12 and 13 i e mark point 1 locates at the gate bottom mark points 2 6 locate at the downstream free surface mark points 7 9 locate at the upper part of the gate and mark points 9 12 locate on the upstream free surface behind the gate respectively the generation and approaching process of break wave could be approximately divided into three stages according to evolution of the wave surface profile the very initial stage approximately 0 s t 0 2 s the jet forms and develops keeps unbroken the fluctuating evolution stage approximately 0 2 s t 1 0 s the jet breaks and wave surface profile fluctuates and the relatively stable stage approximately t 1 0 s fluctuation decreases and the wave surface profile tends to be stable which will be analyzed in detail later 4 1 the very initial stage in this stage i e t 0 1s the water rises up from the junction of the upstream and the downstream the initial locations of mark point 2 at t 0 then forms a jet the free surface of case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in fig 14 a and fig 15 a respectively then the jet develops into a water tongue when the downstream water depth is shallow case r 0 1 shown in fig 14 b or develops into a larger mushroom like jet when the downstream water depth is large case r 0 4 shown in fig 15 b the water tongue or mushroom like jet doesn t break in this stage and the free surface near wave front fluctuates violently similar to the case of dry bed mark point 1 moves downstream almost horizontally at the bottom mark points 2 7 which initially located near the junction of the upstream and the downstream all leap upward during the formations of water tongue in the case r 0 1 demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 14 a b and by trajectories of representative points 2 4 in fig 16 and mushroom like jet in the r 0 4 demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 15 a b and by trajectories of representative points 2 4 in fig 17 and they all still locate on the free surface in the very initial stage however their relative positions are changed as to mark points 8 12 which initially located near the top of the gate move downward and downstream in order at the free surface and their relative positions remain unchanged their vertical movements due to free falling motion from t 0s to t 0 1s not influenced by downstream water depth are the same as that in dry bed case and the mark points 8 9 12 almost fall downward freely from t 0s to t 0 1s but they gradually begin to move downstream horizontally from t 0 1s to t 0 2s shown in figs 16 and 17 for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 respectively the velocity fields for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are also plotted in fig 14 a b and fig 15 a b respectively what could be observed is that both the magnitude and direction of the velocity change prominently and the vertical velocity and acceleration cannot be ignored the interfaces between the upstream water and the downstream water of case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in fig 18 a and fig 19 a respectively together with experimental data kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 numerical interface for the deep downstream water case r 0 4 by ye and zhao 2017 is also compared in fig 19 a which is numerically simulated with two phase flow but without simulating the gate move process comparisons indicate that numerical results of this paper agree very well with ye and zhao 2017 solutions and also agree reasonably well with experimental data except little differences is observed at the top of the interface the downstream water is completely pushed to move forward by the approaching upstream water no matter in r 0 1 or r 0 4 case and then a jet is formed in the very initial stage note that the little difference at the top of the interface in this stage can be mainly attributed to the lack of gate in the numerical model more detailed information is available in the work by ye and zhao 2017 the bottom resistances and the corresponding free surface in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 are plotted in fig 20 a and fig 21 a respectively which shows the maximum values of bottom resistance occur at the end of or trough behind the water tongue or mushroom like jet approximately this is because the bottom velocity is largest at the troughs due to the decrease of the flow cross section as the larger the velocity the bigger the bottom resistance the turbulent kinetic energy is mainly caused by the bottom resistance and concentrated in a thin layer above the bottom their cloud maps are shown in fig 22 a b and fig 23 a b for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively 4 2 the fluctuating evolution stage in this stage the water tongue impacts the downstream water and then breaks in case r 0 1 and the mushroom like jet immerses into the downstream water and then breaks in case r 0 4 the wave surfaces fluctuate up and down violently the velocity including amplitude and direction changes remarkably shown in fig 14 c d for case r 0 1 and fig 15 c d for case r 0 4 which results in the intensive fluctuation of mark points and eventually leads to prominent difference of trajectories among mark points still the vertical velocities and accelerations cannot be ignored in this stage especially at the wave front mark point 1 moves to downstream horizontally along the bottom mark points 2 7 are involved into the water when the water tongue impacting into the downstream water in case r 0 1 both of their horizontal and vertical relative positions change demonstrated by mark point position in fig 14 c d and by the trajectories of the representative points 2 4 in fig 16 however mark points 2 7 all float on the free surface when the mushroom like jet immersing into the downstream water in case r 0 4 and their vertical relative positions change with fluctuation but their horizontal relative positions remain unchanged demonstrated by mark point position in fig 15 c d and by the trajectories of the representative points 2 4 in fig 17 both in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 mark points 8 12 locate at the wave surface all the time while moving downstream in order their vertical relative positions change with the fluctuation of the free surface but their horizontal relative positions remain unchanged shown in fig 14 c d fig 15 c d figs 16 and 17 the numerical results of interface between upstream and downstream water agree reasonably well with experimental data and ye and zhao 2017 results in this stage and the numerical interface is a convex curve that extends to the wave front in case r 0 1 shown in fig 18 b c however the interface is basically vertical and keeps some distance away from the wave front in case r 0 4 shown in fig 19 b c the little difference of the mixing degree at the interface between numerical result and experimental data can be mainly attributed to the lack of gate in the numerical model for more details one can refer to ye and zhao 2017 and it will be no longer explained in the subsequent stage due to the same reason in this stage the bottom resistance has a crest value at the trough that immediate upstream of the jet for both cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 shown in fig 20 a and fig 21 a respectively as the velocity at the trough is relatively larger due to the compression of the flow cross section in case r 0 1 the maximum bottom resistance value moves downstream as the corresponding trough moves downstream and in case r 0 4 the maximum bottom resistance value moves upstream as the corresponding trough moves upstream which agrees with the solution by stoker 1957 that the upstream edge of the surge region moves to downstream when r 0 1384 and moves to upstream when r 0 1384 at a constant speed the upstream edge of the surge region presented by stoker 1957 for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 are presented with short lines in fig 20 b and fig 21 b respectively in which short dashed line is for t 0 2s short wide solid line is for t 0 5s and short fine solid line is for t 2 0s in this stage the water tongue and mushroom like jet break the turbulent kinetic energy is mainly generated by the wave breaking and located in the wave front tip areas the position of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy locates at the interface between the upper surging bore and bottom relatively quiescent water in case r 0 1 shown in fig 22 c d and the position of which locates at the surface that slightly upstream of the wave front in case r 0 4 shown in fig 23 c d the maximum turbulent kinetic energy reaches its maximum at t 0 6s in case r 0 1 and at t 0 8s in case r 0 4 in this stage shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively 4 3 the relatively stable stage the fluctuation of the wave surface gradually decreases and wave front profile tends to be stable the slope of the wave front of case r 0 1 is smaller than that of case r 0 4 shown in fig 14 e and fig 15 e respectively the horizontal component of velocity dominates and the magnitude changes remarkably from the upper layer to bottom layer at the wave front in this stage both in case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 shown in fig 14 e and fig 15 e respectively the velocity distribution along water depth some distance away from upstream gradually tends to be the same as uniform flow still mark point 1 moves to downstream horizontally at the bottom all the time both in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 mark points 2 7 in case r 0 1 continue fluctuating downstream with deceasing amplitude in the water mark points 8 12 in case r 0 1 and all the mark points in case r 0 4 continue floating on the surface and fluctuating up and down with the decreasing amplitude when approaching downstream all the points almost move horizontally and their relative positions have no dramatic changes in this stage demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 14 e and trajectories in fig 16 for case r 0 1 and accordingly fig 15 e and fig 17 for case r 0 4 reasonably good agreement are achieved when the numerical results of interface between upstream and downstream are compared with experimental data and ye and zhao 2017 solutions in this stage the numerical interface is similar to that in the previous stage of case r 0 1 the upper layer of the interface namely the upstream water drags the lower layer water and moves downstream shown in fig 18 d e in case r 0 4 the numerical interface is further away from the wave front than that in previous stage and almost keeps vertical the upstream water pushes the downstream water downstream horizontally shown in fig 19 d e in case r 0 1 the position of the maximum bottom resistance continues moving downstream with the correspond trough at the trough bottom resistance has maximum value and the bottom resistance decreases gradually from the upstream to wave front as shown in fig 20 a this is because the bottom velocity gradually deceases from the upstream to wave front as energy of wave front will be dissipated when the lower layer static water is dragged to the downstream by the upstream water also tiny fluctuation of bottom resistance force due to the fluctuation of bottom velocity at wave front could be observed in case r 0 4 the position of the maximum bottom resistance continues moving upstream with the correspond trough at the trough bottom resistance has maximum value and the bottom resistance decreases gradually with the stabilization of the wave surface the bottom resistance from the wave front to the upstream is basically unchanged as the bottom velocity is approximately the same from the wave front to the upstream as shown in fig 15 e the weaker fluctuation of bottom resistance could be observed because the bottom velocity fluctuates weakly as the larger downstream water depth minimize the disturbance from the wave front shown in fig 21 a the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy is the same as that described in previous stage shown in fig 22 e and fig 23 e for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively the maximum values of the turbulent kinetic energy gradually tend to constant as the wave front surface profiles tend to stable as shown in figs 24 and 25 for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively another 6 mark points namely a1 a6 are defined downstream far away from the gate namely at x 2 50 m and x 2 54 m to help analyze how the lower layer under wave front tip is propelled to move downstream by the wave front in the relatively stable stage shown in fig 26 a and 27 a for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 note that according to stoker 1957 shallow water solution the froude numbers f r u g h u and h are the averaged velocity and wave height behind the bore front are 1 178 and 0 456 for case r 0 1 and r 0 4 representing supercritical flow and subcritical flow respectively in the case r 0 1 the mark points locate at the upper and middle layers of the downstream water in the relatively stable stage mark points a3 a6 and a2 a5 respectively are involved upward into the bore then roll forward and the original upper layer point a6 is dragged downward by the slowly moving bottom layer water their relative positions change during this process shown in fig 26 b and fig 26 c in case r 0 4 those mark points a3 a6 at upper layer of the downstream water in the relatively stable stage are also involve upward into the bore but move forward almost horizontally with velocity larger than those horizontally moving mark points a2 a5 at the middle layer their relative positions almost keep unchanged shown in fig 27 b and fig 27 c so in the relatively stable stage of dam break wave propagation the mixing of the upper layer and the middle layer downstream water is obvious in shallow downstream water condition but is not obvious in deep downstream water condition which also can be shown by trajectories in fig 28 and fig 29 5 comparison and discussion the bottom resistance in dry bed case is bigger than that in wet bed cases and the bottom resistance decreases when the downstream water depth increases compared in fig 30 note that only bottom resistance distribution curves at t 0 5s are compared and comparisons at other times lead to the same results omitted here for brevity ignoring the bottom resistance in dry bed case would introduce remarkable deviation into wave front velocity calculation i e fig 8 which takes bottom resistance into consideration indicates the variation of the wave front velocity with time however the solution by ritter 1892 which neglects the bottom resistance vertical velocity and acceleration is estimated to be a constant value as 2 g h 1 3 13 m s on the contrary wave front velocity and wave front surface profile will match the experimental data well if the bottom resistance is considered i e comparison between the solution by chanson 2006 and experimental data shown in fig 2 b c the maximum turbulent kinetic energy both for dry bed and wet bed cases change with time increasing relatively slowly in the very initial stage increasing shapely and reaches its peak value at t 0 4s in dry bed case at t 0 6s in care r 0 1 and at t 0 8s in case r 0 4 in the fluctuation evolution stage then decreasing gradually and finally tending to be stable at a constant value shown in fig 31 in the very initial stage the maximum turbulent kinetic energy of dry bed case is larger than that of case r 0 1 and the latter is larger than case r 0 4 because the water tongue of case r 0 1 and the mushroom like jet of case r 0 4 have not broken yet and the maximum turbulent kinetic energy is mainly generated by the bottom resistance the peak value of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy of case r 0 1 is larger than that of r 0 4 and the latter is larger than that of dry bed case this is because the turbulent kinetic energy mainly produced by wave breaking in wet bed cases in this stage is larger than that still produced by bottom resistance in dry bed case and for wet bed cases when the downstream water depth is shallow i e case r 0 1 the velocity gradient between upper and lower layers at wave front is larger thus the wave breaking is more violently therefore the corresponding turbulent kinetic energy is larger than deeper downstream water case i e case r 0 4 6 conclusions dam break simulation method based on flow 3d has been validated by experimental data then three physical experiment cases including dry bed case shallow downstream water case r 0 1 and deep downstream water case r 0 4 conducted by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 are studied numerically a comprehensive flow filed involving wave front surface profile velocity distribution mark point movement and trajectory bottom resistance turbulent kinetic energy and interface between upstream and downstream have been studied from the very initial stage to relatively stable stage elaborately comparison shows the prominent difference of flow fields between different downstream water depth cases i e r 0 r 0 1 and r 0 4 the main conclusions are detailed as follows 1 for dry bed case the free surface is a smooth curve which is convex upward at both the wave front tip and the upstream edge but is concave upward in the middle and the convex part will develop into a water tongue in shallow downstream water case or mushroom like jet in deep downstream water case then both will break and approach downstream with fluctuation and tends to be stable later 2 in dry bed case wave front velocity increases firstly then decreases gradually the vertical velocity and acceleration cannot be ignored in the very initial and the fluctuating evolution stage in both dry bed and wet bed cases 3 in dry bed case the mark points locate on free surface and move downstream in order their relative positions keep unchanged and result in similar trajectories the water in different layers moves downstream almost without much mixing in the very initial stage and fluctuating evolution stage the mark points near the junction between upstream and downstream are involved in the current in shallow downstream water case i e r 0 1 but float on the free surface in deep downstream water case i e r 0 4 when approaching downstream with fluctuation the mixing of water in different layer near the gate in shallow downstream water case is more prominent than that in deep downstream water condition in the relatively stable stage the mark points locate at the upper layer of downstream water are involved upward into the bore roll forward and their relative positions change in shallow downstream water case however rolling is not observed and they move almost horizontally with their relative positions unchanged in deep downstream water case the mixing of the upper layer and middle layer of the downstream water is more obvious in shallow downstream water case than in deep downstream water case 4 the interface of upstream and downstream is convex curve that extends to the wave front in shallow downstream water case and the interface is vertical and keeps some distance away from the wave front in deep downstream water case the downstream water is completely pushed to move forward by the upstream water 5 in dry bed case the maximum of the bottom resistance occurs at the wave front tip in wet bed case the maximum of bottom resistance occurs at the upstream edge of the surge region and decreasing from this location to both upstream and downstream in shallow downstream water case while decreasing from this location to upstream but almost keep unchanged downstream in deep downstream water case the position where maximum bottom resistance occurs moves downstream in shallow downstream water case however moves upstream in deep downstream water case the bottom resistance in dry bed case is larger than that in shallow downstream water case and the latter is larger than that in deep downstream water case that is the shallower the downstream water depth the larger the bottom resistance 6 in dry bed case the turbulent kinetic energy distributes in a thin layer at the bottom and gets its maximum value at the wave front tip the maximum of turbulent kinetic energy happens at the interface between upper surge and lower quiescent water at wave front in shallow downstream water case and the maximum happens at the surface that slightly upstream of the wave front in deep downstream water case the maximum of the turbulence kinetic energy in the very initial stage mainly generated by bottom resistance in dry bed case is larger than that in wet bed cases but after wave breaking the maximum turbulence kinetic energy in shallow downstream water case is larger than that in deep downstream water case and the latter is larger than that in dry bed case because in this stage turbulence kinetic energy is mainly generated by wave breaking in wet bed cases and the intensity of wave breaking in shallow downstream water case is more violent than that in deep downstream water case generally a thorough insight into the generation and propagation process of dam break flow with different downstream water depth is presented in this paper however because of the sophistication of the dam break flow some influencing parameters such as gate remove process bottom scour the change of initial depth of the impound water etc are not taken into consideration in this study in the further study the effects of these parameters on the characteristics of dam break wave deserve detailed concerns and more importantly the dam break flow forces on structures such as bridges residential houses and downstream dams deserve much more attention acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science

23377,the influence of the downstream water depth on dam break wave is systematically and comparatively studied by simulating the physical experiments in this study commercial cfd software package flow 3d is chosen as the simulation tool and is validated firstly three experimental cases of different initial downstream water depth including dry bed case r 0 shallow downstream water case r 0 1 and deep downstream water case r 0 4 carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 are then simulated the generation and propagation process of dam break wave is divided into two and three stages respectively for dry bed and wet bed cases and the characteristics of the dam break wave including free surface profile wave front velocity mark point movement and trajectory interface between upstream and downstream water bottom resistance and turbulent kinetic energy are compared and analyzed elaborately in each stage for each case the differences of the characteristics between different downstream water depth cases are achieved and the reasons of the differences are explored which present a comprehensive understanding of dam break wave generation and propagation keywords dam break wave flow 3d wave propagation surface profile bottom resistance turbulent kinetic energy 1 introduction dam break wave could cause catastrophic flood disaster to the downstream area due to its large velocity deep submergence and huge flux the accurate prediction of the wave characteristics i e propagation velocity submerged depth and arrival time has genuine practical significance for early warning and emergency evacuation to reduce the loss of life and property damage and it is also the basis of hydrodynamic force calculation of houses and bridges in the downstream area valuable researches in the field of dam break wave have been done through theoretical analysis experimental research and numerical calculation dam break wave propagates over dry bed and wet bed are usually studied separately in literature due to their significant differences in flow patterns ritter 1892 studied the problem of dam break wave propagates over idealized frictionless horizontal dry bed by solving the saint venant equations nonlinear shallow water equations due to the neglect of the bottom resistance velocity and surface profile of the wave front are different from reality keulegan 1950 dressler 1952 whitham 1955 lauber and hager 1998 and chanson 2006 improved ritter 1892 solution by considering the effect of bottom resistance thus the calculation accuracy has been improved greatly at the wave front stoker 1957 extended ritter 1892 solution to the wet bed condition by solving the saint venant equations through application of the method of characteristics the theories above are all deduced from shallow water equations that based on the shallow water and long wave assumptions in which the vertical velocity and acceleration are neglected and the pressure is hydrostatic experimental studies martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 stansby et al 1998 lauber and hager 1998 and çağatay and kocaman 2008 show differences in the very initial stage and the upstream edge area between the theoretical solutions ritter 1892 and stoker 1957 and real situations as the shallow water assumptions are not valid at the upstream edge area and the solution by stoker 1957 cannot describe the fluctuation evolution process and the corresponding wave front surface profile previous experimental studies either focus on the wave front velocity and surface profile martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 stansby et al 1998 bukreev and gusev 2005 oertel and bung 2012 larocque et al 2012 jánosi et al 2004 lauber and hager 1998 or focus on only dry bed case or wet bed case martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 lauber and hager 1998 arnason 2005 arnason et al 2009 oertel and bung 2012 larocque et al 2012 lobovský et al 2014 or focus on the very initial stage of dam break jánosi et al 2004 lobovský et al 2014 bukreev and gusev 2005 the comparative experimental studies on dam break wave propagation over both dry bed and wet bed are few e g ramsden 1996 stansby et al 1998 jánosi et al 2004 bukreev and gusev 2005 çağatay and kocaman 2008 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 mainly focus on the wave surface and wave height while other flow field characteristics are not included with the rapid development of computer and cfd technology the rans equations can be used to simulate the whole process of dam break wave propagation over both dry bed and wet bed accurately however numerical studies biscarini et al 2010 yang et al 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 mainly focus on the validation of accuracy of numerical model by comparing with the experimental wave velocities and wave surfaces the numerical studies on the wave characteristics are seldom e g park et al 2012 studied the effect of turbulence intensity on the bottom shear frictional resistance and wave front surface profile shigematsu et al 2004 studied the influence of the downstream water depth on the turbulence intensity for both dry bed and wet bed the difference of dam break wave propagation over dry bed and wet bed with different initial water depth cannot be ignored which will eventually introduce a significant influence on the wave characteristics however the systematical and comparative numerical studies on the influence of the downstream water depth on the wave characteristic have not been reported to our knowledge in general theoretical solutions based on shallow water and long wave assumptions cannot describe the fluctuation evolution process and the corresponding wave front surface profile previous experiments mainly focus on the wave surface and wave height and the difference of wave propagation over dry and wet beds are seldom compared numerical studies mainly focus on the verification of calculation precision but ignore the flow field analysis so this paper aims at a systematical comparative study on the influence of the downstream water depth on the flow field by simulating the three experiments carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 2 numerical method and validation commercial cfd software package flow 3d is used to simulate the dam break wave generation and propagation in this study as it has been widely used in hydrodynamic calculations choi et al 2007 chopakatla et al 2008 jin and meng 2011 chen and hsiao 2016 and dam break wave simulations bradford 2000 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 2011 2012 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 2 1 basic theory of numerical method 2 1 1 governing equations the general governing equations for newtonian incompressible fluid flow i e mass conservation and momentum conservation equations which constitute the so called rans equations can be expressed as follows 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i f i where i 1 2 3 and x i represents the x y z coordinate respectively u i is the mean velocity component a i is the fractional area open to flow g i is the body acceleration t represents time v f is the fractional volume open to flow ρ is the fluid density p is pressure and f i represents the viscous acceleration which can be expressed as follows 3 f i 1 v f τ b i ρ x j a j s i j where τ b i represents wall shear stress s i j υ υ t u j x i u i x j represents the strain rate tensor υ represents kinematic viscosity υ t represents kinematic eddy viscosity which can be calculated from turbulence model 2 1 2 turbulence model a variety of turbulence modes are available to solve the rans equations in flow 3d the three classic turbulence models namely standard k ε harlow and nakayama 1967 rng k ε yakhot and smith 1992 and k ω wilcox 1998 are compared with the experimental data comparisons show that there were no obvious differences between the three turbulence models when simulating the experiments carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 again the three classic turbulence models are compared with the experimental data presented by arnason 2005 results show that with the increase of the initial upstream water depth the k ω wilcox 1998 turbulence model shows better agreement than the other two turbulence models on the slope of wave front profile when the wave front arrives so the k ω wilcox 1998 turbulence model is employed in this study the detailed comparison figures are omitted here for brevity υ t could be determined as follows 4 υ t k ω where ω ε k k

numerical model the setup of their experiments is detailed as follows the glass water channel is 8 90 m in length 0 30 m in width 0 30 m in height shown in fig 1 the length of the upstream and the downstream are 4 65 m and 4 25 m respectively in their experiments the upstream water depth h 1 is constant as 0 25 m while the downstream water depth h 0 is 0 m 0 025 m 0 1 m which indicates the ratio of initial downstream water depth to upstream water depth i e r h 0 h 1 is 0 0 1 0 4 respectively dam break wave is produced by lifting the gate upward extremely quickly through a pulley system a two dimensional numerical water channel with one grid in the y direction is established in flow 3d with the same dimensions as used in physical experiments also the water depths of upstream and downstream are totally the same as that in the physical experiments it assumes that the gate is smooth and removed away so quickly that the disturbance to the water body could be ignored so the remove process of gate is not simulated in numerical model and t 0 corresponds to the instant that the gate is just completely removed in physical experiments the computational domain is meshed with 142400 structural grids with grid sizes in x and y directions both are 0 005 m mesh sensitivity analysis omitted here for brevity shows the grid sizes are excellent in both precision and calculation efficiency time steps are automatically determined according to courant friedrichs lewy criterion the front and back boundaries perpendicular to the paper are set as symmetry boundaries since no flux and shear of any property across them the upstream wall downstream wall and bottom wall of the channel shown in fig 1 are set as wall boundaries with no slip condition because both the normal and tangential velocity are zero there the k ω turbulence model provides wall functions to calculate velocity distributions in the boundary layer the top of channel is set as pressure boundary to account for the atmospheric pressure the vof method by hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the free surface and zero shear force and atmospheric pressure are applied there the gmres solver flow science inc 2014 is adopted to calculate the meshes iteratively the numerical results of free surface profiles at different time for the dry bed case r 0 are compared with experimental data and theoretical solution by chanson 2006 shown in fig 2 and the numerical results for the wet bed case r 0 4 are compared with the experimental data and theoretical solution by stoker 1957 shown in fig 3 note that chanson 2006 improved ritter 1892 solution by introducing a constant resistance zone at the wave front thus the wave front velocity wave front position and wave front surface profile were greatly improved making it reasonable to be the theoretical solution of dry bed case in figs 2 and 3 the wave height h horizontal coordinate x time t is non dimensionalized as h h 1 x h 1 t t g h 1 respectively in which g is gravitation acceleration it can be observed that the numerical results agree very well with the experimental data at different time for both dry bed and wet bed cases also the numerical results are much closed to theoretical solutions by chanson 2006 in fig 2 and stoker 1957 in fig 3 for dry bed case and wet bed case respectively the above comparisons indicate that the flow 3d numerical model can accurately simulate the generation and propagation of dam break wave and is employed to simulate three physical experiments dry bed case r 0 wet bed cases r 0 1 and 0 4 carried out by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 in the following sections 3 dam break wave propagation in dry bed case r 0 at the instant when the gate removed away completely namely t 0 the pressure field of the water body will be redistributed immediately due to gravity and atmospheric pressure the pressure contour at t 0 is shown in fig 4 the pressure at the interface between the initial gate position and the upstream water is the same as the free surface is equal to the atmospheric pressure the pressure contours are bent downward and intersect with the bottom boundary behind the initial gate position in order to analyze the generation and propagation of dam break wave the mark points 1 14 are defined and numbered in order from bottom to top as shown in fig 4 i e mark point 1 locates at the gate bottom mark points 2 11 locate at the gate mark points 12 14 locate at the top surface the spacing between these points is 0 025 m these mark points are modeled by setting several moving history probes which follows the flow as marker particles flow science inc 2014 the characteristics of flow filed change with time and could be approximately divided into two stages the very initial stage approximately 0 s t 0 1 s mark points near the gate act free falling and the vertical velocity component dominates and the relatively stable stage approximately t 0 1 s mark points gradually transit into horizontal movement and horizontal velocity component dominates at the wave front which will be discussed as follows 3 1 the very initial stage in the very initial stage the water near channel bottom flows downstream under gravity shown in fig 5 a because the pressure near channel bottom is larger shown in fig 4 the wave free surface is a smooth curve that is convex upward at both the wave front tip and the upstream edge where the velocity is approximately zero while in the middle it is concave upward the mark points start to move from their initial positions as shown in fig 5 a the mark points all locate on the surface and mark point 1 locates at the wave front followed by the rest mark points in order the vertical motions of the mark points 5 9 11 and 14 which initially located near the top of the gate are compared with the analytical solution based on asymptotic expansion method by pohle 1950 shown in fig 6 comparison shows that the present numerical results match the analytical solution by pohle 1950 very well from t 0s to t 0 1s but significant differences are observed when t 0 1s the comparison in fig 6 validates the precondition of analytical solution by pohle 1950 that is these mark points at the gate act free falling motion with gravitation acceleration g in the very initial stage until t 0 1s but with acceleration slightly smaller than g when t 0 1s also it is found that horizontal movement obtained by analytical solution of pohle 1950 is too short to be compared meaningfully with present numerical solution and is omitted here the trajectories of representative mark points are plotted in fig 7 which indicates that in the very initial stage the bottom mark point 1 moves horizontally downstream but the mark points near the top of the gate namely points 5 9 11 and 14 move downstream with a small horizontal displacement component and a large vertical displacement component generated by free falling motion the direction of the wave velocity is mainly downward especially in the area far away from the bottom as shown in fig 5 a the vertical velocity and the vertical acceleration at this moment cannot be neglected the wave front velocity increases gradually with kinetic energy converted from the potential energy in the very initial stage as shown in fig 8 and the bottom resistance is proportional to the velocity near bottom theoretically relationship between bottom resistance and wave free surface is shown in fig 9 which exactly shows that the bottom resistance increases gradually from the upstream edge to wave front at the wave front it increases sharply and reaches its maximum the turbulence kinetic energy is mainly generated by the bottom resistance and concentrates in the thin layer near the bottom similar as bottom resistance the turbulence kinetic energy increases gradually from the upstream edge to the downstream and reaches its maximum at the wave front shown in fig 10 a and its exact maximum value in propagation process is shown in fig 11 note that the maximum value itself increases from 0 at t 0 s to 0 03 at t 0 1 s at the very initial stage 3 2 the relatively stable stage the wave surface in this stage is similar as that in the very initial stage i e it is a smooth curve that convex upward at upstream edge and wave front while in the middle it is concave upward as shown in fig 5 b and c note that according to ritter 1892 shallow water solution the averaged wave height h and velocity u change with time at the downstream and the upstream area but they are constants at the gate and equal to 4 h 1 9 and 2 g h 1 3 respectively the froude number i e f r u g h 1 at the gate which represents critical flow at the gate and the froude number at the downstream and upstream of the gate is larger and smaller than 1 representing supercritical flow and subcritical flow at the downstream and upstream area respectively the bottom mark point 1 moves fastest and locates at the wave front all the time as shown in fig 5 b as time goes on the mark points 2 to 5 gradually gather in the vicinity of the wave front and then advance together with mark point 1 as compared and shown in fig 5 b and c all the mark points stay on the wave surface and their relative positions remain unchanged the trajectories of the mark points are shown in fig 7 which clearly demonstrate the horizontal trajectory of mark point 1 and a transition from vertical dominate trajectory to horizontal dominate trajectory for the other mark points in time interval 0 1s 0 5s and from t 0 5s all the points have approximately horizontal trajectories at the wave front the direction of the velocity gradually becomes horizontal and the average velocity of cross section increases from upstream to downstream as time goes on the velocity profile tends to be the same as that of uniform flow as compared in fig 5 b and c for t 0 5s and t 1 8s respectively the wave front velocity increases from t 0 1s to t 0 5s and then decreases gradually in this stage as shown in fig 8 this is because wave front resistance increases with the velocity and eventually dissipates more kinetic energy which in turn leads to the slow of wave front velocity the bottom resistance distribution in this stage t 0 5s and t 1 8s is similar to that of the very initial stage t 0 1s that is the similar distribution pattern but different slope of change and peek value shown in fig 9 by comparison of the bottom resistance peak value of different times it could be observed that the peek value increases firstly then decreases later with time as described in the very initial stage the turbulent kinetic energy in this stage is also mainly generated by the bottom resistance and concentrated in a thin layer above the bottom boundary as shown in fig 10 b and c the maximum value of turbulent kinetic energy always locates at the wave front and increases first and then decreases gradually as the wave front velocity changes shown in fig 11 the peak value is about 0 07 m s 2 occurred at t 0 5s approximately 4 dam break wave propagation in wet bed cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 similar to the case of dry bed the pressure field of the water body will redistribute under gravity and boundary atmospheric pressure at the instant when the gate removed away completely i e t 0 the pressure contours and 12 mark points for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in figs 12 and 13 i e mark point 1 locates at the gate bottom mark points 2 6 locate at the downstream free surface mark points 7 9 locate at the upper part of the gate and mark points 9 12 locate on the upstream free surface behind the gate respectively the generation and approaching process of break wave could be approximately divided into three stages according to evolution of the wave surface profile the very initial stage approximately 0 s t 0 2 s the jet forms and develops keeps unbroken the fluctuating evolution stage approximately 0 2 s t 1 0 s the jet breaks and wave surface profile fluctuates and the relatively stable stage approximately t 1 0 s fluctuation decreases and the wave surface profile tends to be stable which will be analyzed in detail later 4 1 the very initial stage in this stage i e t 0 1s the water rises up from the junction of the upstream and the downstream the initial locations of mark point 2 at t 0 then forms a jet the free surface of case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in fig 14 a and fig 15 a respectively then the jet develops into a water tongue when the downstream water depth is shallow case r 0 1 shown in fig 14 b or develops into a larger mushroom like jet when the downstream water depth is large case r 0 4 shown in fig 15 b the water tongue or mushroom like jet doesn t break in this stage and the free surface near wave front fluctuates violently similar to the case of dry bed mark point 1 moves downstream almost horizontally at the bottom mark points 2 7 which initially located near the junction of the upstream and the downstream all leap upward during the formations of water tongue in the case r 0 1 demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 14 a b and by trajectories of representative points 2 4 in fig 16 and mushroom like jet in the r 0 4 demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 15 a b and by trajectories of representative points 2 4 in fig 17 and they all still locate on the free surface in the very initial stage however their relative positions are changed as to mark points 8 12 which initially located near the top of the gate move downward and downstream in order at the free surface and their relative positions remain unchanged their vertical movements due to free falling motion from t 0s to t 0 1s not influenced by downstream water depth are the same as that in dry bed case and the mark points 8 9 12 almost fall downward freely from t 0s to t 0 1s but they gradually begin to move downstream horizontally from t 0 1s to t 0 2s shown in figs 16 and 17 for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 respectively the velocity fields for case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are also plotted in fig 14 a b and fig 15 a b respectively what could be observed is that both the magnitude and direction of the velocity change prominently and the vertical velocity and acceleration cannot be ignored the interfaces between the upstream water and the downstream water of case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 are shown in fig 18 a and fig 19 a respectively together with experimental data kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 numerical interface for the deep downstream water case r 0 4 by ye and zhao 2017 is also compared in fig 19 a which is numerically simulated with two phase flow but without simulating the gate move process comparisons indicate that numerical results of this paper agree very well with ye and zhao 2017 solutions and also agree reasonably well with experimental data except little differences is observed at the top of the interface the downstream water is completely pushed to move forward by the approaching upstream water no matter in r 0 1 or r 0 4 case and then a jet is formed in the very initial stage note that the little difference at the top of the interface in this stage can be mainly attributed to the lack of gate in the numerical model more detailed information is available in the work by ye and zhao 2017 the bottom resistances and the corresponding free surface in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 are plotted in fig 20 a and fig 21 a respectively which shows the maximum values of bottom resistance occur at the end of or trough behind the water tongue or mushroom like jet approximately this is because the bottom velocity is largest at the troughs due to the decrease of the flow cross section as the larger the velocity the bigger the bottom resistance the turbulent kinetic energy is mainly caused by the bottom resistance and concentrated in a thin layer above the bottom their cloud maps are shown in fig 22 a b and fig 23 a b for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively 4 2 the fluctuating evolution stage in this stage the water tongue impacts the downstream water and then breaks in case r 0 1 and the mushroom like jet immerses into the downstream water and then breaks in case r 0 4 the wave surfaces fluctuate up and down violently the velocity including amplitude and direction changes remarkably shown in fig 14 c d for case r 0 1 and fig 15 c d for case r 0 4 which results in the intensive fluctuation of mark points and eventually leads to prominent difference of trajectories among mark points still the vertical velocities and accelerations cannot be ignored in this stage especially at the wave front mark point 1 moves to downstream horizontally along the bottom mark points 2 7 are involved into the water when the water tongue impacting into the downstream water in case r 0 1 both of their horizontal and vertical relative positions change demonstrated by mark point position in fig 14 c d and by the trajectories of the representative points 2 4 in fig 16 however mark points 2 7 all float on the free surface when the mushroom like jet immersing into the downstream water in case r 0 4 and their vertical relative positions change with fluctuation but their horizontal relative positions remain unchanged demonstrated by mark point position in fig 15 c d and by the trajectories of the representative points 2 4 in fig 17 both in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 mark points 8 12 locate at the wave surface all the time while moving downstream in order their vertical relative positions change with the fluctuation of the free surface but their horizontal relative positions remain unchanged shown in fig 14 c d fig 15 c d figs 16 and 17 the numerical results of interface between upstream and downstream water agree reasonably well with experimental data and ye and zhao 2017 results in this stage and the numerical interface is a convex curve that extends to the wave front in case r 0 1 shown in fig 18 b c however the interface is basically vertical and keeps some distance away from the wave front in case r 0 4 shown in fig 19 b c the little difference of the mixing degree at the interface between numerical result and experimental data can be mainly attributed to the lack of gate in the numerical model for more details one can refer to ye and zhao 2017 and it will be no longer explained in the subsequent stage due to the same reason in this stage the bottom resistance has a crest value at the trough that immediate upstream of the jet for both cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 shown in fig 20 a and fig 21 a respectively as the velocity at the trough is relatively larger due to the compression of the flow cross section in case r 0 1 the maximum bottom resistance value moves downstream as the corresponding trough moves downstream and in case r 0 4 the maximum bottom resistance value moves upstream as the corresponding trough moves upstream which agrees with the solution by stoker 1957 that the upstream edge of the surge region moves to downstream when r 0 1384 and moves to upstream when r 0 1384 at a constant speed the upstream edge of the surge region presented by stoker 1957 for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 are presented with short lines in fig 20 b and fig 21 b respectively in which short dashed line is for t 0 2s short wide solid line is for t 0 5s and short fine solid line is for t 2 0s in this stage the water tongue and mushroom like jet break the turbulent kinetic energy is mainly generated by the wave breaking and located in the wave front tip areas the position of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy locates at the interface between the upper surging bore and bottom relatively quiescent water in case r 0 1 shown in fig 22 c d and the position of which locates at the surface that slightly upstream of the wave front in case r 0 4 shown in fig 23 c d the maximum turbulent kinetic energy reaches its maximum at t 0 6s in case r 0 1 and at t 0 8s in case r 0 4 in this stage shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively 4 3 the relatively stable stage the fluctuation of the wave surface gradually decreases and wave front profile tends to be stable the slope of the wave front of case r 0 1 is smaller than that of case r 0 4 shown in fig 14 e and fig 15 e respectively the horizontal component of velocity dominates and the magnitude changes remarkably from the upper layer to bottom layer at the wave front in this stage both in case r 0 1 and case r 0 4 shown in fig 14 e and fig 15 e respectively the velocity distribution along water depth some distance away from upstream gradually tends to be the same as uniform flow still mark point 1 moves to downstream horizontally at the bottom all the time both in cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 mark points 2 7 in case r 0 1 continue fluctuating downstream with deceasing amplitude in the water mark points 8 12 in case r 0 1 and all the mark points in case r 0 4 continue floating on the surface and fluctuating up and down with the decreasing amplitude when approaching downstream all the points almost move horizontally and their relative positions have no dramatic changes in this stage demonstrated by mark point positions in fig 14 e and trajectories in fig 16 for case r 0 1 and accordingly fig 15 e and fig 17 for case r 0 4 reasonably good agreement are achieved when the numerical results of interface between upstream and downstream are compared with experimental data and ye and zhao 2017 solutions in this stage the numerical interface is similar to that in the previous stage of case r 0 1 the upper layer of the interface namely the upstream water drags the lower layer water and moves downstream shown in fig 18 d e in case r 0 4 the numerical interface is further away from the wave front than that in previous stage and almost keeps vertical the upstream water pushes the downstream water downstream horizontally shown in fig 19 d e in case r 0 1 the position of the maximum bottom resistance continues moving downstream with the correspond trough at the trough bottom resistance has maximum value and the bottom resistance decreases gradually from the upstream to wave front as shown in fig 20 a this is because the bottom velocity gradually deceases from the upstream to wave front as energy of wave front will be dissipated when the lower layer static water is dragged to the downstream by the upstream water also tiny fluctuation of bottom resistance force due to the fluctuation of bottom velocity at wave front could be observed in case r 0 4 the position of the maximum bottom resistance continues moving upstream with the correspond trough at the trough bottom resistance has maximum value and the bottom resistance decreases gradually with the stabilization of the wave surface the bottom resistance from the wave front to the upstream is basically unchanged as the bottom velocity is approximately the same from the wave front to the upstream as shown in fig 15 e the weaker fluctuation of bottom resistance could be observed because the bottom velocity fluctuates weakly as the larger downstream water depth minimize the disturbance from the wave front shown in fig 21 a the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy is the same as that described in previous stage shown in fig 22 e and fig 23 e for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively the maximum values of the turbulent kinetic energy gradually tend to constant as the wave front surface profiles tend to stable as shown in figs 24 and 25 for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 respectively another 6 mark points namely a1 a6 are defined downstream far away from the gate namely at x 2 50 m and x 2 54 m to help analyze how the lower layer under wave front tip is propelled to move downstream by the wave front in the relatively stable stage shown in fig 26 a and 27 a for cases r 0 1 and r 0 4 note that according to stoker 1957 shallow water solution the froude numbers f r u g h u and h are the averaged velocity and wave height behind the bore front are 1 178 and 0 456 for case r 0 1 and r 0 4 representing supercritical flow and subcritical flow respectively in the case r 0 1 the mark points locate at the upper and middle layers of the downstream water in the relatively stable stage mark points a3 a6 and a2 a5 respectively are involved upward into the bore then roll forward and the original upper layer point a6 is dragged downward by the slowly moving bottom layer water their relative positions change during this process shown in fig 26 b and fig 26 c in case r 0 4 those mark points a3 a6 at upper layer of the downstream water in the relatively stable stage are also involve upward into the bore but move forward almost horizontally with velocity larger than those horizontally moving mark points a2 a5 at the middle layer their relative positions almost keep unchanged shown in fig 27 b and fig 27 c so in the relatively stable stage of dam break wave propagation the mixing of the upper layer and the middle layer downstream water is obvious in shallow downstream water condition but is not obvious in deep downstream water condition which also can be shown by trajectories in fig 28 and fig 29 5 comparison and discussion the bottom resistance in dry bed case is bigger than that in wet bed cases and the bottom resistance decreases when the downstream water depth increases compared in fig 30 note that only bottom resistance distribution curves at t 0 5s are compared and comparisons at other times lead to the same results omitted here for brevity ignoring the bottom resistance in dry bed case would introduce remarkable deviation into wave front velocity calculation i e fig 8 which takes bottom resistance into consideration indicates the variation of the wave front velocity with time however the solution by ritter 1892 which neglects the bottom resistance vertical velocity and acceleration is estimated to be a constant value as 2 g h 1 3 13 m s on the contrary wave front velocity and wave front surface profile will match the experimental data well if the bottom resistance is considered i e comparison between the solution by chanson 2006 and experimental data shown in fig 2 b c the maximum turbulent kinetic energy both for dry bed and wet bed cases change with time increasing relatively slowly in the very initial stage increasing shapely and reaches its peak value at t 0 4s in dry bed case at t 0 6s in care r 0 1 and at t 0 8s in case r 0 4 in the fluctuation evolution stage then decreasing gradually and finally tending to be stable at a constant value shown in fig 31 in the very initial stage the maximum turbulent kinetic energy of dry bed case is larger than that of case r 0 1 and the latter is larger than case r 0 4 because the water tongue of case r 0 1 and the mushroom like jet of case r 0 4 have not broken yet and the maximum turbulent kinetic energy is mainly generated by the bottom resistance the peak value of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy of case r 0 1 is larger than that of r 0 4 and the latter is larger than that of dry bed case this is because the turbulent kinetic energy mainly produced by wave breaking in wet bed cases in this stage is larger than that still produced by bottom resistance in dry bed case and for wet bed cases when the downstream water depth is shallow i e case r 0 1 the velocity gradient between upper and lower layers at wave front is larger thus the wave breaking is more violently therefore the corresponding turbulent kinetic energy is larger than deeper downstream water case i e case r 0 4 6 conclusions dam break simulation method based on flow 3d has been validated by experimental data then three physical experiment cases including dry bed case shallow downstream water case r 0 1 and deep downstream water case r 0 4 conducted by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 are studied numerically a comprehensive flow filed involving wave front surface profile velocity distribution mark point movement and trajectory bottom resistance turbulent kinetic energy and interface between upstream and downstream have been studied from the very initial stage to relatively stable stage elaborately comparison shows the prominent difference of flow fields between different downstream water depth cases i e r 0 r 0 1 and r 0 4 the main conclusions are detailed as follows 1 for dry bed case the free surface is a smooth curve which is convex upward at both the wave front tip and the upstream edge but is concave upward in the middle and the convex part will develop into a water tongue in shallow downstream water case or mushroom like jet in deep downstream water case then both will break and approach downstream with fluctuation and tends to be stable later 2 in dry bed case wave front velocity increases firstly then decreases gradually the vertical velocity and acceleration cannot be ignored in the very initial and the fluctuating evolution stage in both dry bed and wet bed cases 3 in dry bed case the mark points locate on free surface and move downstream in order their relative positions keep unchanged and result in similar trajectories the water in different layers moves downstream almost without much mixing in the very initial stage and fluctuating evolution stage the mark points near the junction between upstream and downstream are involved in the current in shallow downstream water case i e r 0 1 but float on the free surface in deep downstream water case i e r 0 4 when approaching downstream with fluctuation the mixing of water in different layer near the gate in shallow downstream water case is more prominent than that in deep downstream water condition in the relatively stable stage the mark points locate at the upper layer of downstream water are involved upward into the bore roll forward and their relative positions change in shallow downstream water case however rolling is not observed and they move almost horizontally with their relative positions unchanged in deep downstream water case the mixing of the upper layer and middle layer of the downstream water is more obvious in shallow downstream water case than in deep downstream water case 4 the interface of upstream and downstream is convex curve that extends to the wave front in shallow downstream water case and the interface is vertical and keeps some distance away from the wave front in deep downstream water case the downstream water is completely pushed to move forward by the upstream water 5 in dry bed case the maximum of the bottom resistance occurs at the wave front tip in wet bed case the maximum of bottom resistance occurs at the upstream edge of the surge region and decreasing from this location to both upstream and downstream in shallow downstream water case while decreasing from this location to upstream but almost keep unchanged downstream in deep downstream water case the position where maximum bottom resistance occurs moves downstream in shallow downstream water case however moves upstream in deep downstream water case the bottom resistance in dry bed case is larger than that in shallow downstream water case and the latter is larger than that in deep downstream water case that is the shallower the downstream water depth the larger the bottom resistance 6 in dry bed case the turbulent kinetic energy distributes in a thin layer at the bottom and gets its maximum value at the wave front tip the maximum of turbulent kinetic energy happens at the interface between upper surge and lower quiescent water at wave front in shallow downstream water case and the maximum happens at the surface that slightly upstream of the wave front in deep downstream water case the maximum of the turbulence kinetic energy in the very initial stage mainly generated by bottom resistance in dry bed case is larger than that in wet bed cases but after wave breaking the maximum turbulence kinetic energy in shallow downstream water case is larger than that in deep downstream water case and the latter is larger than that in dry bed case because in this stage turbulence kinetic energy is mainly generated by wave breaking in wet bed cases and the intensity of wave breaking in shallow downstream water case is more violent than that in deep downstream water case generally a thorough insight into the generation and propagation process of dam break flow with different downstream water depth is presented in this paper however because of the sophistication of the dam break flow some influencing parameters such as gate remove process bottom scour the change of initial depth of the impound water etc are not taken into consideration in this study in the further study the effects of these parameters on the characteristics of dam break wave deserve detailed concerns and more importantly the dam break flow forces on structures such as bridges residential houses and downstream dams deserve much more attention acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science

23378,in this paper a robust finite time trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle auv which belongs to the class of highly nonlinear coupled dynamics with motion in 6 degrees of freedom dof the finite time error convergence and robust control task is accomplished by designing a non singular fast fuzzy terminal sliding mode controller nfftsmc with disturbance estimator for the 6 dof dynamics of an auv the proposed nfftsmc incorporates a non singular fast terminal sliding mode controller nftsmc which not only assures faster and finite convergence of the tracking errors to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase portrait but also eliminates the issue of singularity dilemma appeared in conventional terminal sliding mode controller tsmc a fuzzy logic control flc tool is employed to generate the hitting control signal in order to reduce chattering in control inputs which commonly occur in conventional tsmc and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the un modeled dynamics external disturbances and time varying parameters furthermore to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method it has been extended to

research has gained a huge momentum due to advancement in underwater research the control system design is one of most active research area in the underwater technology for performing nontrivial underwater missions londhe et al 2017a 2017b to ensure operator safety and wide application range nowadays auvs are mostly preferred compared to remotely operated vehicles rovs for performing deep and hazardous environmental underwater tasks londhe et al 2017a 2017b jacobi 2015 to acquire the good quality of data from ocean resources the accurate position and attitude control of an underwater vehicle is immensely desirable in the existence of highly unstructured ocean environment kim et al 2016 londhe et al 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 this demands designing of a accurate trajectory tracking

time many researchers have been suggested numerous advanced auv control systems including sliding mode control smc robust and adaptive control fuzzy logic and neural network control which can accommodate the large perturbations in the auv dynamics under unstructured ocean environment nevertheless there is still scope to enhance the performance of the auv s motion when dealing with unstructured and time varying operating conditions over a few decades many control methods have been proposed to solve vehicle control issues and can be found in the literature the linear controllers like proportional integral derivative pid control were firstly suggested in jalving 1994 designed separately for steering diving and speed subsystems of the vehicle and subsequently decoupled proportional derivative pd set point controller was introduced in herman 2009 for auvs however these controls do not solve the problem of integral windup when actuator goes to saturation to handle this problem s miyamoto et al miyamaoto et al 2001 employed a single loop pid structure with an anti windup technique for maneuvering control of an auv as an extension to this a dual loop variable structure pid controller with the anti windup technique was adopted in kim et al 2013 for improved performance the authors in feng et al 2002 and roy et al 2013 proposes a h controller and robust controller respectively in order to deal with hydrodynamic parametric uncertainties and payload variations during path tracking of auvs sliding mode control smc technique is one of most efficient and robust control technique due to its invariance properties like robustness order reduction and disturbance rejection utkin 1977 young et al 1999 firstly the smc was designed for underwater vehicles by yoerger and slotine 1985 for robust trajectory tracking control first experimental results using adaptive smc were obtained by yoerger and slotine 1991 in 1991 and discusses their implementation issues furthermore successful design of decoupled control approaches were proposed by cristi et al 1990 using adaptive smc for auv in the diving plane and multivariable sliding mode autopilot design by healey and lienard 1993 for steering depth and speed control functions of an auv consequently motion control of an auv in steering and diving plane was studied in rodrigues et al 1996 then in 1999 a discrete time quasi smc was suggested by p m lee et al for diving control of an experimental auv with paramter uncertainties and large sampling interval also to strengthen the performance of smc a higher order sliding mode control was designed torpedo auv for diving control salgado jimenez and jouvencel 2003 the control and coordination of multiple auvs in horizontal plane have been extensively studied in liu and geng 2013 by applying finite time optimal formation control method however most of the aforementioned controllers require a full or partial information about hydrodynamic coeeficients and disturbances for the accurate design of control scheme additionally the smc based control design suffers from the chattering phenomenon this problem can be overcome by approximating discontinuous term s g n by continouos function like hyperbolic tangent function etc elmokadem et al 2015 also chattering can be reduces by increasing the order of the sliding surface has been successfully examined in joe et al 2014 furthermore chattering can be significantly removed by time delay controller suggested in kim et al 2016 kumar et al 2007 and have been successfully applied to tracking control of an auv an alternative way to tackle these issue is to use intelligent control approaches like fuzzy logic and neural network control and have been widely applied in control of robotic systems chen et al 2016 he et al 2016 these intelligent control methods have been successfully applied to the control of underwater vehicles venugopal et al 1992 jagannathan and galan 2003 ranganathan et al 2001 smith et al 1994 song and smith 2001 but investigating the stability and robustness of these intelligent control methods is found very rigorous and difficult to check patre et al 2015 recently the fusion of soft computing methodologies like fuzzy logic control flc with sliding mode control becoming a most promising control technique since it gives guaranteed stability and strong robustness against parameter variations patre et al 2015 kaynak et al 2001 on the other hand this fusion attempt to alleviate the implementation issues of the smc caused due to discontinuous term in the control law of smc known as chattering kaynak et al 2001 this fusion is commonly termed as a fuzzy sliding mode control fsmc in the literature the main strengths of the fsmc are shahraz and boozarjomehry 2009 1 it does not demand full knowledge about the system model because of the qualitative interpretation offered by fuzzy inference system 2 the fuzzy control rules can be easily created by using sliding mode concepts which guarantees the stability and robustness of the system therefore fsmc has been widely applied to the control of underwater vehicles in recent years initially song and smith 2000 proposed a sliding mode fuzzy controllers for heading and pitch control of an auv in order to obtain time optimal control performance f c chiu et al 2000 and j guo et al 2003 has applied sliding mode fuzzy controller to the guidance and control by line of sight guidance mechanism in the horizontal plane also the control law was validated using a number of tank tests and sea trials an adaptive fsmc for control of an auv in vertical plane has been proposed in balasuriya and cong 2003 which can proximate the un modeled auv dynamics and gives robust control performance the decoupled expanded adaptive fsmc has been designed by using the fuzzy basis function expansions for underwater flight vehicle ufv depth control problem kim and shin 2007 wallace m bessa et al 2008 2010 has been perfectly employed an adaptive fsmc to the effective positioning of rov which enhanced the tracking performance by compensating the effect of uncertainty disturbances recently a fsmc with adaptive disturbance approximation xin and zaojian 2010 and enhanced dynamic fsmc lakhekar et al 2015 for diving control plane of an auv has been designed however aforementioned control methods suffers from following disadvantages 1 most of the above mentioned controllers uses decoupled control approaches by neglecting cross coupling terms however for performing interactive underwater tasks control of an auv in six dof is required with reasonable accuracy few attempts are made in kim et al 2016 antonelli 2007 antonelli et al 2003 gao et al 2016 karkoub et al 2017 kim et al 2015 shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 zhang et al 2010 2 tracking errors converges to the equilibrium point in infinite settling time 3 to obtain high precision in control and strong robustness property the knowledge about the upper bounds of norm of the lumped disturbance vector is required to be known in prior 4 moreover most of the controllers face the problems in selecting appropriate fuzzy control rules and membership functions while designing an flc for real time applications to address these problems this study proposes a disturbance estimator based nfftsmc designed for the complete nonlinear dynamical model of an auv for trajectory tracking control with motion in 6 dof venkataraman et al venkataraman and gulati 1993 and man et al zhihong et al 1994 firstly proposed the concept of terminal smc tsmc by adding a nonlinear term into linear sliding manifold to assure finite time state convergence londhe et al 2017d elmokadem et al 2017 however the conventional tsmc suffers from a singularity dilemma and the control amplitude may go to infinity whenever the error approaches to zero feng et al 2002 significant research has been made to evade the singularity issue by non singular tsmc ntsmc feng et al 2002 2013 chen and lin 2011 jin et al 2009 nevertheless ntsmc suffers from two major disadvantages 1 it exhibits a slower convergence rate when tracking errors are afar from the equilibrium point than the conventional smc and 2 high frequency chattering in control input due to the existence of a discontinuous function in the control term in this paper the first disadvantage is overcome by adding one more nonlinear term to the sliding surface of ntsmc termed as fast ntsmc furthermore chattering problem is eliminated by designing a fuzzy logic control to approximate the discontinuous control term in overall the major contribution of this study can be summaries as follows 1 the proposed nfftsmc is designed for a 6 dof nonlinear model of an auv for trajectory tracking control with motion in 6 dof without decoupling the auv dynamics 2 the proposed control ensures finite time states convergence with faster convergence rate to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase plane 3 the fuzzy control rules are derived based on the lyapunov energy function in order to eradicate the chattering problem usually occurred in ntsmc 4 finally a disturbance estimator is proposed to estimate the perturbations from the dynamics of a terminal sliding manifold to reimburse for hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties unmodeled dynamics unknown forces like an ocean current and measurement sensor noises and at every sampling instant the control input reimburse for the uncertainties that exist thus eliminates the need of information of the bounds of perturbation vector in prior 5 the overall closed loop stability and finite time convergence property are proved by lyapunov sense an extensive numerical simulation study on an experimental auv has been performed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed nfftsmc approach from the performance analysis of the suggested method it is confirmed that the proposed method is robust against not only with parameter uncertainties but also with the time varying ocean current as compared with csmc and ntsmc schemes in order to verify the validness of the proposed method it has been successfully extended to task space control problem of an auvms employed for underwater mission like pre defined trajectory tracking control tasks generally underwater mission involves nontrivial underwater tasks such as deep sea pipelines survey and tracking oceanographic mapping and surveillance etc santhakumar and kim 2011 shim et al 2010 when the manipulator is attached to an auv then controlling it becomes even more difficult because of increased non linearity strong coupling between manipulator and auv and resulting high dimensional nature of an auvms also due to attached manipulator arm auvms becomes a kinematically redundant structure requiring redundancy resolution schemes to handle the situation sarkar and podder 2001 shang and cong 2014a shang et al 2012 2013 task space based control could be most desirable in such situation since it does not require the inverse kinematics furthermore the task space control is more appropriate when the online modification in the task pace of the end effector is frequently required ismail 2011 shang and cong 2014b therefore task space control is designed by using proposed nfftsmc for pre defined complex trajectory tracking control of an auvms the validness of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system consisting of an auv and a two link rotary 2r serial planar manipulator this paper is structured as follows a brief introduction to auv dynamics is presented in section 2 section 3 detailed a design of proposed nfftsmc method in section 4 stability of the proposed method is proved by lyapunov sense simulation results of the proposed controller to an experimental auv is demonstrated in section 5 a case study showing task space control problem of an auvms is demonstrated in section 6 subsequently the concluding remark in section 7 2 auv dynamics the equations of motion for an auv can be described with respect to an inertial frame x e y e z e or body fixed reference frame x 0 y 0 z 0 as depicted in fig 1 the velocity transformation mapping between tow co ordinate system is given by 1 η j η ν where η denotes the vector of position and orientation of the vehicle expressed in inertial frame and denoted as 2 η x y z φ θ ψ t ν is the vector of linear and angular velocity expressed in body fixed frame and represented as 3 ν p q r u v w t and j η is the euler angle mapping matrix the different notations defined in this work are according to the sname 1950 notations sname 1950 usually the dynamics of an underwater vehicle is always formulated in body fixed reference

and τ ℜ 6 represents control efforts including thrusters forces forces and moments causing stern rudder plane deflections by applying the velocity transformations stated in eq 1 to eq 4 assuming that j η is non singular matrix the equation of motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial frame is expressed as 5 m η η η c η ν η η d η ν η η g η η τ η where 6 m η η j t η m j 1 η c η ν η j t η c ν m

of an auv in 5 will give 7 m η η m η η η c η ν η c η ν η η d η ν η d η ν η η g η η g η η τ η τ e d i s now by collecting unknown part including parameter uncertainties un modeled dynamics and unknown external forces like ocean current into a single vector term as lumped uncertainty τ d i s then 7 can be written as 8 m ˆ η η η c ˆ η ν η η d ˆ η ν η η g ˆ η η τ η τ d i s where 9 τ d i s τ e d i s m

η c ˆ η ν η η d ˆ η ν η η g ˆ η η the dynamics expressed by 8 possess the following properties fossen 1994 which are used in the subsequent control law development and closed loop stability analysis here the pitch angle is restricted to θ π 2 property 1 m η η is symmetric and positive definite spd i e 11 m η η m η t η 0 η ℜ 6 there are positive constants m m and m m such that m m m η η m m

system is to make a auv position vector η perfectly follow η d then the position trajectory tracking error is written as 14 e η d η the terminal sliding surface tss for an 6 dof auv tracking system is choosen as feng et al 2002 15 s e βsi g p q e 0 where s s 1 s i s n t ℜ n is sliding surface β d i a g β 1 β i β n ℜ n n in which β i i 1 n is a positive constant si g p q e e 1 p q s i g n e 1 e i p

ζ i s i where ζ i i 1 n 0 under sufficient condition given by 16 suggest the following tsmc control law 17 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g q p 1 e e ksgn s n ˆ η ν η η which ensures that tsm occurs k d i a g k 11 k i i k n n is a positive definite and diagonal parameter matrix and k i i i 1 n 0 during reaching phase i e s i 0 then tracking error e i will reach the tss s i 0 in the finite time t r i i 1 n which satisfies 18 t r i s i 0 k i i now when once the tss s i 0 is reached the system dynamics of e i is govern by 19 e i β i e i p q s i g n e i soving equation 19 for the finite time t s i i 1 n from e i t r i 0 to e i t r i t s i 0 will give zhihong et al 1994 20 t s i 1 β i e i t r i 0 e i q p d e i p β i p q e i t r i 1 q p hence from 20 will give finite time convergence of both the tracking error e i and its derivative e i to zero it can be noted that the term containing si g q p 1 e e from 17 may cause singularity to occur if e 0 when e 0 due to negative power of e feng et al 2002 as a results 17 will give unbounded control forces and moments which may lead to instability of the auv tracking control system in order to deal with this singularity issue a ntsmc has been investigated by many researchers feng et al 2002 2013 chen and lin 2011 jin et al 2009 3 2 ntsmc now to overcome the issue of singularity a non singular tss for system 10 is choosen as feng et al 2002 chen and lin 2011 21 s e 1 β si g p q e 0 where β p and q are defined in 15 and si g p q e e 1 p q s i g n e 1 e i p q s i g n e i e n p q s i g n e n t ℜ n when tsm occurs i e s 0 then the dynamics in 10 is governed by 22 e i β i q p e i q p s i g n e i it could be noted that when s i 0 the non singular tss 21 is equivalent to the nonlinear tss 15 also from 19 and 22 it can be noted that the tracking errors given by tsmc and ntsmc will reach to equilibrium point e i 0 at the same amount of finite time t s i given in 20 using sufficient condition in 16 and non singular tss defined in 21 the ntsmc control input forces moments will take the form as 23 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e ksgn s n ˆ η ν η η where si g 2 p q e e 1 2 p q s i g n e 1 e i 2 p q s i g n e i e n 2 p q s i g n e n t ℜ n however when the tracking errors are long away from the equilibrium of the phase plane the ntsmc exhibits slower convergence rate yang and yang 2010 xu et al 2015 in order to further boost the dynamic response of an ntsmc a nftsmc has been suggested in recent times and can be found in yang and yang 2010 hou et al 2014 komurcugil 2011 li et al 2014 shuo 2015 van et al 2016 3 3 nftsmc a non singular fast tss for system 10 can be defined by adding one more nonlinear term to the sliding manifold of ntsmc in 21 as 24 s e 1 α si g γ e 1 β si g p q e 0 where s ℜ n β ℜ n n are as defined in 15 α d i a g α 1 α i α n ℜ n n in which α i i 1 n 0 si g γ e e 1 γ s i g n e 1 e i γ s i g n e i e n γ s i g n e n t ℜ n and p and q are positive odd integers satisfying the relation 25 1 p q 2 and γ p q with the tss defined in 24 and according to sufficient condition for the existence of tsm a nftsmc can be designed as τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e 26 β q p si g 2 p q e ksgn s remark 1 when the tsm is achieved i e s i 0 the system dynamics is determined by 27 e i 1 α i e i γ s i g n e i 1 β i e i p q s i g n e i 0 where e i 0 is called as terminal attractor of the system the time taken to travel from e i t r i 0 to e i t r i t s i 0 is finite and given by xu et al 2012 28 t s i 1 β i q p e i t r i 0 1 τ 1 α i τ γ q p d τ from the proposed nftsmc control law in 26 it can be conclude that even though the proposed nftsmc exhibits a fast convergence property but it suffers from following two issues 1 the chattering problem caused by the constant value k and a discontinuous function sgn s which could excite un modeled high frequency dynamics of the system 2 a priori information about the upper bounds of the lumped uncertainty term τ d i s is required to obtain robust control performance one way to annihilate the chattering is to change s g n s by a saturation function s a t s φ where φ is the boundary layer introduced around the sliding surface s 0 which is given as 29 sat s φ i s i s i if s i φ i s i φ i if s i φ i where φ i is the boundary layer thickness however this solution may add steady state error into the sliding manifold slotine and li 1991 as a result the compromising situation between performance and chattering may occurred in this study chattering problem is eliminated by employing a fuzzy logic tool to model the sgn s function similarly for improved robustness an disturbance estimator is proposed for online estimation of lumped uncertainty term and then to use the estimate in the nonlinear controller to cancel the effects of the disturbance following subsections describes these methods in details 3 4 nfftsmc to diminish the chattering problem occurred in nftsmc the flc is designed based on the reaching condition of the tsmc this flc is a single input single output siso system with sliding surface s i as a input variable and a crisp control value k f z i after defuzzification as a output variable the main advantages of this flc is that the number of rules required is reduced from p 2 to p as compare to conventional two input flc with p 2 number of rules where p indicates number of fuzzification level the flc is designed by fuzzifying the crisp sliding surface defined in 24 on the universe of discourse of s i whose fuzzy sets are defined by triangular and trapezoidal membership functions the singleton membership functions are used to define the output value k f z i whose fuzzy sets are defined in the universe of discourse k the linguistic variables used for sliding surface s i are n b n s z e p s and p b where n negative p positive s small b big and z e zero and for output variable k f z i are s m a l l e r s m a l l z e r o b i g and b i g g e r fig 2 shows input output membership functions for s i and k f z i therefore under flc design the control input in 26 τ η can be modified by replacing the control gain ksgn s with a fuzzy gain k f z hence the new control input is written as τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e 30 β q p si g 2 p q e k f z n ˆ η ν η η where k f z k f z 1 k f z i k f z n t and the value of k f z i is generated by the siso flc system the value of k f z i has to be estimated by the flc in a such way that it gives reduced chattering with guaranteed stability of the overall closed loop system in order to derive the fuzzy control rules for estimating the value of a fuzzy gain k f z i the following lyapnunov candidate is considered as 31 v 1 2 s t m η s the lyapnunov candidate v in 31 indicates the energy of the sliding surface s therefore the value of fuzzy gain k f z i can be chosen in a such way that the derivative of lyapnunov candidate v in 31 is negative definite which in turn results in minimum energy of s differentiating v from 31 we have 32 v 1 2 s t m η s s t m η s s t m η s since s t m η s s t m η s and m η 2 c η property 2 2 32 can be written as 33 v s t m η s c η s the derivative of 24 will leads to 34 s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e k f z m η 1 τ d i s using 34 into 33 we have 35 v s t 1 β p q si g p q 1 e m η k f z τ d i s s t c η s v i 1 n s i 1 β i p q e i p q 1 s i g n e i m η k f z i τ d i s i s t c η s in order to maintain negative definiteness of 35 the fuzzy rules can be constructed as f 1 if s i is n b then k f z i is s m a l l e r f 2 if s i is n s then k f z i is s m a l l f 3 if s i is z e then k f z i is z e r o f 4 if s i is p s then k f z i is b i g f 5 if s i is p b then k f z i is b i g g e r the above analysis indicate that the each fuzzy rule has to connect the input sliding manifold to the output control value based on the distance of the state to the sliding surface s 0 the fuzzy inference engine performs the mapping from fuzzy input subsets s i to fuzzy output fuzzy sets k f z i based upon the rule base and compositional rule of inference the crisp output value of k f z i is extracted from fuzzy output by the center average defuzzifier 36 k f z i n 1 n θ i n μ f i n s i n 1 n μ f i n s i θ i t ξ i s i where n indicates number of rules and θ i t θ i 1 θ i n θ i n is the consequent part of the fuzzy rules ξ i s i ξ i 1 s i ξ i n s i ξ i n s i t and ξ i n s i μ f i n s i n 1 n μ f i n s i is the weight of singleton fuzzy subset and ξ i s i weight vector of each singleton fuzzy subsets the difference between nftsmc with boundary layer and flc is that the control gain value estimated by flc varies along with the sliding manifold all the time as shown in fig 3 3 5 disturbance estimator based nfftsmc in this section the dynamic disturbance estimation approach is proposed to estimate the unknown perturbations from the dynamics of the non singular fast terminal sliding surface this can be accomplished by treating the effects of the system uncertainties nonlinearities unmodeled dynamics cross coupling effects and external disturbances like an ocean current as a total or composite disturbance termed as lumped uncertainty acting on the auv system and then estimate this unknown quantity by disturbance estimation approach finally its effect on the auv can be canceled out by augmenting it in the nonlinear nfftsmc law given by 30 therefore the modified controller is given as 37 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e β q p si g 2 p q e k f z τ ˆ d i s n ˆ η ν η η fig 4 explains the basic idea of a typical disturbance estimator the output of the disturbance estimator can be used in feed forward compensation of disturbances and this will avoid the use of high feedback gains to have excellent tracking performance and smooth control actions few assumptions are made to prove the overall stability of whole system assumption 1 the value of the lumped disturbance is arbitrarily large and slowly varying with time i e τ d i s 0 kelly et al 2005 yatoh et al 2008 sabanovic and ohnishi 2011 antonelli 2014 mohan and kim 2015 assumption 2 the disturbance estimator gain namely γ is constant symmetric positive definite spd matrix i e 38 γ γ t 0 the proposed disturbance estimator is given as 39 τ ˆ d i s ϒ γ η 40 ϒ γ m ˆ η 1 τ η ϒ γ η n ˆ η ν η η s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e where τ ˆ d i s is the vector of estimated lumped uncertainty term ϒ is an auxiliary vector to estimate the unknown perturbations from the dynamics of tsm manifold let us express the estimation error as 41 τ d i s τ d i s τ ˆ d i s now τ ˆ d i s is to be modify in a such way that the estimation error τ d i s goes to zero within a finite amount of time differentiating 39 42 τ ˆ d i s ϒ γ η using 40 and 10 we have 43 τ ˆ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e rearranging 43 gives 44 τ d i s τ ˆ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e τ d i s τ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e τ d i s the assumption 3 1 holds true if 45 τ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e 4 stability analysis the convergence property of the proposed control method has been proved in this section with following assumptions assumption 3 the lumped disturbance term τ d i s is bounded and there exits a constant d m a x 0 such that 0 τ d i s d m a x but value of upper of bound of d m a x is not required to be known assumption 4 the measurement of states η and η are available for feedback assumption 5 η d η d and η d are available with known bounds theorem 4 1 for the uncertain nonlinear system defined in 10 if the tsm is chosen as 24 and control law in 37 then all the tracking error signals are bounded and converges to equilibrium point in finite time proof select the following lyapnunov function candidate 46 v 1 2 s t s 1 2 τ d i s t τ d i s taking derivative of 46 results into 47 v s t s τ d i s t τ d i s now from 34 and 45 we have v s t 1 β p q si g p q 1 e k f z m η 1 τ d i s 48 τ d i s t γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e simplification of 48 leads to 49 v i 1 n s i 1 β i p q e i p q 1 s i g n e i k f z i m η 1 τ d i s i τ d i s i t τ d i s t γ m η 1 τ d i s 50 v i 1 n s i ρ e s i g n e i k f z i m η 1 τ d i s i τ d i s i t τ d i s t γ m η 1 τ d i s where 51 ρ e i 1 n 1 β i p q e i p q 1 since 1 p q 2 there are two possible situations e i p q 1 0 for e i 0 and e i p q 1 0 for e i 0 when s i 0 and e i 0 we have ρ e 0 the k f z i is designed based on reaching condition of tsm such that 52 k f z i τ d i s i therefore the first part of v in 50 is negative definite also the second part of v is negative definite since the disturbance gain γ is constant spd matrix moreover the derivative of the estimation error dynamics stated in 45 and hence estimation error converges to zero in finite time due to fact that its dynamics involves terminal sliding surface therefore the lyapunov function v fulfills a differential inequality of the type 53 v t γ v t α where γ 0 and α 0 1 hence according to lyapunov stability criteria the non singular nonlinear sliding surface in 24 converges to zero in finite time as stated in 28 in addition it is to be noted that the proposed controller in 37 does not contain any negative fractional power since 1 p q 2 and γ p q therefore it gives singularity free control then it can be concluded that the existence of tsm is guaranteed and tracking errors reach to tsm s 0 from any initial condition in finite time this completes the proof 5 performance analysis to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme simulation studies on an experimental auv have been done the details of the experimental vehicle are given in santhakumar and asokan 2013 asokan and santhakumar 2007 londhe et al 2017d the effectiveness of the proposed control approach has been evaluated under the effect of constant ocean current selected as τ e d i s 0 2 n 0 3 n 0 1 n 0 nm 0 nm 0 nm t as well as time varying ocean

parameters of an auv are considered to test the practical applicability of the proposed controller sensor measurement noise in the η vector is considered here the gaussian random noises of 0 01 m mean and 0 01 standard deviation in the position and 0 2 degree standard deviation in the orientation measurement is considered the auv initial position is η 0 1 6 m 1 m 1 m 0 r a d 0 r a d 0 r a d the inverse of the jacobian matrix in the control law can be obtained analytically to avoid the extra computational burden on the on board computer to investigate the control performance of the proposed nfftsmc here a set of two different reference trajectories is considered as a case i and case ii and discussed in detail in the following subsections the comparison of the proposed controller is made with conventional smc csmc and ntsmc schemes the control laws for csmc and ntsmc are taken as 54 τ η m ˆ η η η d k 1 σ k 2 sat σ φ n ˆ η ν η η csmc 55 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e k s sat s φ n

selected for csmc k 1 4 3 i 6 k 2 2 6 i 2 ntsmc p 5 q 3 β 8 i 6 k s 15 i 6 and φ 0 009 i 6 and proposed nfftsmc p 5 q 3 γ 1 4 β 8 i 6 and α 5 4 i 6 5 1 case i the reference trajectory is generated by setting η d x d y d z d 0 r a d 20 π 180 r a d 20 π 180 r a d where x d y d and z d are the reference trajectories along x y and z axis respectively as illustrated in fig 5 to evaluate the control performance of all the controllers numerical simulation of closed loop system is done under three different conditions as given in table 1 fig 5 depicts position tracking performance given by csmc ntsmc and proposed nfftsmc schemes it can be seen that all the controllers succeeded in tracking the position and orientation of the vehicle in less than 3 s under ideal condition however under an uncertain condition with constant ocean current the csmc controller produces steady state errors in position and orientation tracking whereas the performance gets degraded in the presence of time varying ocean current as depicted in fig 6 as compared to csmc the ntsmc gives acceptable tracking control under an uncertain condition with constant ocean current but shows deviation in tracking errors with the maximum value of 0 15 m in position tracking and 0 005 m in orientation tracking control as indicated by fig 7 fig 8 a and b shows position and orientation tracking errors by the proposed nfftsmc control scheme from these results it can be observed that the proposed nfftsmc offers strong immunity to uncertainties in hydrodynamic coefficients measurement sensor noise and constant as well as a time varying ocean current the time history of the norm of control efforts during this trajectory tracking control can be observed in fig 9 the position tracking control performance given by all the controllers is evaluated in terms of performances indices such as root mean squares of error rms and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method over csmc and ntsmc methods table 2 5 2 case ii the potency of the proposed controller has been tested by considering circular spiral type reference trajectory as depicted in fig 10 a b and c respectively the corresponding tracking errors given by the csmc ntsmc and proposed nfftsmc schemes were noted in figs 11 13 respectively it is to be noted that all the controllers outperforms well in terms of smooth transient response and convergence of tracking errors to zero under ideal condition at the moment of 60 s when the uncertain condition with constant ocean current is acting on the auv the csmc is giving steady state errors in position tracking while shows the oscillatory response at t 120 onward when subject to time varying ocean current as indicated in fig 11 also it can be noted that the csmc controller is not be able to suppress the effect of ocean current effectively and shows oscillations in the roll angle in contrast to this for the same scenario the ntsmc provides satisfactory tacking performance as shown in fig 12 fig 13 a and b clearly depicts that nfftsmc will not only result in faster state convergence rate but also maintain robustness against lumped uncertainty in opposed to ntsmc and csmc this also demonstrate that nfftsmc acquire fast tracking error convergence speed when the system is in sliding mode during this tracking control the change in the norm of control efforts can be observed in fig 14 the effectiveness of proposed nfftsmc can be verify by performing quantitative analysis as depicted in table 3 the 3 dimensional pictorial view of an auv in tracking control under case ii is shown in fig 15 6 a case study task space control of an auvms the frame arrangement considered for an auvms is shown in fig 16 for purposes of clarity and ease the motion of an auvms in horizontal plane is derived by considering 3 dof horizontal plane auv model mounted with 2 dof manipulator system under this considerations auvms motion equation in earth fixed

joint torques of the corresponding manipulator links τ e d i s is the vector of external disturbances due to underwater current and or a paylaod sensor measurement noise etc the relation between task space and joint space coordinates are related as 57 μ f q where μ x t y t t is the vector of task space coordinates and f q is the vector representing the forward kinematics the derivative of 57 gives 58 μ j q q where j q is the jacobian matrix represents mapping between joint velocities to task space velocities using the 57 and 58 the auvms motion in task space coordinates is expressed as 59 m μ μ c μ μ d μ μ g μ f μ τ c t τ e d i s where m μ is the inertia matrix c μ is the coriolis and centripetal matrix d μ is the damping matrix g μ is the vector of restoring effects and f μ is the vector of dynamic coupling of the uvms in task space respectively τ c t is the vector of task space control inputs of the auvms τ e d i s is the vector of external disturbances in the task space the performance of the system is evaluated by performing extensive numerical simulations involving positioning and trajectory tracking of the end effector in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed nfftsmc the complex trajectory tracking control in task space is designed and numerical simulation results are obtained the control law is derived as explained in section 3 and is written as 60 τ μ m ˆ μ μ μ

axes is considered in the velocity vector the unknown external disturbances have been considered for the simulations as 8 n 6 n 0 6 n m 0 3 n m 0 2 n m t also the sensory noises as unknown internal disturbance vector is introduced in the position and orientation measurement the auvms model have only 80 of actual values i e 20 model parameter uncertainties are considered the task space position tracking performance given by all the controllers are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the time history of trajectories of the auvms in the task space positions and their corresponding errors in tracking positions under uncertain condition are shown in fig 17 from these results it is confirmed that the tracking performance given by nfftsmc followed by pid like fuzzy controller londhe et al 2017a is quite better than csmc fig the task space positions tracking of an auvms in the x y plane is shown in 18 this show that the csmc controller provides steady state error in the task space tracking control the position tracking performance of an auvms can be measured in terms of quantitative index such as l 2 norm and rms of task space errors as depicted in table 4 this table confirmed that the proposed nfftsmc and pid like fuzzy control scheme gives minimum tracking errors in x and y directions as compared to csmc and ntsmc 7 conclusion this paper presents a fast finite time non singular fuzzy tsmc has been designed for robust trajectory tracking control of an experimental underwater vehicle the efficacy of the proposed controller has been tested under a different set of reference trajectories and compared with csmc and ntsmc schemes comparing with the existing csmc and ntsmc approaches the proposed scheme has several significant advancements 1 a new fast finite time fuzzy

23378,in this paper a robust finite time trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle auv which belongs to the class of highly nonlinear coupled dynamics with motion in 6 degrees of freedom dof the finite time error convergence and robust control task is accomplished by designing a non singular fast fuzzy terminal sliding mode controller nfftsmc with disturbance estimator for the 6 dof dynamics of an auv the proposed nfftsmc incorporates a non singular fast terminal sliding mode controller nftsmc which not only assures faster and finite convergence of the tracking errors to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase portrait but also eliminates the issue of singularity dilemma appeared in conventional terminal sliding mode controller tsmc a fuzzy logic control flc tool is employed to generate the hitting control signal in order to reduce chattering in control inputs which commonly occur in conventional tsmc and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the un modeled dynamics external disturbances and time varying parameters furthermore to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method it has been extended to task space control problem of an auv manipulator system auvms employed for underwater manipulation tasks simulation studies confirms the potency of the proposed method keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv finite time control fuzzy logic control terminal sliding mode control lyapunov stability 1 introduction over the last few decades design and development of underwater vehicles for ocean research has gained a huge momentum due to advancement in underwater research the control system design is one of most active research area in the underwater technology for performing nontrivial underwater missions londhe et al 2017a 2017b to ensure operator safety and wide application range nowadays auvs are mostly preferred compared to remotely operated vehicles rovs for performing deep and hazardous environmental underwater tasks londhe et al 2017a 2017b jacobi 2015 to acquire the good quality of data from ocean resources the accurate position and attitude control of an underwater vehicle is immensely desirable in the existence of highly unstructured ocean environment kim et al 2016 londhe et al 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 this demands designing of a accurate trajectory tracking control for auv against the variations in the hydrodynamic coefficients and unknown forces acting on the vehicle due to ocean currents londhe et al 2017c ataei and yousefi koma 2015 over a period of time many researchers have been suggested numerous advanced auv control systems including sliding mode control smc robust and adaptive control fuzzy logic and neural network control which can accommodate the large perturbations in the auv dynamics under unstructured ocean environment nevertheless there is still scope to enhance the performance of the auv s motion when dealing with unstructured and time varying operating conditions over a few decades many control methods have been proposed to solve vehicle control issues and can be found in the literature the linear controllers like proportional integral derivative pid control were firstly suggested in jalving 1994 designed separately for steering diving and speed subsystems of the vehicle and subsequently decoupled proportional derivative pd set point controller was introduced in herman 2009 for auvs however these controls do not solve the problem of integral windup when actuator goes to saturation to handle this problem s miyamoto et al miyamaoto et al 2001 employed a single loop pid structure with an anti windup technique for maneuvering control of an auv as an extension to this a dual loop variable structure pid controller with the anti windup technique was adopted in kim et al 2013 for improved performance the authors in feng et al 2002 and roy et al 2013 proposes a h controller and robust controller respectively in order to deal with hydrodynamic parametric uncertainties and payload variations during path tracking of auvs sliding mode control smc technique is one of most efficient and robust control technique due to its invariance properties like robustness order reduction and disturbance rejection utkin 1977 young et al 1999 firstly the smc was designed for underwater vehicles by yoerger and slotine 1985 for robust trajectory tracking control first experimental results using adaptive smc were obtained by yoerger and slotine 1991 in 1991 and discusses their implementation issues furthermore successful design of decoupled control approaches were proposed by cristi et al 1990 using adaptive smc for auv in the diving plane and multivariable sliding mode autopilot design by healey and lienard 1993 for steering depth and speed control functions of an auv consequently motion control of an auv in steering and diving plane was studied in rodrigues et al 1996 then in 1999 a discrete time quasi smc was suggested by p m lee et al for diving control of an experimental auv with paramter uncertainties and large sampling interval also to strengthen the performance of smc a higher order sliding mode control was designed torpedo auv for diving control salgado jimenez and jouvencel 2003 the control and coordination of multiple auvs in horizontal plane have been extensively studied in liu and geng 2013 by applying finite time optimal formation control method however most of the aforementioned controllers require a full or partial information about hydrodynamic coeeficients and disturbances for the accurate design of control scheme additionally the smc based control design suffers from the chattering phenomenon this problem can be overcome by approximating discontinuous term s g n by continouos function like hyperbolic tangent function etc elmokadem et al 2015 also chattering can be reduces by increasing the order of the sliding surface has been successfully examined in joe et al 2014 furthermore chattering can be significantly removed by time delay controller suggested in kim et al 2016 kumar et al 2007 and have been successfully applied to tracking control of an auv an alternative way to tackle these issue is to use intelligent control approaches like fuzzy logic and neural network control and have been widely applied in control of robotic systems chen et al 2016 he et al 2016 these intelligent control methods have been successfully applied to the control of underwater vehicles venugopal et al 1992 jagannathan and galan 2003 ranganathan et al 2001 smith et al 1994 song and smith 2001 but investigating the stability and robustness of these intelligent control methods is found very rigorous and difficult to check patre et al 2015 recently the fusion of soft computing methodologies like fuzzy logic control flc with sliding mode control becoming a most promising control technique since it gives guaranteed stability and strong robustness against parameter variations patre et al 2015 kaynak et al 2001 on the other hand this fusion attempt to alleviate the implementation issues of the smc caused due to discontinuous term in the control law of smc known as chattering kaynak et al 2001 this fusion is commonly termed as a fuzzy sliding mode control fsmc in the literature the main strengths of the fsmc are shahraz and boozarjomehry 2009 1 it does not demand full knowledge about the system model because of the qualitative interpretation offered by fuzzy inference system 2 the fuzzy control rules can be easily created by using sliding mode concepts which guarantees the stability and robustness of the system therefore fsmc has been widely applied to the control of underwater vehicles in recent years initially song and smith 2000 proposed a sliding mode fuzzy controllers for heading and pitch control of an auv in order to obtain time optimal control performance f c chiu et al 2000 and j guo et al 2003 has applied sliding mode fuzzy controller to the guidance and control by line of sight guidance mechanism in the horizontal plane also the control law was validated using a number of tank tests and sea trials an adaptive fsmc for control of an auv in vertical plane has been proposed in balasuriya and cong 2003 which can proximate the un modeled auv dynamics and gives robust control performance the decoupled expanded adaptive fsmc has been designed by using the fuzzy basis function expansions for underwater flight vehicle ufv depth control problem kim and shin 2007 wallace m bessa et al 2008 2010 has been perfectly employed an adaptive fsmc to the effective positioning of rov which enhanced the tracking performance by compensating the effect of uncertainty disturbances recently a fsmc with adaptive disturbance approximation xin and zaojian 2010 and enhanced dynamic fsmc lakhekar et al 2015 for diving control plane of an auv has been designed however aforementioned control methods suffers from following disadvantages 1 most of the above mentioned controllers uses decoupled control approaches by neglecting cross coupling terms however for performing interactive underwater tasks control of an auv in six dof is required with reasonable accuracy few attempts are made in kim et al 2016 antonelli 2007 antonelli et al 2003 gao et al 2016 karkoub et al 2017 kim et al 2015 shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 zhang et al 2010 2 tracking errors converges to the equilibrium point in infinite settling time 3 to obtain high precision in control and strong robustness property the knowledge about the upper bounds of norm of the lumped disturbance vector is required to be known in prior 4 moreover most of the controllers face the problems in selecting appropriate fuzzy control rules and membership functions while designing an flc for real time applications to address these problems this study proposes a disturbance estimator based nfftsmc designed for the complete nonlinear dynamical model of an auv for trajectory tracking control with motion in 6 dof venkataraman et al venkataraman and gulati 1993 and man et al zhihong et al 1994 firstly proposed the concept of terminal smc tsmc by adding a nonlinear term into linear sliding manifold to assure finite time state convergence londhe et al 2017d elmokadem et al 2017 however the conventional tsmc suffers from a singularity dilemma and the control amplitude may go to infinity whenever the error approaches to zero feng et al 2002 significant research has been made to evade the singularity issue by non singular tsmc ntsmc feng et al 2002 2013 chen and lin 2011 jin et al 2009 nevertheless ntsmc suffers from two major disadvantages 1 it exhibits a slower convergence rate when tracking errors are afar from the equilibrium point than the conventional smc and 2 high frequency chattering in control input due to the existence of a discontinuous function in the control term in this paper the first disadvantage is overcome by adding one more nonlinear term to the sliding surface of ntsmc termed as fast ntsmc furthermore chattering problem is eliminated by designing a fuzzy logic control to approximate the discontinuous control term in overall the major contribution of this study can be summaries as follows 1 the proposed nfftsmc is designed for a 6 dof nonlinear model of an auv for trajectory tracking control with motion in 6 dof without decoupling the auv dynamics 2 the proposed control ensures finite time states convergence with faster convergence rate to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase plane 3 the fuzzy control rules are derived based on the lyapunov energy function in order to eradicate the chattering problem usually occurred in ntsmc 4 finally a disturbance estimator is proposed to estimate the perturbations from the dynamics of a terminal sliding manifold to reimburse for hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties unmodeled dynamics unknown forces like an ocean current and measurement sensor noises and at every sampling instant the control input reimburse for the uncertainties that exist thus eliminates the need of information of the bounds of perturbation vector in prior 5 the overall closed loop stability and finite time convergence property are proved by lyapunov sense an extensive numerical simulation study on an experimental auv has been performed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed nfftsmc approach from the performance analysis of the suggested method it is confirmed that the proposed method is robust against not only with parameter uncertainties but also with the time varying ocean current as compared with csmc and ntsmc schemes in order to verify the validness of the proposed method it has been successfully extended to task space control problem of an auvms employed for underwater mission like pre defined trajectory tracking control tasks generally underwater mission involves nontrivial underwater tasks such as deep sea pipelines survey and tracking oceanographic mapping and surveillance etc santhakumar and kim 2011 shim et al 2010 when the manipulator is attached to an auv then controlling it becomes even more difficult because of increased non linearity strong coupling between manipulator and auv and resulting high dimensional nature of an auvms also due to attached manipulator arm auvms becomes a kinematically redundant structure requiring redundancy resolution schemes to handle the situation sarkar and podder 2001 shang and cong 2014a shang et al 2012 2013 task space based control could be most desirable in such situation since it does not require the inverse kinematics furthermore the task space control is more appropriate when the online modification in the task pace of the end effector is frequently required ismail 2011 shang and cong 2014b therefore task space control is designed by using proposed nfftsmc for pre defined complex trajectory tracking control of an auvms the validness of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system consisting of an auv and a two link rotary 2r serial planar manipulator this paper is structured as follows a brief introduction to auv dynamics is presented in section 2 section 3 detailed a design of proposed nfftsmc method in section 4 stability of the proposed method is proved by lyapunov sense simulation results of the proposed controller to an experimental auv is demonstrated in section 5 a case study showing task space control problem of an auvms is demonstrated in section 6 subsequently the concluding remark in section 7 2 auv dynamics the equations of motion for an auv can be described with respect to an inertial frame x e y e z e or body fixed reference frame x 0 y 0

and τ ℜ 6 represents control efforts including thrusters forces forces and moments causing stern rudder plane deflections by applying the velocity transformations stated in eq 1 to eq 4 assuming that j η is non singular matrix the equation of motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial frame is expressed as 5 m η η η c η ν η η d η ν η η g η η τ η where 6 m η η j t η m j 1 η c η ν η j t η c ν m

of an auv in 5 will give 7 m η η m η η η c η ν η c η ν η η d η ν η d η ν η η g η η g η η τ η τ e d i s now by collecting unknown part including parameter uncertainties un modeled dynamics and unknown external forces like ocean current into a single vector term as lumped uncertainty τ d i s then 7 can be written as 8 m ˆ η η η c ˆ η ν η η d ˆ η ν η η g ˆ η η τ η τ d i s where 9 τ d i s τ e d i s m

system is to make a auv position vector η perfectly follow η d then the position trajectory tracking error is written as 14 e η d η the terminal sliding surface tss for an 6 dof auv tracking system is choosen as feng et al 2002 15 s e βsi g p q e 0 where s s 1 s i s n t ℜ n is sliding surface β d i a g β 1 β i β n ℜ n n in which β i i 1 n is a positive constant si g p q e e 1 p q s i g n e 1 e i p

ζ i s i where ζ i i 1 n 0 under sufficient condition given by 16 suggest the following tsmc control law 17 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g q p 1 e e ksgn s n ˆ η ν η η which ensures that tsm occurs k d i a g k 11 k i i k n n is a positive definite and diagonal parameter matrix and k i i i 1 n 0 during reaching phase i e s i 0 then tracking error e i will reach the tss s i 0 in the finite time t r i i 1 n which satisfies 18 t r i s i 0 k i i now when once the tss s i 0 is reached the system dynamics of e i is govern by 19 e i β i e i p q s i g n e i soving equation 19 for the finite time t s i i 1 n from e i t r i 0 to e i t r i t s i 0 will give zhihong et al 1994 20 t s i 1 β i e i t r i 0 e i q p d e i p β i p q e i t r i 1 q p hence from 20 will give finite time convergence of both the tracking error e i and its derivative e i to zero it can be noted that the term containing si g q p 1 e e from 17 may cause singularity to occur if e 0 when e 0 due to negative power of e feng et al 2002 as a results 17 will give unbounded control forces and moments which may lead to instability of the auv tracking control system in order to deal with this singularity issue a ntsmc has been investigated by many researchers feng et al 2002 2013 chen and lin 2011 jin et al 2009 3 2 ntsmc now to overcome the issue of singularity a non singular tss for system 10 is choosen as feng et al 2002 chen and lin 2011 21 s e 1 β si g p q e 0 where β p and q are defined in 15 and si g p q e e 1 p q s i g n e 1 e i p q s i g n e i e n p q s i g n e n t ℜ n when tsm occurs i e s 0 then the dynamics in 10 is governed by 22 e i β i q p e i q p s i g n e i it could be noted that when s i 0 the non singular tss 21 is equivalent to the nonlinear tss 15 also from 19 and 22 it can be noted that the tracking errors given by tsmc and ntsmc will reach to equilibrium point e i 0 at the same amount of finite time t s i given in 20 using sufficient condition in 16 and non singular tss defined in 21 the ntsmc control input forces moments will take the form as 23 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e ksgn s n ˆ η ν η η where si g 2 p q e e 1 2 p q s i g n e 1 e i 2 p q s i g n e i e n 2 p q s i g n e n t ℜ n however when the tracking errors are long away from the equilibrium of the phase plane the ntsmc exhibits slower convergence rate yang and yang 2010 xu et al 2015 in order to further boost the dynamic response of an ntsmc a nftsmc has been suggested in recent times and can be found in yang and yang 2010 hou et al 2014 komurcugil 2011 li et al 2014 shuo 2015 van et al 2016 3 3 nftsmc a non singular fast tss for system 10 can be defined by adding one more nonlinear term to the sliding manifold of ntsmc in 21 as 24 s e 1 α si g γ e 1 β si g p q e 0 where s ℜ n β ℜ n n are as defined in 15 α d i a g α 1 α i α n ℜ n n in which α i i 1 n 0 si g γ e e 1 γ s i g n e 1 e i γ s i g n e i e n γ s i g n e n t ℜ n and p and q are positive odd integers satisfying the relation 25 1 p q 2 and γ p q with the tss defined in 24 and according to sufficient condition for the existence of tsm a nftsmc can be designed as τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e 26 β q p si g 2 p q e ksgn s remark 1 when the tsm is achieved i e s i 0 the system dynamics is determined by 27 e i 1 α i e i γ s i g n e i 1 β i e i p q s i g n e i 0 where e i 0 is called as terminal attractor of the system the time taken to travel from e i t r i 0 to e i t r i t s i 0 is finite and given by xu et al 2012 28 t s i 1 β i q p e i t r i 0 1 τ 1 α i τ γ q p d τ from the proposed nftsmc control law in 26 it can be conclude that even though the proposed nftsmc exhibits a fast convergence property but it suffers from following two issues 1 the chattering problem caused by the constant value k and a discontinuous function sgn s which could excite un modeled high frequency dynamics of the system 2 a priori information about the upper bounds of the lumped uncertainty term τ d i s is required to obtain robust control performance one way to annihilate the chattering is to change s g n s by a saturation function s a t s φ where φ is the boundary layer introduced around the sliding surface s 0 which is given as 29 sat s φ i s i s i if s i φ i s i φ i if s i φ i where φ i is the boundary layer thickness however this solution may add steady state error into the sliding manifold slotine and li 1991 as a result the compromising situation between performance and chattering may occurred in this study chattering problem is eliminated by employing a fuzzy logic tool to model the sgn s function similarly for improved robustness an disturbance estimator is proposed for online estimation of lumped uncertainty term and then to use the estimate in the nonlinear controller to cancel the effects of the disturbance following subsections describes these methods in details 3 4 nfftsmc to diminish the chattering problem occurred in nftsmc the flc is designed based on the reaching condition of the tsmc this flc is a single input single output siso system with sliding surface s i as a input variable and a crisp control value k f z i after defuzzification as a output variable the main advantages of this flc is that the number of rules required is reduced from p 2 to p as compare to conventional two input flc with p 2 number of rules where p indicates number of fuzzification level the flc is designed by fuzzifying the crisp sliding surface defined in 24 on the universe of discourse of s i whose fuzzy sets are defined by triangular and trapezoidal membership functions the singleton membership functions are used to define the output value k f z i whose fuzzy sets are defined in the universe of discourse k the linguistic variables used for sliding surface s i are n b n s z e p s and p b where n negative p positive s small b big and z e zero and for output variable k f z i are s m a l l e r s m a l l z e r o b i g and b i g g e r fig 2 shows input output membership functions for s i and k f z i therefore under flc design the control input in 26 τ η can be modified by replacing the control gain ksgn s with a fuzzy gain k f z hence the new control input is written as τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e 30 β q p si g 2 p q e k f z n ˆ η ν η η where k f z k f z 1 k f z i k f z n t and the value of k f z i is generated by the siso flc system the value of k f z i has to be estimated by the flc in a such way that it gives reduced chattering with guaranteed stability of the overall closed loop system in order to derive the fuzzy control rules for estimating the value of a fuzzy gain k f z i the following lyapnunov candidate is considered as 31 v 1 2 s t m η s the lyapnunov candidate v in 31 indicates the energy of the sliding surface s therefore the value of fuzzy gain k f z i can be chosen in a such way that the derivative of lyapnunov candidate v in 31 is negative definite which in turn results in minimum energy of s differentiating v from 31 we have 32 v 1 2 s t m η s s t m η s s t m η s since s t m η s s t m η s and m η 2 c η property 2 2 32 can be written as 33 v s t m η s c η s the derivative of 24 will leads to 34 s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e k f z m η 1 τ d i s using 34 into 33 we have 35 v s t 1 β p q si g p q 1 e m η k f z τ d i s s t c η s v i 1 n s i 1 β i p q e i p q 1 s i g n e i m η k f z i τ d i s i s t c η s in order to maintain negative definiteness of 35 the fuzzy rules can be constructed as f 1 if s i is n b then k f z i is s m a l l e r f 2 if s i is n s then k f z i is s m a l l f 3 if s i is z e then k f z i is z e r o f 4 if s i is p s then k f z i is b i g f 5 if s i is p b then k f z i is b i g g e r the above analysis indicate that the each fuzzy rule has to connect the input sliding manifold to the output control value based on the distance of the state to the sliding surface s 0 the fuzzy inference engine performs the mapping from fuzzy input subsets s i to fuzzy output fuzzy sets k f z i based upon the rule base and compositional rule of inference the crisp output value of k f z i is extracted from fuzzy output by the center average defuzzifier 36 k f z i n 1 n θ i n μ f i n s i n 1 n μ f i n s i θ i t ξ i s i where n indicates number of rules and θ i t θ i 1 θ i n θ i n is the consequent part of the fuzzy rules ξ i s i ξ i 1 s i ξ i n s i ξ i n s i t and ξ i n s i μ f i n s i n 1 n μ f i n s i is the weight of singleton fuzzy subset and ξ i s i weight vector of each singleton fuzzy subsets the difference between nftsmc with boundary layer and flc is that the control gain value estimated by flc varies along with the sliding manifold all the time as shown in fig 3 3 5 disturbance estimator based nfftsmc in this section the dynamic disturbance estimation approach is proposed to estimate the unknown perturbations from the dynamics of the non singular fast terminal sliding surface this can be accomplished by treating the effects of the system uncertainties nonlinearities unmodeled dynamics cross coupling effects and external disturbances like an ocean current as a total or composite disturbance termed as lumped uncertainty acting on the auv system and then estimate this unknown quantity by disturbance estimation approach finally its effect on the auv can be canceled out by augmenting it in the nonlinear nfftsmc law given by 30 therefore the modified controller is given as 37 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e 1 α γ si g γ 1 e β q p si g 2 p q e k f z τ ˆ d i s n ˆ η ν η η fig 4 explains the basic idea of a typical disturbance estimator the output of the disturbance estimator can be used in feed forward compensation of disturbances and this will avoid the use of high feedback gains to have excellent tracking performance and smooth control actions few assumptions are made to prove the overall stability of whole system assumption 1 the value of the lumped disturbance is arbitrarily large and slowly varying with time i e τ d i s 0 kelly et al 2005 yatoh et al 2008 sabanovic and ohnishi 2011 antonelli 2014 mohan and kim 2015 assumption 2 the disturbance estimator gain namely γ is constant symmetric positive definite spd matrix i e 38 γ γ t 0 the proposed disturbance estimator is given as 39 τ ˆ d i s ϒ γ η 40 ϒ γ m ˆ η 1 τ η ϒ γ η n ˆ η ν η η s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e where τ ˆ d i s is the vector of estimated lumped uncertainty term ϒ is an auxiliary vector to estimate the unknown perturbations from the dynamics of tsm manifold let us express the estimation error as 41 τ d i s τ d i s τ ˆ d i s now τ ˆ d i s is to be modify in a such way that the estimation error τ d i s goes to zero within a finite amount of time differentiating 39 42 τ ˆ d i s ϒ γ η using 40 and 10 we have 43 τ ˆ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e rearranging 43 gives 44 τ d i s τ ˆ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e τ d i s τ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e τ d i s the assumption 3 1 holds true if 45 τ d i s γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e 4 stability analysis the convergence property of the proposed control method has been proved in this section with following assumptions assumption 3 the lumped disturbance term τ d i s is bounded and there exits a constant d m a x 0 such that 0 τ d i s d m a x but value of upper of bound of d m a x is not required to be known assumption 4 the measurement of states η and η are available for feedback assumption 5 η d η d and η d are available with known bounds theorem 4 1 for the uncertain nonlinear system defined in 10 if the tsm is chosen as 24 and control law in 37 then all the tracking error signals are bounded and converges to equilibrium point in finite time proof select the following lyapnunov function candidate 46 v 1 2 s t s 1 2 τ d i s t τ d i s taking derivative of 46 results into 47 v s t s τ d i s t τ d i s now from 34 and 45 we have v s t 1 β p q si g p q 1 e k f z m η 1 τ d i s 48 τ d i s t γ m ˆ η 1 τ d i s s 1 β p q si g p q 1 e simplification of 48 leads to 49 v i 1 n s i 1 β i p q e i p q 1 s i g n e i k f z i m η 1 τ d i s i τ d i s i t τ d i s t γ m η 1 τ d i s 50 v i 1 n s i ρ e s i g n e i k f z i m η 1 τ d i s i τ d i s i t τ d i s t γ m η 1 τ d i s where 51 ρ e i 1 n 1 β i p q e i p q 1 since 1 p q 2 there are two possible situations e i p q 1 0 for e i 0 and e i p q 1 0 for e i 0 when s i 0 and e i 0 we have ρ e 0 the k f z i is designed based on reaching condition of tsm such that 52 k f z i τ d i s i therefore the first part of v in 50 is negative definite also the second part of v is negative definite since the disturbance gain γ is constant spd matrix moreover the derivative of the estimation error dynamics stated in 45 and hence estimation error converges to zero in finite time due to fact that its dynamics involves terminal sliding surface therefore the lyapunov function v fulfills a differential inequality of the type 53 v t γ v t α where γ 0 and α 0 1 hence according to lyapunov stability criteria the non singular nonlinear sliding surface in 24 converges to zero in finite time as stated in 28 in addition it is to be noted that the proposed controller in 37 does not contain any negative fractional power since 1 p q 2 and γ p q therefore it gives singularity free control then it can be concluded that the existence of tsm is guaranteed and tracking errors reach to tsm s 0 from any initial condition in finite time this completes the proof 5 performance analysis to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme simulation studies on an experimental auv have been done the details of the experimental vehicle are given in santhakumar and asokan 2013 asokan and santhakumar 2007 londhe et al 2017d the effectiveness of the proposed control approach has been evaluated under the effect of constant ocean current selected as τ e d i s 0 2 n 0 3 n 0 1 n 0 nm 0 nm 0 nm t as well as time varying ocean current as τ e d i s 0 6 s i n 0 2 t n 0 5 s i n 0 2 t n 0 7 s i n 0 2 t n 0 nm 0 nm 0 nm t an external disturbance force acting on the vehicle in addition to this 20 uncertainties in the model parameters of an auv are considered to test the practical applicability of the proposed controller sensor measurement noise in the η vector is considered here the gaussian random noises of 0 01 m mean and 0 01 standard deviation in the position and 0 2 degree standard deviation in the orientation measurement is considered the auv initial position is η 0 1 6 m 1 m 1 m 0 r a d 0 r a d 0 r a d the inverse of the jacobian matrix in the control law can be obtained analytically to avoid the extra computational burden on the on board computer to investigate the control performance of the proposed nfftsmc here a set of two different reference trajectories is considered as a case i and case ii and discussed in detail in the following subsections the comparison of the proposed controller is made with conventional smc csmc and ntsmc schemes the control laws for csmc and ntsmc are taken as 54 τ η m ˆ η η η d k 1 σ k 2 sat σ φ n ˆ η ν η η csmc 55 τ η m ˆ η η η d β q p si g 2 p q e k s sat s φ n ˆ η ν η η ntsmc where k 1 k 2 and k s are constant spd matrices σ e λe is the sliding manifold of the csmc and λ d i a g λ 1 λ i λ n in which λ i 0 the nominal controller parameter settings are selected for csmc k 1 4 3 i 6 k 2 2 6 i 2 ntsmc p 5 q 3 β 8 i 6 k s 15 i 6 and φ 0 009 i 6 and proposed nfftsmc p 5 q 3 γ 1 4 β 8 i 6 and α 5 4 i 6 5 1 case i the reference trajectory is generated by setting η d x d y d z d 0 r a d 20 π 180 r a d 20 π 180 r a d where x d y d and z d are the reference trajectories along x y and z axis respectively as illustrated in fig 5 to evaluate the control performance of all the controllers numerical simulation of closed loop system is done under three different conditions as given in table 1 fig 5 depicts position tracking performance given by csmc ntsmc and proposed nfftsmc schemes it can be seen that all the controllers succeeded in tracking the position and orientation of the vehicle in less than 3 s under ideal condition however under an uncertain condition with constant ocean current the csmc controller produces steady state errors in position and orientation tracking whereas the performance gets degraded in the presence of time varying ocean current as depicted in fig 6 as compared to csmc the ntsmc gives acceptable tracking control under an uncertain condition with constant ocean current but shows deviation in tracking errors with the maximum value of 0 15 m in position tracking and 0 005 m in orientation tracking control as indicated by fig 7 fig 8 a and b shows position and orientation tracking errors by the proposed nfftsmc control scheme from these results it can be observed that the proposed nfftsmc offers strong immunity to uncertainties in hydrodynamic coefficients measurement sensor noise and constant as well as a time varying ocean current the time history of the norm of control efforts during this trajectory tracking control can be observed in fig 9 the position tracking control performance given by all the controllers is evaluated in terms of performances indices such as root mean squares of error rms and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method over csmc and ntsmc methods table 2 5 2 case ii the potency of the proposed controller has been tested by considering circular spiral type reference trajectory as depicted in fig 10 a b and c respectively the corresponding tracking errors given by the csmc ntsmc and proposed nfftsmc schemes were noted in figs 11 13 respectively it is to be noted that all the controllers outperforms well in terms of smooth transient response and convergence of tracking errors to zero under ideal condition at the moment of 60 s when the uncertain condition with constant ocean current is acting on the auv the csmc is giving steady state errors in position tracking while shows the oscillatory response at t 120 onward when subject to time varying ocean current as indicated in fig 11 also it can be noted that the csmc controller is not be able to suppress the effect of ocean current effectively and shows oscillations in the roll angle in contrast to this for the same scenario the ntsmc provides satisfactory tacking performance as shown in fig 12 fig 13 a and b clearly depicts that nfftsmc will not only result in faster state convergence rate but also maintain robustness against lumped uncertainty in opposed to ntsmc and csmc this also demonstrate that nfftsmc acquire fast tracking error convergence speed when the system is in sliding mode during this tracking control the change in the norm of control efforts can be observed in fig 14 the effectiveness of proposed nfftsmc can be verify by performing quantitative analysis as depicted in table 3 the 3 dimensional pictorial view of an auv in tracking control under case ii is shown in fig 15 6 a case study task space control of an auvms the frame arrangement considered for an auvms is shown in fig 16 for purposes of clarity and ease the motion of an auvms in horizontal plane is derived by considering 3 dof horizontal plane auv model mounted with 2 dof manipulator system under this considerations auvms motion equation in earth fixed

joint torques of the corresponding manipulator links τ e d i s is the vector of external disturbances due to underwater current and or a paylaod sensor measurement noise etc the relation between task space and joint space coordinates are related as 57 μ f q where μ x t y t t is the vector of task space coordinates and f q is the vector representing the forward kinematics the derivative of 57 gives 58 μ j q q where j q is the jacobian matrix represents mapping between joint velocities to task space velocities using the 57 and 58 the auvms motion in task space coordinates is expressed as 59 m μ μ c μ μ d μ μ g μ f μ τ c t τ e d i s where m μ is the inertia matrix c μ is the coriolis and centripetal matrix d μ is the damping matrix g μ is the vector of restoring effects and f μ is the vector of dynamic coupling of the uvms in task space respectively τ c t is the vector of task space control inputs of the auvms τ e d i s is the vector of external disturbances in the task space the performance of the system is evaluated by performing extensive numerical simulations involving positioning and trajectory tracking of the end effector in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed nfftsmc the complex trajectory tracking control in task space is designed and numerical simulation results are obtained the control law is derived as explained in section 3 and is written as 60 τ μ m ˆ μ μ μ

disturbance vector is introduced in the position and orientation measurement the auvms model have only 80 of actual values i e 20 model parameter uncertainties are considered the task space position tracking performance given by all the controllers are depicted in figs 17 and 18 the time history of trajectories of the auvms in the task space positions and their corresponding errors in tracking positions under uncertain condition are shown in fig 17 from these results it is confirmed that the tracking performance given by nfftsmc followed by pid like fuzzy controller londhe et al 2017a is quite better than csmc fig the task space positions tracking of an auvms in the x y plane is shown in 18 this show that the csmc controller provides steady state error in the task space tracking control the position tracking performance of an auvms can be measured in terms of quantitative index such as l 2 norm and rms of task space errors as depicted in table 4 this table confirmed that the proposed nfftsmc and pid like fuzzy control scheme gives minimum tracking errors in x and y directions as compared to csmc and ntsmc 7 conclusion this paper presents a fast finite time non singular fuzzy tsmc has been designed for robust trajectory tracking control of an experimental underwater vehicle the efficacy of the proposed controller has been tested under a different set of reference trajectories and compared with csmc and ntsmc schemes comparing with the existing csmc and ntsmc approaches the proposed scheme has several significant advancements 1 a new fast finite time fuzzy ntsmc is proposed based on disturbance estimator and flc design 2 overcomes the problem of chattering by designing fuzzy control rules which are derived based on the lyapunov energy function 3 a disturbance estimator is proposed which enhances the stability of the whole system 4 the suggested scheme offers some superior properties like higher precision fast finite time convergence singularity

23379,this paper presents an experimental study on the hydrodynamic performance of seawalls in terms of wave reflection coefficient kr relative wave run up rup hi and relative wave run down rdown hi various experiments were carried out under monochromatic waves to test five non traditional seawall setups plane wall pw rectangular serrated wall rsw triangular serrated wall tsw slotted wall slw and triangular serrated slotted wall tslw a thin parallel solid wall with a water chamber width d was used on the leeward side of slw and tslw in order to preclude the wave transmission rsw was found hydrodynamically superior as compared with tsw the blocks spacing of rsw and tsw were hydrodynamically optimized at a value of 2 5 times the width of the block nevertheless the hydrodynamic behaviour of both slw and tslw was optimal when the slots ratio was about 0 33 whilst the chamber width was about 0 25 of the incident wavelength new empirical formulas were developed for understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the proposed seawalls using nonlinear regression analysis these formulas were calibrated using spss based on the experimental results the formulas were used to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of both rsw and tslw for el tinah plain bay in the north east coast of egypt keywords empirical formulas serrated seawalls slotted seawalls spss wave hydrodynamics 1 introduction seawalls have been extensively used for protecting the coastal shoreline to mitigate wave induced erosion however the classical coastal structures are damaged by extreme wave actions generated by storms or coastal flooding results from a complex set of tides surges and rivers inflows olbert et al 2017 such waves can cause displacement overturning soil liquefaction and progressive damage to structural components or foundation failures an optimal design of seawalls requires detailed information on various hydrodynamic parameters including wave run up wave run down wave overtopping and wave reflection characteristics various experimental numerical and theoretical studies have been performed to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of vertical as well as sloped seawalls via developing different computational formulas the contribution of hudson 1959 hunt jr 1959 chue and shah 1981 ahrens and titus 1985 van der meer and breteler 1990 ahrens et al 1993 schuttrumpf et al 1995 and van der meer 1995 are among the earlier investigations of wave run up and run down they combined several standard prediction formulas with their measurements for smooth sloping and rough seawalls to produce equations of wider applicability for the relative wave run up and run down based mainly on the surf similarity parameter ξ according to the wave structure regimes in addition ahrens et al 1993 investigated a formula for evaluating the non breaking wave reflection on the smoothed surfaces posteriorly numerical investigations were carried out by mallayachari and sundar 1994 and isaacson et al 2000 to obtain the wave reflection characteristics for perforated seawalls but no design formulas were given based on the linear wave theory and the eigenfunction expansion method the interaction between waves and a slotted seawall was studied analytically as well as experimentally by zhu and chwang 2001 the analytical investigations showed that the reflection characteristics of a slotted seawall mainly depend on the porosity of the slotted plate and the incident wave height hughes 2005 devised a valid formula for breaking and non breaking incident wave conditions to estimate the influence of rough impermeable slopes on the wave run up identifying only slight differences between the run up between waves that broke on the slope and non breaking waves neelamani and sandhya 2003 and 2005 presented predictive equations based on experimental investigations of wave reflection run up run down and wave pressures on the plane dentated and serrated seawalls the results showed that the obtained formulas can be worthily used for a better hydrodynamic design of vertical and sloped structures while without developing formulas the performance of an offshore submerged breakwater in reducing the wave forces and wave run up on a vertical wall was investigated numerically and experimentally by reddy et al 2007 as well a simple formula was developed by zanuttigh and van der meer 2008 that related the reflection coefficient to the breaker parameter and seemed to fit various types of coastal structures in design conditions such as smooth rock and armour unit slopes empirical equations used for estimating the wave run up reflection and transmission coefficients for a porous seawall with and without the sub merged breakwater were developed by koraim et al 2014 the results of these equations were compared with experimental and theoretical results obtained by different authors and provided a reasonable agreement a steep wave impact on seawalls of various geometries was examined by aida et al 2015 using a simple analytical model for the pressure impulse due to a wave of idealized geometry and dynamics elbisy 2015 quantified the regular wave run up on smooth slopes of perforated coastal structures constructed on sloping beaches using multiple additive regression trees mart and multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp methods the results indicated that the mart method s prediction accuracy and avoidance of over fitting were superior to those of the mlp method an analytical solution for wave interaction with a partially reflecting vertical wall protected by a submerged porous bar based on linear potential theory was given by yang et al 2016 they found that this solution may be used to determine the optimum parameters of structures at a preliminary engineering design stage negm and nassar 2016 determined new formulas of wave reflection estimation for smoothed roughed and perforated sloped seawalls via experimental modelling using non linear regression analysis the results of the obtained formulas were predominately compatible with previous studies but were extremely limited to application it was ultimately noticed from this comprehensive literature that more formulas for estimating wave reflection wave run up and wave run down on seawalls are urgently required to study the impact of different shapes of serrations as well as slots combined with serrations therefore seawalls of various slopes with energy dissipaters in the form of rectangular or triangular serrated blocks and horizontally slotted seawalls with or without triangular serrations accompanied by a leeward thin solid wall at a certain distance were extensively investigated as quasi bottom based structures in this study in spite of the bottom based structures may be initially more expensive than the floating ones when using them in depths greater than 6 1 m bruce 1985 but over the long term period it would be stable and do not need disbursing much money for cyclical maintenances as the case in surface piercing structures furthermore in prototype our novel designs rely mainly on using of pile supported superfine sheets which spontaneously extended to be touched with seabed supported by mounted footing from both leeward and seaward sides to avoid toe scouring these designs never require much heavy materials as the case in the fully bottom based traditional types on the other side a steeply sloped seawall with energy dissipaters or horizontal slots distributed on its surface is expected to hydrodynamically replace the mildly sloped seawall from dissipating the incident wave energy and hence expected to reduce the wave reflection wave load on the seawall wave run up run down and toe scour the main objective of this study is to devise new empirical formulas that would benefit in understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the proposed non traditional coastal structures that will gain a particular importance in developing sustainable coastal management strategies and widely recognized as economically effective over the long term eco friendly and multifunctional coastal structures several specific objectives of the paper include 1 introducing non conventional types of energy dissipating seawalls 2 overcoming the drawbacks of the classical types of seawalls 3 evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the simulated physical models experimentally and 4 developing new empirical formulas of wider applicability to estimate the wave hydrodynamic parameters using nonlinear regression analysis by spss software levesque 2006 2 dimensional analysis relationships of wave reflection kr wave run up rup and wave run down rdown in terms of hydraulic and geometrical characteristics of the studied models were developed by the buckingham pi theorem moreover a functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables could be obtained it was assumed that the dependent variables reflected wave height hr the maximum wave run up rup and the maximum wave run down rdown are a function of independent governing variables which are listed in table 1 the variables could be written in the non dimensional form of the following functions 2 f 1 π 1 π 2 π 3 π 4 π 5 π 6 π 7 π 8 π 9 π 10 π 11 0 0 using pi theorem properties a mathematical reprocessing was

seawalls was checked in response to non dimensional seawall and wave parameters the definitions and ranges of these non dimensional parameters were consigned in table 2 3 physical modeling a series of experiments i e 612 runs were conducted to determine the hydrodynamic parameters using the proposed physical models presented in section 3 3 at different wave and structural parameters 3 1 model scale the physical model of seawall structures was introduced to experimentally simulate the prototype of such structures to ensure that the physical model experiments are valid the physical similarity should be maintained between the model and the prototype chakrabarti 1999 by the principle of physical similarity the design of physical models depends mainly on laboratory and the prototype conditions in coastal engineering studies the froude criterion was adopted for most physical models which requires the froude number to be the same in the model as well as in the prototype zhu and chwang 2001 our interests in the present study were focused on the wave conditions in el tinah plain bay which is located on the north east coast of egypt i e spatial reference wgs 1984 utm zone number 36n as shown in fig 1 the egyptian government decided to set up coastal protection systems in vicinity of el mallaha lake coastline see fig 1 zone 1 due to its severe erosion over the elapsed time from 1989 the sky blue line to 2016 the red line the prototype water depth in coastal areas was approximately 4 0 m and the wave periods were found in a range of 2 12 4 14 s i e these data were collected from the site monitoring buoy north of port said at location 31 21 35n 32 21 00e the height of the wave flume is 100 cm by considering other conditions such as the available flume length and the wave periods which wave maker can generate a water depth d of 40 cm was selected and kept constant in the flume for all experimental tests the length scale is sl 4 0 4 10 the timescale based on the froude similitude was s t s l 3 16 thus regular wave trains with periods t from 0 669 to 1 308 s were selected for the testing wave conditions the wave height for the physical model tests in the present study was specified in the range from 6 50 to 11 1 cm from 65 to 111 cm in prototype dissipater blocks with a width of 5 0 cm and height of 4 0 cm were used the block dimensions corresponding to 4 0 m water depth will be 50 cm width and 40 cm height in the prototype table 3 3 2 test facility the flume in the present study was of 15 1 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m deep fig 2 a flap type wave generator was used to displace the water in the flume to get the desired monochromatic wave characteristics the wave generator was installed at one end of the flume two wave absorbers were used to prevent the reflection of waves at the other end of the flume to increase the efficiency of experiments decreasing the potential effect of multi reflection and to reduce the time required between runs while the water is calming down the first absorber was placed in the seaward side of the wave generator while the another absorber was installed at the leeward side of the flume with a slope of 3 1 as recommended by koraim and rageh 2013 the experiments were carried out at constant water depth d of 0 4 m the flap was controlled by an induction motor of 11 kw the motor was regulated by an inventor drive frequency capacity from 0 0 to 50 hz rotating in a speed range of 0 0 155 rpm regular waves with heights hi i e from 6 495 to 11 1 cm and periods t i e from 0 669 to 1 308s have been generated using this facility these ranges were used corresponding to motor frequency f changes from 2 5 hz to 5 2 hz 3 3 model details five different types of the seawalls were examined in the present study including pw rsw tsw slw and tslw fig 3 a a thin parallel solid back plate with a water chamber width d was used on the leeward side of both slw and tslw in order to preclude the wave transmission fig

power and feeding the nearby fish farms in el tinah plain bay in addition this wall type can largely fix the erosion situation in el tinah bay by allowing the long shore and cross shore sediment to be easily transported through the open sides chamber and the slots without any interruptions the tested models were placed in the middle of the wave flume perspex working section the models were fixed inside the wave flume rigidly for the required angle of inclination i e θ 45 60 75 and 90 using supports and wedges driven between the model and flume wall the models basically consist of a plane plate rectangular and triangular dissipater blocks the plate was made of hardwood 30 mm thick and coated with water insulation material i e acryl flex 200 blocks were made of wood of sizes 99 cm long 5 0 cm wide parallel to wall slope and 4 0 cm height perpendicular to wall slope they were fixed in a regular manner the leakage of water between the model and the flume wall has been sealed by using a filled material citosil 400 3 4 instrumentations 3 4 1 wave probes vertical linear probes in the form of movable diaphanous rulers with an accuracy of 1 0 mm were installed in the perspex section at different positions i e p1 p2 p3 and p4 as illustrated in fig 2 the vertical probes were selected to be in front of the seawall model seaward side to measure the hydrodynamic parameters of waves i e hi hr rup and rdown 3 4 2 wave generation process a static wave generation process was carried out daily at the inception of each set of experiments this process encompassed the wave characteristics measurement including hi li lo and t in the absence of seawall the daily variations were found to have a standard deviation of 0 1 3 4 3 data acquisition the free surface variations that resulted from the wave structure interaction were recorded using a sony mvc cd 500 digital still camera at various motor frequencies i e ranging from 2 5 hz to 5 2 hz the camera zoom was exactly adjusted perpendicular to the linear probe on the glass flume side at each recording positions the camera was fixed on a vertical stand avoiding the variations of the video shots the recording time for each test is approximately 4 5 the time required for a generated wave to travel from the generator to the model position i e 30 sec rageh and koraim 2010 using a precise slow motion technique e g adobe premiere the recorded waves taken by the camera were directly detected via a computer screen then time series of free surface elevation were plotted e g fig 6 this technique provided a high definition image every 1 50 s the methodology of detecting was appreciably validated by arc map software and satisfactorily tolerable errors have been acquired 3 4 4 wave height measurements the incident wave heights hi were measured during the flume calibration process using wave probe p3 in the absence of seawalls the values of the incident wave heights in the presence of seawalls were calculated according to the method described by dalrymple et al 1991 the calculated values were compared with those measured by wave probe p3 and plotted in fig 4 the results agreed quite closely with the value of normalized root mean square error nrmse 0 1557 maximum residual of 3 0 mm two wave probes p2 the quasi nodes and p1 the quasi antinodes were set in front of the model at distances 0 2 li and 0 45 li respectively from the seawall toe to separate the incident hi and reflected hr wave heights according to goda and suzuki 1976 dalrymple et al 1991 koraim and rageh 2013 and koraim et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 2 the incident wavelength li is variable according to the wave period t where it was calculated using the dispersion relationship according to the linear wave theory the free surface elevation η x for any location x can be estimated by the following equation dalrymple et al 1991 6 η x h i 2 2 h r 2 2 h i h r 2 2 cos 2 k x ε in which k is the wave number k 2π li and ε is the phase lag induced by the reflection process the η x obviously varies periodically with x and it becomes a maximum of the envelope at the phase positions 7 2 k x 1 ε 2 n π n 0 1 2 8 η x max h i h r 2 quasi antinodes whereas at the phase positions of 9 2 k x 2 ε 2 n 1 π n 0 1 2 it becomes a minimum of the envelope 10 η x min h i h r 2 quasi nodes the actual distance between the quasi nodes and the quasi antinodes the distance between the vertical probes p1 and p2 was obtained by subtracting eq 9 from eq 7 resulting in the following equation 11 x 2 x 1 π 2 k l i 4 typical envelopes of the partial standing wave induced by pw was measured and plotted in fig 5 at slope angles θ 90 75 60 and 45 li 144 7 cm hi 9 4 cm and t 0 994 s to verify the results obtained by dalrymple et al 1991 experimentally the maximum and minimum free surface elevations were measured at different spatial positions along the wave flume at 0 1 m intervals from x 0 15 m 1 95 m i e from seawall toe it was observed in the partial standing wave field that the nodes and the antinodes alternate spatially at x locations at almost equal increments of li 4 this was seen in fig 5 nodes x li 0 2 0 7 1 2 antinodes x li 0 45 0 95 similarly in fig 5 where li 1 447 m the antinodes occur approximately at x 0 65 m and 1 37 m and the nodes occur approximately at x 0 29 m 1 01 m and 1 74 m the wave energy was almost fully reflected in case of vertical pw i e θ 90 o while only a part of the wave energy is reflected from the sloped walls i e θ 75 o 60 o and 45 o because of the energy dissipated by breaking on the sloped faces so the spatial wave profile will be that of a partial standing wave system the envelope height at the antinodes in the partial standing wave system is the result of the incident wave height plus the partial reflected wave height hi hr whereas the envelope height at the nodal points is hi hr fig 5 shows that whenever the slope was milder i e θ decreases from 90 to 45 the envelope height at the nodal points increased while it decreased at the antinodal points this reflects the efficiency of the sloped walls in the dispersal of the wave energy due to the breaking of a large part of this energy when the slope becomes milder the calculated incident hi and reflected hr wave heights estimated from eq 8 and 10 are as follows 12 h i η max η min h max h min 2 13 h r 2 η r η max η min h max h min 2 where hmax 2 η x max max wave height at antinodes max crest level min through level at wave scale position p1 and hmin 2 η x min min wave height at nodes min crest level max trough level at wave scale position p2 the reflection coefficient kr is the ratio between reflected and incident wave heights therefore 14 k r h r h i 15 k r h max h min h max h min η x max η x min η x max η x min 3 4 5 wave run up and run down a set of vertical probes p4 have been fixed at the seaward side of the seawall to cover the run up and run down zones for different selected wall slopes fig 2 run up and run down could be observed as the maximum wave run up rup equals the maximum positive free surface elevation on the sloped face i e during wave up rushing minus the still water level swl while the maximum wave run down rdown equals the maximum negative free surface elevation on the sloped face i e during wave down rushing minus the still water level swl 3 4 6 optimal timing of experimental measurements fig 6 presents a sample of the analysed data using the wave probes p1 p2 p3 and p4 for determining the optimal time zone of measurements to avoid the noise effect which accompanying with the wave multi reflection using a case study of pw at θ 60 d 0 40 m and t 0 994 1 308 s fig 6a showed that through 0 7 s the wave travelled from the wave generator to p3 in case of no seawall some disturbance occurred in the shape of the wave for a few seconds then the wave seemed steadily stable for some time i e time 7 30 s which is the suitable period to measure the incident wave height after inauguration of the seawall in the physical model the reflected waves from the seawall started affecting the incident waves as shown in fig 6b and c which represent the positions of the antinode p1 and the node p2 respectively the partial standing wave began to build its shape after 14 s for both t 0 994 and 1 308 s and the wave devolved to be uniform through the time from 14 s to 30 s which is the period of the suitable zone to estimate η max and η min at p1 and p2 respectively fig 6d exhibits the resulted value of the reflected wave η r from eq 13 for pw at θ 90 a n d θ 60 in the case of θ 60 there were no recorded values for the reflected wave height from time 0 s up to 14 s for t 0 994 and 1 308 s after that the partial standing wave started that was unlike the vertical case the standing wave commenced after 7 s it was noticed that when the wall slope angle becomes milder the occurrence of the standing wave comes later this time lag occurs due to the excessive dissipation of the wave energy on the seawall slope due to wave breaking additionally the water particles go a longer distance before colliding with the barrier wall this feature can be used for a better design of the side revetments of navigation canals fig 6e shows the variations of free surface elevation with time at p4 for measuring the values of the run up and down the figure shows that a disturbance appeared in the shape of the wave for a few seconds from 0 s to 10 s after that the wave became dramatically stable for some time i e from 10 to 30 s which is the suitable period to measure the wave run up and down the figure clearly shows that the wave period almost does not affect the optimal period of time to undertake the measurements at all wave probes 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of wave investigations the effects of ξ wave periods in terms of d li and wave heights in terms of hi li on kr rup hi and rdown hi are not only essential to understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of the existing seawall for coastal regions but also undoubtedly help to assess the performance of the seawall under normal and extreme wave actions moreover the effects of s w g and θ on kr rup hi and rdown hi are required to select the appropriate configuration for seawalls 4 1 1 effect of surf similarity parameter ξ on kr rup hi and rdown hi the surf similarity parameter ξ or iribarren number relates the angle of the structure slope and the wave steepness where battjes 1974 defined ξ as 16 ξ tan θ h i l o fig 7 a b and c clearly illustrate the effect of the surf similarity parameter ξ on wave hydrodynamic parameters kr rup and rdown for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw at θ 45 θ 60 a n d θ 75 kr rup hi and rdown hi values increased at increasing ξ under different angles of inclination the values of ξ and hi lo are inversely proportional based on eq 16 this indicates that the energy dissipation was low as shown in fig 8 and this provided an augmentation in the hydrodynamic parameters over and above average trend lines on the basis of logarithmic functions were plotted for each angle i e θ 45 for 2 43 ξ 6 4 θ 60 for 6 4 ξ 13 4 and θ 75 for 13 4 ξ 23 9 to qualify the effectiveness of ξ on kr rup and rdown under different wall slopes the impact of ξ on the hydrodynamic parameters was found to be less effective when slopes increased from 45 to 75 because of the wave breaking on the sloped face this supports the work of twu and liu 1999 4 1 2 wave energy dissipation the data at θ 60 were selected to test the impact of wave steepness hi li on the wave energy dissipation for pw rsw s w 2 0 and tslw g 0 33 and d li 0 25 as presented in fig 8 the wave energy dissipation was estimated in terms of non dimensional parameter namely relative energy dissipation rl the value of rl can be evaluated as a function of the reflection coefficient through the energy equilibrium of an incident wave attacking the structure as follows 17 e i e r e l in which ei is the energy of the incident wave er is the energy of the reflected wave and el is the dissipated wave energy based on eq 17 the portion of the wave energy which dissipated at the structure can be estimated as a function of the reflection coefficient as given by reddy and neelamani 1992 18 e l e i 1 e r e i 19 r l 1 k r 2 the results in fig 8 show that there was a robust correlation between hi li and the rl rl substantially increased from 0 08 to 0 4 at increasing hi li from 0 029 to 0 159 at θ 60 for pw however rl increased from 0 58 to 0 83 and from 0 74 to 0 84 for rsw and tslw respectively these results give the precedence to both rsw and tslw in wave energy dispersion compared with pw this could be due to the excessive loss of wave energy that mainly results from wave breaking surface roughness return flow effect and disturbance of wave orbital paths for rsw yagci et al 2014 moreover the influence of jet interactions represented the most effective dissipation mode for tslw as discussed earlier by zhu and chwang 2001 see fig 11a and b sloped structures are good energy dissipaters when compared with vertical structures the amount of wave energy dissipation depends greatly on the slope provided if the slope of the seawall is milder then more waves break by surging plunging or spilling and this is beneficial from a force and water particle kinematics reduction but the milder the wall slopes the more expensive they are as sloped walls experience high run up and thus require higher crest elevation furthermore they also occupy more space and willimpede the social activities near coastal zones führböter 1994 fig 9 presents the effect of wall type on wave energy dissipation it was noticed through this figure that adding dissipater blocks or slots to the vertical wall led to squandering more wave energy than the sloped pw e g at θ 45 therefore using blocks or slots with vertical walls can overcome the drawbacks of sloped walls this clearly brings out the benefit of vertical walls compared with sloped walls for quay walls and berthing structures with vertical faces 4 1 3 effect of wave height on kr rup hi and rdown hi fig 10 describes the influence of wave height in terms of the wave steepness parameter hi li on kr rup hi and rdown hi for the pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 at slope angles 90 and 45 fig 10 shows that kr rup hi and rdown hi generally decreased for all wall types while hi li increased from 0 0297 to 0 1593 due to the excessive energy dissipation of the steeper waves as demonstrated in fig 8 fig 10a and b illustrate that the effects of hi li were relatively low for predicting the values of kr for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw when θ 90 in contrast they became more efficient and significant when the slope reduced to 45 because of the amalgamation between the dispersed energy of the steeper waves and breaking in the sloped surface moreover rsw was better in reducing kr than tsw and pw for both cases of vertical and sloped walls the rectangular blocks largely disturbed the orbital path of the wave particles and caused higher energy dissipation fig 11a furthermore the least reduction in kr with hi li was recorded for tslw when compared withthe other tested walls for both θ 90 and 45 due to the excessive energy dissipated by surface friction and the vena contracta effect when waves transmit through the gaps as the fluid passes the slots a jet is formed which expands and collides with jets from adjacent slots to create an eddy zone around the slotted plate as presented in fig 11b zhu and chwang 2001 on the other side fig 10c shows that the values of rup hi had almost the same effect for both vertical rsw and tsw when hi li 0 065 this clearly means that the rough shape did not have a significant effect on the run up when the wave became steeper adding triangular serrations to the slotted walls achieved a limited decrease in rup hi when hi li increased from 0 0297 to 0 1593 fig 13d shows that when the wall slope was reduced to 45 the wave run up became higher for all seawall types because of the impulsiveness of water particles on the sloped face from the wave breaking the wave steepness also became more effective in decreasing the wave run up for pw slw and tslw a conclusion could be drawn from fig 10c and d that tslw had the optimal reduction for run up values due to the energy dissipation by the combination effect of both surface roughness and eddies fig 10e and f illustrate that the values of rdown hi always decreased when hi li 0 0683 for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw when the slope mitigated from 90 to 45 unstable readings occurred when hi li 0 0683 in addition when the slope became milder rsw had the best performance in reducing the values of rdown hi compared with pw tsw slw and tslw because the rectangular blocks can retain a large portion of water mass during the wave down rushing 4 1 4 effect of wall slope on kr rup hi and rdown hi the effect of wall slope cot θ on kr rup hi and rdown hi was studied at two different wave periods i e d li from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 for pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 where the relative water depth d li was selected to represent the wave period neelamani and sandhya 2003 the d li ranged from 0 183 to 0 263 representing the wave period t from 1 308 s to 1 024 s and d li ranged from 0 495 to 0 574 representing the wave period t from 0 73 s to 0 669 s fig 12 a shows that when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 574 kr decreased with increasing cot θ from 0 0 to 1 0 for all wall types due to the wave breaking on the sloped surface by surging or plunging it was also observed in fig 12b that the wall slope was found to be more effective at predicting kr whenever the waves became shorter there was a significant reduction in kr for all wall types when the waves were shorter i e d li from 0 495 to 0 574 compared with the longer waves i e d li from 0 183 to 0 263 when the waves became shorter the wave steepness increased and hence more energy was dissipated fig 13a and b showed that rup hi increased with increasing cot θ from 0 0 to 1 0 for the five tested walls when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 this increase occurred due to the big disturbance sequenced by the wave breaking on the sloped faces waves breaking on a sloped face accelerates the water particles on the sloped body and causes a big wave to rush up it was also observed that the effect of wall slope reduced as the more waves became shorter moreover the effect of the wave period was found to be very significant in predicting the values of wave run up rup hi dramatically decreased when d li increased it was also noticed that rsw was better at reducing wave run up for longer waves while slw and tslw were superior in reducing wave run up when waves became shorter the surface friction became less efficacious when waves were shorter similarly fig 13c and d shows that the rdown hi decreased while cot θ increased from 0 0 to 1 0 for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw the resistance of water particle gravity in the perpendicular direction of the wall surface during wave down rushing was higher when the slope was milder it was also found that the rsw was better at reducing rdown hi compared with pw tsw slw and tslw when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 respectively the rectangular blocks could trap a significant amount of water mass during waves down rushing when the slope got milder as the wave released a big portion of its energy due to friction and breaking furthermore tsw slw and tslw had almost the same impact on wave run down for all wave periods 4 1 5 overall hydrodynamic performance evaluation it was found based on the experimental results that an overall hydrodynamic performance evaluation for the five tested seawalls was needed to assign the optimal seawall configurations this evaluation was mainly done in terms of a single parameter namely the wave hydrodynamic performance parameter mathematically this parameter was defined previously by neelamani and sandhya 2003 as follows 20 performance parameter v w t in which v is the value of the wave hydrodynamics parameters i e kr rup hi rdown hi and wt is a weight factor substituting in eq 20 to get the formula of this parameter to be as follows 21 performance parameter k r w k r r u p h i w r u p r d o w n h i w r d o w n table 4 present information on the cumulative hydrodynamic performance for tslw g 0 33 this table was produced by fixing different weightings for each normalized hydrodynamic output parameter however the mechanism of calculating the weights of each hydrodynamic parameter was derived based on the required design criteria of seawalls as listed in table 5 fig 14 displays the effect of wall slope and wall type on the hydrodynamic performance parameter it was found that the values of this parameter varied from 1 75 to 1 45 1 0 to 0 70 1 1 to 0 88 0 9 to 0 70 and 0 74 to 0 65 for pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 respectively this means that rsw tsw slw and tslw improved the hydrodynamic performance of seawalls by about 44 37 48 and 58 respectively with respect to pw when cot θ varied from 0 0 to 1 0 these results granted the entitlement for tslw to be identified as hydrodynamically optimal both rsw and slw had almost the same hydrodynamic performance when cot θ increased from 0 48 to 1 0 moreover it was recorded that the worst hydrodynamic performance occurred when the wall slope angle with seabed closed to 75 i e cot θ 0 2679 for the five tested walls where the experimental results recorded the highest value of the performance parameter when approaching from this angle the results showed an abrupt increase in rup hi when the slope decreased from 90 to 75 as presented in table 4 because of sudden wave breaking on the steeply sloped faces 4 1 6 effect of block spacing on the hydrodynamic performance of serrated walls the spacing between blocks was considered a significant parameter for the determination of the optimum design criteria of serrated seawall configuration it plays an active role in determining the level of surface roughness which in turn contributes to the dispersal of a large part of the incident wave energy subsequently more investigations are needed to assign the optimal spacing between the dissipater blocks fig 15 a and b showed the influence of relative spacing between the energy dissipater blocks s w on the hydrodynamic performance parameter for both rsw and tsw at θ 90 75 60 and 45 the distribution of the data was most appropriately fitted by a polynomial trend line a trend line was used to accurately assign the optimal spacing between blocks consequently it was observed for both rsw and tsw that the optimum hydrodynamic performance occurred when spacing between blocks s was equal to 2 5 times the width of the dissipater block w at all wall slopes this is primarily because of the energy dissipation due the orbital path disturbance of wave particles by increasing this spacing the impact of surface roughness began to progressively increase therefore the hydrodynamic performance parameter started to increase on its way to return to the status of pw again 4 1 7 effect of slots ratio on the hydrodynamic performance of serrated walls fig 16 a and b presented the variation in the performance parameter versus d li at different values of g 0 13 0 23 0 33 0 43 and 0 53 for both slw and tslw at θ 90 as in fig 15 trend lines were used and it was noted that the performance parameter attained its minimum value for all slots ratio as d li reached 0 25 if the chamber width was about a quarter of the wavelength the slotted plate almost stood at a node of the standing wave pattern the velocity through the slotted plate reached its maximum value and a majority portion of the wave energy was dissipated during the interaction between waves and the slotted plate when the chamber width was approximately 0 5 of the wavelength the slotted plate almost stood at an antinodal point the velocity through the slotted plate approached 0 0 and little wave energy was dissipated fig 17 furthermore when the porosity was moderate i e g 0 33 the hydrodynamic behaviour was at its optimum level for both slw and tslw the effect of g on the hydrodynamic performance parameter at different slope angles and d li 0 25 for both slw and tslw is illustrated in fig 16c and d it was observed that both slw and tslw reached their optimal hydrodynamic performance when g 0 33 as θ varied from 90 to 45 and d li 0 25 as the interaction between jets became larger at g 0 33 highly disturbed eddies occurred a sample test was conducted on the vertical pw under certain wave conditions at hi 9 4 cm li 144 7 cm t 0 994 s to measure the horizontal water particles velocity ux in front of the wall using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the adv i e sontek 16 mhz microadv measures three dimensional flow velocities using the doppler shift principle the instrument consists of a sound emitter three sound receivers and a signal conditioning electronic module the sound emitter generates an acoustic signal that is reflected by sound scattering particles present in the water which are assumed to move at the water s velocity the scattered sound signal was detected by the receivers and used to compute the doppler phase shift from which the flow velocity in the radial or beam directions was calculated a detailed description of the velocimeter operation can be found in mclelland and nicholas 2000 next the radial or beam velocities were converted to a local cartesian coordinate system ux uy uz using a transformation matrix that was determined empirically through calibration by the manufacturer mclelland and nicholas 2000 typical free surface levels and horizontal velocity envelopes of the partial standing wave field were plotted in fig 17 the free surface elevations and near free surface horizontal velocity data were collected spatially at 0 1 m intervals from x 0 15 1 95 m as studied by young and testik 2011 the maximum horizontal velocities occurred at distances of x 0 29 1 01 and 1 74 m while the minimum velocities occurred at distances of x 0 65 and 1 37 m the maximum and minimum horizontal velocities spatially alternated at distances of x li 4 similar to the partial standing wave height envelope the maximum horizontal velocities occurred at nodes whereas minimum horizontal velocities occurred at antinodes 5 development of empirical formulas 5 1 parameters calibration by spss based on the mentioned dimensionless parameters in eq 5 a non linear regression analysis was carried out on the results of 450 experiments i e corresponding to wave characteristics hi 6 49 10 44 cm t 1 08 to 0 758 s li 218 4 to 88 97 cm using spss software levesque 2006 to devise predictive equations for estimating the values of kr rup hi and rdown hi several iterations were done in spss to determine the most appropriate formula for the general equation to be as follows 22 k r r u p h i r d o w n h i a d l i b h i l i c ξ d cot θ e s w f g g the values of parameters a b c d e f and g and the corresponding r2 value for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw in the case of vertical and sloped wall faces were calibrated and listed in table 6 based on the experimental results a sample of the spss outputs is listed in appendix a the devised formulas were considered for a specific applicability range of non dimensional parameters as mentioned in table 6 5 2 verification of formulas the results of 162 experiments i e unseen data for spss corresponding to wave characteristics hi 10 86 11 1 cm t 0 721 to 0 669 s li 80 78 to 69 69 cm were used to verify the predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi obtained from eq 22 the data points were reasonably distributed on either side of a 45 line that was used for observing the correlation between the predicted and measured values fig 18 a b and c were plotted to depict the correlation between the measured and predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi for pw rsw and tslw for the sloped wall fig 18d e and f demonstrated the residuals and the corresponding mean square errors mse for the predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi the mse for kr were 2 10 7 0 0005 and 0 019 for pw rsw and tslw respectively while for wave run up the values of mse were 0 0004 1 10 5 and 0 0004 and for wave run down these values were 0 0015 0 0054 and 0 0003 there was an appreciable agreement between observed and predicted values where the values of residuals were found rather small as the data was symmetrically distributed around the line of 0 error 5 3 validation of formulas a comparative study was performed to validate the results of eq 22 with other previous predictive formulas investigated by different authors for various cases of seawalls fig 19 demonstrates a comparison between the results of present work i e sloped pw and the results of other authors and formulas for predicting the wave reflection coefficient for sloped plane impermeable seawalls for a wide range of slope angles i e 0 267 cot θ 1 0 wave periods i e d li 0

i e el tinah plain bay under certain field conditions the selected field conditions were d 4 0 m hi from 0 8 to 1 7 m and t from 2 3 to 5 1 s in contrast the field conditions can be considered a prototype simulated geometrically and kinematically to assign the corresponding test conditions the test conditions were determined based on a length scale sl 10 and a timescale st 3 16 d 40 cm hi 8 0 17 cm and t from 0 72 to 1 6 s fig 25 was plotted to assess the validity of eq 22 in representing the hydrodynamic status of seawalls in the study area by comparing its results with the experimental results fig 25a b and c elucidated a relationship between hi li versus kr rup hi and rdown hi respectively these figures presented a comparison between the calculated results i e based on the field conditions and the experimental results i e based on the test conditions for the cases of sloped pw θ 60 sloped rsw θ 60 s w 2 0 and sloped tslw θ 60 g 0 33 d li 0 25 the calculated values were determined from eq 22 and table 6 under the following ranges d li from 0 13 to 0 48 hi li from 0 056 to 0 097 ξ from 5 54 to 7 2 s w 2 0 g 0 33 θ 60 and d li 0 25 in general the predictive equations in the present study could accurately predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the tested seawalls in the selected study area in addition the results of both model and prototype are found unequivocally convergent implying that the scale effect can be neglected regardless the existence of some minor disparities the reason for these differences is caused by the neglect of reynolds criterion similitude which becomes rather significant when reynolds number is small the scale effects observed for small scale tests in the present analysis are in agreement with the reported scale effects by lin and karunarathna 2008 and koraim et al 2014 on the other hand rubble mound seawalls were selected as a comparison case with rsw and tslw for kr and rup the red boxes in fig 25a represent the results of eq 26 for a rubble mound seawall dolos type at cot θ 1 25 a 10 and b 0 56 as introduced by allsop and hettiarachchi 1988 the red boxes in fig 25b and c clarify the output of rup hi and rdown hi values from hudson 1959 and van der meer 1995 respectively for dolos type at cot θ 1 25 the figures showed that the dolos seawall was slightly better at reducing wave reflection while rsw and tslw were superior in reducing wave run up and run down overall the hydrodynamic behaviour of steeply sloped rsw and tslw were fairly better than the classical gentle sloped dolos seawalls especially as the wave steepness increases 6 conclusion the present study proposed non conventional coastal structures that will gain a particular prominence in developing sustainable coastal management strategies and widely recognized as cost effective eco friendly and multifunctional coastal structures the hydrodynamic performances of vertical and sloped seawalls in terms of the wave reflection coefficient kr relative wave run up rup hi and relative wave run down rdown hi were examined experimentally five seawall setups plane wall pw rectangular serrated wall rsw triangular serrated wall tsw slotted wall slw and slotted wall with triangular serrations tslw were tested under regular waves based upon the experimental limitations of the present study i e regular wave conditions of 0 183 d li 0 574 and 0

dissipater blocks s w for serrated walls slots ratio g for slotted walls wave steepness hi li the relative water depth d li wall slope cot θ and the surf similarity parameter iribarren number ξ rsw and tsw improved the hydrodynamic performance by 44 and 37 respectively with respect to pw moreover slw and tslw increased the hydrodynamic efficiency by 48 and 58 respectively compared with the pw in conclusion tslw was demonstrated to be hydrodynamically the more efficient and robust of the five tested seawalls both rsw and tsw had the optimum hydrodynamic performance when spacing between blocks s approached 2 5 the width of the dissipater block w at all selected wall slopes adding rectangular blocks to pw increased energy dissipation by 31 52 while adding triangular serrations increased energy dissipation by 26 44 therefore the rectangular blocks were found to be better energy dissipaters compared with triangular blocks adding triangular serrations to the plane slotted wall increased the energy dissipation by 3 10 for the vertical slw and tslw the hydrodynamic performance reached its minimum value when the chamber width d was approximately one quarter of the incident wavelength at slot ratio g 0 33 using vertical seawalls with serrations or slots was hydrodynamically better than using the sloped pw avoiding the use of seawalls on slope angle of 75 with the seabed was recommended as it recorded the worst hydrodynamic performance compared with the other tested wall slopes for the five proposed seawall shapes predictive formulas were developed for estimating the wave hydrodynamic parameters in front of the seawalls in terms of wave reflection run up and run down by using nonlinear regression analysis these formulas were precisely calibrated by spss based on the experimental modelling results the results of these formulas were relatively consistent with experimental numerical outputs of earlier studies in addition these formulas could accurately predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the tested seawalls of wider applicability in el tinah plain bay in the north east coast of egypt both steeply sloped rsw and tslw were recommended instead of the common traditional types of seawalls e g gently sloping dolos types as the results elucidated a preferable hydrodynamic performance we recommend that this research is beneficial for the design of different

23379,this paper presents an experimental study on the hydrodynamic performance of seawalls in terms of wave reflection coefficient kr relative wave run up rup hi and relative wave run down rdown hi various experiments were carried out under monochromatic waves to test five non traditional seawall setups plane wall pw rectangular serrated wall rsw triangular serrated wall tsw slotted wall slw and triangular serrated slotted wall tslw a thin parallel solid wall with a water chamber width d was used on the leeward side of slw and tslw in order to preclude the wave transmission rsw was found hydrodynamically superior as compared with tsw the blocks spacing of rsw and tsw were hydrodynamically optimized at a value of 2 5 times the width of the block nevertheless the hydrodynamic behaviour of both slw and tslw was optimal when the slots ratio was about 0 33 whilst the chamber width was about 0 25 of the incident wavelength new empirical formulas were developed for understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the proposed seawalls using nonlinear regression analysis these formulas were calibrated using spss based on the experimental results the formulas were used to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of both rsw and tslw for el tinah plain bay in the north east coast of egypt keywords empirical formulas serrated seawalls slotted seawalls spss wave hydrodynamics 1 introduction seawalls have been extensively used for protecting the coastal shoreline to mitigate wave induced erosion however the classical coastal structures are damaged by extreme wave actions generated by storms or coastal flooding results from a complex set of tides surges and rivers inflows olbert et al 2017 such waves can cause displacement overturning soil liquefaction and progressive damage to structural components or foundation failures an optimal design of seawalls requires detailed information on various hydrodynamic parameters including wave run up wave run down wave overtopping and wave reflection characteristics various experimental numerical and theoretical studies have been performed to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of vertical as well as sloped seawalls via developing different computational formulas the contribution of hudson 1959 hunt jr 1959 chue and shah 1981 ahrens and titus 1985 van der meer and breteler 1990 ahrens et al 1993 schuttrumpf et al 1995 and van der meer 1995 are among the earlier investigations of wave run up and run down they combined several standard prediction formulas with their measurements for smooth sloping and rough seawalls to produce equations of wider applicability for the relative wave run up and run down based mainly on the surf similarity parameter ξ according to the wave structure regimes in addition ahrens et al 1993 investigated a formula for evaluating the non breaking wave reflection on the smoothed surfaces posteriorly numerical investigations were carried out by mallayachari and sundar 1994 and isaacson et al 2000 to obtain the wave reflection characteristics for perforated seawalls but no design formulas were given based on the linear wave theory and the eigenfunction expansion method the interaction between waves and a slotted seawall was studied analytically as well as experimentally by zhu and chwang 2001 the analytical investigations showed that the reflection characteristics of a slotted seawall mainly depend on the porosity of the slotted plate and the incident wave height hughes 2005 devised a valid formula for breaking and non breaking incident wave conditions to estimate the influence of rough impermeable slopes on the wave run up identifying only slight differences between the run up between waves that broke on the slope and non breaking waves neelamani and sandhya 2003 and 2005 presented predictive equations based on experimental investigations of wave reflection run up run down and wave pressures on the plane dentated and serrated seawalls the results showed that the obtained formulas can be worthily used for a better hydrodynamic design of vertical and sloped structures while without developing formulas the performance of an offshore submerged breakwater in reducing the wave forces and wave run up on a vertical wall was investigated numerically and experimentally by reddy et al 2007 as well a simple formula was developed by zanuttigh and van der meer 2008 that related the reflection coefficient to the breaker parameter and seemed to fit various types of coastal structures in design conditions such as smooth rock and armour unit slopes empirical equations used for estimating the wave run up reflection and transmission coefficients for a porous seawall with and without the sub merged breakwater were developed by koraim et al 2014 the results of these equations were compared with experimental and theoretical results obtained by different authors and provided a reasonable agreement a steep wave impact on seawalls of various geometries was examined by aida et al 2015 using a simple analytical model for the pressure impulse due to a wave of idealized geometry and dynamics elbisy 2015 quantified the regular wave run up on smooth slopes of perforated coastal structures constructed on sloping beaches using multiple additive regression trees mart and multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp methods the results indicated that the mart method s prediction accuracy and avoidance of over fitting were superior to those of the mlp method an analytical solution for wave interaction with a partially reflecting vertical wall protected by a submerged porous bar based on linear potential theory was given by yang et al 2016 they found that this solution may be used to determine the optimum parameters of structures at a preliminary engineering design stage negm and nassar 2016 determined new formulas of wave reflection estimation for smoothed roughed and perforated sloped seawalls via experimental modelling using non linear regression analysis the results of the obtained formulas were predominately compatible with previous studies but were extremely limited to application it was ultimately noticed from this comprehensive literature that more formulas for estimating wave reflection wave run up and wave run down on seawalls are urgently required to study the impact of different shapes of serrations as well as slots combined with serrations therefore seawalls of various slopes with energy dissipaters in the form of rectangular or triangular serrated blocks and horizontally slotted seawalls with or without triangular serrations accompanied by a leeward thin solid wall at a certain distance were extensively investigated as quasi bottom based structures in this study in spite of the bottom based structures may be initially more expensive than the floating ones when using them in depths greater than 6 1 m bruce 1985 but over the long term period it would be stable and do not need disbursing much money for cyclical maintenances as the case in surface piercing structures furthermore in prototype our novel designs rely mainly on using of pile supported superfine sheets which spontaneously extended to be touched with seabed supported by mounted footing from both leeward and seaward sides to avoid toe scouring these designs never require much heavy materials as the case in the fully bottom based traditional types on the other side a steeply sloped seawall with energy dissipaters or horizontal slots distributed on its surface is expected to hydrodynamically replace the mildly sloped seawall from dissipating the incident wave energy and hence expected to reduce the wave reflection wave load on the seawall wave run up run down and toe scour the main objective of this study is to devise new empirical formulas that would benefit in understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of the proposed non traditional coastal structures that will gain a particular importance in developing sustainable coastal management strategies and widely recognized as economically effective over the long term eco friendly and multifunctional coastal structures several specific objectives of the paper include 1 introducing non conventional types of energy dissipating seawalls 2 overcoming the drawbacks of the classical types of seawalls 3 evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the simulated physical models experimentally and 4 developing new empirical formulas of wider applicability to estimate the wave hydrodynamic parameters using nonlinear regression analysis by spss software levesque 2006 2 dimensional analysis relationships of wave reflection kr wave run up rup and wave run down rdown in terms of hydraulic and geometrical characteristics of the studied models were developed by the buckingham pi theorem moreover a functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables could be obtained it was assumed that the dependent variables reflected wave height hr the maximum wave run up rup and the maximum wave run down rdown are a function of independent governing variables which are listed in table 1 the variables could be written in the non dimensional form of the following functions 2 f 1 π 1 π 2 π 3 π 4 π 5 π 6 π 7 π 8 π 9 π 10 π 11 0 0 using pi theorem properties a mathematical reprocessing was carried out i e multiplications divisions for the non dimensional parameters so pi terms have been reduced from 11 to 9 for the following 3 f 2 π 1 π 2 π 3 π 4 π 5 π 6 π 7 π 8 π 9 0 0 4 f 3 h i l i k

seawalls was checked in response to non dimensional seawall and wave parameters the definitions and ranges of these non dimensional parameters were consigned in table 2 3 physical modeling a series of experiments i e 612 runs were conducted to determine the hydrodynamic parameters using the proposed physical models presented in section 3 3 at different wave and structural parameters 3 1 model scale the physical model of seawall structures was introduced to experimentally simulate the prototype of such structures to ensure that the physical model experiments are valid the physical similarity should be maintained between the model and the prototype chakrabarti 1999 by the principle of physical similarity the design of physical models depends mainly on laboratory and the prototype conditions in coastal engineering studies the froude criterion was adopted for most physical models which requires the froude number to be the same in the model as well as in the prototype zhu and chwang 2001 our interests in the present study were focused on the wave conditions in el tinah plain bay which is located on the north east coast of egypt i e spatial reference wgs 1984 utm zone number 36n as shown in fig 1 the egyptian government decided to set up coastal protection systems in vicinity of el mallaha lake coastline see fig 1 zone 1 due to its severe erosion over the elapsed time from 1989 the sky blue line to 2016 the red line the prototype water depth in coastal areas was approximately 4 0 m and the wave periods were found in a range of 2 12 4 14 s i e these data were collected from the site monitoring buoy north of port said at location 31 21 35n 32 21 00e the height of the wave flume is 100 cm by considering other conditions such as the available flume length and the wave periods which wave maker can generate a water depth d of 40 cm was selected and kept constant in the flume for all experimental tests the length scale is sl 4 0 4 10 the timescale based on the froude similitude was s t s l 3 16 thus regular wave trains with periods t from 0 669 to 1 308 s were selected for the testing wave conditions the wave height for the physical model tests in the present study was specified in the range from 6 50 to 11 1 cm from 65 to 111 cm in prototype dissipater blocks with a width of 5 0 cm and height of 4 0 cm were used the block dimensions corresponding to 4 0 m water depth will be 50 cm width and 40 cm height in the prototype table 3 3 2 test facility the flume in the present study was of 15 1 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 0 m deep fig 2 a flap type wave generator was used to displace the water in the flume to get the desired monochromatic wave characteristics the wave generator was installed at one end of the flume two wave absorbers were used to prevent the reflection of waves at the other end of the flume to increase the efficiency of experiments decreasing the potential effect of multi reflection and to reduce the time required between runs while the water is calming down the first absorber was placed in the seaward side of the wave generator while the another absorber was installed at the leeward side of the flume with a slope of 3 1 as recommended by koraim and rageh 2013 the experiments were carried out at constant water depth d of 0 4 m the flap was controlled by an induction motor of 11 kw the motor was regulated by an inventor drive frequency capacity from 0 0 to 50 hz rotating in a speed range of 0 0 155 rpm regular waves with heights hi i e from 6 495 to 11 1 cm and periods t i e from 0 669 to 1 308s have been generated using this facility these ranges were used corresponding to motor frequency f changes from 2 5 hz to 5 2 hz 3 3 model details five different types of the seawalls were examined in the present study including pw rsw tsw slw and tslw fig 3 a a thin parallel solid back plate with a water chamber width d was used on the leeward side of both slw and tslw in order to preclude the wave transmission fig 3b practically the chamber space can be exploited to install a wave energy converter system wecs to convert the mechanical power acquired from water particles motion inside the chamber into electric power and feeding the nearby fish farms in el tinah plain bay in addition this wall type can largely fix the erosion situation in el tinah bay by allowing the long shore and cross shore sediment to be easily transported through the open sides chamber and the slots without any interruptions the tested models were placed in the middle of the wave flume perspex working section the models were fixed inside the wave flume rigidly for the required angle of inclination i e θ 45 60 75 and 90 using supports and wedges driven between the model and flume wall the models basically consist of a plane plate rectangular and triangular dissipater blocks the plate was made of hardwood 30 mm thick and coated with water insulation material i e acryl flex 200 blocks were made of wood of sizes 99 cm long 5 0 cm wide parallel to wall slope and 4 0 cm height perpendicular to wall slope they were fixed in a regular manner the leakage of water between the model and the flume wall has been sealed by using a filled material citosil 400 3 4 instrumentations 3 4 1 wave probes vertical linear probes in the form of movable diaphanous rulers with an accuracy of 1 0 mm were installed in the perspex section at different positions i e p1 p2 p3 and p4 as illustrated in fig 2 the vertical probes were selected to be in front of the seawall model seaward side to measure the hydrodynamic parameters of waves i e hi hr rup and rdown 3 4 2 wave generation process a static wave generation process was carried out daily at the inception of each set of experiments this process encompassed the wave characteristics measurement including hi li lo and t in the absence of seawall the daily variations were found to have a standard deviation of 0 1 3 4 3 data acquisition the free surface variations that resulted from the wave structure interaction were recorded using a sony mvc cd 500 digital still camera at various motor frequencies i e ranging from 2 5 hz to 5 2 hz the camera zoom was exactly adjusted perpendicular to the linear probe on the glass flume side at each recording positions the camera was fixed on a vertical stand avoiding the variations of the video shots the recording time for each test is approximately 4 5 the time required for a generated wave to travel from the generator to the model position i e 30 sec rageh and koraim 2010 using a precise slow motion technique e g adobe premiere the recorded waves taken by the camera were directly detected via a computer screen then time series of free surface elevation were plotted e g fig 6 this technique provided a high definition image every 1 50 s the methodology of detecting was appreciably validated by arc map software and satisfactorily tolerable errors have been acquired 3 4 4 wave height measurements the incident wave heights hi were measured during the flume calibration process using wave probe p3 in the absence of seawalls the values of the incident wave heights in the presence of seawalls were calculated according to the method described by dalrymple et al 1991 the calculated values were compared with those measured by wave probe p3 and plotted in fig 4 the results agreed quite closely with the value of normalized root mean square error nrmse 0 1557 maximum residual of 3 0 mm two wave probes p2 the quasi nodes and p1 the quasi antinodes were set in front of the model at distances 0 2 li and 0 45 li respectively from the seawall toe to separate the incident hi and reflected hr wave heights according to goda and suzuki 1976 dalrymple et al 1991 koraim and rageh 2013 and koraim et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 2 the incident wavelength li is variable according to the wave period t where it was calculated using the dispersion relationship according to the linear wave theory the free surface elevation η x for any location x can be estimated by the following equation dalrymple et al 1991 6 η x h i 2 2 h r 2 2 h i h r 2 2 cos 2 k x ε in which k is the wave number k 2π li and ε is the phase lag induced by the reflection process the η x obviously varies periodically with x and it becomes a maximum of the envelope at the phase positions 7 2 k x 1 ε 2 n π n 0 1 2 8 η x max h i h r 2 quasi antinodes whereas at the phase positions of 9 2 k x 2 ε 2 n 1 π n 0 1 2 it becomes a minimum of the envelope 10 η x min h i h r 2 quasi nodes the actual distance between the quasi nodes and the quasi antinodes the distance between the vertical probes p1 and p2 was obtained by subtracting eq 9 from eq 7 resulting in the following equation 11 x 2 x 1 π 2 k l i 4 typical envelopes of the partial standing wave induced by pw was measured and plotted in fig 5 at slope angles θ 90 75 60 and 45 li 144 7 cm hi 9 4 cm and t 0 994 s to verify the results obtained by dalrymple et al 1991 experimentally the maximum and minimum free surface elevations were measured at different spatial positions along the wave flume at 0 1 m intervals from x 0 15 m 1 95 m i e from seawall toe it was observed in the partial standing wave field that the nodes and the antinodes alternate spatially at x locations at almost equal increments of li 4 this was seen in fig 5 nodes x li 0 2 0 7 1 2 antinodes x li 0 45 0 95 similarly in fig 5 where li 1 447 m the antinodes occur approximately at x 0 65 m and 1 37 m and the nodes occur approximately at x 0 29 m 1 01 m and 1 74 m the wave energy was almost fully reflected in case of vertical pw i e θ 90 o while only a part of the wave energy is reflected from the sloped walls i e θ 75 o 60 o and 45 o because of the energy dissipated by breaking on the sloped faces so the spatial wave profile will be that of a partial standing wave system the envelope height at the antinodes in the partial standing wave system is the result of the incident wave height plus the partial reflected wave height hi hr whereas the envelope height at the nodal points is hi hr fig 5 shows that whenever the slope was milder i e θ decreases from 90 to 45 the envelope height at the nodal points increased while it decreased at the antinodal points this reflects the efficiency of the sloped walls in the dispersal of the wave energy due to the breaking of a large part of this energy when the slope becomes milder the calculated incident hi and reflected hr wave heights estimated from eq 8 and 10 are as follows 12 h i η max η min h max h min 2 13 h r 2 η r η max η min h max h min 2 where hmax 2 η x max max wave height at antinodes max crest level min through level at wave scale position p1 and hmin 2 η x min min wave height at nodes min crest level max trough level at wave scale position p2 the reflection coefficient kr is the ratio between reflected and incident wave heights therefore 14 k r h r h i 15 k r h max h min h max h min η x max η x min η x max η x min 3 4 5 wave run up and run down a set of vertical probes p4 have been fixed at the seaward side of the seawall to cover the run up and run down zones for different selected wall slopes fig 2 run up and run down could be observed as the maximum wave run up rup equals the maximum positive free surface elevation on the sloped face i e during wave up rushing minus the still water level swl while the maximum wave run down rdown equals the maximum negative free surface elevation on the sloped face i e during wave down rushing minus the still water level swl 3 4 6 optimal timing of experimental measurements fig 6 presents a sample of the analysed data using the wave probes p1 p2 p3 and p4 for determining the optimal time zone of measurements to avoid the noise effect which accompanying with the wave multi reflection using a case study of pw at θ 60 d 0 40 m and t 0 994 1 308 s fig 6a showed that through 0 7 s the wave travelled from the wave generator to p3 in case of no seawall some disturbance occurred in the shape of the wave for a few seconds then the wave seemed steadily stable for some time i e time 7 30 s which is the suitable period to measure the incident wave height after inauguration of the seawall in the physical model the reflected waves from the seawall started affecting the incident waves as shown in fig 6b and c which represent the positions of the antinode p1 and the node p2 respectively the partial standing wave began to build its shape after 14 s for both t 0 994 and 1 308 s and the wave devolved to be uniform through the time from 14 s to 30 s which is the period of the suitable zone to estimate η max and η min at p1 and p2 respectively fig 6d exhibits the resulted value of the reflected wave η r from eq 13 for pw at θ 90 a n d θ 60 in the case of θ 60 there were no recorded values for the reflected wave height from time 0 s up to 14 s for t 0 994 and 1 308 s after that the partial standing wave started that was unlike the vertical case the standing wave commenced after 7 s it was noticed that when the wall slope angle becomes milder the occurrence of the standing wave comes later this time lag occurs due to the excessive dissipation of the wave energy on the seawall slope due to wave breaking additionally the water particles go a longer distance before colliding with the barrier wall this feature can be used for a better design of the side revetments of navigation canals fig 6e shows the variations of free surface elevation with time at p4 for measuring the values of the run up and down the figure shows that a disturbance appeared in the shape of the wave for a few seconds from 0 s to 10 s after that the wave became dramatically stable for some time i e from 10 to 30 s which is the suitable period to measure the wave run up and down the figure clearly shows that the wave period almost does not affect the optimal period of time to undertake the measurements at all wave probes 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of wave investigations the effects of ξ wave periods in terms of d li and wave heights in terms of hi li on kr rup hi and rdown hi are not only essential to understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of the existing seawall for coastal regions but also undoubtedly help to assess the performance of the seawall under normal and extreme wave actions moreover the effects of s w g and θ on kr rup hi and rdown hi are required to select the appropriate configuration for seawalls 4 1 1 effect of surf similarity parameter ξ on kr rup hi and rdown hi the surf similarity parameter ξ or iribarren number relates the angle of the structure slope and the wave steepness where battjes 1974 defined ξ as 16 ξ tan θ h i l o fig 7 a b and c clearly illustrate the effect of the surf similarity parameter ξ on wave hydrodynamic parameters kr rup and rdown for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw at θ 45 θ 60 a n d θ 75 kr rup hi and rdown hi values increased at increasing ξ under different angles of inclination the values of ξ and hi lo are inversely proportional based on eq 16 this indicates that the energy dissipation was low as shown in fig 8 and this provided an augmentation in the hydrodynamic parameters over and above average trend lines on the basis of logarithmic functions were plotted for each angle i e θ 45 for 2 43 ξ 6 4 θ 60 for 6 4 ξ 13 4 and θ 75 for 13 4 ξ 23 9 to qualify the effectiveness of ξ on kr rup and rdown under different wall slopes the impact of ξ on the hydrodynamic parameters was found to be less effective when slopes increased from 45 to 75 because of the wave breaking on the sloped face this supports the work of twu and liu 1999 4 1 2 wave energy dissipation the data at θ 60 were selected to test the impact of wave steepness hi li on the wave energy dissipation for pw rsw s w 2 0 and tslw g 0 33 and d li 0 25 as presented in fig 8 the wave energy dissipation was estimated in terms of non dimensional parameter namely relative energy dissipation rl the value of rl can be evaluated as a function of the reflection coefficient through the energy equilibrium of an incident wave attacking the structure as follows 17 e i e r e l in which ei is the energy of the incident wave er is the energy of the reflected wave and el is the dissipated wave energy based on eq 17 the portion of the wave energy which dissipated at the structure can be estimated as a function of the reflection coefficient as given by reddy and neelamani 1992 18 e l e i 1 e r e i 19 r l 1 k r 2 the results in fig 8 show that there was a robust correlation between hi li and the rl rl substantially increased from 0 08 to 0 4 at increasing hi li from 0 029 to 0 159 at θ 60 for pw however rl increased from 0 58 to 0 83 and from 0 74 to 0 84 for rsw and tslw respectively these results give the precedence to both rsw and tslw in wave energy dispersion compared with pw this could be due to the excessive loss of wave energy that mainly results from wave breaking surface roughness return flow effect and disturbance of wave orbital paths for rsw yagci et al 2014 moreover the influence of jet interactions represented the most effective dissipation mode for tslw as discussed earlier by zhu and chwang 2001 see fig 11a and b sloped structures are good energy dissipaters when compared with vertical structures the amount of wave energy dissipation depends greatly on the slope provided if the slope of the seawall is milder then more waves break by surging plunging or spilling and this is beneficial from a force and water particle kinematics reduction but the milder the wall slopes the more expensive they are as sloped walls experience high run up and thus require higher crest elevation furthermore they also occupy more space and willimpede the social activities near coastal zones führböter 1994 fig 9 presents the effect of wall type on wave energy dissipation it was noticed through this figure that adding dissipater blocks or slots to the vertical wall led to squandering more wave energy than the sloped pw e g at θ 45 therefore using blocks or slots with vertical walls can overcome the drawbacks of sloped walls this clearly brings out the benefit of vertical walls compared with sloped walls for quay walls and berthing structures with vertical faces 4 1 3 effect of wave height on kr rup hi and rdown hi fig 10 describes the influence of wave height in terms of the wave steepness parameter hi li on kr rup hi and rdown hi for the pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 at slope angles 90 and 45 fig 10 shows that kr rup hi and rdown hi generally decreased for all wall types while hi li increased from 0 0297 to 0 1593 due to the excessive energy dissipation of the steeper waves as demonstrated in fig 8 fig 10a and b illustrate that the effects of hi li were relatively low for predicting the values of kr for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw when θ 90 in contrast they became more efficient and significant when the slope reduced to 45 because of the amalgamation between the dispersed energy of the steeper waves and breaking in the sloped surface moreover rsw was better in reducing kr than tsw and pw for both cases of vertical and sloped walls the rectangular blocks largely disturbed the orbital path of the wave particles and caused higher energy dissipation fig 11a furthermore the least reduction in kr with hi li was recorded for tslw when compared withthe other tested walls for both θ 90 and 45 due to the excessive energy dissipated by surface friction and the vena contracta effect when waves transmit through the gaps as the fluid passes the slots a jet is formed which expands and collides with jets from adjacent slots to create an eddy zone around the slotted plate as presented in fig 11b zhu and chwang 2001 on the other side fig 10c shows that the values of rup hi had almost the same effect for both vertical rsw and tsw when hi li 0 065 this clearly means that the rough shape did not have a significant effect on the run up when the wave became steeper adding triangular serrations to the slotted walls achieved a limited decrease in rup hi when hi li increased from 0 0297 to 0 1593 fig 13d shows that when the wall slope was reduced to 45 the wave run up became higher for all seawall types because of the impulsiveness of water particles on the sloped face from the wave breaking the wave steepness also became more effective in decreasing the wave run up for pw slw and tslw a conclusion could be drawn from fig 10c and d that tslw had the optimal reduction for run up values due to the energy dissipation by the combination effect of both surface roughness and eddies fig 10e and f illustrate that the values of rdown hi always decreased when hi li 0 0683 for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw when the slope mitigated from 90 to 45 unstable readings occurred when hi li 0 0683 in addition when the slope became milder rsw had the best performance in reducing the values of rdown hi compared with pw tsw slw and tslw because the rectangular blocks can retain a large portion of water mass during the wave down rushing 4 1 4 effect of wall slope on kr rup hi and rdown hi the effect of wall slope cot θ on kr rup hi and rdown hi was studied at two different wave periods i e d li from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 for pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 where the relative water depth d li was selected to represent the wave period neelamani and sandhya 2003 the d li ranged from 0 183 to 0 263 representing the wave period t from 1 308 s to 1 024 s and d li ranged from 0 495 to 0 574 representing the wave period t from 0 73 s to 0 669 s fig 12 a shows that when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 574 kr decreased with increasing cot θ from 0 0 to 1 0 for all wall types due to the wave breaking on the sloped surface by surging or plunging it was also observed in fig 12b that the wall slope was found to be more effective at predicting kr whenever the waves became shorter there was a significant reduction in kr for all wall types when the waves were shorter i e d li from 0 495 to 0 574 compared with the longer waves i e d li from 0 183 to 0 263 when the waves became shorter the wave steepness increased and hence more energy was dissipated fig 13a and b showed that rup hi increased with increasing cot θ from 0 0 to 1 0 for the five tested walls when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 this increase occurred due to the big disturbance sequenced by the wave breaking on the sloped faces waves breaking on a sloped face accelerates the water particles on the sloped body and causes a big wave to rush up it was also observed that the effect of wall slope reduced as the more waves became shorter moreover the effect of the wave period was found to be very significant in predicting the values of wave run up rup hi dramatically decreased when d li increased it was also noticed that rsw was better at reducing wave run up for longer waves while slw and tslw were superior in reducing wave run up when waves became shorter the surface friction became less efficacious when waves were shorter similarly fig 13c and d shows that the rdown hi decreased while cot θ increased from 0 0 to 1 0 for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw the resistance of water particle gravity in the perpendicular direction of the wall surface during wave down rushing was higher when the slope was milder it was also found that the rsw was better at reducing rdown hi compared with pw tsw slw and tslw when d li increased from 0 183 to 0 263 and 0 495 to 0 574 respectively the rectangular blocks could trap a significant amount of water mass during waves down rushing when the slope got milder as the wave released a big portion of its energy due to friction and breaking furthermore tsw slw and tslw had almost the same impact on wave run down for all wave periods 4 1 5 overall hydrodynamic performance evaluation it was found based on the experimental results that an overall hydrodynamic performance evaluation for the five tested seawalls was needed to assign the optimal seawall configurations this evaluation was mainly done in terms of a single parameter namely the wave hydrodynamic performance parameter mathematically this parameter was defined previously by neelamani and sandhya 2003 as follows 20 performance parameter v w t in which v is the value of the wave hydrodynamics parameters i e kr rup hi rdown hi and wt is a weight factor substituting in eq 20 to get the formula of this parameter to be as follows 21 performance parameter k r w k r r u p h i w r u p r d o w n h i w r d o w n table 4 present information on the cumulative hydrodynamic performance for tslw g 0 33 this table was produced by fixing different weightings for each normalized hydrodynamic output parameter however the mechanism of calculating the weights of each hydrodynamic parameter was derived based on the required design criteria of seawalls as listed in table 5 fig 14 displays the effect of wall slope and wall type on the hydrodynamic performance parameter it was found that the values of this parameter varied from 1 75 to 1 45 1 0 to 0 70 1 1 to 0 88 0 9 to 0 70 and 0 74 to 0 65 for pw rsw s w 2 0 tsw s w 2 0 slw g 0 33 d li 0 25 and tslw g 0 33 d li 0 25 respectively this means that rsw tsw slw and tslw improved the hydrodynamic performance of seawalls by about 44 37 48 and 58 respectively with respect to pw when cot θ varied from 0 0 to 1 0 these results granted the entitlement for tslw to be identified as hydrodynamically optimal both rsw and slw had almost the same hydrodynamic performance when cot θ increased from 0 48 to 1 0 moreover it was recorded that the worst hydrodynamic performance occurred when the wall slope angle with seabed closed to 75 i e cot θ 0 2679 for the five tested walls where the experimental results recorded the highest value of the performance parameter when approaching from this angle the results showed an abrupt increase in rup hi when the slope decreased from 90 to 75 as presented in table 4 because of sudden wave breaking on the steeply sloped faces 4 1 6 effect of block spacing on the hydrodynamic performance of serrated walls the spacing between blocks was considered a significant parameter for the determination of the optimum design criteria of serrated seawall configuration it plays an active role in determining the level of surface roughness which in turn contributes to the dispersal of a large part of the incident wave energy subsequently more investigations are needed to assign the optimal spacing between the dissipater blocks fig 15 a and b showed the influence of relative spacing between the energy dissipater blocks s w on the hydrodynamic performance parameter for both rsw and tsw at θ 90 75 60 and 45 the distribution of the data was most appropriately fitted by a polynomial trend line a trend line was used to accurately assign the optimal spacing between blocks consequently it was observed for both rsw and tsw that the optimum hydrodynamic performance occurred when spacing between blocks s was equal to 2 5 times the width of the dissipater block w at all wall slopes this is primarily because of the energy dissipation due the orbital path disturbance of wave particles by increasing this spacing the impact of surface roughness began to progressively increase therefore the hydrodynamic performance parameter started to increase on its way to return to the status of pw again 4 1 7 effect of slots ratio on the hydrodynamic performance of serrated walls fig 16 a and b presented the variation in the performance parameter versus d li at different values of g 0 13 0 23 0 33 0 43 and 0 53 for both slw and tslw at θ 90 as in fig 15 trend lines were used and it was noted that the performance parameter attained its minimum value for all slots ratio as d li reached 0 25 if the chamber width was about a quarter of the wavelength the slotted plate almost stood at a node of the standing wave pattern the velocity through the slotted plate reached its maximum value and a majority portion of the wave energy was dissipated during the interaction between waves and the slotted plate when the chamber width was approximately 0 5 of the wavelength the slotted plate almost stood at an antinodal point the velocity through the slotted plate approached 0 0 and little wave energy was dissipated fig 17 furthermore when the porosity was moderate i e g 0 33 the hydrodynamic behaviour was at its optimum level for both slw and tslw the effect of g on the hydrodynamic performance parameter at different slope angles and d li 0 25 for both slw and tslw is illustrated in fig 16c and d it was observed that both slw and tslw reached their optimal hydrodynamic performance when g 0 33 as θ varied from 90 to 45 and d li 0 25 as the interaction between jets became larger at g 0 33 highly disturbed eddies occurred a sample test was conducted on the vertical pw under certain wave conditions at hi 9 4 cm li 144 7 cm t 0 994 s to measure the horizontal water particles velocity ux in front of the wall using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the adv i e sontek 16 mhz microadv measures three dimensional flow velocities using the doppler shift principle the instrument consists of a sound emitter three sound receivers and a signal conditioning electronic module the sound emitter generates an acoustic signal that is reflected by sound scattering particles present in the water which are assumed to move at the water s velocity the scattered sound signal was detected by the receivers and used to compute the doppler phase shift from which the flow velocity in the radial or beam directions was calculated a detailed description of the velocimeter operation can be found in mclelland and nicholas 2000 next the radial or beam velocities were converted to a local cartesian coordinate system ux uy uz using a transformation matrix that was determined empirically through calibration by the manufacturer mclelland and nicholas 2000 typical free surface levels and horizontal velocity envelopes of the partial standing wave field were plotted in fig 17 the free surface elevations and near free surface horizontal velocity data were collected spatially at 0 1 m intervals from x 0 15 1 95 m as studied by young and testik 2011 the maximum horizontal velocities occurred at distances of x 0 29 1 01 and 1 74 m while the minimum velocities occurred at distances of x 0 65 and 1 37 m the maximum and minimum horizontal velocities spatially alternated at distances of x li 4 similar to the partial standing wave height envelope the maximum horizontal velocities occurred at nodes whereas minimum horizontal velocities occurred at antinodes 5 development of empirical formulas 5 1 parameters calibration by spss based on the mentioned dimensionless parameters in eq 5 a non linear regression analysis was carried out on the results of 450 experiments i e corresponding to wave characteristics hi 6 49 10 44 cm t 1 08 to 0 758 s li 218 4 to 88 97 cm using spss software levesque 2006 to devise predictive equations for estimating the values of kr rup hi and rdown hi several iterations were done in spss to determine the most appropriate formula for the general equation to be as follows 22 k r r u p h i r d o w n h i a d l i b h i l i c ξ d cot θ e s w f g g the values of parameters a b c d e f and g and the corresponding r2 value for pw rsw tsw slw and tslw in the case of vertical and sloped wall faces were calibrated and listed in table 6 based on the experimental results a sample of the spss outputs is listed in appendix a the devised formulas were considered for a specific applicability range of non dimensional parameters as mentioned in table 6 5 2 verification of formulas the results of 162 experiments i e unseen data for spss corresponding to wave characteristics hi 10 86 11 1 cm t 0 721 to 0 669 s li 80 78 to 69 69 cm were used to verify the predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi obtained from eq 22 the data points were reasonably distributed on either side of a 45 line that was used for observing the correlation between the predicted and measured values fig 18 a b and c were plotted to depict the correlation between the measured and predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi for pw rsw and tslw for the sloped wall fig 18d e and f demonstrated the residuals and the corresponding mean square errors mse for the predicted values of kr rup hi and rdown hi the mse for kr were 2 10 7 0 0005 and 0 019 for pw rsw and tslw respectively while for wave run up the values of mse were 0 0004 1 10 5 and 0 0004 and for wave run down these values were 0 0015 0 0054 and 0 0003 there was an appreciable agreement between observed and predicted values where the values of residuals were found rather small as the data was symmetrically distributed around the line of 0 error 5 3 validation of formulas a comparative study was performed to validate the results of eq 22 with other previous predictive formulas investigated by different authors for various cases of seawalls fig 19 demonstrates a comparison between the results of present work i e sloped pw and the

kinematics in front of the wall due to the significant wave reflection whilst for the roughed surface cases kr decreased as d li increased because of the excessive energy dissipation by surface

formulas were relatively consistent with experimental numerical outputs of some earlier studies however there was variation between the results due to variable experimental setups design criteria of the experiments and limitations of each study 5 4 formula application for el tinah plain bay and the scale effect eq 22 was selected to predict the hydrodynamic situation of seawalls in the study area i e el tinah plain bay under certain field conditions the selected field conditions were d 4 0 m hi from 0 8 to 1 7 m and t from 2 3 to 5 1 s in contrast the field conditions can be considered a prototype simulated geometrically and kinematically to assign the corresponding test conditions the test conditions were determined based on a length scale sl 10 and a timescale st 3 16 d 40 cm hi 8 0 17 cm and t from 0 72 to 1 6 s fig 25 was plotted to assess the validity of eq 22 in representing the hydrodynamic status of seawalls in the study area by comparing its results with the experimental results fig 25a b and c elucidated a relationship between hi li versus kr rup hi and rdown hi respectively these figures presented a comparison between the calculated results i e based on the field conditions and the experimental results i e based on the test conditions for the cases of sloped pw θ 60 sloped rsw θ 60 s w 2 0 and sloped tslw θ 60 g 0 33 d li 0 25 the calculated values were determined from eq 22 and table 6 under the following ranges d li from 0 13 to 0 48 hi li from 0 056 to 0 097 ξ from 5 54 to 7 2 s w 2 0 g 0 33 θ 60 and d li 0 25 in general the predictive equations in the present study could accurately predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the tested seawalls in the selected study area in addition the results of both model and prototype are found unequivocally convergent implying that the scale effect can be neglected regardless the existence of some minor disparities the reason for these differences is caused by the neglect of reynolds criterion similitude which becomes rather significant when reynolds number is small the scale effects observed for small scale tests in the present analysis are in agreement with the reported scale effects by lin and karunarathna 2008 and koraim et al 2014 on the other hand rubble mound seawalls were selected as a comparison case with rsw and tslw for kr and rup the red boxes in fig 25a represent the results of eq 26 for a rubble mound seawall dolos type at cot θ 1 25 a 10 and b 0 56 as introduced by allsop and hettiarachchi 1988 the red boxes in fig 25b and c clarify the output of rup hi and rdown hi values from hudson 1959 and van der meer 1995 respectively for dolos type at cot θ 1 25 the figures showed that the dolos seawall was slightly better at reducing wave reflection while rsw and tslw were superior in reducing wave run up and run down overall the hydrodynamic behaviour of steeply sloped rsw and tslw were fairly better than the classical gentle sloped dolos seawalls especially as the wave steepness increases 6 conclusion the present study proposed non conventional coastal structures that will gain a particular prominence in developing sustainable coastal management strategies and widely recognized as cost effective eco friendly and multifunctional coastal structures the hydrodynamic performances of vertical and sloped seawalls in terms of the wave reflection coefficient kr relative wave run up rup hi and relative wave run down rdown hi were examined experimentally five seawall setups plane wall pw rectangular serrated wall rsw triangular serrated wall tsw slotted wall slw and slotted wall with triangular serrations tslw were tested under regular waves based upon the experimental limitations of the present study i e regular wave conditions of 0 183 d li 0 574 and 0 0297 hi li 0 1593 and wall characteristics of 2 43 ξ 23 93 s w 2 5 g 0 33 0 0 cot θ 1 0 and d li 0 25 it was concluded that the wave hydrodynamic parameters depend strongly on the relative spacing of dissipater blocks s w for serrated walls slots ratio g for slotted walls wave steepness hi li the relative water depth d li wall slope cot θ and the surf similarity parameter iribarren number ξ rsw and tsw improved the hydrodynamic performance by 44 and 37 respectively with respect to pw moreover slw and tslw increased the hydrodynamic efficiency by 48 and 58 respectively compared with the pw in conclusion tslw was demonstrated to be hydrodynamically the more efficient and robust of the five tested seawalls both rsw and tsw had the optimum hydrodynamic performance when spacing between blocks s approached 2 5 the width of the dissipater block w at all selected wall slopes adding rectangular blocks to pw increased energy dissipation by 31 52 while adding triangular serrations increased energy dissipation by 26 44 therefore the rectangular blocks were found to be better energy dissipaters compared with triangular blocks adding triangular serrations to the plane slotted wall increased the energy dissipation by 3 10 for the vertical slw and tslw the hydrodynamic performance reached its minimum value when the chamber width d was approximately one quarter of the incident wavelength at slot ratio g 0 33 using vertical seawalls with serrations or slots was hydrodynamically better than using the sloped pw avoiding the use of seawalls on slope angle of 75 with the seabed was recommended as it recorded the worst hydrodynamic performance compared with the other tested wall slopes for the five proposed seawall shapes predictive formulas were developed for estimating the wave hydrodynamic parameters in front of the seawalls in terms of wave reflection run up and run down by using nonlinear regression analysis these formulas were precisely calibrated by spss based on the experimental modelling results the results of these formulas were relatively consistent with experimental numerical outputs of earlier studies in addition these formulas could accurately predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the tested seawalls of wider applicability in el tinah plain bay in the north east coast of egypt both steeply sloped rsw and tslw were recommended instead of the common traditional types of seawalls e g gently sloping dolos types as the results elucidated a preferable hydrodynamic performance we recommend that this research is beneficial for the design of different coastal features such as energy dissipating type vertical quay walls in ports and harbours sloped seawalls for shore protection from erosion revetments on the sides of navigation channels wave energy
