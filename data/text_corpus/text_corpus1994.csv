same applied water depth in different irrigation event at three growth stages each wss consisted of four different irrigation levels including severe moderate and mild drought stress and a full irrigation in both pot and field experiments severe drought stress under ws1 and ws2 strategies led to a depression in la and tb at tassel s2 and silage harvest s3 stages at each growth stage wpi

grows in the irrigated areas of iran especially in the central parts it has been widely used in both livestock feed and human diet due to various positive characteristics such as high nutrient and dry matter content low buffering capacity and available carbohydrate levels for lactic acid fermentation karakozak and ayasan 2010 shiferaw et al 2011 ibrahim et al 2016 recently water pumping from wells has become costly and progressively more energy consuming on the other hand population growth is increasingly driving food production sectors to the withdrawal of limited water resources dioudis et al 2009 consequently farmers are interested in using localized irrigation systems with higher irrigation efficiency and lower applied water for the unit area besides the heterogeneous distribution of rainfall under rain fed fields and the limited water resources under irrigated fields in arid regions often leads to drought stress negatively affecting crop growth and development blum 2011 de carvalho et al 2011 many studies have revealed that drought stress significantly decreases stomatal conductance leaf area biomass growth and finally the yield production in maize ertek and kara 2013 ucak et al 2016 a major advantage of deficit irrigation management is increasing water use efficiency by slightly reducing applied water while imposing no significant stress on crops farré and faci 2006 kang et al 1998 researchers formulated irrigation management strategies by assessing the sensitivity of the plant to different levels of water stress versus non stress conditions which is recommended for an area with water concerns shi et al 2015 the water yield relationship is usually evaluated by the yield response factor ky which is determined by the slope of relative yield reduction and relative evapotranspiration deficit for the whole duration or a specific developmental stage of the growing season and represents a crop sensitivity to drought vaux and pruitt 1983 the yield response factor for a special crop is non transmissible since it is affected by localized climatic variability soil and water management conditions kuscu and demir 2013 rudnick and irmak 2013 in fact there are many ways to adapt to water constraints ways that increase water use efficiency by using modern irrigation systems for applying the water at desired time place and amount to compensate depleted water from the root zone el hendawy et al 2008 peng et al 2012 consequently utilization of drip irrigation expanded as it provides water directly to the root area and in the same condition provides more net profit than sprinkler and surface irrigation methods bozkurt et al 2006 couto et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the simple irrigation planning in the drip system is the most important advantage for increasing water and fertilizer use efficiency arbat et al 2010 el wahed and ali 2013 zhou et al 2017 different deficit irrigation methods and their effects have been assessed on maize yield by using water use efficiency indices lamm et al 1996 panda et al 2004 li et al 2020 different deficit irrigation methods i e applying less water than the crop need in each irrigation event kiani et al 2016 and increase irrigation intervals and letting delicate more water from the root zone domínguez et al 2012 could have different effects on the extensive root system and maize yield under drip tape irrigation system under deficit irrigation management with reduced applied water the wetting front advance may be limited and consequently results in reduced root growth plant height and plant leaf area elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2007 under deficit irrigation with increased irrigation interval the depth of water in each irrigation is sufficient for the advancement of the wetting front but a large amount of the soil s readily available water will be depleted from the soil profile until the next irrigation increasing the amount of soil water depletion causes water stress to the plant and reduces evapotranspiration and maize yield allen et al 1998 several researchers have studied the effects of the deficit irrigation managements on maize growth indices under surface farré and faci 2009 sprinkler igbadun et al 2008 wen et al 2015 and drip nilahyane et al 2018 irrigation systems their results showed that in the surface and sprinkler irrigation systems the mild deficit irrigation level gheysari et al 2009 and in the surface drip irrigation system the full irrigation level had the highest water use efficiency in maize zou et al 2020 in arid and semi arid climates deficit irrigation management is an important strategy for increasing the yield production and water use efficiency surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems are suitable systems for crop production with high water use efficiency van donk et al 2013 lamm 2016 liu et al 2021 due to reducing deep percolation and runoff losses and eliminating wind drift and evaporation losses sadeghi et al 2015 for row crops however the effect of type of deficit irrigation management on plant growth yield indices and water use efficiency under drip tape irrigation system which limits the wetting front has not been investigated in maize gheysari et al 2017 investigated the effects of two different irrigation managements on root production and silage maize yield under pot experiments in an arid area however it is important to confirm their findings under the field condition in this study we want to answer this question with field data under drip tape irrigation dti system as it is the common irrigation system in arid and semi arid environments like iran with water shortage annual precipitation 150 mm year dti has a high capability for low water application under different deficit irrigation managements so the results of this study could be useful for researchers engineers and farmers for using directly in the farms this study was aimed to 1 assess the response of silage maize hybrid 704 single cross at different growth stages to varied water stress strategies in a semi arid region under field conditions via drip tape irrigation system and pot experiments and 2 determine the relationship between applied water and above ground biomass in different wsss at both experiments and compare pot and field results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description this

the combination of 3 growth stages 4 irrigation levels 3 replications for this purpose three seeds hybrid 704 single cross were planted in polyethylene pot 0 8 m depth and 0 39 m diameter filled with clay loam soil in may 2009 and 2010 table 2 ten days after planting the robust plant in each pot was kept for evaluation and others were removed it should be noted that in each year the plants were grown outside from june 25 to sep 26 2009 and from 6 july to oct 10 2010 under the natural condition daily temperatures of 18 28 c and photoperiod of 14 h to limit soil warming due to light radiation the pots were insulated with a series of white foam sheets gheysari et al 2017 2 2 2 field experiment silage maize hybrid sc 704 was planted at the field according to the split split plot in a complete block designed with three replications in june 2017 plants were grown under full irrigation until the 8 leaf stage then assessed under two water stress strategy wss ws1 and ws2 as main plot applied at three different maize growth stages as sup plot 12 leaves stage s1 tasseling s2 and silage harvest stage s3 with four irrigation levels severe t1 moderate t2 mild t3 and full irrigation t4 as sub sub plot as well the pot experiment every plot was 12 25 m2 and contained 95 plants planted in five rows 0 70 cm apart in order to prevent the marginal and wind effects two rows of maize were planted along four sides of the experimental field which were irrigated separately a drip tape irrigation system was used to manage irrigation a 16 mm drip tape eurodrip s a inc greece with a 20 centimeter dripper apart and 1 3 l h 1 flow rate for each dripper used for each crop row 2 3 crop evapotranspiration reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the amount of et0 was determined by using daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunny hours that were received from the najafabad meteorological station as part of the iranian meteorological organization http www weather ir crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using et0 and modified crop coefficient kc provided by allen et al 1998 the modified crop coefficient under drip tape irrigation system for experimental site for initial mid and late stages were 0 38 1 14 and 0 73 respectively 2 4 water stress strategies 2 4 1 different applied water depth ws1 for ws1 strategy the irrigation time in the full irrigation level was determined based on soil moisture content threshold θmad that was calculated using eq 1 with management allowable deficit mad of 0 55 allen et al 1998 as follows 1 θ 0 55 θ fc θ fc θ pwp 0 55 where θ0 55 is the volumetric soil moisture content in the root zone at irrigation time soil moisture content threshold for mad of 0 55 cm3 cm 3 θfc is the volumetric soil moisture content at the field capacity cm3 cm 3 and θpwp is the volumetric soil moisture content at the permanent wilting point cm3 cm 3 all water stress levels were irrigated at the same time as full irrigation when the average soil moisture content in the root zone θi in full irrigation level reached θ0 55 0 05 θ0 55 all irrigation levels irrigated at the same time net irrigation depth for full irrigation dn 0 55 was calculated as follows 2 d n 0 55 θ fc θ 0 55 z r 3 d g 0 55 d n 0 55 e a where dn

0 035 0 65 0 0325 0 55 0 0275 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil moisture measurement soil moisture was derived from measurements of soil water potential made with tensiometers manufactured by soilmoisture equipment co usa in the pot experiment the location of tensiometers was 7 cm apart from the plant at depth of 15 25 35 50 cm in the field experiment the location of tensiometers was selected at a distance of 15 cm between two plants amiri et al 2021 and installed in a depth of 20 and 40 cm the 1 inch auger was used for direct soil moisture measurement in the root depth during the growing season therefore soil moisture fluctuation in full irrigation treatment was monitored by tensiometers when the soil matric pressure ranged between 40 and 50kpa in 2009 and 2010 and between 50 and 55kpa in 2017 deficit moisture was compensated by irrigation for each year the soil matric suction measured by the tensiometers in the range of 0 80kpa was converted to soil water content using the procedures described by smajstrla and harrison 2011 the conversion equations were as follows 6 θ m 2009 4 97 ln c 35 45 7 θ m 2010 6 80 ln c 37 76 8 θ v 2017 6 583 ln c 46 017 where θ m is gravimetric soil water content θ v is volumetric soil water content and c is the negative pressure kpa measured by the tensiometers 2 5 2 aboveground crop development in each year during the growing season morphological characteristics including total aboveground biomass tb and leaf area la were measured at different physiological growth stages the stages consisted of 12 leaf s1 tasseling s2 and silage stage s3 which occurred at 46 63 and 91 days after planting dap in 2009 at 44 68 and 97 dap in 2010 and at 51 66 and 94 dap in 2017 respectively at each stage of sampling in the pot experiment one pot from each replication was omitted for each irrigation treatment totally it will be 3 pots from three replications at each sampling date in the field experiment three maize bushes were scraped and the distance between those was measured to calculate yield per unit area and leaf area index for all three replicates la was measured by a leaf area meter mk2 delta t devicesltd cambridge uk in 2009 and 2010 in 2017 the leaf area was obtained by measuring the broadest leaf cross section and leaf length and constant coefficient of 0 73 daughtry and hollinger 1984 as follows 9 l a 0 73 l w m where la is the leaf area l is the leaf length and w m is the maximum leaf width leaf area index lai was calculated from la measurements the dry weight of the aboveground tb was measured after drying the plant samples containing the leaves stems and ears at 72 c for 48 h 2 5 3 irrigation water productivity and response factor to irrigation irrigation water productivity was calculated as fernández et al 2020 10 wp i tdmp aw yield response factor ky to water stress was calculated as doorenbos and kassam 1979 11 1 y i y m k y 1 a w i a w m where tdmp is total dry matter produced kgha 1 y is tdmp kgha 1 and aw is a term of gross applied water depth mm at different sampling stages in this study there was no precipitation during the growing seasons sub indent i represents the experimental treatment and sub indent m represent the complete irrigation treatment without stress to calculate ky la ky tb coefficients y was replaced by la and tb in eq 11 growing degree days ggd were computed using the following equation kiniry 1991 12 gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t b i where tmax and tmin are maximum and minimum daily air temperature respectively tb is crop base temperature for maize equal 8 c i is the indicator of days 2 6 statistical analysis the normality test of the data was performed by the kolmogorov smirnov test and was subjected to analysis of variance using proc glm of sas sas institute 2001 treatment means in each water stress strategy ws1 and ws2 were compared using duncan s multiple test range p 0 05 separately graphs were illustrated using the mstat c and sigmaplot 12 0 software 3 results ans discussion 3 1 maize evapotranspiration and applied water the cumulative amount of estimated et0 prior to the silage harvest stage s3 were 659 607 and 666 mm and the growing degree day gdd to complete the plant growth process until the s3 was 1832 1734 and 1727 c in 2009 2010 and 2017 respectively table 3 the water requirement of the maize plant considerably increased from s1 to s3 under all irrigation treatments in both pot and field experiments it varied between 262 and 1068 mm in pot experiment and 267 626 mm in field experiment table 3 the higher values of applied water in the pot experiment were due to the ambient and microclimate effect in the pot experiment shojaei et al 2020 and also drained water during first and second irrigations in the pots experiment in the field experiment large area of maize was planted in the field and the maize s roots were in the soil however in the pot experiment the site was above the ground level and the microclimatic effects had an effect on increasing the air temperature also there was poor vegetation around this site and the relative humidity was lower therefore these two factors lead to increasing the maize s water requirement the effect of microclimate on maize evapotranspiration under pot experiment have been described by gheysari et al 2017 the higher values of applied water at the s3 stage were a result of the greater plant cover and higher transpiration which confirms the previous findings of udom bassey and kamalu 2019 in the maize plant it demonstrates that the amount of applied water in the plant depends on the duration of growth and development stages of the crop the evaporative demand of the environment and the planting density wright and bell 1992 allen et al 1998 3 2 leaf area total biomass and leaf area index analysis of variance indicated that water stress strategy wss growth stage s and irrigation treatment t had significant effects on all measured traits in both pot and field experiments tables s2 and s3 the wss s wss t s t interaction effects and the triple interaction of wss t s were also significant for all evaluated traits in both pot and field experiments tables s2 and s3 the mean comparison of measured traits at different irrigation treatments and each growth stage in pot and field experiments are presented in tables 4 and 5 results revealed that in the pot experiment the severe drought stress treatment under both ws1 and ws2 strategies significantly decreased la and tb of maize compared to the full irrigation level in both s2 and s3 stages table 4 however the differences in the extent of decrease were greater under the pot experiment than the field experiment table 4 similarly leaf area index lai la and tb were decreased under severe drought stress conditions in both ws1 and ws2 compared to the full irrigation in all three growth stages at field experiment tables 4 and 5 however the effects of moderate t2 and mild t3 drought stress on measured traits at different growth stages were variable in both ws1 and ws2 strategies tables 4 and 5 in some cases we did not find a significant difference between the effects of mild and moderate drought stress on measured traits at special growth stages and traits were affected by these two levels of deficit irrigations tables 4 and 5 it has been demonstrated that the effects of drought stress on plants and their performance strongly interact with crop species growth stage soil type fertility irrigation management duration and intensity of deficit irrigation and other environmental variables anastasi et al 2010 consistent with our findings some previous studies have reported the reduction of la lai and tb in maize plant due to an increase in the water stress intensity especially at the final growth stages farré and faci 2009 stone et al 2001 these negative effects are evidently due to stomatal closure and rolling leaves in response to low soil moisture which decreases the intake of co2 and as a result a decline in photosynthesis net assimilation and finally biomass allocation in fig 1 tb is plotted against the applied water at each irrigation strategy ws1 and ws2 separately in general we found a linear relationship between tb and applied water at ws1 and ws2 in both experiments but the slope of the line changes with the type of irrigation management fig 1 in the pot experiment at the silage harvest stage the average tb during 2009 and 2010 diminished by 36 27 and 17 due to decreasing the applied water from t4 to t1 t2 and t3 by 35 23 and 11 under ws1 strategy respectively table 4 while under the ws2 strategy tb was reduced by 60 48 and 20 due to decreasing the applied water by 36 38 and 22 respectively table 4 reducing the applied water from t4 to t1 t2 and t3 by 28 17 and 9 under the ws1 strategy at field experiment 2017 caused a significant reduction of tb by 37 17 and 6 respectively table 4 however under the ws2 strategy decreasing about 28 22 and 14 of applied water in comparison with full irrigation led to a reduction of tb by 42 40 and 28 respectively table 4 these results indicated that the reduction in applied water and consequently in tb under ws2 strategy was more than ws1 in both pot and field experiments therefore the growth rate and yield performance per unit of water used are higher at ws1 compared to ws2 in different research studies it has been shown that the relationship between yield production and applied water can be linear or nonlinear the nonlinear relationships are somewhat because the whole water is not entirely used during et and some part of that is lost or the fraction of et that does not contribute to plant growth varies throughout the crop life cycle fereres and soriano 2007 similar to our results several researchers have reported a linear relationship between yield and applied water for maize and other crop species ferreira and goncalves 2007 yazar et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 in contrast kipkorir et al 2002 reported a curvilinear relationship between yield and applied water for maize grown in kenya 3 3 irrigation water productivity the calculated irrigation water productivity wpi at different irrigation treatments and each growth stage in both wss s ws1 and ws2 strategy is presented in table 5 results show that wpi was affected by irrigation levels and growth stage so that from s1 to s3 wpi increased for all irrigation treatments in both wss s besides at each growth stage wpi increased from t1 to t4 treatments in both wss s table 5 the values of wpi for t4 treatment under ws1 were 2 47 3 36 and 3 32 kg m 3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively the corresponding values under ws2 were 2 15 2 80 3 07 kg m 3 these results demonstrated that ws1 had higher wpi compared to ws2 table 5 the wpi values in the current study are in the range reported by karimi and gomrokchi 2011 2 43 4 27 kg m 3 and djaman and irmak 2012 2 97 4 87 kg m 3 in maize plant many studies across different plant species revealed that increasing the applied irrigation quantities to full irrigation level significantly increased wpi and finally the yield performance dagdelen et al 2006 kiziloglu et al 2009 the declining wpi under drought stress condition in this study also supported by the findings of rodrigues et al 2013 in maize plants that reported severe water stress under drip irrigation system certainly reduced wpi of plant irrespective of growth stages 3 4 response factor to water stress ky the calculated response factor to water stress ky for la ky la and tb ky tb in pot and field experiments at the silage stage s3 under ws1 and ws2 are given in table 6 the average of ky tb in pot experiment based on the mean of 2 years 2009 and 2010 was 1 07 0 04 for ws1 and 1 73 0 52 for ws2 in the field experiment under the drip tape irrigation system the corresponding values were 1 20 and 1 66 respectively table 6 this indicated that tb of maize plant were 1 6 and 1 38 times more sensitive to decline irrigation under ws2 compared to the ws1 in pot and field experiments respectively in the pot experiment the average of ky la was 0 29 0 05 and 0 69 0 12 for ws1 and ws2 respectively in the field experiment it was 0 51 for ws1 and 1 32 for ws2 table 6 this is demonstrating that la was nearly twice as sensitive to water stress under ws2 compared to ws1 in both experiments based on 3 years study in different soil texture there was difference between the ky of la and tb values from the field and pot experiments but the trend was nearly the same in both field and pot experiments fig 2 in general we concluded that ws2 had higher values of ky for la and tb compared to ws1 which indicates that ws1 can be employed in the study location as an effective and practical water management strategy for maize plants fig 2 also it means that la and tb were considerably more sensitive to decline in irrigation under ws2 compared to ws1 in both pot and field experiments however nearly the same trend was observed in two different experiments in response to wss s but the extent of the sensitivity was greater in the pot experiment than in the field experiment it has been demonstrated that the range of values for ky strongly differed based on crop species climate parameters soil characteristics fertilizer plant water consumptions and irrigation program gheysari et al 2015 steduto et al 2012 payero et al 2008 in our study we also show that not only the type of irrigation strategy wss but also the type of experiments pot or field affects ky values for maize restriction of root development space in pot experiment the possibility of preferential water flow from the potting wall non uniform density of soil in the pots putting pots on the ground which increased the range of potting soil temperature changes through the day and night due to the air temperature and direct sunlight gheysari et al 2010 the effect of microclimate due to the lack of vegetation around the pots gheysari et al 2017 are some of the factors that can make the difference between the pot and field experiments in the current study the range of values of ky approximately agreed with the range of ky values reported by kirnak et al 2003 0 77 0 81 andrioli and sentelhas 2009 0 6 1 5 and djaman et al 2013 1 65 2 85 in maize plant under different areas and drought stress conditions they also showed that the increase of drought stress was associated with the increase of ky value 4 conclusion we found that the peak period of applied water was during yield formation silage stage of maize in both pot and field experiments under two water stress strategies ws1 and ws2 additionally a positive and linear relationship was observed between total above ground biomass tb and applied water at ws1 and ws2 in both experiments but the yield performance per unit of water used was higher at ws1 than ws2 in the pot experiment severe drought stress under both ws1 and ws2 strategies had an adverse effect on tb and leaf area la at tasseling s2 and silage harvest s3 stages meanwhile in the field experiment the same irrigation treatment had negative effects on tb la leaf area index lai and irrigation water productivity wpi at all growth stages at each growth stage wpi values decreased with increasing water deficit levels in both wss s and experiments however in general the same trend was observed for the effects of ws1 and ws2 strategies in silage maize at different growth stages in both pot and field experiments the response factor to water stress ky was affected by the type of irrigation strategy wss and the type of experiment the ky values for la and tb were higher under ws2 than ws1 in both pot and field experiments but the extent of the increase was higher in the pot experiment compared to the field experiment these results indicated that ws1 can be employed as an effective and practical deficit irrigation management in both experimental

has become costly and progressively more energy consuming on the other hand population growth is increasingly driving food production sectors to the withdrawal of limited water resources dioudis et al 2009 consequently farmers are interested in using localized irrigation systems with higher irrigation efficiency and lower applied water for the unit area besides the heterogeneous distribution of rainfall under rain fed fields and the limited water resources under irrigated fields in arid regions often leads to drought stress negatively affecting crop growth and development blum 2011 de carvalho et al 2011 many studies have revealed that drought stress significantly decreases stomatal conductance leaf area biomass growth and finally the yield production in maize ertek and kara 2013 ucak et al 2016 a major advantage of deficit irrigation management is increasing water use efficiency by slightly reducing applied water while imposing no significant stress on crops farré and faci 2006 kang et al 1998 researchers formulated irrigation management strategies by assessing the sensitivity of the plant to different levels of water stress versus non stress conditions which is recommended for an area with water concerns shi et al 2015 the water yield relationship is usually evaluated by the yield response factor ky which is determined by the slope of relative yield reduction and relative evapotranspiration deficit for the whole duration or a specific developmental stage of the growing season and represents a crop sensitivity to drought vaux and pruitt 1983 the yield response factor for a special crop is non transmissible since it is affected by localized climatic variability soil and water management conditions kuscu and demir 2013 rudnick and irmak 2013 in fact there are many ways to adapt to water constraints ways that increase water use efficiency by using modern irrigation systems for applying the water at desired time place and amount to compensate depleted water from the root zone el hendawy et al 2008 peng et al 2012 consequently utilization of drip irrigation expanded as it provides water directly to the root area and in the same condition provides more net profit than sprinkler and surface irrigation methods bozkurt et al 2006 couto et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the simple irrigation planning in the drip system is the most important advantage for increasing water and fertilizer use efficiency arbat et al 2010 el wahed and ali 2013 zhou et al 2017 different deficit irrigation methods and their effects have been assessed on maize yield by using water use efficiency indices lamm et al 1996 panda et al 2004 li et al 2020 different deficit irrigation methods i e applying less water than the crop need in each irrigation event kiani et al 2016 and increase irrigation intervals and letting delicate more water from the root zone domínguez et al 2012 could have different effects on the extensive root system and maize yield under drip tape irrigation system under deficit irrigation management with reduced applied water the wetting front advance may be limited and consequently results in reduced root growth plant height and plant leaf area elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2007 under deficit irrigation with increased irrigation interval the depth of water in each irrigation is sufficient for the advancement of the wetting front but a large amount of the soil s readily available water will be depleted from the soil profile until the next irrigation increasing the amount of soil water depletion causes water stress to the plant and reduces evapotranspiration and maize yield allen et al 1998 several researchers have studied the effects of the deficit irrigation managements on maize growth indices under surface farré and faci 2009 sprinkler igbadun et al 2008 wen et al 2015 and drip nilahyane et al 2018 irrigation systems their results showed that in the surface and sprinkler irrigation systems the mild deficit irrigation level gheysari et al 2009 and in the surface drip irrigation system the full irrigation level had the highest water use efficiency in maize zou et al 2020 in arid and semi arid climates deficit irrigation management is an important strategy for increasing the yield production and water use efficiency surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems are suitable systems for crop production with high water use efficiency van donk et al 2013 lamm 2016 liu et al 2021 due to reducing deep percolation and runoff losses and eliminating wind drift and evaporation losses sadeghi et al 2015 for row crops however the effect of type of deficit irrigation management on plant growth yield indices and water use efficiency under drip tape irrigation system which limits the wetting front has not been investigated in maize gheysari et al 2017 investigated the effects of two different irrigation managements on root production and silage maize yield under pot experiments in an arid area however it is important to confirm their findings under the field condition in this study we want to answer this question with field data under drip tape irrigation dti system as it is the common irrigation system in arid and semi arid environments like iran with water shortage annual precipitation 150 mm year dti has a high capability for low water application under different deficit irrigation managements so the results of this study could be useful for researchers engineers and farmers for using directly in the farms this study was aimed to 1 assess the response of silage maize hybrid 704 single cross at different growth stages to varied water stress strategies in a semi arid region under field conditions via drip tape irrigation system and pot experiments and 2 determine the relationship between applied water and above ground biomass in different wsss at both experiments and compare pot and field results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description this

clay loam soil in may 2009 and 2010 table 2 ten days after planting the robust plant in each pot was kept for evaluation and others were removed it should be noted that in each year the plants were grown outside from june 25 to sep 26 2009 and from 6 july to oct 10 2010 under the natural condition daily temperatures of 18 28 c and photoperiod of 14 h to limit soil warming due to light radiation the pots were insulated with a series of white foam sheets gheysari et al 2017 2 2 2 field experiment silage maize hybrid sc 704 was planted at the field according to the split split plot in a complete block designed with three replications in june 2017 plants were grown under full irrigation until the 8 leaf stage then assessed under two water stress strategy wss ws1 and ws2 as main plot

as sub sub plot as well the pot experiment every plot was 12 25 m2 and contained 95 plants planted in five rows 0 70 cm apart in order to prevent the marginal and wind effects two rows of maize were planted along four sides of the experimental field which were irrigated separately a drip tape irrigation system was used to manage irrigation a 16 mm drip tape eurodrip s a inc greece with a 20 centimeter dripper apart and 1 3 l h 1 flow rate for each dripper used for each crop row 2 3 crop evapotranspiration reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the amount of et0 was determined by using daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunny hours that were received from the najafabad meteorological station as part of the iranian meteorological organization http www weather ir crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using et0 and modified crop coefficient kc provided by allen et al 1998 the modified crop coefficient under drip tape irrigation system for experimental site for initial mid and late stages were 0 38 1 14 and 0 73 respectively 2 4 water stress strategies 2 4 1 different applied water depth ws1 for ws1 strategy the irrigation time in the full irrigation level was determined based on soil moisture content threshold θmad that was calculated using eq 1 with management allowable deficit mad of 0 55 allen et al 1998 as follows 1 θ 0 55 θ fc θ fc θ pwp 0 55 where θ0 55 is the volumetric soil moisture content in the root zone at irrigation time soil moisture content threshold for mad of 0 55 cm3 cm 3 θfc is the volumetric soil moisture content at the field capacity cm3 cm 3 and θpwp is the volumetric soil moisture content at the permanent wilting point cm3 cm 3 all water stress levels were irrigated at the same time as full irrigation when the average soil moisture content in the root zone θi in full irrigation level reached θ0 55 0 05 θ0 55 all irrigation levels irrigated at the same time net irrigation depth for full irrigation dn 0 55 was calculated as follows 2 d n 0 55 θ fc θ 0 55 z r 3 d g 0 55 d n 0 55 e a where dn 0 55 is net irrigation depth for no water stress level cm and zr is root zone depth irrigation system efficiency ea for pot and field experiments was 100 and 92 respectively which was used to calculate the gross irrigation water depth dg 0 55 irrigation depth for severe t1 moderate t2 and mild t3 stress treatments were 0 72 0 83 and 0 91 of dg 0 55 respectively 2 4 2 different irrigation event ws2 for the ws2 strategy irrigation depth for all irrigation levels was the same and equal to dn 0 55 however irrigation interval were varied and controlled by soil moisture content threshold θmad the θmad for t1 t2 t3 and t4 stress levels was θ0 85 θ0 70 θ0 65 and θ0 55 respectively in other words t1 t2 t3 and t4 levels irrigated when σetc between two irrigations reached dt 0 85 dt 0 70

0 035 0 65 0 0325 0 55 0 0275 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil moisture measurement soil moisture was derived from measurements of soil water potential made with tensiometers manufactured by soilmoisture equipment co usa in the pot experiment the location of tensiometers was 7 cm apart from the plant at depth of 15 25 35 50 cm in the field experiment the location of tensiometers was selected at a distance of 15 cm between two plants amiri et al 2021 and installed in a depth of 20 and 40 cm the 1 inch auger was used for direct soil moisture measurement in the root depth during the growing season therefore soil moisture fluctuation in full irrigation treatment was monitored by tensiometers when the soil matric pressure ranged between 40 and 50kpa in 2009 and 2010 and between 50 and 55kpa in 2017 deficit moisture was compensated by irrigation for each year the soil matric suction measured by the tensiometers in the range of 0 80kpa was converted to soil water content using the procedures described by smajstrla and harrison 2011 the conversion equations were as follows 6 θ m 2009 4 97 ln c 35 45 7 θ m 2010 6 80 ln c 37 76 8 θ v 2017 6 583 ln c 46 017 where θ m is gravimetric soil water content θ v is volumetric soil water content and c is the negative pressure kpa measured by the tensiometers 2 5 2 aboveground crop development in each year during the growing season morphological characteristics including total aboveground biomass tb and leaf area la were measured at different physiological growth stages the stages consisted of 12 leaf s1 tasseling s2 and silage stage s3 which occurred at 46 63 and 91 days after planting dap in 2009 at 44 68 and 97 dap in 2010 and at 51 66 and 94 dap in 2017 respectively at each stage of sampling in the pot experiment one pot from each replication was omitted for each irrigation treatment totally it will be 3 pots from three replications at each sampling date in the field experiment three maize bushes were scraped and the distance between those was measured to calculate yield per unit area and leaf area index for all three replicates la was measured by a leaf area meter mk2 delta t devicesltd cambridge uk in 2009 and 2010 in 2017 the leaf area was obtained by measuring the broadest leaf cross section and leaf length and constant coefficient of 0 73 daughtry and hollinger 1984 as follows 9 l a 0 73 l w m where la is the leaf area l is the leaf length and w m is the maximum leaf width leaf area index lai was calculated from la measurements the dry weight of the aboveground tb was measured after drying the plant samples containing the leaves stems and ears at 72 c for 48 h 2 5 3 irrigation water productivity and response factor to irrigation irrigation water productivity was calculated as fernández et al 2020 10 wp i tdmp aw yield response factor ky to water stress was calculated as doorenbos and kassam 1979 11 1 y i y m k y 1 a w i a w m where tdmp is total dry matter produced kgha 1 y is tdmp kgha 1 and aw is a term of gross applied water depth mm at different sampling stages in this study there was no precipitation during the growing seasons sub indent i represents the experimental treatment and sub indent m represent the complete irrigation treatment without stress to calculate ky la ky tb coefficients y was replaced by la and tb in eq 11 growing degree days ggd were computed using the following equation kiniry 1991 12 gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t b i where tmax and tmin are maximum and minimum daily air temperature respectively tb is crop base temperature for maize equal 8 c i is the indicator of days 2 6 statistical analysis the normality test of the data was performed by the kolmogorov smirnov test and was subjected to analysis of variance using proc glm of sas sas institute 2001 treatment means in each water stress strategy ws1 and ws2 were compared using duncan s multiple test range p 0 05 separately graphs were illustrated using the mstat c and sigmaplot 12 0 software 3 results ans discussion 3 1 maize evapotranspiration and applied water the cumulative amount of estimated et0 prior to the silage harvest stage s3 were 659 607 and 666 mm and the growing degree day gdd to complete the plant growth process until the s3 was 1832 1734 and 1727 c in 2009 2010 and 2017 respectively table 3 the water requirement of the maize plant considerably increased from s1 to s3 under all irrigation treatments in both pot and field experiments it varied between 262 and 1068 mm in pot experiment and 267 626 mm in field experiment table 3 the higher values of applied water in the pot experiment were due to the ambient and microclimate effect in the pot experiment shojaei et al 2020 and also drained water during first and second irrigations in the pots experiment in the field experiment large area of maize was planted in the field and the maize s roots were in the soil however in the pot experiment the site was above the ground level and the microclimatic effects had an effect on increasing the air temperature also there was poor vegetation around this site and the relative humidity was lower therefore these two factors lead to increasing the maize s water requirement the effect of microclimate on maize evapotranspiration under pot experiment have been described by gheysari et al 2017 the higher values of applied water at the s3 stage were a result of the greater plant cover and higher transpiration which confirms the previous findings of udom bassey and kamalu 2019 in the maize plant it demonstrates that the amount of applied water in the plant depends on the duration of growth and development stages of the crop the evaporative demand of the environment and the planting density wright and bell 1992 allen et al 1998 3 2 leaf area total biomass and leaf area index analysis of variance indicated that water stress strategy wss growth stage s and irrigation treatment t had significant effects on all measured traits in both pot and field experiments tables s2 and s3 the wss s wss t s t interaction effects and the triple interaction of wss t s were also significant for all evaluated traits in both pot and field experiments tables s2 and s3 the mean comparison of measured traits at different irrigation treatments and each growth stage in pot and field experiments are presented in tables 4 and 5 results revealed that in the pot experiment the severe drought stress treatment under both ws1 and ws2 strategies significantly decreased la and tb of maize compared to the full irrigation level in both s2 and s3 stages table 4 however the differences in the extent of decrease were greater under the pot experiment than the field experiment table 4 similarly leaf area index lai la and tb were decreased under severe drought stress conditions in both ws1 and ws2 compared to the full irrigation in all three growth stages at field experiment tables 4 and 5 however the effects of moderate t2 and mild t3 drought stress on measured traits at different growth stages were variable in both ws1 and ws2 strategies tables 4 and 5 in some cases we did not find a significant difference between the effects of mild and moderate drought stress on measured traits at special growth stages and traits were affected by these two levels of deficit irrigations tables 4 and 5 it has been demonstrated that the effects of drought stress on plants and their performance strongly interact with crop species growth stage soil type fertility irrigation management duration and intensity of deficit irrigation and other environmental variables anastasi et al 2010 consistent with our findings some previous studies have reported the reduction of la lai and tb in maize plant due to an increase in the water stress intensity especially at the final growth stages farré and faci 2009 stone et al 2001 these negative effects are evidently due to stomatal closure and rolling leaves in response to low soil moisture which decreases the intake of co2 and as a result a decline in photosynthesis net assimilation and finally biomass allocation in fig 1 tb is plotted against the applied water at each irrigation strategy ws1 and ws2 separately in general we found a linear relationship between tb and applied water at ws1 and ws2 in both experiments but the slope of the line changes with the type of irrigation management fig 1 in the pot experiment at the silage harvest stage the average tb during 2009 and 2010 diminished by 36 27 and 17 due to decreasing the applied water from t4 to t1 t2 and t3 by 35 23 and 11 under ws1 strategy respectively table 4 while under the ws2 strategy tb was reduced by 60 48 and 20 due to decreasing the applied water by 36 38 and 22 respectively table 4 reducing the applied water from t4 to t1 t2 and t3 by 28 17 and 9 under the ws1 strategy at field experiment 2017 caused a significant reduction of tb by 37 17 and 6 respectively table 4 however under the ws2 strategy decreasing about 28 22 and 14 of applied water in comparison with full irrigation led to a reduction of tb by 42 40 and 28 respectively table 4 these results indicated that the reduction in applied water and consequently in tb under ws2 strategy was more than ws1 in both pot and field experiments therefore the growth rate and yield performance per unit of water used are higher at ws1 compared to ws2 in different research studies it has been shown that the relationship between yield production and applied water can be linear or nonlinear the nonlinear relationships are somewhat because the whole water is not entirely used during et and some part of that is lost or the fraction of et that does not contribute to plant growth varies throughout the crop life cycle fereres and soriano 2007 similar to our results several researchers have reported a linear relationship between yield and applied water for maize and other crop species ferreira and goncalves 2007 yazar et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 in contrast kipkorir et al 2002 reported a curvilinear relationship between yield and applied water for maize grown in kenya 3 3 irrigation water productivity the calculated irrigation water productivity wpi at different irrigation treatments and each growth stage in both wss s ws1 and ws2 strategy is presented in table 5 results show that wpi was affected by irrigation levels and growth stage so that from s1 to s3 wpi increased for all irrigation treatments in both wss s besides at each growth stage wpi increased from t1 to t4 treatments in both wss s table 5 the values of wpi for t4 treatment under ws1 were 2 47 3 36 and 3 32 kg m 3 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively the corresponding values under ws2 were 2 15 2 80 3 07 kg m 3 these results demonstrated that ws1 had higher wpi compared to ws2 table 5 the wpi values in the current study are in the range reported by karimi and gomrokchi 2011 2 43 4 27 kg m 3 and djaman and irmak 2012 2 97 4 87 kg m 3 in maize plant many studies across different plant species revealed that increasing the applied irrigation quantities to full irrigation level significantly increased wpi and finally the yield performance dagdelen et al 2006 kiziloglu et al 2009 the declining wpi under drought stress condition in this study also supported by the findings of rodrigues et al 2013 in maize plants that reported severe water stress under drip irrigation system certainly reduced wpi of plant irrespective of growth stages 3 4 response factor to water stress ky the calculated response factor to water stress ky for la ky la and tb ky tb in pot and field experiments at the silage stage s3 under ws1 and ws2 are given in table 6 the average of ky tb in pot experiment based on the mean of 2 years 2009 and 2010 was 1 07 0 04 for ws1 and 1 73 0 52 for ws2 in the field experiment under the drip tape irrigation system the corresponding values were 1 20 and 1 66 respectively table 6 this indicated that tb of maize plant were 1 6 and 1 38 times more sensitive to decline irrigation under ws2 compared to the ws1 in pot and field experiments respectively in the pot experiment the average of ky la was 0 29 0 05 and 0 69 0 12 for ws1 and ws2 respectively in the field experiment it was 0 51 for ws1 and 1 32 for ws2 table 6 this is demonstrating that la was nearly twice as sensitive to water stress under ws2 compared to ws1 in both experiments based on 3 years study in different soil texture there was difference between the ky of la and tb values from the field and pot experiments but the trend was nearly the same in both field and pot experiments fig 2 in general we concluded that ws2 had higher values of ky for la and tb compared to ws1 which indicates that ws1 can be employed in the study location as an effective and practical water management strategy for maize plants fig 2 also it means that la and tb were considerably more sensitive to decline in irrigation under ws2 compared to ws1 in both pot and field experiments however nearly the same trend was observed in two different experiments in response to wss s but the extent of the sensitivity was greater in the pot experiment than in the field experiment it has been demonstrated that the range of values for ky strongly differed based on crop species climate parameters soil characteristics fertilizer plant water consumptions and irrigation program gheysari et al 2015 steduto et al 2012 payero et al 2008 in our study we also show that not only the type of irrigation strategy wss but also the type of experiments pot or field affects ky values for maize restriction of root development space in pot experiment the possibility of preferential water flow from the potting wall non uniform density of soil in the pots putting pots on the ground which increased the range of potting soil temperature changes through the day and night due to the air temperature and direct sunlight gheysari et al 2010 the effect of microclimate due to the lack of vegetation around the pots gheysari et al 2017 are some of the factors that can make the difference between the pot and field experiments in the current study the range of values of ky approximately agreed with the range of ky values reported by kirnak et al 2003 0 77 0 81 andrioli and sentelhas 2009 0 6 1 5 and djaman et al 2013 1 65 2 85 in maize plant under different areas and drought stress conditions they also showed that the increase of drought stress was associated with the increase of ky value 4 conclusion we found that the peak period of applied water was during yield formation silage stage of maize in both pot and field experiments under two water stress strategies ws1 and ws2 additionally a positive and linear relationship was observed between total above ground biomass tb and applied water at ws1 and ws2 in both experiments but the yield performance per unit of water used was higher at ws1 than ws2 in the pot experiment severe drought stress under both ws1 and ws2 strategies had an adverse effect on tb and leaf area la at tasseling s2 and silage harvest s3 stages meanwhile in the field experiment the same irrigation treatment had negative effects on tb la leaf area index lai and irrigation water productivity wpi at all growth stages at each growth stage wpi values decreased with increasing water deficit levels in both wss s and experiments however in general the same trend was observed for the effects of ws1 and ws2 strategies in silage maize at different growth stages in both pot and field experiments the response factor to water stress ky was affected by the type of irrigation strategy wss and the type of experiment the ky values for la and tb were higher under ws2 than ws1 in both pot and field experiments but the extent of the increase was higher in the pot experiment compared to the field experiment these results indicated that ws1 can be employed as an effective and practical deficit irrigation management in both experimental

tsakmakis et al 2017 2019 zhou et al 2018 one of the key parameters that is broadly used by researches as a mean to assess the crop models performance is the plants canopy cover the latter plays a

advanced tools like the bvnet tool battude et al 2017 or other artificial neural network algorithms marta et al 2019 these tools are data demanding and require as inputs the visible spectral bands of

ndvi s calculation formula is just the quotient of the ni red bands difference against ni red bands sum de la casa et al 2014 while ndvi has been successively coupled with a number of crop models in the past maas 1988 moriondo et al 2007 zeleke 2019 there are scarce works coupling ndvi with fao aquacrop model and specifically maize crop the main objectives of this study are a to establish a correlation relationship between field measured cc and the high resolution sentinel 2 ndvi product b integrating the cc ndvi relationship on sentinel 2 imagery products to calculate field spatial cc variability and temporal cc changes throughout maize cultivation season c to assess aquacrop model capacity to simulate maize growing cycle under different weather conditions and soil types and d to evaluate the potency of satellite acquired cc time series to improve aquacrop performance in terms of simulating canopy cover soil water content final biomass and corn yield in operational field monitoring experiments were conducted in large commercial farms of northern and central greece in which operational precision irrigation was implemented 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data the experimental data was collected from four commercial fields that were cultivated with maize in northern and central greece in 2018 2019 and 2020 the continuous crop rotation practice that is implemented by the farmers in the study areas renders the multiyear maize monitoring on the same field not feasible consequently in northern greece field 1 lat 41 069243 long 25 057557 alt 6 m was monitored in 2018 field 2 lat 41 058449 long 25 000202 alt 19 m in 2019 and field 3 lat 41 064463 long 24 991879 alt 35 m in 2020 while in central greece field 4 lat 39 546981 long 22 688011 alt 47 m was monitored in 2020 all fields corresponded to one irrigation block with fields 1 2 and 3 covering an area of 1 ha having a rectangular shape with width ranging from 53 to 58 m and length between 170 and 190 m on the other hand field 4 had a total area of 2 ha rectangular shape with a width and length equal to 100 m and 200 m respectively this difference in irrigation block size is due to the differences in the capacity of the irrigation systems that are used by the farmers in northern and central greece thus fields 1 2 and 3 were irrigated with a sprinkler irrigation system consisting of a single large nozzle that operates under pressure rotates and is self propelled while field 4 with a netafim streamline self regulated drip system with a dripper flow rate equal to 2 3 l h dripper spacing of 80 cm and dripper lateral spacing 1 5 m fields 1 2 and 3 were plowed with a moldboard down to 30 35 cm depth in early february and then a week before sowing they were treated with disc harrows for bed preparation field 4 was plowed with a moldboard in november treated with a heavy cultivator type in january a light cultivator type in february and then a few days before sowing with cultivator garry for bed preparation the maize hybrid that was used was pioneer s brand new hybrid p1049 fao 500 this hybrid incorporates the innovative aquamax technology increasing its resilience in challenging conditions and its responsiveness in favorable ones the distance between the planted rows was 0 75 m and the mean sowing density in all fields was roughly 7 5 plants m2 nevertheless in 2018 a moderate damage in the young maize plants by νoctuidae thinned their density to 6 7 plants m2 the sowing dates for each year and field as well as the observed emergence and maturity dates are presented in table 1 moreover in field 1 the overall maize growth cycle was monitored closely via weekly field observations emergence maximum canopy cover maximum rooting depth start of flowering beginning of senescence and maturity were observed 7 47 51 60 91 120 days after sowing das respectively the corresponding growing degree days gdds that were required for each of the abovementioned development stages were 36 445 495 604 1003 1404 ggds were calculated with method 3 as defined by the aquacrop model manual fao 2012 following the pioneer agronomists guidelines the tbase and tupper for gdds calculation was set to 10 c and 30 c respectively four points were georeferenced at the beginning of the season in field 1 and the cc was measured in das 14 21 28 35 43 50 and 63 by taking photos of 1 m2 of field surface vertically from roughly 3 m height aboveground using a camera mounted on a selfie stick images were further processed via photoshop and gimp software after the 63rd day from sowing when the plants height exceeded 2 7 m photo acquisition was very difficult and thus cc measurements stopped however in das 63 the plants had already reached their maximum development and the cc obtained at this date was considered to be the season s maximum cc on the harvest day in fields 1 2 and 3 maize plants were cut from 1 m2 of field surface at least 6 plants from four different points withing the fields the gathered plants clipped into smaller pieces and placed in an oven at 65 c until constant weight successively the dry aboveground biomass b and maize yield y for each monitored field was determined as the mean weight of the total gathered plants dry weight and total maize seeds dry weight respectively in the case of field 4 the final y was reported by the farmer right after the maize harvesting machine harvested the whole field and was considered as the field real mean y data on soil texture organic matter content and gravel content for all monitored fields were obtained from regional soil maps these data were imported into pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and estimations of soil saturation point sat field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were obtained table 2 in brief fields in northern greece were loam and sandy loam fields characterized by low organic matter content and the absence of gravels organic matter was also low in field 4 but it was characterized by the dominant presence of clay and leading to low hydraulic conductivity air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation rs and rainfall height were measured via meteorological stations installed in the vicinity of the monitored fields the reference evapotranspiration et0 was then calculated using the r language evapotranspiration package utilizing penman monteith formulation option guo et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the daily mean air temperature fluctuations prevailed in the monitored fields as well as the corresponding daily rain depths for the period march 1 to august 31 et0 was calculated to be equal to 745 5 mm 734 2 mm 726 6 mm and 718 2 mm for fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for the same period the total rain depth that fell in the fields 1 2 3 and 4 was 345 3 mm 216 7 mm 312 1 mm and 185 4 mm respectively looking closely to the rainfall patterns in fig 1 it is obvious that in every field at least one rainfall event with a total precipitation height above 30 mm occurred with some of them reaching 50 mm as a result at least half of the abovementioned seasonal total rainfall depths fell within just 3 4 days noteworthily our partner farmer in field 3 reported that a light hailstorm occurred in 2020 late may having as a result the moderate damage of plants leaves shortly after sowing netafim s rnet soil moisture monitoring system was installed in fields 1 2 and 3 the system consisted of time domain transmissometry soil moisture sensors connected via a cable with a logger which transmits sensors measurements in 15 min intervals to a unit equipped with a cellular gprs gsm modem the latter is able to send the data to a cloud allowing the near real time field monitoring an excavation with a shovel performed in 2017 to a sandy loam field with fully developed p1049 plants showed that the maximum rooting depth was roughly 60 cm with the bulk of the root system occupying the first 30 cm of soil and just few roots to go down to 60 cm taking into consideration these findings three sensors were installed at depths 15 35 and 55 cm from surface for the real time monitoring of the water content within the rooting zone the water content at 25 and 45 cm was estimated as the mean of the water content measurements at 15 and 35 cm and 35 and 55 cm respectively successively the water content within the rooting zone was calculated in mm as 1 w c v w c 15 v w c 25 v w c 35 v w c 45 v w c 55 10 where wc in the water content in the 0 60 cm soil profile in mm vwc15 to vwc55 the volumetric water content cm3 water cm3 soil in the specific depth and 10 a unit conversion factor in fields 1 2 and 3 350 kg ha 31 8 12 n p k granular fertilizer was applied during sowing basic fertilization and additional 500 kg ha of urea 46 0 0 granular fertilizer was applied during tillage at the second half of may first half of june in field 3 moreover during sowing 4 l ha lumax 537 5 se 3 75 mesotrione 31 25 s metolachlor 18 7 terbuthylazine herbicide was sprayed on the field for annual broad leaf and grassy weeds control in field 4 350 kg ha 18 46 0 granular fertilizer was applied into sowing coupled with 2 5 kg ha modett 25 28 se herbicide an additional 500 kg ha urea 46 0 0 granular fertilizer was applied on the first half of june in all the cases fertilization and weed control was considered to be optimal 2 2 sentinel 2 satellite imagery acquisition copernicus sentinel 2 mission was launched in march 2017 and is comprised since march 2017 from 2 satellites sensors s2a and s2b offering products with 5 day temporal resolution at the equator and a spatial grid cell resolution of 10 m esa 2020 the sentinel 2 mission satellite products that were used in this work were acquired and processed via qgis v 3 16 geographic information system software and specifically the semi automatic classification tool plugin congedo 2016 in the plugin menu the following options were defined a the sentinel 2 requested bands band 4 red and band 8 ni b the coordinates of the study areas c the time search windows march 1 to august 31 in 2018 2019 and 2020 and d the acceptable imagery cloud cover was set to 80 when executed the plugin returned all the top of the atmosphere l1c and bottom of the atmosphere l2a available products in the copernicus open access hub for the requested swaths and time in this work only the l2a atmosphere corrected products were selected for further analysis in this way for each date a raster image with the reflectance in red region band 4 and a raster image with the reflectance in the ni region band 8 were downloaded all images were visually inspected for cloud or shadow presence over the areas of interest images with clouds or cloud shadows over the monitored fields were discarded in total 17 12 16 and 18 products were obtained for fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively subsequently the downloaded products were cropped to the monitored field borders using the qgis clip raster by mask layer tool available on the raster menu successively the pixels from the perimeter of the fields were excluded to minimize the border effect induced by the roads and nearby fields sozzi et al 2020 ndvi in the selected images was calculated using the raster calculator tool available on the qgis raster menu using the formula 2 n d v i b a n d 8 b a n d 4 b a n d 8 b a n d 4 2 3 canopy cover ndvi the dates of the acquired ndvi maps in field 1 were compared to the dates that cc field measurements were conducted and the images with the closest dates were selected and matched table 3 subsequently for each image cc measurement pair shown in table 3 the ndvi map pixels closer to the four cc measuring points in field 1 were determined via a script in r language using the equation 3 p i x e l min distance i 1 n l a t c c l a t i n d v i 2 l o n g c c l o n g i n d v i 2 where distance is a vector of n elements n is the number of pixels in the acquired ndvi map latcc and longcc the latitude and longitude of the cc measuring point and latindvi and longindvi the latitude and longitude of the center of ith map pixel the process resulted in the acquisition of twenty four cc ndvi pairs overall collected at four sampling locations over field 1 2 4 the aquacrop model aquacrop v 6 1 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 is a crop growth model capable to simulate the growing cycle of grains vegetables tuber crops cotton maize etc its function is partially based on the double crop coefficient concept allen et al 1998 but it also incorporates the relatively novel concept of water productivity wp in order to convert the plants estimated transpiration to accumulative biomass steduto et al 2007 the daily transpiration is calculated via the equation 4 t r c a d j k s c c k c t r x e t 0 where ks is the dimensionless soil water stress coefficient equal to 1 when the soil is at field capacity and 0 at permanent wilting point kctr x is the maximum crop transpiration coefficient mm et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm and cc is the canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects given by the equation 5 c c 1 72 c c c c 2 0 30 c c 3 τhe db accumulation in calculated in daily basis as 6 d b w p i 1 n t r c a d j e t 0 i where db is the accumulated dry aboveground biomass in day after sowing das n tn ha d and wp is the crop s water productivity adjusted for atmospheric co2 concentration and climate g m2 finally the model calculates the crop yield as 7 y h i b where y is the crop production tn ha and hi is the harvest index cc is a model output parameter its growth and decline pattern over the growing cycle is calculated through the adjustment of input parameters a initial canopy cover at the time of 90 crop emergence cco b canopy growth coefficient cgc c canopy decline coefficient cdc d maximum canopy cover ccx and e gdds to senescence in brief after plants emergence and until ccx 2 is reached cc is calculated daily by the exponential function 8 c c c c o e d a s c g c while from ccx 2 to ccx via the equation 9 c c c c x 0 25 c c x 2 c c o e d a s c g c for the time interval between ccx is achieved until the begging of senescence stage the cc is considered to remain constant then the cdc was applied and the daily cc decline until the end of the season is estimated a water shortage during cc development may result in limited or no cc development a process simulated by the model through the water stress expansion coefficient similarly a severe water shortage in the mid season may trigger early cc senescence a process estimated by the model through the corresponding senescence water stress coefficient the required input data for model execution are a a meteorological file b a crop file c a soil file d an irrigation file e a field management f a groundwater file and g an initial conditions file in the framework of this work the meteorological soil and irrigation files for each of the monitored fields were created according to the collected data the initial soil water content was considered to be close to fc and thus the upper 10 cm soil layer was adjusted to 90 of fc this decision is justified by the rainfall events and low temperatures that prevail in the study areas during march and early april the field management and groundwater files were not used as the groundwater table in all the fields was below 40 m depth whilst no mulching nor bounds were used as typical maize cultivation practices 2 5 irrigation scheduling in the cases of field 1 2 and 3 the irrigation water applied in each irrigation event was measured with rain gauges placed above the canopy as proposed and implemented by paredes et al 2014 in total 226 mm 357 mm and 474 mm of irrigation water was applied on the three fields respectively a water meter was used to measure the irrigation amounts in field 4 recorded 350 mm of water during 2020 monitoring season during the early growing stage roughly the first 40 das if no rainfall events were occurred one or two irrigation events were performed to ensure the robust young plants establishment from 40 das until the end of the season field 1 irrigation schedule was based on soil moisture sensor measurements with an overall goal to irrigate when the depletion level within rooting zone was ready to drop below 60 of the total available water e g fc pwp this water deficit is quite higher than the 40 50 depletion levels used for maize in similar studies zou et al 2021 but the technology that integrated is the hybrid used in the current work aquamax renders it more resilient in water shortage for the same time period fields 2 3 and 4 were irrigated according to the algorithm proposed by tsakmakis et al 2017 the algorithm was executed with a crop file created based on field 1 measurements and observations during the cultivation season the crop file was dynamically modified by adjusting cgc cdc ccx and gdds to senescence parameters described in detail in section 2 6 the maximum allowable depletion level within the rooting zone was set again to 60 of the total available water field specific constraints e g an irrigation event could not occur more often than once per four days etc were integrated to the scheduling process if for some reason the generated irrigation schedule was not followed e g electrical failure in the pumping station damage to irrigation system etc the schedule was updated accordingly and the algorithm was re executed these adjustments resulted in regular violations in the initial depletion threshold by applying irrigation before the threshold is reached or after the water content drop below it 2 6 maize crop file calibration and validation the default aquacrop maize file was calibrated based on the measurements and observations in field 1 during 2018 the procedure followed is that proposed by hsiao et al 2009 and paredes et al 2014 initially the values of the non conservative parameters e g parameters that change remarkably in time and space like plants density ccx time to maximum rooting depth beginning duration of flowering and time to maturation were tuned to match field 1 observations subsequently a group of conservative parameters parameters that are considered to exhibit minor changes globally and over time e g cgc cdc kctr x wp was adjusted based on the trial and error approach with an overall goal to optimize the model s simulation performance in terms of cc soil water content swc b and y table 4 presents the default and calibrated values for the non conservative and conservative parameters that have been changed during calibration process in this work for the rest of the parameters the default crop file values were used as when was attempted to modify them via trial and error approach the model showed poor results during field 2 3 and 4 monitoring seasons the initial calibrated crop file was modified dynamically based on sentinel 2 acquired cc time series specifically ccx cgc cdc and the gdds to senescence crop file parameters were changed to match the remotely cc observations the cgc and cdc were obtained by the trial and error approach aiming to match the simulated cc values with those acquired from sentinel 2 the validation procedure was separated into two distinct steps at first the calibrated file was validated with the data collected from fields 2 3 and 4 by modifying only the corresponding observed emergence dates table 1 then the model was validated for fields 2 3 and 4 datasets using the corresponding in season modified crop files in both cases the aquacrop performance was assessed through its capability to simulate cc swc b and y 2 6 1 model evaluation criteria in all the cases the model was evaluated on its capability to simulate cc swc b and y to assess the fine tuning between the measured and simulated cc and swc values the coefficient of determination r2 index was used as an index of the residual error among the measurements and simulations the root mean square error rmse eq 10 and the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 11 katerji et al 2013 indices were calculated 10 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 0 5 11 r r m s e r m s e 100 o m and the modeling efficiency ef eq 12 nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a model performance indicator paredes et al 2014 12 e f 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o m 2 finally the model s capability to simulate final b and y were assessed via prediction error pe eq 13 index 13 p e s i o i o i 100 in eqs 6 9 oi and si represent the observed and the simulated values respectively om the observed mean value and n the number of measurements the model s performance is considered to be satisfactory when ef and r2 values are close to 1 while values close to 0 indicate unrealistic simulation results on the contrary rmse rrmse and pe values close to zero indicate a good agreement between measured and simulated data moreover in the case of rrmse katerji et al 2013 mentioned that rrmse values 10 indicate excellent model performance values between 10 and 20 a good model performance values between 20 and 30 an acceptable model performance and finally values 30 a poor model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 canopy cover ndvi a linear regression analysis was performed between the twenty four field measured cc and corresponding ndvi values measured during 2018 in field 1 table 3 the results are illustrated in fig 2 the analysis indicated a good fitting between the two vis with r2 taking a value of 0 96 the obtained regression line is 14 n d v i 0 008 c c 0 190 while there is a moderate number of studies relating the maize crop lai and ndvi there are scarcely any works relating maize crop cc and ndvi maybe this is attributed to the fact that once maize plants reach their maximum cc the field cc measurements are difficult and uncertain or just because lai measurements are easier using specialized instruments e g delta t sunscan decagon accupar li cor lai 2000 which conduct measurements bellow the canopy and no further data process e g photo processing is required in one of these rare works de la casa et al 2014 measured the cc over the whole maize crop season and regressed a dataset of over forty cc ndvi pairs they reported a linear relationship between them and an r2 equal to 0 88 the intercept they found was slightly higher than the one found in the current study 0 249 but the slope was very similar 0 007 moreover in a study where bulk perennial and annual crop field cc measurements were regressed with ndvi trout et al 2008 a linear relationship was also reported among the 2 vis r2 0 95 with slope and intercept equal to 0 008 and 0 180 respectively for the set of sentinel 2 ndvi maps acquired for each monitored field e g a set of 17 maps for field 1 the eq 10 was implemented and the ndvi values in each map pixel were transformed to cc values subsequently the cc time series for each field was calculated as 15 c c t i 4 m e a n c c p i x e l 1 1 c c p i x e l 2 1 c c p i x e l n 1 m e a n c c p i x e l 1 k c c p i x e l 2 k c c p i x e l n k where ccti a vector of k elements i the number of the monitored fields k the number of acquired ndvi maps in the ith field e g 17 12 16 and 18 for fields 1 2 3 and 4 n the number of pixels in the kth map of the ith field and ccpixeln k the cc value in the nth pixel of the kth map the absolute maximum canopy cover cci max for each season was calculated by solving the max ccti function table 5 continuously the ccx of each season was calculated as the mean of the ccti values that do not deviate more than 5 from the ccmax accordingly in each field the ccx was considered to be reached when the difference between two successive values in the ccti vector is equal or lower than 5 while the beginning of the senescence stage when this difference becomes again greater than 5 in field 1 ccx was found to be 2 4 lower than that the other fields this is related to the lower plant density observed in this filed 6 7 plants m2 due to the damage occurred by νoctuidae during young plants establishment despite the fact that there is no direct relationship between ccx and plants density it is considered as a fact that plant density affects ccx value paredes et al 2014 reported a ccx equal to 96 with a corresponding plant density 8 2 plants m2 while ahmadi et al 2015 and katerji et al 2013 found a ccx equal to 90 for plant densities 6 6 and 5 0 plants m2 respectively although ccx cdc cdc and gdds to senescence are considered as conservative parameters when they are assessed through the remotely acquired cct they were found to fluctuate considerably specifically cgc was found to range from 9 3 day to 18 day a substantial difference of almost 10 day the default crop file value is 16 3 day while other researchers have reported cgc values ranging from 12 5 to 19 9 day abedinpour et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2015 mohamed sallah et al 2019 sandhu and irmak 2019 on the other hand cdc show values ranging from 6 3 to 7 1 day very close to the 6 5 day reported by ahmadi et al 2015 3 2 model performance under real farming conditions 3 2 1 canopy cover when the calibrated maize crop file was used the aquacrop model managed to simulate the cc development through the 2019 season very satisfactorily fig 3 when compared with the field measured cc values the model achieved an almost identical performance with r2 and ef values equal to 1 accordingly the rmse and rrmse indices were found equal to 2 03 and 5 31 respectively in the case of the statistical analysis between the model s simulated cc and the cct1 the obtained results were again nearly optimum with r2 and ef scoring a 0 98 and rmse and rrmse resulting in values slightly higher than those in the case of field measured cc 4 53 7 17 the use of the calibrated crop file with the minor modifications in the emergence dates gave fair results when validated with fields 2 3 and 4 datasets fig 4a c e table 6 in the case of field 2 the rrmse was found to be lower than 10 indicating an excellent model performance while the index values were among 10 and 20 for fields 3 and 4 showing a good calibrated crop file capability to simulate cc the r2 and ef showed values between 0 94 and 0 98 and 0 95 0 98 respectively confirming the fine tuning between the simulated and remotely measured cc the model s capability to simulate cc was further improved when the field specific ccx cdc cdc and gdds to senescence values obtained from sentinel 2 cct time series table 5 were ingested in the crop file fig 4b d f rrmse index was in all cases lower than 10 characterizing the simulations as excellent table 6 moreover r2 and ef took values greater than 0 98 the improvement was more obvious in field 3 where the modifications in the crop file achieved to reduce the rrmse index by more than 10 from 15 74 down to 3 38 this improvement is mainly attributed to the modification in cgc in field 3 a light hailstorm occurred in late may das 30 47 and maybe this explains the delay observed in cc development when compared to the initial calibrated crop file fig 4c d at this point it should be mentioned that due to the presence of clouds over the fields 1 and 2 from das 40 to das 60 just one satellite image was acquired for both fields during this time period fig 4a c unfortunately this period is characterized from the canopy s rapid development and its monitoring is considered as vital for the robust assessment of the overall plants development this fact reveals the weakness introduced by the uncertain weather conditions to any approach that relies solely in satellite images for the evaluation of crop water needs and development the capability of the calibrated aquacrop model to simulate properly the cc variability that was found in this work is similar to the findings of other studies when they used aquacrop model to simulate maize cc development under rainfed limited and full irrigation conditions sandhu and irmak 2019 reported rmses ranging from 4 80 to 13 40 and r2 values larger than 0 84 similarly paredes et al 2014 for various irrigation schedules found rmses between 4 60 and 6 60 r2 larger than 0 95 and ef larger than 0 93 moreover studies that were conducted in tropical and semi arid environments abedinpour et al 2012 greaves and wang 2016 reported rmses r2 and ef ranging from 0 81 to 16 0 89 0 98 and 0 60 0 95 respectively 3 2 2 soil water content overall the swc simulation was found to be fair during the 2018 calibration season despite an overestimation observed at the beginning and end of the season fig 5 table 7 the model followed the upward and downward trends of the swc rather closely rrmse index was lower than 10 indicating excellent performance nevertheless the r2 was found to be 0 79 marginally lower than the 0 80 value that is proposed as a threshold for an acceptable swc model simulation performance ma et al 2015 while ef 0 76 was well above the corresponding performance limit of 0 70 the model achieved a fair performance for the datasets of field 2 and 3 as well with rrme constantly below 10 and r2 and ef taking values above 0 81 and 0 74 respectively however r2 and ef never exceeded 0 90 and 0 80 respectively revealing that in some sense the model s capability to simulate swc is limited in field 2 fig 6a the model again seemed to overestimate the swc at the beginning of the season as well as between das 90 and 110 on the contrary in field 3 the aquacrop underestimated the swc from das 80 to das 90 the overestimations that were observed in the cases of field 1 and field 2 at the beginning of the season could be attributed to the fact that the initial soil water content was lower than the assumed 90 fc or to the soil disturbance and a potential soil water evaporation during moisture sensors installation moreover the presented measurements are integrating sensor biases and or random errors as well as errors introduced by the formula used to transform the raw volumetric water content measurements to mm of water section 2 1 aquacrop performance did not change notably when the re calibrated crop files were used and not striking differences were observed in the simulation patterns fig 6b d in the case of field 2 rrmse was reduced slightly and r2 increased from 0 86 to 0 88 on the other hand ef reduced marginally from 0 74 down to 0 72 when regarding field 3 both r2 and ef reduced slightly and rrmse increased table 7 however in all the cases rrmse remained below 10 and r2 and ef larger than the good performance thresholds of 0 80 and 0 70 respectively similar findings are presented in previous works paredes et al 2014 argued that the capability of aquacrop model to simulate swc is unstable reporting r2 and ef values ranging from 0 59 to 0 88 and 0 03 0 72 respectively sandhu and irmak 2019 found that while in the calibration season the model simulated swc with high accuracy r2 0 86 ef 0 83 rrmse 7 30 during validation the results varied greatly 0 00 r2 0 88 21 40 ef 0 84 3 00 rrmse 29 60 on the contrary ahmadi et al 2015 argued that aquacrop successively simulated the soil water dynamics within the rooting zone reporting rmse values 0 01 0 37 m3 m 3 3 2 3 final biomass and yield for the 2018 calibration season the model simulated b rather accurately with the difference between the measured and simulated values to be just 0 001 tn ha table 8 similarly the y was simulated with fair accuracy with the pe index to be equal to 3 12 nevertheless when the model tested against the datasets of fields 2 3 and 4 differences up to 2 622 tn ha and 1 652 tn ha and pe values equal to 12 76 and 12 76 were found between the measured and simulated b and y respectively table 8 in the cases of field 2 and 4 the model underestimated the final accumulated b and produced y whilst in the case of field 3 overestimated them when the remotely sensed re calibrated crop files were used the aquacrop performance was remarkably improved the most striking improvement was observed in the case of field 2 where the difference in measured and simulated b dropped from 1 218 tn ha to 0 311 tn ha and the pe from 4 98 to 1 27 accordingly the difference in the measured and simulated y decreased to 0 262 tn ha and the corresponding pe from 5 39 to 1 69 despite the fact that the simulation of b and y was improved for field 3 as well the simulated values were still substantially different from those measured showing a difference in b up to 2 506 tn ha whilst the difference regarding y was up to 1 265 tn ha and the pe equal to 12 76 table 8 no clear reasons for this discrepancy could be given but a hypothesis that the assumption of optimal fertilization maybe violated by a potential leaching of nitrates below the rooting zone during the urea application in early june as a result of the high field s soil hydraulic conductivity ksat 577 4 mm d and the frequent irrigation events every fourth day that occurred during this period high residual errors regarding the model s capability to simulate b and y have been found to other studies too rmses up to 3 50 tn ha 2 21 tn ha and 2 60 tn ha were reported for y simulations by paredes et al 2014 ahmadi et al 2015 and sandhu and irmak 2019 respectively while abedinpour et al 2012 and hsiao et al 2009 indicated rmses ranging from 0 11 to 6 18 tn ha for b moreover katerji et al 2013 found pe values equal to 15 20 and 13 30 when compared measured and simulated b and y whilst greaves and wang 2016 pe that ranges from 4 30 to 7 70 tn ha and 2 00 4 90 tn ha for b and y respectively overall models improved performance in the case of the re calibrated crop files appears strongly connected to the improvement in the cc simulation that was observed when the re calibrated crop files were used section 3 2 1 the strong interconnection between optimal cc simulation and b and y estimations is prominent in eqs 4 7 in this framework paredes et al 2014 discussed the paramount importance of model s cc simulation by stating that the proper cc estimation is a major requisite for the model to produce good estimates of soil evaporation crop transpiration and biomass and hence good yield predictions however at the current version of the model the cc development could be changed only indirectly by adjusting ccx cgc cdc and gdds to senescence parameters making the in season cc assimilation difficult an off season direct cc assimilation for potato and cotton crops in aquacrop model has been already reported linker and ioslovich 2017 as alternative options aquacrop os foster et al 2017 or aquacrop r rodriguez and ober 2019 appear promising but more studies are needed to assess their accuracy and precision 4 conclusions in this study we initially locally calibrated aquacrop model maize crop file and then we assessed its capability to simulate adequately the maize crop cycle in greece under variable climate conditions and different soil types for the validation process sentinel 2 cc time series field development stages observations and field swc b and y measurements were used finally the possibility to improve field operational monitoring in terms of cc swc final b and final y estimations through sentinel 2 acquired cc time series was studied to do so the satellite acquired cc time series for each field was used to modify dynamically within cultivation period the ccx cgc cdc and gdds to senescence crop file input parameters the results showed that when calibrated with local field measurements the model achieved to simulate cc and swc with fair accuracy for all the datasets by adjusting only the observed emergence day moreover sentinel 2 acquired cc time series were proved to be essential tools for the validation of aquacrop when field cc measurements were absent however in the case of b and y estimations the model showed a robust performance only in field 1 and field 4 the ingestion of the remotely re calibrated parameters in the crop file improved remarkably the model s performance to simulate cc and subsequently a substantial improvement was observed in the final b and final y estimations nevertheless the ingestion of the adjusted parameters was not found to affect negatively or positively the model s performance in swc the results of this study showed that even parameters that are considered conservative may vary moderately in time and space while their in season adjustment could improve the overall model performance the continuous improvement in the satellite products in terms of temporal and special resolution promises in the near future an even more dense vis time series minimizing the potentially adverse impact that the cloud cover could have on the series smoothness taking the latter into consideration in conjunction with the findings of this study the model developers may should consider for the next version to convert cc from an output to an input parameter this way the in season assimilation of remotely acquired or field measured cc series would be easily inserted into the model improving its overall performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9971,canopy cover cc is a key parameter in calibration and validation of crop growth models especially those used in operational field monitoring however cc direct measurements require intense field campaigns increasing the cost in time series data acquisition for large agricultural areas normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a commonly used remote sensing vegetation index expressing crop water status being indirectly related to cc in this paper we explore the relationship between on site cc and the high resolution ndvi data acquired via sentinel 2 products this relationship was utilized to produce cc time series over the cultivation period in four maize fields in northern and central greece subsequently the expression linking cc and ndvi was used to operationally validate cc change in a crop model capable to simulate the maize growth cycle aquacrop the proposed method involves the dynamic in season re adjustment to a number of key model input parameters based on the remotely acquired cc time series namely maximum cc canopy growth and decline coefficient growing degree days needed to the beginning of senescence stage these re adjusted parameters were imported to model s crop file to improve simulations in cc soil water content final biomass and yield results showed that the remotely acquired cc time series could be successfully used as an alternative mean to validate cc simulations moreover the ingestion of re estimated parameters to crop file improved model s capability to simulate cc r2 0 98 rmse 5 12 biomass pe 12 and yield pe 12 no significant

models are widely used as tools to assess crops fertilization irrigation demands and increase their use efficiency battude et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 their establishment as operational precision agriculture tools is expected to secure the sustainability and increase the resilience of the agricultural sector this can be achieved by guaranteeing lower water footprints chukalla et al 2015 tsakmakis et al 2018 while contributing to the mitigation of the oncoming climate change impacts on the agricultural sector xiao et al 2020 ranging between empirical and analytical complex approaches these models simulate the biological chemical and physical processes occurring in the air soil plant continuum that fosters plants during their growing cycle the most widely used models are aquacrop raes et al 2009 aqyield constantin et al 2015 cropgro wang et al 2020 cropsys conrad and fohrer 2016 daisy hansen et al 1991 dssat ceres malik et al 2019 mohid land simionesei et al 2016 safy duchemin et al 2008 swap hassanli et al 2016 wofost tenreiro et al 2020 their capability to simulate arable crops growing cycle in terms of plants canopy development aboveground biomass accumulation water balance within the rooting zone and final crop yield has been thoroughly assessed in many studies with satisfactory results battude et al 2016 hsiao et al 2009 paredes et al 2014 sandhu and irmak 2019 tsakmakis et al 2017 2019 zhou et al 2018 one of the key parameters that is broadly used by researches as a mean to assess the crop models performance is the plants canopy cover the latter plays a vital role in assessing plants development and wellbeing as it influences the light interception photosynthesis and thus crop growth rate crop water use and soil evaporation sone et al 2009 canopy cover development is usually assessed via field measurements of leaf area index lai the ratio of leaf area to a given land unit wilhelm et al 1996 or green canopy cover cc the portion of green leaves cover in a given unit of land nevertheless collecting systematic lai or cc time series will require frequent field measurements rendering the overall process laborious costly and not applicable in large scale operational field monitoring the lack of systematic large scale cc data induces a significant uncertainty in operational irrigation scheduling especially when on site meteorologic plant growth and soil moisture data are assimilated in large scale crop modeling since the late 80 s numerous studies have indicated the feasibility of monitoring cc indirectly through vegetation indices vis that are acquired via remote sensing de la casa et al 2014 kross et al 2015 maas 1988 tan et al 2020 some of the latest works utilized the green fraction cover vi to decrease the uncertainty and improve the canopy cover simulation efficiency of crop models battude et al 2017 marta et al 2019 mohamed sallah et al 2019 however the calculation of the green fraction cover requires the use of advanced tools like the bvnet tool battude et al 2017 or other artificial neural network algorithms marta et al 2019 these tools are data demanding and require as inputs the visible spectral bands of red and green as well as near infrared ni and shortwave infrared bands as a result these demands on input data and tools algorithms end up in increased acquisition file sizes and high processing needs on the contrary normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a vi widely used for cc monitoring zou and mõttus 2017 moreover its calculation requires only the use of red and ni spectral bands whilst ndvi s calculation formula is just the quotient of the ni red bands difference against ni red bands sum de la casa et al 2014 while ndvi has been successively coupled with a number of crop models in the past maas 1988 moriondo et al 2007 zeleke 2019 there are scarce works coupling ndvi with fao aquacrop model and specifically maize crop the main objectives of this study are a to establish a correlation relationship between field measured cc and the high resolution sentinel 2 ndvi product b integrating the cc ndvi relationship on sentinel 2 imagery products to calculate field spatial cc variability and temporal cc changes throughout maize cultivation season c to assess aquacrop model capacity to simulate maize growing cycle under different weather conditions and soil types and d to evaluate the potency of satellite acquired cc time series to improve aquacrop performance in terms of simulating canopy cover soil water content final biomass and corn yield in operational field monitoring experiments were conducted in large commercial farms of northern and central greece in which operational precision irrigation was implemented 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data the experimental data was collected from four commercial fields that were cultivated with maize in northern and central greece in 2018 2019 and 2020 the continuous crop rotation practice that is implemented by the farmers in the study areas renders the multiyear maize monitoring on the same field not feasible consequently in northern greece field 1 lat 41 069243 long 25 057557 alt 6 m was monitored in 2018 field 2 lat 41 058449 long 25 000202 alt 19 m in 2019 and field 3 lat 41 064463 long 24 991879 alt 35 m in 2020 while in central greece field 4 lat 39 546981 long 22 688011 alt 47 m was monitored in 2020 all fields corresponded to one irrigation block with fields 1 2 and 3 covering an area of 1 ha having a rectangular shape with width ranging from 53 to 58 m and length between 170 and 190 m on the other hand field 4 had a total area of 2 ha rectangular shape with a width and length equal to 100 m and 200 m respectively this difference in irrigation block size is due to the differences in the capacity of the irrigation systems that are used by the farmers in northern and central greece thus fields 1 2 and 3 were irrigated with a sprinkler irrigation system consisting of a single large nozzle that operates under pressure rotates and is self propelled while field 4 with a netafim streamline self regulated drip system with a dripper flow rate equal to 2 3 l h dripper spacing of 80 cm and dripper lateral spacing 1 5 m fields 1 2 and 3 were plowed with a moldboard down to 30 35 cm depth in early february and then a week before sowing they were treated with disc harrows for bed preparation field 4 was plowed with a moldboard in november treated with a heavy cultivator type in january a light cultivator type in february and then a few days before sowing with cultivator garry for bed preparation the maize hybrid that was used was pioneer s brand new hybrid p1049 fao 500 this hybrid incorporates the innovative aquamax technology increasing its resilience in challenging conditions and its responsiveness in favorable ones the distance between the planted rows was 0 75 m and the mean sowing density in all fields was roughly 7 5 plants m2 nevertheless in 2018 a moderate damage in the young maize plants by νoctuidae thinned their density to 6 7 plants m2 the sowing dates for each year and field as well as the observed emergence and maturity dates are presented in table 1 moreover in field 1 the overall maize growth cycle was monitored closely via weekly field observations emergence maximum canopy cover maximum rooting depth start of flowering beginning of senescence and maturity were observed 7 47 51 60 91 120 days after sowing das respectively the corresponding growing degree days gdds that were required for each of the abovementioned development stages were 36 445 495 604 1003 1404 ggds were calculated with method 3 as defined by the aquacrop model manual fao 2012 following the pioneer agronomists guidelines the tbase and tupper for gdds calculation was set to 10 c and 30 c respectively four points were georeferenced at the beginning of the season in field 1 and the cc was measured in das 14 21 28 35 43 50 and 63 by taking photos of 1 m2 of field surface vertically from roughly 3 m height aboveground using a camera mounted on a selfie stick images were further processed via photoshop and gimp software after the 63rd day from sowing when the plants height exceeded 2 7 m photo acquisition was very difficult and thus cc measurements stopped however in das 63 the plants had already reached their maximum development and the cc obtained at this date was considered to be the season s maximum cc on the harvest day in fields 1 2 and 3 maize plants were cut from 1 m2 of field surface at least 6 plants from four different points withing the fields the gathered plants clipped into smaller pieces and placed in an oven at 65 c until constant weight successively the dry aboveground biomass b and maize yield y for each monitored field was determined as the mean weight of the total gathered plants dry weight and total maize seeds dry weight respectively in the case of field 4 the final y was reported by the farmer right after the maize harvesting machine harvested the whole field and was considered as the field real mean y data on soil texture organic matter content and gravel content for all monitored fields were obtained from regional soil maps these data were imported into pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and estimations of soil saturation point sat field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were obtained table 2 in brief fields in northern greece were loam and sandy loam fields characterized by low organic matter content and the absence of gravels organic matter was also low in field 4 but it was characterized by the dominant presence of clay and leading to low hydraulic conductivity air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation rs and rainfall height were measured via meteorological stations installed in the vicinity of the monitored fields the reference evapotranspiration et0 was then calculated using the r language evapotranspiration package utilizing penman monteith formulation option guo et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the daily mean air temperature fluctuations prevailed in the monitored fields as well as the corresponding daily rain depths for the period march 1 to august 31 et0 was calculated to be equal to 745 5 mm 734 2 mm 726 6 mm and 718 2 mm for fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for the same period the total rain depth that fell in the fields 1 2 3 and 4 was 345 3 mm 216 7 mm 312 1 mm and 185 4 mm respectively looking closely to the rainfall patterns in fig 1 it is obvious that in every field at least one rainfall event with a total precipitation height above 30 mm occurred with some of them reaching 50 mm as a result at least half of the abovementioned seasonal total rainfall depths fell within just 3 4 days noteworthily our partner farmer in field 3 reported that a light hailstorm occurred in 2020 late may having as a result the moderate damage of plants leaves shortly after sowing netafim s rnet soil moisture monitoring system was installed in fields 1 2 and 3 the system consisted of time domain transmissometry soil moisture sensors connected via a cable with a logger which transmits sensors measurements in 15 min intervals to a unit equipped with a cellular gprs gsm modem the latter is able to send the data to a cloud allowing the near real time field monitoring an excavation with a shovel performed in 2017 to a sandy loam field with fully developed p1049 plants showed that the maximum rooting depth was roughly 60 cm with the bulk of the root system occupying the first 30 cm of soil and just few roots to go down to 60 cm taking into consideration these findings three sensors were installed at depths 15 35 and 55 cm from surface for the real time monitoring of the water content within the rooting zone the water content at 25 and 45 cm was estimated as the mean of the water content measurements at 15 and 35 cm and 35 and 55 cm respectively successively the water content within the rooting zone was calculated in mm as 1 w c v w c 15 v w c 25 v w c 35 v w c 45 v w c 55 10 where wc in the water content in the 0 60 cm soil profile in mm vwc15 to vwc55 the volumetric water content cm3 water cm3 soil in the specific depth and 10 a unit conversion factor in fields 1 2 and 3 350 kg ha 31 8 12 n p k granular fertilizer was applied during sowing basic fertilization and additional 500 kg ha of urea 46 0 0 granular fertilizer was applied during tillage at the second half of may first half of june in field 3 moreover during sowing 4 l ha lumax 537 5 se 3 75 mesotrione 31 25 s metolachlor 18 7 terbuthylazine herbicide was sprayed on the field for annual broad leaf and grassy weeds control in field 4 350 kg ha 18 46 0 granular fertilizer was applied into sowing coupled with 2 5 kg ha modett 25 28 se herbicide an additional 500 kg ha urea 46 0 0 granular fertilizer was applied on the first half of june in all the cases fertilization and weed control was considered to be optimal 2 2 sentinel 2 satellite imagery acquisition copernicus sentinel 2 mission was launched in march 2017 and is comprised since march 2017 from 2 satellites sensors s2a and s2b offering products with 5 day temporal resolution at the equator and a spatial grid cell resolution of 10 m esa 2020 the sentinel 2 mission satellite products that were used in this work were acquired and processed via qgis v 3 16 geographic information system software and specifically the semi automatic classification tool plugin congedo 2016 in the plugin menu the following options were defined a the sentinel 2 requested bands band 4 red and band 8 ni b the coordinates of the study areas c the time search windows march 1 to august 31 in 2018 2019 and 2020 and d the acceptable imagery cloud cover was set to 80 when executed the plugin returned all the top of the atmosphere l1c and bottom of the atmosphere l2a available products in the copernicus open access hub for the requested swaths and time in this work only the l2a atmosphere corrected products were selected for further analysis in this way for each date a raster image with the reflectance in red region band 4 and a raster image with the reflectance in the ni region band 8 were downloaded all images were visually inspected for cloud or shadow presence over the areas of interest images with clouds or cloud shadows over the monitored fields were discarded in total 17 12 16 and 18 products were obtained for fields 1 2 3 and 4 respectively subsequently the downloaded products were cropped to the monitored field borders using the qgis clip raster by mask layer tool available on the raster menu successively the pixels from the perimeter of the fields were excluded to minimize the border effect induced by the roads and nearby fields sozzi et al 2020 ndvi in the selected images was calculated using the raster calculator tool available on the qgis raster menu using the formula 2 n d v i b a n d 8 b a n d 4 b a n d 8 b a n d 4 2 3 canopy cover ndvi the dates of the acquired ndvi maps in field 1 were compared to the dates that cc field measurements were conducted and the images with the closest dates were selected and matched table 3 subsequently for each image cc measurement pair shown in table 3 the ndvi map pixels closer to the four cc measuring points in field 1 were determined via a script in r language using the equation 3 p i x e l min distance i 1 n l a t c c l a t i n d v i 2 l o n g c c l o n g i n d v i 2 where distance is a vector of n elements n is the number of pixels in the acquired ndvi map latcc and longcc the latitude and longitude of the cc measuring point and latindvi and longindvi the latitude and longitude of the center of ith map pixel the process resulted in the acquisition of twenty four cc ndvi pairs overall collected at four sampling locations over field 1 2 4 the aquacrop model aquacrop v 6 1 hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 is a crop growth model capable to simulate the growing cycle of grains vegetables tuber crops cotton maize etc its function is partially based on the double crop coefficient concept allen et al 1998 but it also incorporates the relatively novel concept of water productivity wp in order to convert the plants estimated transpiration to accumulative biomass steduto et al 2007 the daily transpiration is calculated via the equation 4 t r c a d j k s c c k c t r x e t 0 where ks is the dimensionless soil water stress coefficient equal to 1 when the soil is at field capacity and 0 at permanent wilting point kctr x is the maximum crop transpiration coefficient mm et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm and cc is the canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects given by the equation 5 c c 1 72 c c c c 2 0 30 c c 3 τhe db accumulation in calculated in daily basis as 6 d b w p i 1 n t r c a d j e t 0 i where db is the accumulated dry aboveground biomass in day after sowing das n tn ha d and wp is the crop s water productivity adjusted for atmospheric co2 concentration and climate g m2 finally the model calculates the crop yield as 7 y h i b where y is the crop production tn ha and hi is the harvest index cc is a model output parameter its growth and decline pattern over the growing cycle is calculated through the adjustment of input parameters a initial canopy cover at the time of 90 crop emergence cco b canopy growth coefficient cgc c canopy decline coefficient cdc d maximum canopy cover ccx and e gdds to senescence in brief after plants emergence and until ccx 2 is reached cc is calculated daily by the exponential function 8 c c c c o e d a s c g c while from ccx 2 to ccx via the equation 9 c c c c x 0 25 c c x 2 c c o e d a s c g c for the time interval between ccx is achieved until the begging of senescence stage the cc is considered to remain constant then the cdc was applied and the daily cc decline until the end of the season is estimated a water shortage during cc development may result in limited or no cc development a process simulated by the model through the water stress expansion coefficient similarly a severe water shortage in the mid season may trigger early cc senescence a process estimated by the model through the corresponding senescence water stress coefficient the required input data for model execution are a a meteorological file b a crop file c a soil file d an irrigation file e a field management f a groundwater file and g an initial conditions file in the framework of this work the meteorological soil and irrigation files for each of the monitored fields were created according to the collected data the initial soil water content was considered to be close to fc and thus the upper 10 cm soil layer was adjusted to 90 of fc this decision is justified by the rainfall events and low temperatures that prevail in the study areas during march and early april the field management and groundwater files were not used as the groundwater table in all the fields was below 40 m depth whilst no mulching nor bounds were used as typical maize cultivation practices 2 5 irrigation scheduling in the cases of field 1 2 and 3 the irrigation water applied in each irrigation event was measured with rain gauges placed above the canopy as proposed and implemented by paredes et al 2014 in total 226 mm 357 mm and 474 mm of irrigation water was applied on the three fields respectively a water meter was used to measure the irrigation amounts in field 4 recorded 350 mm of water during 2020 monitoring season during the early growing stage roughly the first 40 das if no rainfall events were occurred one or two irrigation events were performed to ensure the robust young plants establishment from 40 das until the end of the season field 1 irrigation schedule was based on soil moisture sensor measurements with an overall goal to irrigate when the depletion level within rooting zone was ready to drop below 60 of the total available water e g fc pwp this water deficit is quite higher than the 40 50 depletion levels used for maize in similar studies zou et al 2021 but the technology that integrated is the hybrid used in the current work aquamax renders it more resilient in water shortage for the same time period fields 2 3 and 4 were irrigated according to the algorithm proposed by tsakmakis et al 2017 the algorithm was executed with a crop file created based on field 1 measurements and observations during the cultivation season the crop file was dynamically modified by adjusting cgc cdc ccx and gdds to senescence parameters described in detail in section 2 6 the maximum allowable depletion level within the rooting zone was set again to 60 of the total available water field specific constraints e g an irrigation event could not occur more often than once per four days etc were integrated to the scheduling process if for some reason the generated irrigation schedule was not followed e g electrical failure in the pumping station damage to irrigation system etc the schedule was updated accordingly and the algorithm was re executed these adjustments resulted in regular violations in the initial depletion threshold by applying irrigation before the threshold is reached or after the water content drop below it 2 6 maize crop file calibration and validation the default aquacrop maize file was calibrated based on the measurements and observations in field 1 during 2018 the procedure followed is that proposed by hsiao et al 2009 and paredes et al 2014 initially the values of the non conservative parameters e g parameters that change remarkably in time and space like plants density ccx time to maximum rooting depth beginning duration of flowering and time to maturation were tuned to match field 1 observations subsequently a group of conservative parameters parameters that are considered to exhibit minor changes globally and over time e g cgc cdc kctr x wp was adjusted based on the trial and error approach with an overall goal to optimize the model s simulation performance in terms of cc soil water content swc b and y table 4 presents the default and calibrated values for the non conservative and conservative parameters that have been changed during calibration process in this work for the rest of the parameters the default crop file values were used as when was attempted to modify them via trial and error approach the model showed poor results during field 2 3 and 4 monitoring seasons the initial calibrated crop file was modified dynamically based on sentinel 2 acquired cc time series specifically ccx cgc cdc and the gdds to senescence crop file parameters were changed to match the remotely cc observations the cgc and cdc were obtained by the trial and error approach aiming to match the simulated cc values with those acquired from sentinel 2 the validation procedure was separated into two distinct steps at first the calibrated file was validated with the data collected from fields 2 3 and 4 by modifying only the corresponding observed emergence dates table 1 then the model was validated for fields 2 3 and 4 datasets using the corresponding in season modified crop files in both cases the aquacrop performance was assessed through its capability to simulate cc swc b and y 2 6 1 model evaluation criteria in all the cases the model was evaluated on its capability to simulate cc swc b and y to assess the fine tuning between the measured and simulated cc and swc values the coefficient of determination r2 index was used as an index of the residual error among the measurements and simulations the root mean square error rmse eq 10 and the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 11 katerji et al 2013 indices were calculated 10 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 0 5 11 r r m s e r m s e 100 o m and the modeling efficiency ef eq 12 nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a model performance indicator paredes et al 2014 12 e f 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o m 2 finally the model s capability to simulate final b and y were assessed via prediction error pe eq 13 index 13 p e s i o i o i 100 in eqs 6 9 oi and si represent the observed and the simulated values respectively om the observed mean value and n the number of measurements the model s performance is considered to be satisfactory when ef and r2 values are close to 1 while values close to 0 indicate unrealistic simulation results on the contrary rmse rrmse and pe values close to zero indicate a good agreement between measured and simulated data moreover in the case of rrmse katerji et al 2013 mentioned that rrmse values 10 indicate excellent model performance values between 10 and 20 a good model performance values between 20 and 30 an acceptable model performance and finally values 30 a poor model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 canopy cover ndvi a linear regression analysis was performed between the twenty four field measured cc and corresponding ndvi values measured during 2018 in field 1 table 3 the results are illustrated in fig 2 the analysis indicated a good fitting between the two vis with r2 taking a value of 0 96 the obtained regression line is 14 n d v i 0 008 c c 0 190 while there is a moderate number of studies relating the maize crop lai and ndvi there are scarcely any works relating maize crop cc and ndvi maybe this is attributed to the fact that once maize plants reach their maximum cc the field cc measurements are difficult and uncertain or just because lai measurements are easier using specialized instruments e g delta t sunscan decagon accupar li cor lai 2000 which conduct measurements bellow the canopy and no further data process e g photo processing is required in one of these rare works de la casa et al 2014 measured the cc over the whole maize crop season and regressed a dataset of over forty cc ndvi pairs they reported a linear relationship between them and an r2 equal to 0 88 the intercept they found was slightly higher than the one found in the current study 0 249 but the slope was very similar 0 007 moreover in a study where bulk perennial and annual crop field cc measurements were regressed with ndvi trout et al 2008 a linear relationship was also reported among the 2 vis r2 0 95 with slope and intercept equal to 0 008 and 0 180 respectively for the set of sentinel 2 ndvi maps acquired for each monitored field e g a set of 17 maps for field 1 the eq 10 was implemented and the ndvi values in each map pixel were transformed to cc values subsequently the cc time series for each field was calculated as 15 c c t i 4 m e a n c c p i x e l 1 1 c c p i x e l 2 1 c c p i x e l n 1 m e a n c c p i x e l 1 k c c p i x e l 2 k c c p i x e l n k where ccti a vector of k elements i the number of the monitored fields k the number of acquired ndvi maps in the ith field e g 17 12 16 and 18 for fields 1 2 3 and 4 n the number of pixels in the kth map of the ith field and ccpixeln k the cc value in the nth pixel of the kth map the absolute maximum canopy cover cci max for each season was calculated by solving the max ccti function table 5 continuously the ccx of each season was calculated as the mean of the ccti values that do not deviate more than 5 from the ccmax accordingly in each field the ccx was considered to be reached when the difference between two successive values in the ccti vector is equal or lower than 5 while the beginning of the senescence stage when this difference becomes again greater than 5 in field 1 ccx was found to be 2 4 lower than that the other fields this is related to the lower plant density observed in this filed 6 7 plants m2 due to the damage occurred by νoctuidae during young plants establishment despite the fact that there is no direct relationship between ccx and plants density it is considered as a fact that plant density affects ccx value paredes et al 2014 reported a ccx equal to 96 with a corresponding plant density 8 2 plants m2 while ahmadi et al 2015 and katerji et al 2013 found a ccx equal to 90 for plant densities 6 6 and 5 0 plants m2 respectively although ccx cdc cdc and gdds to senescence are considered as conservative parameters when they are assessed through the remotely acquired cct they were found to fluctuate considerably specifically cgc was found to range from 9 3 day to 18 day a substantial difference of almost 10 day the default crop file value is 16 3 day while other researchers have reported cgc values ranging from 12 5 to 19 9 day abedinpour et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2015 mohamed sallah et al 2019 sandhu and irmak 2019 on the other hand cdc show values ranging from 6 3 to 7 1 day very close to the 6 5 day reported by ahmadi et al 2015 3 2 model performance under real farming conditions 3 2 1 canopy cover when the calibrated maize crop file was used the aquacrop model managed to simulate the cc development through the 2019 season very satisfactorily fig 3 when compared with the field measured cc values the model achieved an almost identical performance with r2 and ef values equal to 1 accordingly the rmse and rrmse indices were found equal to 2 03 and 5 31 respectively in the case of the statistical analysis between the model s simulated cc and the cct1 the obtained results were again nearly optimum with r2 and ef scoring a 0 98 and rmse and rrmse resulting in values slightly higher than those in the case of field measured cc 4 53 7 17 the use of the calibrated crop file with the minor modifications in the emergence dates gave fair results when validated with fields 2 3 and 4 datasets fig 4a c e table 6 in the case of field 2 the rrmse was found to be lower than 10 indicating an excellent model performance while the index values were among 10 and 20 for fields 3 and 4 showing a good calibrated crop file capability to simulate cc the r2 and ef showed values between 0 94 and 0 98 and 0 95 0 98 respectively confirming the fine tuning between the simulated and remotely measured cc the model s capability to simulate cc was further improved when the field specific ccx cdc cdc and gdds to senescence values obtained from sentinel 2 cct time series table 5 were ingested in the crop file fig 4b d f rrmse index was in all cases lower than 10 characterizing the simulations as excellent table 6 moreover r2 and ef took values greater than 0 98 the improvement was more obvious in field 3 where the modifications in the crop file achieved to reduce the rrmse index by more than 10 from 15 74 down to 3 38 this improvement is mainly attributed to the modification in cgc in field 3 a light hailstorm occurred in late may das 30 47 and maybe this explains the delay observed in cc development when compared to the initial calibrated crop file fig 4c d at this point it should be mentioned that due to the presence of clouds over the fields 1 and 2 from das 40 to das 60 just one satellite image was acquired for both fields during this time period fig 4a c unfortunately this period is characterized from the canopy s rapid development and its monitoring is considered as vital for the robust assessment of the overall plants development this fact reveals the weakness introduced by the uncertain weather conditions to any approach that relies solely in satellite images for the evaluation of crop water needs and development the capability of the calibrated aquacrop model to simulate properly the cc variability that was found in this work is similar to the findings of other studies when they used aquacrop model to simulate maize cc development under rainfed limited and full irrigation conditions sandhu and irmak 2019 reported rmses ranging from 4 80 to 13 40 and r2 values larger than 0 84 similarly paredes et al 2014 for various irrigation schedules found rmses between 4 60 and 6 60 r2 larger than 0 95 and ef larger than 0 93 moreover studies that were conducted in tropical and semi arid environments abedinpour et al 2012 greaves and wang 2016 reported rmses r2 and ef ranging from 0 81 to 16 0 89 0 98 and 0 60 0 95 respectively 3 2 2 soil water content overall the swc simulation was found to be fair during the 2018 calibration season despite an overestimation observed at the beginning and end of the season fig 5 table 7 the model followed the upward and downward trends of the swc rather closely rrmse index was lower than 10 indicating excellent performance nevertheless the r2 was found to be 0 79 marginally lower than the 0 80 value that is proposed as a threshold for an acceptable swc model simulation performance ma et al 2015 while ef 0 76 was well above the corresponding performance limit of 0 70 the model achieved a fair performance for the datasets of field 2 and 3 as well with rrme constantly below 10 and r2 and ef taking values above 0 81 and 0 74 respectively however r2 and ef never exceeded 0 90 and 0 80 respectively revealing that in some sense the model s capability to simulate swc is limited in field 2 fig 6a the model again seemed to overestimate the swc at the beginning of the season as well as between das 90 and 110 on the contrary in field 3 the aquacrop underestimated the swc from das 80 to das 90 the overestimations that were observed in the cases of field 1 and field 2 at the beginning of the season could be attributed to the fact that the initial soil water content was lower than the assumed 90 fc or to the soil disturbance and a potential soil water evaporation during moisture sensors installation moreover the presented measurements are integrating sensor biases and or random errors as well as errors introduced by the formula used to transform the raw volumetric water content measurements to mm of water section 2 1 aquacrop performance did not change notably when the re calibrated crop files were used and not striking differences were observed in the simulation patterns fig 6b d in the case of field 2 rrmse was reduced slightly and r2 increased from 0 86 to 0 88 on the other hand ef reduced marginally from 0 74 down to 0 72 when regarding field 3 both r2 and ef reduced slightly and rrmse increased table 7 however in all the cases rrmse remained below 10 and r2 and ef larger than the good performance thresholds of 0 80 and 0 70 respectively similar findings are presented in previous works paredes et al 2014 argued that the capability of aquacrop model to simulate swc is unstable reporting r2 and ef values ranging from 0 59 to 0 88 and 0 03 0 72 respectively sandhu and irmak 2019 found that while in the calibration season the model simulated swc with high accuracy r2 0 86 ef 0 83 rrmse 7 30 during validation the results varied greatly 0 00 r2 0 88 21 40 ef 0 84 3 00 rrmse 29 60 on the contrary ahmadi et al 2015 argued that aquacrop successively simulated the soil water dynamics within the rooting zone reporting rmse values 0 01 0 37 m3 m 3 3 2 3 final biomass and yield for the 2018 calibration season the model simulated b rather accurately with the difference between the measured and simulated values to be just 0 001 tn ha table 8 similarly the y was simulated with fair accuracy with the pe index to be equal to 3 12 nevertheless when the model tested against the datasets of fields 2 3 and 4 differences up to 2 622 tn ha and 1 652 tn ha and pe values equal to 12 76 and 12 76 were found between the measured and simulated b and y respectively table 8 in the cases of field 2 and 4 the model underestimated the final accumulated b and produced y whilst in the case of field 3 overestimated them when the remotely sensed re calibrated crop files were used the aquacrop performance was remarkably improved the most striking improvement was observed in the case of field 2 where the difference in measured and simulated b dropped from 1 218 tn ha to 0 311 tn ha and the pe from 4 98 to 1 27 accordingly the difference in the measured and simulated y decreased to 0 262 tn ha and the corresponding pe from 5 39 to 1 69 despite the fact that the simulation of b and y was improved for field 3 as well the simulated values were still substantially different from those measured showing a difference in b up to 2 506 tn ha whilst the difference regarding y was up to 1 265 tn ha and the pe equal to 12 76 table 8 no clear reasons for this discrepancy could be given but a hypothesis that the assumption of optimal fertilization maybe violated by a potential leaching of nitrates below the rooting zone during the urea application in early june as a result of the high field s soil hydraulic conductivity ksat 577 4 mm d and the frequent irrigation events every fourth day that occurred during this period high residual errors regarding the model s capability to simulate b and y have been found to other studies too rmses up to 3 50 tn ha 2 21 tn ha and 2 60 tn ha were reported for y simulations by paredes et al 2014 ahmadi et al 2015 and sandhu and irmak 2019 respectively while abedinpour et al 2012 and hsiao et al 2009 indicated rmses ranging from 0 11 to 6 18 tn ha for b moreover katerji et al 2013 found pe values equal to 15 20 and 13 30 when compared measured and simulated b and y whilst greaves and wang 2016 pe that ranges from 4 30 to 7 70 tn ha and 2 00 4 90 tn ha for b and y respectively overall models improved performance in the case of the re calibrated crop files appears strongly connected to the improvement in the cc simulation that was observed when the re calibrated crop files were used section 3 2 1 the strong interconnection between optimal cc simulation and b and y estimations is prominent in eqs 4 7 in this framework paredes et al 2014 discussed the paramount importance of model s cc simulation by stating that the proper cc estimation is a major requisite for the model to produce good estimates of soil evaporation crop transpiration and biomass and hence good yield predictions however at the current version of the model the cc development could be changed only indirectly by adjusting ccx cgc cdc and gdds to senescence parameters making the in season cc assimilation difficult an off season direct cc assimilation for potato and cotton crops in aquacrop model has been already reported linker and ioslovich 2017 as alternative options aquacrop os foster et al 2017 or aquacrop r rodriguez and ober 2019 appear promising but more studies are needed to assess their accuracy and precision 4 conclusions in this study we initially locally calibrated aquacrop model maize crop file and then we assessed its capability to simulate adequately the maize crop cycle in greece under variable climate conditions and different soil types for the validation process sentinel 2 cc time series field development stages observations and field swc b and y measurements were used finally the possibility to improve field operational monitoring in terms of cc swc final b and final y estimations through sentinel 2 acquired cc time series was studied to do so the satellite acquired cc time series for each field was used to modify dynamically within cultivation period the ccx cgc cdc and gdds to senescence crop file input parameters the results showed that when calibrated with local field measurements the model achieved to simulate cc and swc with fair accuracy for all the datasets by adjusting only the observed emergence day moreover sentinel 2 acquired cc time series were proved to be essential tools for the validation of aquacrop when field cc measurements were absent however in the case of b and y estimations the model showed a robust performance only in field 1 and field 4 the ingestion of the remotely re calibrated parameters in the crop file improved remarkably the model s performance to simulate cc and subsequently a substantial improvement was observed in the final b and final y estimations nevertheless the ingestion of the adjusted parameters was not found to affect negatively or positively the model s performance in swc the results of this study showed that even parameters that are considered conservative may vary moderately in time and space while their in season adjustment could improve the overall model performance the continuous improvement in the satellite products in terms of temporal and special resolution promises in the near future an even more dense vis time series minimizing the potentially adverse impact that the cloud cover could have on the series smoothness taking the latter into consideration in conjunction with the findings of this study the model developers may should consider for the next version to convert cc from an output to an input parameter this way the in season assimilation of remotely acquired or field measured cc series would be easily inserted into the model improving its overall performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9972,silicon si supplementation is related to the induction of different tolerance mechanisms leading to higher farm crop yields the objective of this study was to elucidate the si action mechanisms as a beneficial element in primary antioxidant and osmoregulatory metabolism in sorghum plants cultivated in soil under two different water availability conditions plants of the sorghum brs332 genotype sensitive to drought were cultivated in pots in greenhouse conditions until harvest at the pre flowering stage the following treatments were applied field capacity irrigated plants water deficit field capacity with si application and water deficit with si application water deficit was conducted over 12 days after which water potential and photosynthetic rate analyses and leaf and root harvesting for biochemical analyses were performed after the water deficit treatment all plants were returned to normal irrigation until harvest when the yield components were analyzed si supply occurred via fertilization at a concentration of 2 mm applied to the soil in a volume of 250 ml per day over 17 days which corresponded to a supply on the five days preceding the beginning of stress plus a 12 day supply during the stress period si alleviated the water deficit in plants resulting in higher water potential photosynthetic rate grain biomass and harvest index si increased the antioxidant enzymatic activity and increased non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate and osmoregulatory substances including proline soluble and reducing sugars and sucrose plants treated with si showed lower damage to cell membranes lower lipid peroxidation the beneficial effects of si also extended to plants that were not subjected to the water deficit treatment si uses the peroxide pathway as a signal to regulate metabolic responses keywords carbohydrates peroxidase grain biomass sorghum bicolor lipid peroxidation 1 introduction agriculture has been suffering pressure on selection due to the demand for more productive and tolerant plant species under water deficit crespo herrera et al 2018 sorghum bicolor l has emerged as a crop plant with high potential because it represents the fifth most important grain yield worldwide sorghum shows higher tolerance to water deficit conditions than other cereals such as maize approximately 85 of global sorghum cultivation is concentrated in dry environments assefa et al 2010 and is one of the main sources of food for humans in the dry regions of asia and africa venkateswaran et al 2019 similar to other crops water deficit conditions decrease sorghum production with the impairment being more severe when the water deficit occurs during the pre flowering stage of development kothari et al 2020 the negative effects of water deficit on plants begin when plant water loss to the atmosphere is greater than its absorption from the soil in this scenario the leaf water potential ψmd is reduced and there is a reduction in stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation avila et al 2016 in addition there is a reduction in the activity of saccharolytic enzymes mainly in cell wall acid invertases compromising carbon partitioning from the leaves to the sink organs chen et al 2019 du et al 2020 there is an accumulation of reducing sugars rs soluble sugars and starch in the leaves and a decrease in carbohydrate supply for growing reproductive organs thus there is an impairment in plant yield due to panicles with fewer and more empty grains dong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 water deficit compromises nitrogen metabolism and alters the protein and amino acid aa content quantitatively and qualitatively which might be a physiological adjustment to alleviate the harmful effects of water deficit on plant metabolism bhargava and sawant 2013 explicit quantitative alterations have been reported in proline content a multifunctional inert and compatible aa proline accumulation is highly related to osmotic regulation and protein stabilization in leaves and roots during water deficit bandurska et al 2017 meena et al 2019 in addition to aa plants under water deficit accumulate other sugars as compatible solutes to help in osmotic adjustment zhang et al 2017 under stress conditions such as water deficit reactive oxygen species ros production including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in chloroplasts peroxisomes mitochondria and cytosol occurs despite the role of ros in many different signaling pathways for stress tolerance when their generation rate is much higher than their removal they can be toxic to cell metabolism causing oxidative stress anjum et al 2017 hasanuzzaman et al 2019 to cope with oxidative stress water deficit tolerant plants possess a sophisticated system of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant defenses sun et al 2018 enzymatic defense occurs via superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat guaiacol peroxidase pod and ascorbate glutathione cycle enzyme activities including ascorbate peroxidase apx dehydroascorbate reductase dhar monodehydroascorbate reductase mdhar and glutathione reductase anjum et al 2017 zia et al 2021 besides eliminating h2o2 the ascorbate glutathione cycle is important for energy dissipation because during its activity there is energy consumption derived from ferredoxin or nadph by the action of mdhar and glutathione reductase enzymes besides being an enzymatic co factor ascorbate can eliminate 1o2 o2 and oh directly hasanuzzaman et al 2019 proline and soluble sugars can also participate as non enzymatic antioxidants as they are involved in the neutralization of different ros rehman et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 despite the morpho anatomical and physiological modifications that allow plant survival under stress conditions crop yield is still decreased by water deficit a commonly used practice is the application of substances that mitigate the effects of abiotic stress in plants li et al 2018 rabêlo et al 2019 thorne et al 2020 silicon si plays an important role in the development of several species and its strongest effects are observed in plants under biotic or abiotic stresses avila et al 2019 etesami and jeong 2018 li et al 2018 si accumulation in the rhizosphere and in plants can alleviate the unfavorable effects of stresses such as drought heavy metals and nutritional imbalance by inducing different tolerance mechanisms leading to a greater accumulation of biomass and higher crop yield li et al 2018 in general the better performance of plants treated with si under water deficit is due to better physiological performance culminating in higher yield these plants show higher responses to antioxidant enzymes higher accumulation of compatible solutes lower cell damage and higher water content nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity suggesting the mitigating role of si in plants under water deficit esmaili et al 2020 ibrahim et al 2020 although studies on si application in plants have been published there has been limited research regarding sorghum cultivation at different reproductive stages and cultivated in soil instead of nutrient solution for rice si supplementation is economically feasible because si is an essential nutrient alvarez and datnoff 2001 however for sorghum plants information on yield components and root and leaf physiology associated with si under water deficit has not been obtained systematically in addition few studies have aimed to understand the beneficial effects of si on plant physiology under non stress conditions hence the objective of the present study was to elucidate the si action mechanisms as a beneficial element in primary antioxidant and osmoregulatory metabolism in sorghum plants cultivated in the soil under two different water availability

replacement by irrigation was performed based on the readings taken with the sensor and the water was replaced to field capacity during the period preceding the start of the treatment water replacement calculations were performed using an electronic spreadsheet based on the soil water retention curve correction base and top dressing fertilization were made based on soil chemical analyses according to crop demand the plants were subjected to the following treatments field capacity fc water deficit wd fc si and wd si fc and fc si treatments maintained soil water tension close to 18 kpa during the entire cycle in the wd and wd si treatments when the plants reached the pre flowering stage the soil water tension was reduced to 138 kpa which corresponds to 50 of the available water and was maintained at this level for 12 days de souza et al 2013 si was supplied by fertirrigation from silício foliar potassium silicate which is a commercial product containing 12 si a solution of 2 mm

variables was determined using pearson s correlation coefficient p 0 05 3 results after 12 days of wd there was a drastic reduction in the ψmd of the sorghum plants in the wd treatment compared to those in the fc treatment table 1 however the plants treated with si had higher values of ψmd than the plants that did not receive si both under wd and fc conditions similar results were found for p n gdm and hi of these plants with higher values in fc plants followed by fc si wd si and wd the beneficial action of si was evident in both fc and wd plants analysis of primary metabolism revealed that wd conditions promoted alterations in carbohydrate distribution patterns table 2 in the leaves of the plants under wd there was an increase in starch tss rs and sucrose content compared to their respective irrigated controls fc the leaves treated with si showed higher starch except for fc si tss rs and sucrose levels compared to the leaves not treated with si regardless of water regime in the roots results comparable to those reported in the leaves were observed i e an increase in the starch tss and sucrose content in plants under wd compared to their respective irrigated controls fc table 2 the plants treated with si also showed higher amounts of starch compared with the plants not treated under both water conditions unlike starch the highest tss and sucrose levels were reported in plants under wd conditions and not treated with si the rs level in the roots was not influenced by si treatment the total protein levels increased in the leaves of plants treated with si with a more significant increase in the plants under fc fc si followed by wd wd si table 2 wd with si application induced an increase in the total aa levels in the leaves the proline level and proline aa ratio increased with wd regardless of the treatment with si however under these water conditions plants not treated with si had higher proline levels and a higher proline aa ratio compared to plants treated with si in contrast there was no difference in the proline levels or the proline aa ratio between the fc treatments table 2 in the roots the total proteins and aa levels were increased in the wd treatment table 2 si application only improved the amount of total protein in fc si compared to untreated plants wd was also an important factor because the highest aa levels were reported in plants under stress not treated with si table 2 in addition there was an increase in the proline and proline aa ratio in the roots due to wd however si led to a lower production of proline and proline aa ratio in plants under wd si compared to plants under wd si application did not influence the proline content or the proline aa ratio in plants under fc wd and si also substantially influenced enzymatic antioxidant metabolism in leaves the activity of antioxidant enzymes was increased by wd fig 1 in addition sod apx cat and dhar activities fig 1a d showed a more pronounced increase under si application wd si under fc the effects of si on these enzymatic antioxidant activities were not reported the apx and cat activities fig 1b c showed similar patterns where si application increased the activity under wd and fc compared to the untreated plants the mdhar and pod activities fig 1e f were increased by wd however si application did not affect their activity thus modulation by si in apx and cat activities was observed because si application improved the activity of these peroxidases independently of the water condition of the plants wd or fc in the roots the sod fig 2a dhar fig 2d and pod fig 2f activities were enhanced by si application under wd wd si cat activity fig 2c was not affected by the treatments apx fig 2b and mdhar fig 2e activities were increased by wd and si application under fc and wd wd increased ascorbate levels only in the leaves fig 3a moreover si increased these levels in leaves under fc fc si and wd wd si being more expressive under wd in the roots fig 3b an increase in ascorbate the levels occurred only under wd si regarding lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde level wd increased lipid peroxidation in the leaves fig 4a and roots fig 4b the plants that received si supplementation under wd wd si showed lower lipid peroxidation than the untreated plants in the leaves and roots in addition si supplementation reduced lipid peroxidation in the leaves of plants under fc fc si compared to the untreated plants fc in contrast the h2o2 levels in the leaves followed the same response of lipid peroxidation in the leaves with an increase in the levels in the wd treatment and reduction of these in the irrigated fc si and stressed plants wd si that received si fig 4c conversely in the roots the si treatment elevated the h2o2 concentration regardless of the water regime to which they were exposed wd si or fc si fig 4d 4 discussion soil water deficit compromises plant growth and production because it promotes metabolic disorders that harm important processes such as photosynthesis carbon partitioning nitrogen respiration and metabolism zia et al 2021 the importance of water for sorghum plant yield was confirmed by the high positive correlations between ψmd and hi 0 96 and gdm 0 98 however the negative effects of water deficit have been mitigated by the application of si in plants from different species alzahrani et al 2018 biju et al 2017 cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for sorghum the species of interest in the present study mineral supplementation with si reduced the negative effects of water deficit on plant metabolism and positively affected metabolism and production of plants under fc irrigated conditions plants supplemented with si showed higher starch tss rs and sucrose levels in their leaves this increase can be explained by the higher photosynthetic index of these plants because a higher production of photoassimilates contributes to higher photosynthesis and accumulation of these carbohydrates in the leaves and roots ogbaga et al 2014 sugars also have play a role in antioxidant and osmotic adjustment in plants under water deficit contributing to the maintenance of tissue turgidity zhang et al 2017 therefore the increase in the sugar content in leaves might have promoted greater protection of cell membranes the negative correlations between starch and mda 0 57 and h2o2 0 48 content endorsed the role of sugars as antioxidants in preventing oxidative stress under water deficit however there were positive correlations between rs and mda 0 59 and h2o2 0 54 content sugars might have contributed to increasing the water potential in cells stimulating an increase in cellular homeostasis and therefore in the photosynthesis of these plants regarding the higher accumulation of carbohydrates in the leaves and roots of plants under wd wd was imposed during the pre flowering stage when the growing reproductive organs were the strongest sink for sorghum plants under water deficit the plant loses its carbon partitioning efficiency and accumulates more carbohydrates in the leaves stems and roots compromising the development of the reproductive organs avila et al 2016 lavinsky et al 2015 the alteration in carbon partitioning under water deficit was related to reduction in the activity of cell wall invertases which alter the glucose gradient and lead to impairment of reproductive processes in different plant species chen et al 2019 dong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 in sorghum plants the higher content of sugars was also responsible for higher plant production as there were high negative correlations between gdm and hi with tss 0 77 0 76 rs 0 77 0 76 and sucrose 0 63 0 63 content respectively this confirms the importance of sugar translocation from vegetative to reproductive organs allowing higher investment in crop production under low water potential a drastic reduction in the activity of wall acid invertase in the carpel of maize grains also occurs therefore there is a reduction in sucrose discharge which affects the development of the embryo and the accumulation of starch in the endosperm of the seed zinselmeier et al 1999 si treatment promoted an increase in gdm and hi of sorghum plants the plants under wd si accumulated greater amounts of carbohydrates than the untreated plants and showed higher carbon partitioning efficiency as demonstrated by hi leading to a higher grain production therefore the greater water potential of the plants treated with si contributed to providing better carbohydrate partitioning to the grains compared to the untreated plants si positively influenced the protein levels in the leaves compared to the untreated plants this increase might have resulted from the stimulus to biosynthesis in the proteins of the photochemical apparatus and in the proteins that participated in the biochemical process of carbon assimilation or antioxidant enzymes in the roots due to osmotic and hydraulic adjustment an increase in the content of channel proteins such as aquaporins garg et al 2018 and osmotic adjustment proteins such as late embryogenesis abundant proteins zamora briseño and de jiménez 2016 and dehydrins and other proteins related to the tolerance to tissue desiccation osakabe et al 2014 might have occurred however protein dynamics in response to si treatment might be better elucidated via proteomic analysis because enzymatic activity might occur due to the increase in the levels of substrate and activation kinetics and an increase in its pool bisswanger 2014 the osmotic adjustment process might be related to the accumulation of osmolytes such as soluble sugars proteins proline and glycine betaine zia et al 2021 the highest aa levels in the present study were reported in the leaves of plants in the wd si treatment and in the roots of plants in the wd treatment the osmotic adjustment of sorghum plants under wd and si application was demonstrated by the negative correlations between water potential and starch 0 36 tss 0 79 rs 0 79 sucrose 0 66 and proline 0 55 contents and the proline aa ratio 0 83 the proline content in the leaves and roots of plants in the wd treatment was up to 85 higher than that in the plants in the fc treatment proline is a multifunctional aa in cellular metabolism under environmental stress conditions meena et al 2019 therefore proline can act as an inert and compatible osmotic agent contributing to osmotic adjustment of the tissue proline can also act as an antioxidant molecule capable of disabling singlet oxygen which is highly toxic to cellular metabolism hayat et al 2012 kaur and asthir 2015 based on our findings proline was more related to osmotic adjustment than to antioxidant activity in sorghum plants because there was a negative correlation between proline and water potential 0 55 and positive correlations between proline and mda 0 83 and h2o2 0 79 levels moreover it acts as a molecular chaperone by stabilizing proteins and avoiding their misconfiguration and agglomeration hayat et al 2012 szabados and savouré 2010 finally the proline biosynthesis process consumes reducing equivalents contributing to redox homeostasis and lower ros formation this function is very important under water stress conditions because of the high production of ros in the chloroplasts by photosynthesis ros are also generated in the mitochondria during respiration and in peroxisomes due to lipid hydrolysis or photorespiration which may cause serious oxidative damage to the cells if not controlled meena et al 2019 zia et al 2021 there was a reduction in total aa and proline levels in wd si plants compared to the untreated plants si supplementation in sorghum under wd stimulates osmoregulatory metabolism via sugars highlighted in the present study in tss rs and sucrose which could explain the lower proline level in the si treatments the plants treated with si showed a reduction in the amount of tss proline and aa despite being subjected to wd nevertheless wd si plants showed higher water potential and lower cellular damage than wd plants the mitigation of water deficit by si might be explained by the fact that the si application leads to the accumulation of this element in plants alzahrani et al 2018 biju et al 2017 more specifically in cell walls therefore si might be deposited in the cell walls strengthening them and protecting cell membranes coskun et al 2016 which makes them less vulnerable to water deficit enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant systems are physiological mechanisms that are highly related to water deficit tolerance as they are responsible for eliminating ros anjum et al 2017 verma et al 2020 si has been shown to promote antioxidant enzymatic activity and induce water deficit tolerance in other plant species alzahrani et al 2018 cao et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 in our study the capacity of si to induce tolerance to drought in sorghum was observed because stressed plants supplemented with si showed mainly in the leaves higher activity of sod cat apx dhar mdhar and pod sod plays an important role as it acts on the superoxide anion dismutase therefore while eliminating the highly harmful ros o2 it produces hydrogen peroxide which at low concentrations is an important secondary messenger gupta et al 2016 hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis may still occur through the photorespiratory pathway which can be intensified during water deficit thus when the two pathways are intensified the h2o2 pool may inevitably reach levels that are toxic to metabolism with the increase in h2o2 the first enzymes to act are those that are part of the ascorbate glutathione cycle apx dhar mdhar and gr where h2o2 is reduced to water and oxygen by apx however with an increase in h2o2 concentration a reduction in apx activity occurs due to a negative feedback mechanism hasanuzzaman et al 2019 cat and pod act on the detoxification of high concentrations of h2o2 thus during water deficit the sorghum plants showed a triple defense in the elimination of h2o2 because they elevated the activity of apx cat and pod peroxidases this defense mechanism of the antioxidant system was even more efficient in plants treated with si the synchronicity of the enzymes was observed by the positive correlations between the sod and cat 0 77 sod and dhar 0 95 cat and dhar 0 77 sod and mdhar 0 91 cat and mdhar 0 70 and apx and mdhar 0 89 activities moreover antioxidant enzymes have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in sorghum plants under water deficit conditions there were negative correlations between the activities of sod 0 78 cat 0 76 dhar 0 84 and mdhar 0 72 with mda content in plants thus an increase in antioxidant activity reduced cell damage in sorghum plants the non enzymatic antioxidant system was also used by sorghum plants as a mechanism of response to drought via greater production of ascorbate mainly in plants treated with si the participation of this low molecular weight compound is related to the neutralization of ros that may occur via the participation in two dynamic pathways enzymatic and non enzymatic hasanuzzaman et al 2019 in the enzymatic pathway ascorbate acts as an enzymatic co factor in the ascorbate glutathione cycle which in addition to acting on the elimination of ros contributes to the dissipation of excess photochemical energy occurring in the leaves during water deficit suo et al 2017 our findings suggest the involvement of asa as an enzymatic co factor in sorghum plants despite the increase in ascorbate levels there was a positive correlation between ascorbate and mda 0 89 however there was also a high negative correlation between asa level and sod 0 79 dhar 0 85 and mdhar 0 75 suggesting that the consumption of asa is related to high antioxidant enzyme activity in the non enzymatic pathway ascorbate acts by regenerating the tocopherol from tocopheroxyl as a membrane protective mechanism ahmad et al 2010 ascorbate also acts as a violaxanthin de epoxidase co factor supporting the dissipation of excess excitation energy in an extremely important process to prevent ros formation under stress conditions foyer and noctor 2005 si application in sorghum plants under water deficit promoted antioxidant enzymatic activity and ascorbate production hence the efficiency of this antioxidant system in neutralizing ros could be proven by the reduced membrane damage however in the roots of plants treated with si despite the lower mda formation there was a greater production of h2o2 compared to untreated plants thus one of the si signal lines in plants might be the h2o2 pathway so that hydrogen peroxide is possibly produced to act as a stress signaling response agent ros especially hydrogen peroxide have been proposed as key components in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses singh et al 2019 in addition to mitigating the effects of water deficit in sorghum the beneficial effects of si in irrigated plants were observed in the present study si promoted antioxidant enzymatic activity in the leaves and roots and increased the ascorbate pool and tss in the leaves hence the oxidative stress expressed in mda levels was lower in the leaves and roots of the plants treated with si than in the untreated plants these observations strengthen the role of si as an important element as a tolerance induction factor for water deficit and beneficial to the growth of sorghum under proper water conditions epstein 1999 this observation is important because throughout their lifetime plants are subjected to countless environmental stress agents in higher or lower intensities however isolated or combined stressful conditions reduce the potential yield of different crop plants including sorghum thus fertilization with si is a feasible and inexpensive alternative to improve the performance of agricultural crops in the field coskun et al 2016 si promoted positive effects on the enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant systems and the osmoregulatory system all of which are of extreme importance for the continued growth development and production of plants under stress conditions caused by water shortages this justifies the greater production of grains observed in the sorghum plants treated with si in addition the capacity of this element to induce tolerance to water deficit in plants including sorghum and to act as a beneficial factor in irrigated plants has been reiterated 5 conclusion si mitigates water deficit in sorghum by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity non enzymatic antioxidants and osmoprotective substances plants treated with si showed lower damage to membranes which was confirmed by lower lipid peroxidation the beneficial effects of si extended to plants that were not subjected to water deficit because the application of si increased the

9972,silicon si supplementation is related to the induction of different tolerance mechanisms leading to higher farm crop yields the objective of this study was to elucidate the si action mechanisms as a beneficial element in primary antioxidant and osmoregulatory metabolism in sorghum plants cultivated in soil under two different water availability conditions plants of the sorghum brs332 genotype sensitive to drought were cultivated in pots in greenhouse conditions until harvest at the pre flowering stage the following treatments were applied field capacity irrigated plants water deficit field capacity with si application and water deficit with si application water deficit was conducted over 12 days after which water potential and photosynthetic rate analyses and leaf and root harvesting for biochemical analyses were performed after the water deficit treatment all plants were returned to normal irrigation until harvest when the yield components were analyzed si supply occurred via fertilization at a concentration of 2 mm applied to the soil in a volume of 250 ml per day over 17 days which corresponded to a supply on the five days preceding the beginning of stress plus a 12 day supply during the stress period si alleviated the water deficit in plants resulting in higher water potential photosynthetic rate grain biomass and harvest index si increased the antioxidant enzymatic activity and increased non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate and osmoregulatory substances including proline soluble and reducing sugars and sucrose plants treated with si showed lower damage to cell membranes lower lipid peroxidation the beneficial effects of si also extended to plants that were not subjected to the water deficit treatment si uses the peroxide pathway as a signal to regulate metabolic responses keywords carbohydrates peroxidase grain biomass sorghum bicolor lipid peroxidation 1 introduction agriculture has been suffering pressure on selection due to the demand for more productive and tolerant plant species under water deficit crespo herrera et al 2018 sorghum bicolor l has emerged as a crop plant with high potential because it represents the fifth most important grain yield worldwide sorghum shows higher tolerance to water deficit conditions than other cereals such as maize approximately 85 of global sorghum cultivation is concentrated in dry environments assefa et al 2010 and is one of the main sources of food for humans in the dry regions of asia and africa venkateswaran et al 2019 similar to other crops water deficit conditions decrease sorghum production with the impairment being more severe when the water deficit occurs during the pre flowering stage of development kothari et al 2020 the negative effects of water deficit on plants begin when plant water loss to the atmosphere is greater than its absorption from the soil in this scenario the leaf water potential ψmd is reduced and there is a reduction in stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation avila et al 2016 in addition there is a reduction in the activity of saccharolytic enzymes mainly in cell wall acid invertases compromising carbon partitioning from the leaves to the sink organs chen et al 2019 du et al 2020 there is an accumulation of reducing sugars rs soluble sugars and starch in the leaves and a decrease in carbohydrate supply for growing reproductive organs thus there is an impairment in plant yield due to panicles with fewer and more empty grains dong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 water deficit compromises nitrogen metabolism and alters the protein and amino acid aa content quantitatively and qualitatively which might be a physiological adjustment to alleviate the harmful effects of water deficit on plant metabolism bhargava and sawant 2013 explicit quantitative alterations have been reported in proline content a multifunctional inert and compatible aa proline accumulation is highly related to osmotic regulation and protein stabilization in leaves and roots during water deficit bandurska et al 2017 meena et al 2019 in addition to aa plants under water deficit accumulate other sugars as compatible solutes to help in osmotic adjustment zhang et al 2017 under stress conditions such as water deficit reactive oxygen species ros production including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in chloroplasts peroxisomes mitochondria and cytosol occurs despite the role of ros in many different signaling pathways for stress tolerance when their generation rate is much higher than their removal they can be toxic to cell metabolism causing oxidative stress anjum et al 2017 hasanuzzaman et al 2019 to cope with oxidative stress water deficit tolerant plants possess a sophisticated system of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant defenses sun et al 2018 enzymatic defense occurs via superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat guaiacol peroxidase pod and ascorbate glutathione cycle enzyme activities including ascorbate peroxidase apx dehydroascorbate reductase dhar monodehydroascorbate reductase mdhar and glutathione reductase anjum et al 2017 zia et al 2021 besides eliminating h2o2 the ascorbate glutathione cycle is important for energy dissipation because during its activity there is energy consumption derived from ferredoxin or nadph by the action of mdhar and glutathione reductase enzymes besides being an enzymatic co factor ascorbate can eliminate 1o2 o2 and oh directly hasanuzzaman et al 2019 proline and soluble sugars can also participate as non enzymatic antioxidants as they are involved in the neutralization of different ros rehman et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 despite the morpho anatomical and physiological modifications that allow plant survival under stress conditions crop yield is still decreased by water deficit a commonly used practice is the application of substances that mitigate the effects of abiotic stress in plants li et al 2018 rabêlo et al 2019 thorne et al 2020 silicon si plays an important role in the development of several species and its strongest effects are observed in plants under biotic or abiotic stresses avila et al 2019 etesami and jeong 2018 li et al 2018 si accumulation in the rhizosphere and in plants can alleviate the unfavorable effects of stresses such as drought heavy metals and nutritional imbalance by inducing different tolerance mechanisms leading to a greater accumulation of biomass and higher crop yield li et al 2018 in general the better performance of plants treated with si under water deficit is due to better physiological performance culminating in higher yield these plants show higher responses to antioxidant enzymes higher accumulation of compatible solutes lower cell damage and higher water content nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity suggesting the mitigating role of si in plants under water deficit esmaili et al 2020 ibrahim et al 2020 although studies on si application in plants have been published there has been limited research regarding sorghum cultivation at different reproductive stages and cultivated in soil instead of nutrient solution for rice si supplementation is economically feasible because si is an essential nutrient alvarez and datnoff 2001 however for sorghum plants information on yield components and root and leaf physiology associated with si under water deficit has not been obtained systematically in addition few studies have aimed to understand the beneficial effects of si on plant physiology under non stress conditions hence the objective of the present study was to elucidate the si action mechanisms as a beneficial element in primary antioxidant and osmoregulatory metabolism in sorghum plants cultivated in the soil under two different water availability

replacement calculations were performed using an electronic spreadsheet based on the soil water retention curve correction base and top dressing fertilization were made based on soil chemical analyses according to crop demand the plants were subjected to the following treatments field capacity fc water deficit wd fc si and wd si fc and fc si treatments maintained soil water tension close to 18 kpa during the entire cycle in the wd and wd si treatments when the plants reached the pre flowering stage the soil water tension was reduced to 138 kpa which corresponds to 50 of the available water and was maintained at this level for 12 days de souza et al 2013 si was supplied by fertirrigation from silício foliar potassium silicate which is a commercial product containing 12 si a solution of 2 mm

variables was determined using pearson s correlation coefficient p 0 05 3 results after 12 days of wd there was a drastic reduction in the ψmd of the sorghum plants in the wd treatment compared to those in the fc treatment table 1 however the plants treated with si had higher values of ψmd than the plants that did not receive si both under wd and fc conditions similar results were found for p n gdm and hi of these plants with higher values in fc plants followed by fc si wd si and wd the beneficial action of si was evident in both fc and wd plants analysis of primary metabolism revealed that wd conditions promoted alterations in carbohydrate distribution patterns table 2 in the leaves of the plants under wd there was an increase in starch tss rs and sucrose content compared to their respective irrigated controls fc the leaves treated with si showed higher starch except for fc si tss rs and sucrose levels compared to the leaves not treated with si regardless of water regime in the roots results comparable to those reported in the leaves were observed i e an increase in the starch tss and sucrose content in plants under wd compared to their respective irrigated controls fc table 2 the plants treated with si also showed higher amounts of starch compared with the plants not treated under both water conditions unlike starch the highest tss and sucrose levels were reported in plants under wd conditions and not treated with si the rs level in the roots was not influenced by si treatment the total protein levels increased in the leaves of plants treated with si with a more significant increase in the plants under fc fc si followed by wd wd si table 2 wd with si application induced an increase in the total aa levels in the leaves the proline level and proline aa ratio increased with wd regardless of the treatment with si however under these water conditions plants not treated with si had higher proline levels and a higher proline aa ratio compared to plants treated with si in contrast there was no difference in the proline levels or the proline aa ratio between the fc treatments table 2 in the roots the total proteins and aa levels were increased in the wd treatment table 2 si application only improved the amount of total protein in fc si compared to untreated plants wd was also an important factor because the highest aa levels were reported in plants under stress not treated with si table 2 in addition there was an increase in the proline and proline aa ratio in the roots due to wd however si led to a lower production of proline and proline aa ratio in plants under wd si compared to plants under wd si application did not influence the proline content or the proline aa ratio in plants under fc wd and si also substantially influenced enzymatic antioxidant metabolism in leaves the activity of antioxidant enzymes was increased by wd fig 1 in addition sod apx cat and dhar activities fig 1a d showed a more pronounced increase under si application wd si under fc the effects of si on these enzymatic antioxidant activities were not reported the apx and cat activities fig 1b c showed similar patterns where si application increased the activity under wd and fc compared to the untreated plants the mdhar and pod activities fig 1e f were increased by wd however si application did not affect their activity thus modulation by si in apx and cat activities was observed because si application improved the activity of these peroxidases independently of the water condition of the plants wd or fc in the roots the sod fig 2a dhar fig 2d and pod fig 2f activities were enhanced by si application under wd wd si cat activity fig 2c was not affected by the treatments apx fig 2b and mdhar fig 2e activities were increased by wd and si application under fc and wd wd increased ascorbate levels only in the leaves fig 3a moreover si increased these levels in leaves under fc fc si and wd wd si being more expressive under wd in the roots fig 3b an increase in ascorbate the levels occurred only under wd si regarding lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde level wd increased lipid peroxidation in the leaves fig 4a and roots fig 4b the plants that received si supplementation under wd wd si showed lower lipid peroxidation than the untreated plants in the leaves and roots in addition si supplementation reduced lipid peroxidation in the leaves of plants under fc fc si compared to the untreated plants fc in contrast the h2o2 levels in the leaves followed the same response of lipid peroxidation in the leaves with an increase in the levels in the wd treatment and reduction of these in the irrigated fc si and stressed plants wd si that received si fig 4c conversely in the roots the si treatment elevated the h2o2 concentration regardless of the water regime to which they were exposed wd si or fc si fig 4d 4 discussion soil water deficit compromises plant growth and production because it promotes metabolic disorders that harm important processes such as photosynthesis carbon partitioning nitrogen respiration and metabolism zia et al 2021 the importance of water for sorghum plant yield was confirmed by the high positive correlations between ψmd and hi 0 96 and gdm 0 98 however the negative effects of water deficit have been mitigated by the application of si in plants from different species alzahrani et al 2018 biju et al 2017 cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for sorghum the species of interest in the present study mineral supplementation with si reduced the negative effects of water deficit on plant metabolism and positively affected metabolism and production of plants under fc irrigated conditions plants supplemented with si showed higher starch tss rs and sucrose levels in their leaves this increase can be explained by the higher photosynthetic index of these plants because a higher production of photoassimilates contributes to higher photosynthesis and accumulation of these carbohydrates in the leaves and roots ogbaga et al 2014 sugars also have play a role in antioxidant and osmotic adjustment in plants under water deficit contributing to the maintenance of tissue turgidity zhang et al 2017 therefore the increase in the sugar content in leaves might have promoted greater protection of cell membranes the negative correlations between starch and mda 0 57 and h2o2 0 48 content endorsed the role of sugars as antioxidants in preventing oxidative stress under water deficit however there were positive correlations between rs and mda 0 59 and h2o2 0 54 content sugars might have contributed to increasing the water potential in cells stimulating an increase in cellular homeostasis and therefore in the photosynthesis of these plants regarding the higher accumulation of carbohydrates in the leaves and roots of plants under wd wd was imposed during the pre flowering stage when the growing reproductive organs were the strongest sink for sorghum plants under water deficit the plant loses its carbon partitioning efficiency and accumulates more carbohydrates in the leaves stems and roots compromising the development of the reproductive organs avila et al 2016 lavinsky et al 2015 the alteration in carbon partitioning under water deficit was related to reduction in the activity of cell wall invertases which alter the glucose gradient and lead to impairment of reproductive processes in different plant species chen et al 2019 dong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 in sorghum plants the higher content of sugars was also responsible for higher plant production as there were high negative correlations between gdm and hi with tss 0 77 0 76 rs 0 77 0 76 and sucrose 0 63 0 63 content respectively this confirms the importance of sugar translocation from vegetative to reproductive organs allowing higher investment in crop production under low water potential a drastic reduction in the activity of wall acid invertase in the carpel of maize grains also occurs therefore there is a reduction in sucrose discharge which affects the development of the embryo and the accumulation of starch in the endosperm of the seed zinselmeier et al 1999 si treatment promoted an increase in gdm and hi of sorghum plants the plants under wd si accumulated greater amounts of carbohydrates than the untreated plants and showed higher carbon partitioning efficiency as demonstrated by hi leading to a higher grain production therefore the greater water potential of the plants treated with si contributed to providing better carbohydrate partitioning to the grains compared to the untreated plants si positively influenced the protein levels in the leaves compared to the untreated plants this increase might have resulted from the stimulus to biosynthesis in the proteins of the photochemical apparatus and in the proteins that participated in the biochemical process of carbon assimilation or antioxidant enzymes in the roots due to osmotic and hydraulic adjustment an increase in the content of channel proteins such as aquaporins garg et al 2018 and osmotic adjustment proteins such as late embryogenesis abundant proteins zamora briseño and de jiménez 2016 and dehydrins and other proteins related to the tolerance to tissue desiccation osakabe et al 2014 might have occurred however protein dynamics in response to si treatment might be better elucidated via proteomic analysis because enzymatic activity might occur due to the increase in the levels of substrate and activation kinetics and an increase in its pool bisswanger 2014 the osmotic adjustment process might be related to the accumulation of osmolytes such as soluble sugars proteins proline and glycine betaine zia et al 2021 the highest aa levels in the present study were reported in the leaves of plants in the wd si treatment and in the roots of plants in the wd treatment the osmotic adjustment of sorghum plants under wd and si application was demonstrated by the negative correlations between water potential and starch 0 36 tss 0 79 rs 0 79 sucrose 0 66 and proline 0 55 contents and the proline aa ratio 0 83 the proline content in the leaves and roots of plants in the wd treatment was up to 85 higher than that in the plants in the fc treatment proline is a multifunctional aa in cellular metabolism under environmental stress conditions meena et al 2019 therefore proline can act as an inert and compatible osmotic agent contributing to osmotic adjustment of the tissue proline can also act as an antioxidant molecule capable of disabling singlet oxygen which is highly toxic to cellular metabolism hayat et al 2012 kaur and asthir 2015 based on our findings proline was more related to osmotic adjustment than to antioxidant activity in sorghum plants because there was a negative correlation between proline and water potential 0 55 and positive correlations between proline and mda 0 83 and h2o2 0 79 levels moreover it acts as a molecular chaperone by stabilizing proteins and avoiding their misconfiguration and agglomeration hayat et al 2012 szabados and savouré 2010 finally the proline biosynthesis process consumes reducing equivalents contributing to redox homeostasis and lower ros formation this function is very important under water stress conditions because of the high production of ros in the chloroplasts by photosynthesis ros are also generated in the mitochondria during respiration and in peroxisomes due to lipid hydrolysis or photorespiration which may cause serious oxidative damage to the cells if not controlled meena et al 2019 zia et al 2021 there was a reduction in total aa and proline levels in wd si plants compared to the untreated plants si supplementation in sorghum under wd stimulates osmoregulatory metabolism via sugars highlighted in the present study in tss rs and sucrose which could explain the lower proline level in the si treatments the plants treated with si showed a reduction in the amount of tss proline and aa despite being subjected to wd nevertheless wd si plants showed higher water potential and lower cellular damage than wd plants the mitigation of water deficit by si might be explained by the fact that the si application leads to the accumulation of this element in plants alzahrani et al 2018 biju et al 2017 more specifically in cell walls therefore si might be deposited in the cell walls strengthening them and protecting cell membranes coskun et al 2016 which makes them less vulnerable to water deficit enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant systems are physiological mechanisms that are highly related to water deficit tolerance as they are responsible for eliminating ros anjum et al 2017 verma et al 2020 si has been shown to promote antioxidant enzymatic activity and induce water deficit tolerance in other plant species alzahrani et al 2018 cao et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 in our study the capacity of si to induce tolerance to drought in sorghum was observed because stressed plants supplemented with si showed mainly in the leaves higher activity of sod cat apx dhar mdhar and pod sod plays an important role as it acts on the superoxide anion dismutase therefore while eliminating the highly harmful ros o2 it produces hydrogen peroxide which at low concentrations is an important secondary messenger gupta et al 2016 hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis may still occur through the photorespiratory pathway which can be intensified during water deficit thus when the two pathways are intensified the h2o2 pool may inevitably reach levels that are toxic to metabolism with the increase in h2o2 the first enzymes to act are those that are part of the ascorbate glutathione cycle apx dhar mdhar and gr where h2o2 is reduced to water and oxygen by apx however with an increase in h2o2 concentration a reduction in apx activity occurs due to a negative feedback mechanism hasanuzzaman et al 2019 cat and pod act on the detoxification of high concentrations of h2o2 thus during water deficit the sorghum plants showed a triple defense in the elimination of h2o2 because they elevated the activity of apx cat and pod peroxidases this defense mechanism of the antioxidant system was even more efficient in plants treated with si the synchronicity of the enzymes was observed by the positive correlations between the sod and cat 0 77 sod and dhar 0 95 cat and dhar 0 77 sod and mdhar 0 91 cat and mdhar 0 70 and apx and mdhar 0 89 activities moreover antioxidant enzymes have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in sorghum plants under water deficit conditions there were negative correlations between the activities of sod 0 78 cat 0 76 dhar 0 84 and mdhar 0 72 with mda content in plants thus an increase in antioxidant activity reduced cell damage in sorghum plants the non enzymatic antioxidant system was also used by sorghum plants as a mechanism of response to drought via greater production of ascorbate mainly in plants treated with si the participation of this low molecular weight compound is related to the neutralization of ros that may occur via the participation in two dynamic pathways enzymatic and non enzymatic hasanuzzaman et al 2019 in the enzymatic pathway ascorbate acts as an enzymatic co factor in the ascorbate glutathione cycle which in addition to acting on the elimination of ros contributes to the dissipation of excess photochemical energy occurring in the leaves during water deficit suo et al 2017 our findings suggest the involvement of asa as an enzymatic co factor in sorghum plants despite the increase in ascorbate levels there was a positive correlation between ascorbate and mda 0 89 however there was also a high negative correlation between asa level and sod 0 79 dhar 0 85 and mdhar 0 75 suggesting that the consumption of asa is related to high antioxidant enzyme activity in the non enzymatic pathway ascorbate acts by regenerating the tocopherol from tocopheroxyl as a membrane protective mechanism ahmad et al 2010 ascorbate also acts as a violaxanthin de epoxidase co factor supporting the dissipation of excess excitation energy in an extremely important process to prevent ros formation under stress conditions foyer and noctor 2005 si application in sorghum plants under water deficit promoted antioxidant enzymatic activity and ascorbate production hence the efficiency of this antioxidant system in neutralizing ros could be proven by the reduced membrane damage however in the roots of plants treated with si despite the lower mda formation there was a greater production of h2o2 compared to untreated plants thus one of the si signal lines in plants might be the h2o2 pathway so that hydrogen peroxide is possibly produced to act as a stress signaling response agent ros especially hydrogen peroxide have been proposed as key components in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses singh et al 2019 in addition to mitigating the effects of water deficit in sorghum the beneficial effects of si in irrigated plants were observed in the present study si promoted antioxidant enzymatic activity in the leaves and roots and increased the ascorbate pool and tss in the leaves hence the oxidative stress expressed in mda levels was lower in the leaves and roots of the plants treated with si than in the untreated plants these observations strengthen the role of si as an important element as a tolerance induction factor for water deficit and beneficial to the growth of sorghum under proper water conditions epstein 1999 this observation is important because throughout their lifetime plants are subjected to countless environmental stress agents in higher or lower intensities however isolated or combined stressful conditions reduce the potential yield of different crop plants including sorghum thus fertilization with si is a feasible and inexpensive alternative to improve the performance of agricultural crops in the field coskun et al 2016 si promoted positive effects on the enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant systems and the osmoregulatory system all of which are of extreme importance for the continued growth development and production of plants under stress conditions caused by water shortages this justifies the greater production of grains observed in the sorghum plants treated with si in addition the capacity of this element to induce tolerance to water deficit in plants including sorghum and to act as a beneficial factor in irrigated plants has been reiterated 5 conclusion si mitigates water deficit in sorghum by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity non enzymatic antioxidants and osmoprotective substances plants treated with si showed lower damage to membranes which was confirmed by lower lipid peroxidation the beneficial effects of si extended to plants that were not subjected to water deficit because the application of si increased the

9973,climate change has increased the occurrence of droughts and the use of deficient irrigation associated with silicon si can be a strategy to mitigate water deficit in crops however the mechanisms involved have to be understood the objective of this study was to evaluate whether the application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray mitigates the effects of water deficit by improving the physiological aspects and modifying c n p stoichiometry inducing an increase in nutrient use efficiency in the ratoon of two sugarcane species saccharum officinarum conventional sugarcane and s spontaneum energy cane two experiments were carried out in a greenhouse using conventional sugar cane variety rb 966928 and energy cane variety vx2 in both experiments the treatments were arranged in a 2 2 factorial scheme without water deficit and with severe water deficit 30 of soil water retention capacity without and with application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray both in a concentration 2 5 mmol l 1 arranged in randomized blocks at 80 days after ratoon regrowth the following parameters were evaluated si content and accumulation efficiency of using c n and p c si c n and c p ratios quantum efficiency of ps ii relative content of water leaf water potential leaf area number of leaves and tillers and dry matter production in the absence of si water deficit affected the physiological variables and the growth of the two sugarcane species the supply of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying of soluble si increased the absorption of this element in the ratoon of conventional sugarcane and energy cane regardless of water condition si attenuated the effects caused by severe water deficit because of the increase in the relative water content and water potential thus decreasing oxidative stress impacting photosynthesis efficiency and also modifying the c n p stoichiometry increasing use efficiency for these nutrients and the growth of the two study species keywords abiotic stress fertigation leaf spray water limitation saccharum officinarum saccharum spontaneum 1 introduction climate change has increased the emergence of extreme climatic events such as the occurrence of droughts besharat et al 2020 which can hinder the progress of sugarcane cultivation in tropical regions sugarcane saccharum spp is a high yield semi perennial species owing to the process of ratoon regrowth manhães et al 2015 during development sugarcane plants are frequently exposed to water deficit conditions which limits biomass production and crop development marchiori et al 2017 as a result of low regrowth and tillering souza et al 2015 these losses in plant growth which result from water deficit are due to their effects of decreasing water content which induces oxidative stress causes damage to the plant s physiological processes teixeira et al 2020 and decreases nutrient use efficiency hoang et al 2019 in addition recent studies with other species have indicated that water deficit affects stoichiometric homeostasis decreasing the c n and c p ratios in banana long et al 2018 and the c n ratio in cocoa lahive et al 2018 therefore water deficit causes significant damage to plants whose growth will depend on their ability to quickly adjust to stress basnayake et al 2012 a possible strategy to mitigate the harmful effects of water deficit on sugarcane is the use of silicon si because it induces different mitigating mechanisms si is beneficial in sugarcane plants under water deficit because it increases the relative water content bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 and the potential water of tissues bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 attenuating the oxidative stress by decreasing cell electrolyte leakage bezerra et al 2019 this provides greater quantum efficiency of ps ii teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 which results in greater dry mass production de camargo et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 previous studies on sugarcane cultivation have indicated important physiological benefits of si to mitigate water deficit however si can promote other effects such as stoichiometric modification of c n and c p ratios in the plant in banana plants for example the use of si under water deficit increased the c n and c p ratios of leaves long et al 2018 this stoichiometric modification promoted by si can induce new homeostasis improving the use efficiency of these nutrients si is therefore an important component in water deficit mitigation as it is known that water stress causes nutritional damage to plants as discussed above to ensure the beneficial effect of si on plants their absorption by sugarcane crops has to be maximized as much as possible to this end soluble sources need to be used together with an effective application mode currently new sources of water soluble si such as sodium silicate and sorbitol stabilized potassium have been used via nutritive solution teixeira et al 2020 or foliar spray santos et al 2020 another possibility is the use of fertigation in the soil associated with foliar spraying but there are not enough studies about that this form of application of si can enhance the absorption of si and increase the possibility of response of the culture notably studies on optimization of si absorption are expected to offer important biological benefits for example stoichiometric changes that can affect the growth of sugarcane plants under water deficit the reason is that according to ma et al 2011 poaceae are considered to be si accumulators because they have specific silicon transporters which favors absorption and plant responses however further research is still needed to improve the understanding of these effects both for conventional sugarcane saccharum officinarum and energy cane saccharum spontaneum conventional sugarcane has a high sucrose content used for the production of first generation ethanol and sugar and restricted energy cogeneration silva et al 2018 with the advancement of technology for the production of second generation ethanol from cellulosic fiber energy cane appeared which could enhance the production of ethanol and the cogeneration of energy thermal and electric in relation to conventional cane energy cane has a high fiber content for this reason it is a new option for energy production as it provides high biomass yield when burnt leal et al 2013 however studies on its response to the condition of water deficit and its relationship with si are lacking this is cause for concern because its cultivation is advancing above all in tropical regions with low rainfall and although most of the cane is still grown under rainfed conditions the use of irrigation has advanced as it is an important strategy to improve crop productivity dias and sentelhas 2019 in order to broaden the knowledge of the benefits of si in these two species under water deficit conditions the following hypotheses should be tested i initially it is important to check if si supplied via fertigation and associated with foliar spraying of soluble si ensures high absorption of the element in conventional sugar cane and energy cane grown with or without water deficit ii if si reverses the effects caused by water deficit as a result of an increase in relative water content and water potential reducing oxidative stress and increasing photosynthetic efficiency iii if si causes enough c n p stoichiometry modification to induce new homeostasis increasing nutrient use efficiency and consequently the growth of both species conventional sugarcane and energy cane the results of this study will allow advancing knowledge of the responses of these species to water deficit producing more robust knowledge of the effects of si describing their carbon related nutritional role which has not yet been explored by researchers therefore this information has important environmental implications owing to climate changes in the region where these species are grown for this purpose this research was carried out to evaluate if the application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray application mitigates the effects of water deficit by improving physiological aspects and c n p stoichiometric modification inducing an increase in the efficiency of use of these nutrients in the ratoon of two species of sugar cane conventional sugar cane and energy cane 2 material and methods two experiments were carried out in pots filled with quartzene neossol from september to december 2019 with sugarcane ratoon first cutting in a greenhouse at unesp jaboticabal campus experiment i was developed with conventional sugar cane saccharum officinarum variety rb966928 experiment ii with energy cane saccharum spontaneum variety vx2 with higher fiber content 28 0 and lower sugar content in the form of sucrose 6 sugarcane ratoon first cutting comes from plants that received application of si during the production phase of pre sprouted seedlings and during the growth of the cane plant via fertigation using four applications at a concentration of 2 5 mmol l 1 before sugarcane was planted chemical analysis of the soil was carried out for fertility purposes according to the method described by raij et al 2001 and the following

minimum temperature and the maximum and minimum relative humidity levels were recorded throughout the experimental period with the aid of a thermo hygrometer fig 1 the irradiance level of the greenhouse where the plants grew was 250 350 µmol m 2 s 1 in both experiments the treatments were arranged in a 2 2 factorial scheme with two water conditions without water deficit ww 70 of soil water retention capacity swrc and with water deficit wd 30 of swrc combined with absence si and presence si si 2 5 mmol l 1 applied via fertigation associated with leaf spray for enhance the absorption of the element by the plant arranged in randomized blocks in five repetitions the experimental portion consisted of a polypropylene vessel with a capacity of 20 dm³ having five pots per treatment and 20 pots for each species water deficiency levels were determined according to the study carried out by teixeira et al 2020 and boaretto et al 2014 in which 70 of swrc was an adequate water condition and 30 of swrc was a severe water deficit the ideal water condition for sugarcane is 70 of the water retention capacity in the soil according to boaretto et al 2014 a condition that allows 70 of the micropores to be filled with available water and the remaining 30 with air maintaining the gas exchange in the root area allowing excellent plant growth the deficient irrigation treatments were maintained at 30 of the soil s water retention capacity according to previous reports by teixeira et al 2020 described significant harmful effects on the accumulation of dry mass of sugarcane plants which reflected well a situation of relatively severe drought occurring in the field water availability was controlled daily by weighing the pots and restoring water losses due to soil evaporation and plant transpiration teixeira et al 2020 this ensured that the plants were maintained at the water retention capacity levels proposed in the treatments since the adjustments were made vase by vase the same irrigation frequency was used for both species and for the irrigation treatments that is they were all weighed daily at the time of water restoring the 70 swrc pots had approximately 60 swrc and the 30 swrc vessels were approximately 25 swrc it is justified that the loss of water in the 70 swrc pots was greater because the losses due to transpiration were greater due to the growth of the plants for this reason irrigations have always been carried out at the same time of day at 5 pm preliminary tests were carried out and the water loss was more accentuated between the period of 2 5 pm hours therefore although there was variation it only occurred during a period of 3 h a day the start of the irrigation event was defined when the pots had swrc less than that required for the maintenance of the water regimes of 70 and 30 of the swrc irrigation management was carried out daily so that the soil moisture within each treatment the minimum possible variation that would be insignificant to alter the biological response of the plant thus it started to define the mass of soil to be used in each pot after filling them with high rigor having all the same amount of soil in addition the mass of the pots was also defined to discount from the total mass from this the mass restoring method was used considering the water losses by evaporation of the soil and transpiration of the plant the levels of soil water availability were determined based on the microporosity values measured by the tension table method with a 60 cm high water column embrapa 1997 this calculation takes into account the density of the soil determined by the dry weight ratio of the soil after drying in an oven at 110 c for 24 h and the volume of the non deformed sample of soil in this way the equivalent water mass was calculated to keep the soil of the pots precisely at 70 and 30 of the water holding capacity in the soil the restoring of water was carried out in the same way for both species that is maintained at the levels of 70 or 30 the irrigation system used was the manual where the amount of water was slowly replaced to the soil until reaching the stipulated mass for each treatment distilled water was used in all irrigations to prevent contamination especially in relation to si the total amount of water replenished during the experiment in each treatment was in the range of 120 200 l in the water restoring of 70 of the swrc and from 40 l to 80 l in the water restoring of 30 of the swrc this is because the water restoring varied from 1 5 l to 2 5 l in 70 of the swrc and from 0 5 l to 1 0 l for 30 of the swrc this range occurred due to temperature humidity and light conditions during the experimental period the source of si used was sorbitol stabilized sodium and potassium silicate 113 4 g l 1 of si and 18 9 g l 1 of k2o and ph 11 8 si was supplied via fertigation with soil application and foliar spraying a concentration of 2 5 mmol l 1 was used in four applications at 20 35 50 and 65 days after cutting the ratoon in the morning with relative humidity and temperature c equal to 90 and 20 9 86 and 21 5 94 and 21 2 91 and 28 4 respectively fig 1 in the experiment the si application method was used via fertigation complemented by foliar spraying in order to increase the possibility of the culture responding to si supply inducing absorption by organs root and leaf for application of si the spray was prepared and the ph value was adjusted to 5 0 0 2 using the hcl solution 1 mol l 1 the application of si via fertigation was manually performed by simulating a 5 mm spray of silicate solution for foliar spraying a manual spray was used with a 250 ml spray volume per plant leaf spraying was carried out to ensure coverage of the leaf without any runoff the amount of potassium present in the si source was equilibrated in plants that did not receive fertigation of the element using a 1 mol l 1 potassium chloride solution at 80 days after regrowth the experiments were concluded and the evaluations described below were carried out in all experimental units being composed of a pot having a plant with primary secondary and tertiary tillers containing five plants per treatment the physiological evaluations relative water content water potential electrolyte leakage index and quantum efficiency of the fsii were obtained in the primary tiller while the determination of the leaf area number of leaves number of tillers and dry mass were considered all tillers the evaluations were initiated in the first hours of the 80th day the state of the water in the plant suffered the effect of the irrigation carried out the day before at 5 pm hours since the last irrigation was carried out at 79 days after regrowth therefore the plants were irrigated the day before the analysis relative water content in the leaf was determined by collecting six leaf disks from the first fully developed leaf which were immediately weighed on an analytical scale to measure tissue fresh weight pf after that as they were rehydrated in deionized water for 6 h to obtain the turgid mass pst using paper towels to extract the excess water the dry mass ps was obtained after the disks remained in an oven with forced air circulation at 80ºc for 24 h relative water content values were calculated using the equation proposed by barrs and weatherley 1962 pf ps pst ps x 100 leaf water potential ψw was determined in the middle leaf third of the first fully developed leaf with the aid of a scholander pressure chamber soil moisture equipment usa the pressure was applied until exudation occurred from the cut made in the leaf measurements were taken between 5 am and 6 am hours turner 1981 quantum efficiency of ps ii was estimated using a chlorophyll fluorometer opti sciences os30p the plants were left to adapt in the dark for a minimum of 30 min before the excitation of the red light pulse the measurements were made on the first fully developed leaf in the period between 7 and 8 am damage to cell membrane integrity was assessed using the method of determining the electrolyte leakage index proposed by dionisio sese and tobita 1998 three leaf disks were collected from the first fully developed leaf leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter l 3100 licor usa number of leaves and tillers was determined by manual counting subsequently the samples were washed in running water detergent solution 0 1 vol vol hcl solution 0 3 vol vol and deionized water the plant material was dried in a forced air circulation oven 65 5 c to constant weight and then the dry matter value of each part of the plant was calculated then the leaves and stems were ground separately in a willey mill si content was determined by digestion of the samples according to the methodology described by kraska and breitenbeck 2010 and colorimetric reading as indicated by korndörfer et al 2004 si accumulation in the leaves and stem was then calculated as the product between si content and dry matter production dry matter was used to measure the content of c and n by dry combustion 1000 c using a truspec chns device leco p content was determined by nitric perchloric digestion according to the methods described by bataglia et al 1983 data on c n and p accumulation in the shoot and dry matter accumulation were used to calculate nutrient use efficiency as indicated by siddiqi and glass 1981 the c si c n and c p ratios were determined by the ratio between the content of the elements the data were submitted to analysis of variance by the f test p 0 05 and the means were compared by tukey s test at 5 probability using the statistical software agroestat barbosa and maldonado júnior 2010 3 results 3 1 the supply of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying increases si accumulation in conventional cane and energy cane water deficit decreased si accumulation in the leaves and culm of conventional sugar cane fig 2a c and energy cane fig 2b d on the other hand the application of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying increased the accumulation of the element both in the leaves and in the culm in both conventional sugarcane fig 2a c and energy cane fig 2b d in the presence and absence of water deficit in both species si accumulation was higher in the leaves fig 2a b in comparison to the culm

using c n and p in conventional cane and energy cane the c si ratio of plants without si application is reduced under water deficit conditions while in plants fertilized with this element this ratio does not change with imposition of water deficit in the leaf of conventional cane fig 3a and energy cane fig 3b the application of si regardless of water deficit decreases the c si ratio in the leaf of conventional cane fig 3a and energy cane fig 3b the c n ratio of the leaf of conventional cane fig 3c and energy cane fig 3d plants is decreased in water deficit conditions when compared to plants

in both conventional cane fig 4a c e and energy cane fig 4b d f the application of si with and without water deficit increased efficiency in the use of c and n from conventional sugarcane fig 4a c however the efficiency of use of p in conventional cane fig 4e and efficiency of c n and p in energy cane increased only in water deficit conditions fig 4b d f 3 3 fertilization with si increases relative water content and leaf water potential ψw decreases electrolyte leakage and increases quantum efficiency of ps ii of plants under water stress conditions the relative water content of the leaf decreased in plants submitted to water deficit without si application compared to plants without water deficit in conventional cane fig 5a and energy cane fig 5b the application of si in conventional cane fig 5a regardless of water condition increased the relative water content of the plants however in energy cane this increase occurred only under water deficit fig 5b in conventional cane there was a decrease in the water potential of plants in deficit condition when compared to plants without water limitation fig 5c in energy cane the water potential decreased with water deficit only in plants without the application of si fig 5d under water deficit si supply maintained the leaf water potential greater when compared to the condition of absence of the element in conventional cane fig 5c and energy cane fig 5d in plants under water deficit without si in comparison to those cultivated without the deficit there was an increase in cellular electrolyte leakage fig 5e f and a decrease in quantum efficiency of ps ii fig 5g h in both species however the presence of si in plants under water stress decreases electrolyte leakage in conventional cane fig 5e and energy cane fig

production the number of leaves and tillers decreased with water deficit without si when compared to plants with adequate water availability fig 6a b c d in plants submitted or not to water deficit si increased the number of leaves of conventional cane fig 6a however in energy cane this increase was found only in water deficit conditions fig 6b for both species the number of tillers increased with the application of si in both water conditions fig 6c d the leaf area of conventional cane fig 6e and energy cane fig 6f plants decreased in plants submitted to the water deficit condition without si in comparison to those with adequate water availability the application of si in comparison to its absence increased the leaf area of conventional cane only under water deficit fig 6e and of energy cane for the two water conditions fig 6f the dry matter the conventional cane fig 6g and energy cane plants fig 6h decreased in plants under water deficit without si however in plants under water deficit that received si there was an increase in the dry matter the whole plant for conventional cane fig 6g and for energy cane fig 6h 4 discussion the absorption of si by the two sugarcane species that received this beneficial element was reduced with water deficit fig 2 since the ion root contact depends on the water content of the soil to induce the process of mass flow taiz et al 2017 however this effect did not occur in plants that did not receive si in which the absorption of this element was very low given the fact that the soil used a quartzene neossol naturally has a low content of available si although sand consisting of sio2 is predominant its crystalline form is not in a form that is available to plants de oliveira et al 2007 plants under water deficit need to adapt to the conditions of the medium to resist low water availability verslues et al 2006 with a decrease in the relative water content of the leaves of the two sugarcane species with or without si fig 5a b a similar form occurred with the water potential in the leaves which was reduced by water deficit fig 5c d a fact also found by marcos et al 2018 in sugar cane this scenario with low water content in the plant induces oxidative stress because of the increase in reactive oxygen species which degrade organic compounds such as the lipids in the membranes causing cytosol efflux barbosa et al 2014 this induces an increase in the rate of electrolyte leakage from the cells of the leaves of both sugarcane species especially without application of si fig 5e f these effects of water deficit also impaired ps ii efficiency of the two study species fig 5g h the low efficiency of ps ii in treatments without si in water deficit conditions reaching values below 0 75 fv fm indicates loss of energy in the photosynthetic apparatus maxwell and johnson 2000 water deficit in sugarcane can lead to stomatal closure inducing a condition of excess energy pressure in the photochemical apparatus which can lead to photoinhibition sales et al 2013 photoinhibition occurs when the photon energy exceeds the amount of energy used by photosynthesis under water stress there is usually a simultaneous increase in temperature and irradiance potentially increasing the amount of excess photon energy in ps ii zhang et al 2016 this physiological damage in the sugarcane plants was evidenced by the occurrence of severe water deficit 30 of soil water retention capacity with these physiological losses water deficit hindered the growth of the two species with a decrease in number of leaves fig 6a b tillers fig 6c d and leaf area fig 6e f and consequently dry matter production of the plants fig 6g h it should be noted that the decrease in leaf area is considered as a response to water limitation because it reduces the sweating area to avoid water loss and also the interception of the sun s rays to decrease the energy pressure in quantum efficiency of ps ii chaves et al 2009 these negative effects of water deficit on sugarcane growth have been reported by other authors bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 but there are no previous studies for energy cane hence this is the first report for this species these authors relate this decreased growth of sugarcane plants due to damage to the physiological aspects caused by water deficit however water deficit may alter the homeostasis of c n and p which are vital for plant growth but this has not yet been reported for these species therefore our study revealed that water deficit induces damage to the plant also a result of c si c n and c p stoichiometric changes which occurred in the two species especially without the addition of si in the culture medium fig 3 therefore we evidenced that water deficit when modifying the stoichiometric ratios changed the homeostasis of these elements in the plant tissues and decreased use efficiency for nutrients c n and p fig 4 gerloff and gabelman 1983 reported that plants in water deficit conditions decrease nutrient redistribution which can also impair nutrient use efficiency by the plant our research shows that for a better understanding of the effects of water deficit on sugarcane growth the stoichiometric ratio and the losses use efficiency of c n and p also have to be taken into account rather than physiological damage alone the beneficial effect of si in attenuating water deficit is evident in the two sugarcane species clearly the application of si in the two species grown under water deficit increased water content in the plant fig 5a b as a result of the greater water potential fig 5c d these effects are possibly due to a decrease in stomatal conductance mata and lamattina 2001 and sweating pei et al 2010 the increase in water content in the sugarcane plant under water deficit as a result si application has also been reported by other authors for conventional cane bezerra et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 but not for energy cane therefore fertilization with si in both species was effective in reducing oxidative stress as there was a lower rate of cell electrolyte leakage fig 5e f possibly by increasing the action of antioxidant defense mechanisms hernandez apaolaza 2014 avoiding the peroxidation of membrane lipids that induce cell leakage noctor and foyer 1998 another mechanism that indicates that si attenuated stress in plants under water deficit was its benefit in increasing the quantitative efficiency of ps ii fig 5g h this result indicates the benefit of si in maintaining the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant under stress the decrease in damage caused by water deficit with the application of si was very evident in biometric variables promoting an increase in the number of leaves fig 6a b tillers fig 6c d leaf area fig 6e f and in plant dry matter of the two species fig 6g h these beneficial effects of si on the growth of sugarcane plants under water deficit were also found in a study by de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 and verma et al 2019 however there are no reports for energy cane and our study shows that it has a similar response to that of conventional cane to si application for the purpose of mitigating water deficit as found and also pointed out by several authors the mechanisms required for si to promote the attenuation of water deficit in sugarcane are related to physiological aspects that result in improved plant growth however it is known that plants under stress have strategies to promote new stoichiometric homeostasis to balance their metabolism attenuating environmental restriction prado et al 2017 in this sense it was found that the application of si in the two study species under water deficit modified the stoichiometry of si c n p decreasing the c si ratio fig 3a b and increasing the c n and c p ratios fig 3c d e f the decrease in the c si ratio is due to an increase in si content after its application and also by a decrease in c content in the leaf tissues of the study plants the relative decrease in c in leaf tissues is due to the fact that part of this c can be replaced by si because of the low energy cost during its incorporation into plant tissue in comparison to organic compounds cooke and leishman 2012 schaller et al 2012a it was found that si decreased cellulose and also c levels in phragmites australis trin plants schaller et al 2012b therefore under water deficit these stoichiometric changes promoted by si had benefits for the plant s metabolism for c and subsequently for n and p and this finding was confirmed by the increased efficiency of use of c n and p by the two study species fig 4 it is also worth mentioning that the increase in use efficiency of c may have been due to the si effect on the increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence as it reveals the excited energy level of pigments which direct photosynthesis therefore the ability to maintain high fv fm ratios under water stress can be an indicator of efficient use of radiation by photochemistry and consequently assimilation of c tester and bacic 2005 therefore for the first time it is evidenced that plants under water deficit use si as a strategy to promote important stoichiometric changes and ensure sufficient homeostasis to increase efficiency in the use of vital nutrients for their metabolism thereby explaining the increase in growth of the two study species it was also found that even with adequate water conditions in the soil there was a beneficial effect of si on some variables mainly in conventional sugarcane in comparison to energy cane but they were not agronomically important because they did not affect the weight production of the plant this indicates that si is more important in plants grown under stress than without stress a fact widely reported in the literature bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 2017 pei et al 2010 youssef et al 2012 5 conclusions the supply of silicon via fertigation associated with foliar spraying of soluble silicon increased the absorption of this element in the culm of sugarcane and energy cane grown with or without water deficit silicon attenuated the effects caused by severe water deficit because of an increase in the relative water content and water potential reducing oxidative stress impacting the efficiency of photosynthesis and also modifying c n p stoichiometry thereby increasing use efficiency of these nutrients and the growth of the two study species funding information this study was

9973,climate change has increased the occurrence of droughts and the use of deficient irrigation associated with silicon si can be a strategy to mitigate water deficit in crops however the mechanisms involved have to be understood the objective of this study was to evaluate whether the application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray mitigates the effects of water deficit by improving the physiological aspects and modifying c n p stoichiometry inducing an increase in nutrient use efficiency in the ratoon of two sugarcane species saccharum officinarum conventional sugarcane and s spontaneum energy cane two experiments were carried out in a greenhouse using conventional sugar cane variety rb 966928 and energy cane variety vx2 in both experiments the treatments were arranged in a 2 2 factorial scheme without water deficit and with severe water deficit 30 of soil water retention capacity without and with application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray both in a concentration 2 5 mmol l 1 arranged in randomized blocks at 80 days after ratoon regrowth the following parameters were evaluated si content and accumulation efficiency of using c n and p c si c n and c p ratios quantum efficiency of ps ii relative content of water leaf water potential leaf area number of leaves and tillers and dry matter production in the absence of si water deficit affected the physiological variables and the growth of the two sugarcane species the supply of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying of soluble si increased the absorption of this element in the ratoon of conventional sugarcane and energy cane regardless of water condition si attenuated the effects caused by severe water deficit because of the increase in the relative water content and water potential thus decreasing oxidative stress impacting photosynthesis efficiency and also modifying the c n p stoichiometry increasing use efficiency for these nutrients and the growth of the two study species keywords abiotic stress fertigation leaf spray water limitation saccharum officinarum saccharum spontaneum 1 introduction climate change has increased the emergence of extreme climatic events such as the occurrence of droughts besharat et al 2020 which can hinder the progress of sugarcane cultivation in tropical regions sugarcane saccharum spp is a high yield semi perennial species owing to the process of ratoon regrowth manhães et al 2015 during development sugarcane plants are frequently exposed to water deficit conditions which limits biomass production and crop development marchiori et al 2017 as a result of low regrowth and tillering souza et al 2015 these losses in plant growth which result from water deficit are due to their effects of decreasing water content which induces oxidative stress causes damage to the plant s physiological processes teixeira et al 2020 and decreases nutrient use efficiency hoang et al 2019 in addition recent studies with other species have indicated that water deficit affects stoichiometric homeostasis decreasing the c n and c p ratios in banana long et al 2018 and the c n ratio in cocoa lahive et al 2018 therefore water deficit causes significant damage to plants whose growth will depend on their ability to quickly adjust to stress basnayake et al 2012 a possible strategy to mitigate the harmful effects of water deficit on sugarcane is the use of silicon si because it induces different mitigating mechanisms si is beneficial in sugarcane plants under water deficit because it increases the relative water content bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 and the potential water of tissues bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 attenuating the oxidative stress by decreasing cell electrolyte leakage bezerra et al 2019 this provides greater quantum efficiency of ps ii teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 which results in greater dry mass production de camargo et al 2017 teixeira et al 2020 previous studies on sugarcane cultivation have indicated important physiological benefits of si to mitigate water deficit however si can promote other effects such as stoichiometric modification of c n and c p ratios in the plant in banana plants for example the use of si under water deficit increased the c n and c p ratios of leaves long et al 2018 this stoichiometric modification promoted by si can induce new homeostasis improving the use efficiency of these nutrients si is therefore an important component in water deficit mitigation as it is known that water stress causes nutritional damage to plants as discussed above to ensure the beneficial effect of si on plants their absorption by sugarcane crops has to be maximized as much as possible to this end soluble sources need to be used together with an effective application mode currently new sources of water soluble si such as sodium silicate and sorbitol stabilized potassium have been used via nutritive solution teixeira et al 2020 or foliar spray santos et al 2020 another possibility is the use of fertigation in the soil associated with foliar spraying but there are not enough studies about that this form of application of si can enhance the absorption of si and increase the possibility of response of the culture notably studies on optimization of si absorption are expected to offer important biological benefits for example stoichiometric changes that can affect the growth of sugarcane plants under water deficit the reason is that according to ma et al 2011 poaceae are considered to be si accumulators because they have specific silicon transporters which favors absorption and plant responses however further research is still needed to improve the understanding of these effects both for conventional sugarcane saccharum officinarum and energy cane saccharum spontaneum conventional sugarcane has a high sucrose content used for the production of first generation ethanol and sugar and restricted energy cogeneration silva et al 2018 with the advancement of technology for the production of second generation ethanol from cellulosic fiber energy cane appeared which could enhance the production of ethanol and the cogeneration of energy thermal and electric in relation to conventional cane energy cane has a high fiber content for this reason it is a new option for energy production as it provides high biomass yield when burnt leal et al 2013 however studies on its response to the condition of water deficit and its relationship with si are lacking this is cause for concern because its cultivation is advancing above all in tropical regions with low rainfall and although most of the cane is still grown under rainfed conditions the use of irrigation has advanced as it is an important strategy to improve crop productivity dias and sentelhas 2019 in order to broaden the knowledge of the benefits of si in these two species under water deficit conditions the following hypotheses should be tested i initially it is important to check if si supplied via fertigation and associated with foliar spraying of soluble si ensures high absorption of the element in conventional sugar cane and energy cane grown with or without water deficit ii if si reverses the effects caused by water deficit as a result of an increase in relative water content and water potential reducing oxidative stress and increasing photosynthetic efficiency iii if si causes enough c n p stoichiometry modification to induce new homeostasis increasing nutrient use efficiency and consequently the growth of both species conventional sugarcane and energy cane the results of this study will allow advancing knowledge of the responses of these species to water deficit producing more robust knowledge of the effects of si describing their carbon related nutritional role which has not yet been explored by researchers therefore this information has important environmental implications owing to climate changes in the region where these species are grown for this purpose this research was carried out to evaluate if the application of si via fertigation associated with leaf spray application mitigates the effects of water deficit by improving physiological aspects and c n p stoichiometric modification inducing an increase in the efficiency of use of these nutrients in the ratoon of two species of sugar cane conventional sugar cane and energy cane 2 material and methods two experiments were carried out in pots filled with quartzene neossol from september to december 2019 with sugarcane ratoon first cutting in a greenhouse at unesp jaboticabal campus experiment i was developed with conventional sugar cane saccharum officinarum variety rb966928 experiment ii with energy cane saccharum spontaneum variety vx2 with higher fiber content 28 0 and lower sugar content in the form of sucrose 6 sugarcane ratoon first cutting comes from plants that received application of si during the production phase of pre sprouted seedlings and during the growth of the cane plant via fertigation using four applications at a concentration of 2 5 mmol l 1 before sugarcane was planted chemical analysis of the soil was carried out for fertility purposes according to the method described by raij et al 2001 and the following

minimum temperature and the maximum and minimum relative humidity levels were recorded throughout the experimental period with the aid of a thermo hygrometer fig 1 the irradiance level of the greenhouse where the plants grew was 250 350 µmol m 2 s 1 in both experiments the treatments were arranged in a 2 2 factorial scheme with two water conditions without water deficit ww 70 of soil water retention capacity swrc and with water deficit wd 30 of swrc combined with absence si and presence si si 2 5 mmol l 1 applied via fertigation associated with leaf spray for enhance the absorption of the element by the plant arranged in randomized blocks in five repetitions the experimental portion consisted of a polypropylene vessel with a capacity of 20 dm³ having five pots per treatment and 20 pots for each species water deficiency levels were determined according to the study carried out by teixeira et al 2020 and boaretto et al 2014 in which 70 of swrc was an adequate water condition and 30 of swrc was a severe water deficit the ideal water condition for sugarcane is 70 of the water retention capacity in the soil according to boaretto et al 2014 a condition that allows 70 of the micropores to be filled with available water and the remaining 30 with air maintaining the gas exchange in the root area allowing excellent plant growth the deficient irrigation treatments were maintained at 30 of the soil s water retention capacity according to previous reports by teixeira et al 2020 described significant harmful effects on the accumulation of dry mass of sugarcane plants which reflected well a situation of relatively severe drought occurring in the field water availability was controlled daily by weighing the pots and restoring water losses due to soil evaporation and plant transpiration teixeira et al 2020 this ensured that the plants were maintained at the water retention capacity levels proposed in the treatments since the adjustments were made vase by vase the same irrigation frequency was used for both species and for the irrigation treatments that is they were all weighed daily at the time of water restoring the 70 swrc pots had approximately 60 swrc and the 30 swrc vessels were approximately 25 swrc it is justified that the loss of water in the 70 swrc pots was greater because the losses due to transpiration were greater due to the growth of the plants for this reason irrigations have always been carried out at the same time of day at 5 pm preliminary tests were carried out and the water loss was more accentuated between the period of 2 5 pm hours therefore although there was variation it only occurred during a period of 3 h a day the start of the irrigation event was defined when the pots had swrc less than that required for the maintenance of the water regimes of 70 and 30 of the swrc irrigation management was carried out daily so that the soil moisture within each treatment the minimum possible variation that would be insignificant to alter the biological response of the plant thus it started to define the mass of soil to be used in each pot after filling them with high rigor having all the same amount of soil in addition the mass of the pots was also defined to discount from the total mass from this the mass restoring method was used considering the water losses by evaporation of the soil and transpiration of the plant the levels of soil water availability were determined based on the microporosity values measured by the tension table method with a 60 cm high water column embrapa 1997 this calculation takes into account the density of the soil determined by the dry weight ratio of the soil after drying in an oven at 110 c for 24 h and the volume of the non deformed sample of soil in this way the equivalent water mass was calculated to keep the soil of the pots precisely at 70 and 30 of the water holding capacity in the soil the restoring of water was carried out in the same way for both species that is maintained at the levels of 70 or 30 the irrigation system used was the manual where the amount of water was slowly replaced to the soil until reaching the stipulated mass for each treatment distilled water was used in all irrigations to prevent contamination especially in relation to si the total amount of water replenished during the experiment in each treatment was in the range of 120 200 l in the water restoring of 70 of the swrc and from 40 l to 80 l in the water restoring of 30 of the swrc this is because the water restoring varied from 1 5 l to 2 5 l in 70 of the swrc and from 0 5 l to 1 0 l for 30 of the swrc this range occurred due to temperature humidity and light conditions during the experimental period the source of si used was sorbitol stabilized sodium and potassium silicate 113 4 g l 1 of si and 18 9 g l 1 of k2o and ph 11 8 si was supplied via fertigation with soil application and foliar spraying a concentration of 2 5 mmol l 1 was used in four applications at 20 35 50 and 65 days after cutting the ratoon in the morning with relative humidity and temperature c equal to 90 and 20 9 86 and 21 5 94 and 21 2 91 and 28 4 respectively fig 1 in the experiment the si application method was used via fertigation complemented by foliar spraying in order to increase the possibility of the culture responding to si supply inducing absorption by organs root and leaf for application of si the spray was prepared and the ph value was adjusted to 5 0 0 2 using the hcl solution 1 mol l 1 the application of si via fertigation was manually performed by simulating a 5 mm spray of silicate solution for foliar spraying a manual spray was used with a 250 ml spray volume per plant leaf spraying was carried out to ensure coverage of the leaf without any runoff the amount of potassium present in the si source was equilibrated in plants that did not receive fertigation of the element using a 1 mol l 1 potassium chloride solution at 80 days after regrowth the experiments were concluded and the evaluations described below were carried out in all experimental units being composed of a pot having a plant with primary secondary and tertiary tillers containing five plants per treatment the physiological evaluations relative water content water potential electrolyte leakage index and quantum efficiency of the fsii were obtained in the primary tiller while the determination of the leaf area number of leaves number of tillers and dry mass were considered all tillers the evaluations were initiated in the first hours of the 80th day the state of the water in the plant suffered the effect of the irrigation carried out the day before at 5 pm hours since the last irrigation was carried out at 79 days after regrowth therefore the plants were irrigated the day before the analysis relative water content in the leaf was determined by collecting six leaf disks from the first fully developed leaf which were immediately weighed on an analytical scale to measure tissue fresh weight pf after that as they were rehydrated in deionized water for 6 h to obtain the turgid mass pst using paper towels to extract the excess water the dry mass ps was obtained after the disks remained in an oven with forced air circulation at 80ºc for 24 h relative water content values were calculated using the equation proposed by barrs and weatherley 1962 pf ps pst ps x 100 leaf water potential ψw was determined in the middle leaf third of the first fully developed leaf with the aid of a scholander pressure chamber soil moisture equipment usa the pressure was applied until exudation occurred from the cut made in the leaf measurements were taken between 5 am and 6 am hours turner 1981 quantum efficiency of ps ii was estimated using a chlorophyll fluorometer opti sciences os30p the plants were left to adapt in the dark for a minimum of 30 min before the excitation of the red light pulse the measurements were made on the first fully developed leaf in the period between 7 and 8 am damage to cell membrane integrity was assessed using the method of determining the electrolyte leakage index proposed by dionisio sese and tobita 1998 three leaf disks were collected from the first fully developed leaf leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter l 3100 licor usa number of leaves and tillers was determined by manual counting subsequently the samples were washed in running water detergent solution 0 1 vol vol hcl solution 0 3 vol vol and deionized water the plant material was dried in a forced air circulation oven 65 5 c to constant weight and then the dry matter value of each part of the plant was calculated then the leaves and stems were ground separately in a willey mill si content was determined by digestion of the samples according to the methodology described by kraska and breitenbeck 2010 and colorimetric reading as indicated by korndörfer et al 2004 si accumulation in the leaves and stem was then calculated as the product between si content and dry matter production dry matter was used to measure the content of c and n by dry combustion 1000 c using a truspec chns device leco p content was determined by nitric perchloric digestion according to the methods described by bataglia et al 1983 data on c n and p accumulation in the shoot and dry matter accumulation were used to calculate nutrient use efficiency as indicated by siddiqi and glass 1981 the c si c n and c p ratios were determined by the ratio between the content of the elements the data were submitted to analysis of variance by the f test p 0 05 and the means were compared by tukey s test at 5 probability using the statistical software agroestat barbosa and maldonado júnior 2010 3 results 3 1 the supply of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying increases si accumulation in conventional cane and energy cane water deficit decreased si accumulation in the leaves and culm of conventional sugar cane fig 2a c and energy cane fig 2b d on the other hand the application of si via fertigation associated with foliar spraying increased the accumulation of the element both in the leaves and in the culm in both conventional sugarcane fig 2a c and energy cane fig 2b d in the presence and absence of water deficit in both species si accumulation was higher in the leaves fig 2a b in comparison to the culm of the plants fig 2c d both with and without water deficit 3 2 in water deficit conditions the application of si decreases the c si ratio and increases the c n and c p ratios and the efficiency of using c n and p in conventional cane and energy cane the c si ratio of plants without si application is reduced under water deficit conditions while in plants fertilized with this element this ratio does not change with imposition of water deficit in the leaf of conventional cane fig 3a and energy cane fig 3b the application of si regardless of water deficit decreases the c si ratio in the leaf of conventional cane fig 3a and energy cane fig 3b the c n ratio of the leaf of conventional cane fig 3c and energy cane fig 3d plants is decreased in water deficit conditions when compared to plants without water restriction the application of si in water deficit conditions increased the c n ratio of the leaf in conventional cane fig 3c and energy cane fig 3d the c p ratio of the sugarcane leaf is decreased under water deficit conditions of conventional cane fig 3e and energy cane fig 3f with the exception of leaves fertilized with si for both species in water deficit conditions the application of si increased the c p ratio of the leaf in both species fig 3e f use efficiency for c n and p decreased in plants submitted to water deficit when compared to plants without water deficit in both conventional cane fig 4a c e and energy cane fig 4b d f the application of si with and without water deficit increased efficiency in the use of c and n from conventional sugarcane fig 4a c however the efficiency of use of p in conventional cane fig 4e and efficiency of c n and p in energy cane increased only in water deficit conditions fig 4b d f 3 3 fertilization with si increases relative water content and leaf water potential ψw decreases electrolyte leakage and increases quantum efficiency of ps ii of plants under water stress conditions the relative water content of the leaf decreased in plants submitted to water deficit without si application compared to plants without water deficit in conventional cane fig 5a and energy cane fig 5b the application of si in conventional cane fig 5a regardless of water condition increased the relative water content of the plants however in energy cane this increase occurred only under water deficit fig 5b in conventional cane there was a decrease in the water potential of plants in deficit condition when compared to plants without water limitation fig 5c in energy cane the water potential decreased with water deficit only in plants without the application of si fig 5d under water deficit si supply maintained the leaf water potential greater when compared to the condition of absence of the element in conventional cane fig 5c and energy cane fig 5d in plants under water deficit without si in comparison to those cultivated without the deficit there was an increase in cellular electrolyte leakage fig 5e f and a decrease in quantum efficiency of ps ii fig 5g h in both species however the presence of si in plants under water stress decreases electrolyte leakage in conventional cane fig 5e and energy cane fig 5f and increased quantum efficiency of ps ii in the two study sugarcane species fig 5g h 3 4 si assists in plant development increasing the number of leaves and tillers leaf area and dry matter production the number of leaves and tillers decreased with water deficit without si when compared to plants with adequate water availability fig 6a b c d in plants submitted or not to water deficit si increased the number of leaves of conventional cane fig 6a however in energy cane this increase was found only in water deficit conditions fig 6b for both species the number of tillers increased with the application of si in both water conditions fig 6c d the leaf area of conventional cane fig 6e and energy cane fig 6f plants decreased in plants submitted to the water deficit condition without si in comparison to those with adequate water availability the application of si in comparison to its absence increased the leaf area of conventional cane only under water deficit fig 6e and of energy cane for the two water conditions fig 6f the dry matter the conventional cane fig 6g and energy cane plants fig 6h decreased in plants under water deficit without si however in plants under water deficit that received si there was an increase in the dry matter the whole plant for conventional cane fig 6g and for energy cane fig 6h 4 discussion the absorption of si by the two sugarcane species that received this beneficial element was reduced with water deficit fig 2 since the ion root contact depends on the water content of the soil to induce the process of mass flow taiz et al 2017 however this effect did not occur in plants that did not receive si in which the absorption of this element was very low given the fact that the soil used a quartzene neossol naturally has a low content of available si although sand consisting of sio2 is predominant its crystalline form is not in a form that is available to plants de oliveira et al 2007 plants under water deficit need to adapt to the conditions of the medium to resist low water availability verslues et al 2006 with a decrease in the relative water content of the leaves of the two sugarcane species with or without si fig 5a b a similar form occurred with the water potential in the leaves which was reduced by water deficit fig 5c d a fact also found by marcos et al 2018 in sugar cane this scenario with low water content in the plant induces oxidative stress because of the increase in reactive oxygen species which degrade organic compounds such as the lipids in the membranes causing cytosol efflux barbosa et al 2014 this induces an increase in the rate of electrolyte leakage from the cells of the leaves of both sugarcane species especially without application of si fig 5e f these effects of water deficit also impaired ps ii efficiency of the two study species fig 5g h the low efficiency of ps ii in treatments without si in water deficit conditions reaching values below 0 75 fv fm indicates loss of energy in the photosynthetic apparatus maxwell and johnson 2000 water deficit in sugarcane can lead to stomatal closure inducing a condition of excess energy pressure in the photochemical apparatus which can lead to photoinhibition sales et al 2013 photoinhibition occurs when the photon energy exceeds the amount of energy used by photosynthesis under water stress there is usually a simultaneous increase in temperature and irradiance potentially increasing the amount of excess photon energy in ps ii zhang et al 2016 this physiological damage in the sugarcane plants was evidenced by the occurrence of severe water deficit 30 of soil water retention capacity with these physiological losses water deficit hindered the growth of the two species with a decrease in number of leaves fig 6a b tillers fig 6c d and leaf area fig 6e f and consequently dry matter production of the plants fig 6g h it should be noted that the decrease in leaf area is considered as a response to water limitation because it reduces the sweating area to avoid water loss and also the interception of the sun s rays to decrease the energy pressure in quantum efficiency of ps ii chaves et al 2009 these negative effects of water deficit on sugarcane growth have been reported by other authors bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 verma et al 2019 but there are no previous studies for energy cane hence this is the first report for this species these authors relate this decreased growth of sugarcane plants due to damage to the physiological aspects caused by water deficit however water deficit may alter the homeostasis of c n and p which are vital for plant growth but this has not yet been reported for these species therefore our study revealed that water deficit induces damage to the plant also a result of c si c n and c p stoichiometric changes which occurred in the two species especially without the addition of si in the culture medium fig 3 therefore we evidenced that water deficit when modifying the stoichiometric ratios changed the homeostasis of these elements in the plant tissues and decreased use efficiency for nutrients c n and p fig 4 gerloff and gabelman 1983 reported that plants in water deficit conditions decrease nutrient redistribution which can also impair nutrient use efficiency by the plant our research shows that for a better understanding of the effects of water deficit on sugarcane growth the stoichiometric ratio and the losses use efficiency of c n and p also have to be taken into account rather than physiological damage alone the beneficial effect of si in attenuating water deficit is evident in the two sugarcane species clearly the application of si in the two species grown under water deficit increased water content in the plant fig 5a b as a result of the greater water potential fig 5c d these effects are possibly due to a decrease in stomatal conductance mata and lamattina 2001 and sweating pei et al 2010 the increase in water content in the sugarcane plant under water deficit as a result si application has also been reported by other authors for conventional cane bezerra et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 but not for energy cane therefore fertilization with si in both species was effective in reducing oxidative stress as there was a lower rate of cell electrolyte leakage fig 5e f possibly by increasing the action of antioxidant defense mechanisms hernandez apaolaza 2014 avoiding the peroxidation of membrane lipids that induce cell leakage noctor and foyer 1998 another mechanism that indicates that si attenuated stress in plants under water deficit was its benefit in increasing the quantitative efficiency of ps ii fig 5g h this result indicates the benefit of si in maintaining the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant under stress the decrease in damage caused by water deficit with the application of si was very evident in biometric variables promoting an increase in the number of leaves fig 6a b tillers fig 6c d leaf area fig 6e f and in plant dry matter of the two species fig 6g h these beneficial effects of si on the growth of sugarcane plants under water deficit were also found in a study by de camargo et al 2019 teixeira et al 2020 and verma et al 2019 however there are no reports for energy cane and our study shows that it has a similar response to that of conventional cane to si application for the purpose of mitigating water deficit as found and also pointed out by several authors the mechanisms required for si to promote the attenuation of water deficit in sugarcane are related to physiological aspects that result in improved plant growth however it is known that plants under stress have strategies to promote new stoichiometric homeostasis to balance their metabolism attenuating environmental restriction prado et al 2017 in this sense it was found that the application of si in the two study species under water deficit modified the stoichiometry of si c n p decreasing the c si ratio fig 3a b and increasing the c n and c p ratios fig 3c d e f the decrease in the c si ratio is due to an increase in si content after its application and also by a decrease in c content in the leaf tissues of the study plants the relative decrease in c in leaf tissues is due to the fact that part of this c can be replaced by si because of the low energy cost during its incorporation into plant tissue in comparison to organic compounds cooke and leishman 2012 schaller et al 2012a it was found that si decreased cellulose and also c levels in phragmites australis trin plants schaller et al 2012b therefore under water deficit these stoichiometric changes promoted by si had benefits for the plant s metabolism for c and subsequently for n and p and this finding was confirmed by the increased efficiency of use of c n and p by the two study species fig 4 it is also worth mentioning that the increase in use efficiency of c may have been due to the si effect on the increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence as it reveals the excited energy level of pigments which direct photosynthesis therefore the ability to maintain high fv fm ratios under water stress can be an indicator of efficient use of radiation by photochemistry and consequently assimilation of c tester and bacic 2005 therefore for the first time it is evidenced that plants under water deficit use si as a strategy to promote important stoichiometric changes and ensure sufficient homeostasis to increase efficiency in the use of vital nutrients for their metabolism thereby explaining the increase in growth of the two study species it was also found that even with adequate water conditions in the soil there was a beneficial effect of si on some variables mainly in conventional sugarcane in comparison to energy cane but they were not agronomically important because they did not affect the weight production of the plant this indicates that si is more important in plants grown under stress than without stress a fact widely reported in the literature bezerra et al 2019 de camargo et al 2019 2017 pei et al 2010 youssef et al 2012 5 conclusions the supply of silicon via fertigation associated with foliar spraying of soluble silicon increased the absorption of this element in the culm of sugarcane and energy cane grown with or without water deficit silicon attenuated the effects caused by severe water deficit because of an increase in the relative water content and water potential reducing oxidative stress impacting the efficiency of photosynthesis and also modifying c n p stoichiometry thereby increasing use efficiency of these nutrients and the growth of the two study species funding information this study was

9974,farmed prairie potholes are small isolated depressions frequently classified as semi permanent wetlands that make up a significant portion of land area in the des moines lobe dml of the larger prairie pothole region ppr historically these depressions have been subjected to significant drainage to improve their agricultural capacity however many assessments of the economic return of continuing to farm these depressions suggest that continued attempts to produce conventional row crops is not profitable and has other ecological consequences beyond crop drownout this study expands the existing discussion of land use and drainage alternatives in a watershed modeling context this study utilized the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps model to individually simulate the long term hydrology of 6 prairie potholes using a matrix of land use and drainage modifications results suggest the presence of artificial drainage is the dominant factor in prairie pothole hydrology while retirement and no till practices can provide moderate reductions in flood inundation conservation tillage induces minimal change on flood metrics results show that average annual maximum inundated surface area is reduced by at most 50 across all simulations and the median annual days flooded could be reduced by 25 days though this is less consistent when isolating high precipitation years regardless of drainage status in all scenarios there are on average more than two inundations events per year lasting 2 4 days longer events occur approximately once per year on average area inundation frequency curves suggest up to a 20 reduction in maximum pothole area inundated annually can be achieved at the 2 year return frequency the availability of this data helps characterize the hydrology of farmed potholes more generally over a wide range of conditions providing a reference for the prioritization of potholes for conservation or alternative management keywords prairie potholes annagnps precision agriculture targeted conservation farmed wetlands 1 introduction prairie potholes are surface depressions left behind after deglaciation in regions of the midwest montana and three canadian provinces known as the prairie pothole region ppr these hydrologically isolated depressions are small shallow semi permanent waterbodies fed mostly by surface runoff the des moines lobe dml of the ppr extends from central iowa through state s north central region and into southern minnesota this region is of interest due to its intensive agriculture and significant historic modifications made to pothole hydrology it has been estimated that surface and subsurface drainage activities have directly affected over 95 of potholes green et al 2019 despite these changes frequent flood events continue to have an impact on crop survival upadhyay et al 2018 rhine et al 2010 zaidi et al 2004 furthermore they are a nuisance for farmers delaying fieldwork due to their wetness or necessitating driving around them to avoid getting stuck and often cause economic losses because of this crop failure fey et al 2016 management practices within potholes generally mirror those of the field but programs and practices exist that improve either the environmental or economic outcomes of potholes and have gained some traction the conservation reserve program crp is a us federal government program that provides economic incentive for agricultural landowners to remove marginal or sensitive land from production in long term contracts gleason et al 2011 more recently the nrcs released the prairie pothole water quality and wildlife program which makes prairie potholes located in the dml up to 2 acres 0 80 ha in size eligible for payments through the environmental quality incentives program eqip if they are retired from production usda 2020 other practices to keep these areas in production include investing in more drainage or modifying tillage practices to improve soil quality and infiltration capacity in the field thereby reducing direct runoff to potholes landowners frequently need to evaluate drainage upgrades or alternative management because the extensive drainage network is aging and potentially undersized or increasingly overwhelmed due to higher precipitation as a result of climate change castellano et al 2019 pothole inundation causes significant agricultural management problems impacts include agricultural economics water quality management and natural resource conservation to name a few investing in seed fertilizer or drainage infrastructure in potholes reduces profitability despite frequent yield reductions or total crop loss in that area fey et al 2016 pothole drainage results in high nitrate and potentially high phosphorus export from the field martin et al 2019b king et al 2015 these wetlands once drained are removed from the historic wetland network that was once pervasive across north central iowa this wetland network can provide high quality nesting sites and energy sources for migratory birds or other species if restored and maintained janke et al 2019 these issues highlight the importance of monitoring and modeling pothole hydrology water quality and crop failure comprehensive monitoring leads to robust model calibration which can be used to create decision making frameworks for farmers public entities and policymakers classification of the issues presented as wicked problems churchman 1967 is becoming more widely recognized for example the extreme hypoxia experienced in the gulf of mexico due to high nitrate loading from the mississippi watershed patterson et al 2013 local scale support is undoubtedly required to empower change through modeling and decision support tools modeling prairie potholes has been of interest in recent years due to their ambiguous definition under the clean water act waters of the us cohen et al 2016 golden et al 2014 this includes understanding their surface water connectivity or spill and fill dynamics that have been modeled in a modified soil and water assessment tool swat model evenson et al 2016 and using a new and highly specific u s geological survey model the pothole hydrology linked systems simulator phyliss mckenna et al 2018 these studies attempt to show the connectivity of geographically isolated wetlands such as potholes and assess their impact on downstream waters understanding individual pothole dynamics is as important as understanding watershed scale dynamics for enabling local decision making understanding hydrologic fluxes in prairie potholes at the field scale allows for specific and targeted input into how they are managed something difficult to do when assessing watershed hydrology at scale individual potholes have been modeled using the usda annualized agricultural non point source pollution model annagnps by modifying the cell and reach resolution and wetland parameters upadhyay et al 2018 annagnps is well suited to very small watersheds such as those that drain to prairie potholes calibration of these models found moderate success in simulating flood depth but updates to the source code provided stronger calibration to standing water volume in the pothole at a daily time step nahkala 2020 furthermore upadhyay et al 2019 included an exploratory study of how simple changes in the annagnps model might affect flooding in farmed prairie pothole systems this limited exploration included modeling two individual prairie potholes using three different land management scenarios and did not consider different drainage strategies thus a more extensive study including a larger number of potholes and deeper exploration of land use and drainage intensities is needed the current study is adds to our understanding of pothole flood dynamics by 1 introducing four more potholes to the assessment completed by upadhyay et al 2019 and by 2 modeling a range of natural to intensive drainage conditions perennial and row crop land uses and conventional and conservation oriented tillage strategies that can be used in prairie pothole systems this watershed modeling in annagnps includes all combinations of drainage tillage and land use variables described later that reflect real management alternatives for landowners the goal of this study is thus to more broadly describe the influence of a multitude of land management practices on prairie pothole flooding via watershed modeling by quantifying impacts of model inputs on the temporal and spatial extent of flooding 2 methods 2 1 study area the prairie pothole study area sits on the border of two adjacent huc 12 watersheds near ames ia within the dml of the ppr five potholes reside in two adjacent fields managed by iowa state university isu that straddle the walnut creek and worrell creek watersheds on the border of story and boone county fig 1 a sixth pothole resides approximately 6 km northwest on an isu research farm these potholes named bunny walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth have been previously modeled on an individual basis upadhyay et al 2018 2019 nahkala 2020 and are the only potholes described in this study with the exception of mouth all modeled potholes were conventionally farmed during the 2016 2018 model calibration period which included a corn and soybean rotation conventional tillage no irrigation and standard fertilizer and pesticide application the western portion of mouth is registered in the conservation reserve program while the eastern portion is also conventionally farmed the potholes have varying surface and subsurface drainage which has been extensively described in previous studies at this location martin et al 2019a bunny is the most intensely drained with multiple surface inlets while hen and mouth are assumed to have no surface or subsurface drainage lettuce has subsurface drainage while walnut and cardinal have a surface inlet connected to subsurface drainage hourly water levels were recorded during the growing seasons of 2016 2018 using pressure transducers installed at the bottom of each pothole and the methods are fully described by martin et al 2019a 2 2 scenarios individual models of the six potholes shown in fig 1 were built using the annagnps model and were calibrated to daily water level and volume data nahkala 2020 then we identified alternative management scenarios that might affect prairie pothole inundation changes to the drainage intensity switching to tillage practices that improve infiltration modifying the planting schedule and retiring the pothole or its entire microwatershed these scenarios are realistic alternatives for common practices within the des moines lobe and did not consider emerging agricultural markets and pothole agricultural uses such as biofuel production in marginal areas feng et al 2017 model scenarios are listed in table 1 which lists modifications to runoff curve number cn for the hydrologic soil groups at these sites and to the modeled infiltration of the pothole other data files for field management and schedule were modified to call the correct management inputs within the model but only management schedule directly references hydrologic parameters that differ between the scenarios we investigated changes to the baseline calibrated models included 1 modifying artificial drainage by changing infiltration to represent additional or removed infrastructure 2 changing tillage practices by changing cn in the pothole or field to conservation or no till 3 retiring the pothole to perennial vegetation or in one scenario retiring the whole watershed by replacing the cropping system with pasture which includes modifying cn and management schedule including crop seeding within the model and 4 modifying the planting schedule across all years simulated table 1 displays a matrix of the most significant changes of interest drainage tillage and land retirement are presented in to represent all scenarios modeled for each pothole the simulation identifiers for this study are listed in this table which includes drainage status codes field land use codes and tillage practice codes the planting schedule changes four additional scenarios are not included in this table but are discussed separately later for those scenarios planting schedule was modified while maintaining the existing conditions for each pothole these scenarios adjusted all planting operations by 2 week increments representing a range of 2 weeks to 6 weeks from normal operation changes in planting schedule represent one component of uncertainty within the existing model as planting date can change significantly year to year based on soil temperature and wetness zipper 2018 2 3 data and model construction annagnps utilizes topographic climatic soil and land use data for watershed simulations and calculates outputs at a daily time step topographic data includes a dem that is converted to spatially aggregated cells or subwatersheds dominant soil class is assigned to each cell which influences infiltration rates land use data includes land cover or cropping information included management schedules vegetative cover curve number and other land use parameters a wetland data section includes data on where wetlands are placed on the reach network within a watershed this data includes surface area infiltration and overflow parameters to calculate a water balance within the wetland 2 3 1 model setup and calibration a 1 m dem was used for the delineation of subwatershed cell and reach networks the basic units used by annagnps to determine runoff and routing the data parameters and process used for physical model setup is previously described in upadhyay et al 2019 and nahkala 2020 briefly the modeled pothole wetlands were placed at the end of the cell and reach network for the respective microwatershed pressure transducers installed at the lowest elevation of each pothole measured hourly water level during the growing season approx may september in 2016 2017 and 2018 these data were aggregated to a daily time step to match the annagnps model time step and the model was driven using the weather data described below an iterative method using python was performed to calibrate agricultural curve numbers and infiltration within the pothole matching the simulated daily ponded water volume to the observed values using multiple statistical metrics details for this method can be found in nahkala 2020 these values were then used as the baseline model and changes to model inputs described below allowed for the simulation of additional 2 3 2 land use data and representation these calibrated values of scs cn and wetland pothole infiltration were then the baseline for modifications to simulate scenarios beyond the actual field conditions from monitoring the water balance of these potholes approximately 33 and 50 of infiltrated outflow was accounted for by surface inlets in bunny and walnut respectively martin et al 2019a which were used to inflate the infiltration rate in the pothole for medium d2 and high d3 drainage a value of 10 was chosen where only low drainage d1 was present where no drainage was present the maximum drainage from d soils 24 mm d 1 was used from huffman et al 2013 where this value was higher than the calibrated value of infiltration for current conditions the appropriate drainage outflow contribution ratio 10 33 or 50 was used to estimate a natural drainage condition this was necessary for the walnut model where values of 14 16 and 22 mm d 1 where used to represent d0 d1 and d2 these values are within the natural infiltration range for monitored potholes in iowa schilling et al 2019 roth and capel 2018 table 2 shows the typical values for each cn parameter and any modifications made during calibration calibrated models used modified curve numbers for conventional tillage where cn was adjusted upwards compared to nrcs standard published values for bunny walnut lettuce and cardinal cn was calibrated downwards from standard values for hen and mouth conservation tillage was represented by row crop straight row rc sr in good conditions and no modifications were made to the standard values additionally the rc sr no till value was used without modifications nrcs 2008 these cn values are closely correlated with surface residue irrespective of specific tillage practice but are not specific in situ measurements within these poorly drained areas elhakeem and papanicolaou 2009 retirement to perennial plantings was represented by pasture in good conditions with no modifications to the standard values 2 3 3 climate the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and the sustaining the earth s watersheds agricultural research data system stewards were combined to create a climate dataset for this study daily precipitation was sourced from prism which include statistically generated precipitation depths with high spatial resolution based on local weather stations other climate parameters including wind velocity wind direction maximum and minimum temperature dew point temperature and solar radiation were sourced from stewards from a weather station within 6 km from the managed field plots the years 1992 2018 were used with the first two years accounting for a model warmup period the long term simulation is necessary to generate appropriate confidence in the range of annual and seasonal precipitation expected when assessing flood events in the potholes 2 4 assessment methods we treated the modifications to planting date as a simple way to measure sensitivity of the curve number to planting date these were analyzed separately from the main output evaluation but were used for context when considering the uncertainty of the model the rest of the following analyses were conducted considering the drainage tillage and land use matrix described in table 1 we assessed the maximum surface area flooded during each month in the simulation and calculated as an average of all years in the simulation the volumetric time series output from the model was converted to surface area via two regressions prior studies had determined depth volume area relationships using a quadratic relationship between depth and volume and depth and area martin et al 2019a for depths less than 0 1 m a linear model was used these models were fit resulting in an r2 of greater than 0 99 for all potholes for the analysis in this study a conditional solving algorithm was used to solve the quadratic for water depth the depth time series was then converted to area using the second quadratic relationship we then calculated the maximum inundation area in each month of the simulation and averaged these values by month for all years in the simulation we assessed the number of flood days in the growing season annagnps is a daily time step model and thus this was denoted by the presence or absence of water at the end of a simulated day this assessment was summarized on a monthly basis to understand how flood dynamics of consequences in the agricultural operational system we counted the number of consecutive days of inundation each series of consecutive days was considered a flood event the length of flood events is directly related to the biophysical risk a crop experiences during the growing season scenarios were compared based on the frequency and total number of events that lasted long enough to threaten crops general risk began at events longer than 2 days especially during the first half of the growing season while extreme risk was considered to be events of 4 days or longer at any point during the growing season deboer and ritter 1970 mukhtar et al 1990 rhine et al 2010 analogous to flow duration curves for streams area inundation frequency curves were generated for each scenario and pothole these graphs could be replicated for pothole depths or volume however key operational parameters in flood risk assessments and risk management for farmers are typically communicated on an aerial basis as seen through 100 year floodplain mapping through fema programs or the acre by acre yield and soil mapping utilized in precision agriculture a frequency curve was created describing the frequency percent of simulated years with which incremental extents of the pothole surface area were flooded as a percentage of total pothole surface area the percent of years that a pothole flooded to incremental pothole extents as a percentage of the maximum area was calculated at increments of 10 of the total surface area individual scenarios were compared while further comparison was done between constant drainage or land use characteristics the loess smoothing method was used to aggregate the curves based on drainage and land use conditions for a general comparison 3 results the results of changes in planting date reflect a general sensitivity of the model to land management activities these dates can be highly variable year to year as most keenly observed during wet years such as 2018 and 2019 when many farmers were prevented from planting millions of acres for extended periods of time due to wet conditions these simulations span an 8 week planting window from mid april until mid june suggesting that in the early stages of crop growth ponding will go largely unaffected simply based on planting schedule median differences in ponding when ponding was present volume not equal to zero were 12 28 47 and 84 cubic meters across all potholes for 2 weeks early 2 weeks late 4 weeks late and 6 weeks late respectively daily median pothole volumes changed by less than 3 across all potholes due to planting date modifications this shows that the explicit change in hydrology due to management activities with implications for parameters such as scs cn are minimally affected by realistic temporal changes in scheduling 3 1 maximum surface area the flood extents on an aerial basis are of interest when assessing potential damage to row crops the typical land cover in prairie potholes assessing potential maximum land extents where yield is reduced or eliminated helps understand the economic return based on agronomic inputs and outputs the averages of monthly maximum inundated areas are reported by pothole and simulation scenario in fig 2 shown as a fraction of each pothole s maximum surface area each bar represents the 25 year average of the maximum monthly surface area flooded these data are reported for each scenario and pothole combination representing the full spectrum of drainage tillage and land use characteristics data are grouped by drainage in each subpanel a d the greatest reductions in inundated area whether in scenarios with changed drainage tillage or retirement occurred outside of the growing season this is possibly observed because improved infiltration from better management or drainage installation has a potential to handle the more frequent smaller storms that occur outside of the april june time period a period of more intense rainfall 3 1 1 effects of drainage an assessment of the maximum area inundated based on drainage condition is presented in table 3 this table does not include dx r r scenarios in the averages if d0 is considered the baseline the presence of subsurface drainage d1 produces an average monthly decrease in maximum surface area by 35 for drainage statuses d2 and d3 this value is 49 and 61 respectively representing incremental percent differences of 40 and 24 between each drainage level this data suggests installing more drainage via surface inlets has diminishing returns despite significant increases in the volumetric drainage capacity provided by those inlets infiltration values were inflated by 10 33 and 50 for d1 d2 and d3 growing season april september reductions were smaller than off season reductions average reductions from the 27 to 54 surface area flooded table 3 for the growing season only were 25 36 and 48 for d1 d2 and d3 within the growing season drainage helped reduce the monthly maximum most in june and july ranges of reduction within the growing season from the baseline for d1 d2 and d3 levels by pothole varied from 15 32 30 42 and 40 53 respectively 3 1 2 effects of management activities the effects of conservation tillage were minimal during the growing season the average monthly reduction in maximum inundated area during the growing season was 4 and 17 for conservation tillage and no till respectively from an average of 27 of the maximum pothole area tillage practices had a bigger impact later in the growing season greater than 10 reduction in maximum surface area was observed for the months of july through december from a baseline 20 of the maximum area retirement of the entire watershed from conventional operations produces a 56 reduction all months baseline 30 of maximum area in maximum monthly surface area when there is no additional drainage present however when drainage remains in place and the watershed is retired from conventional management retirement only provides an average 10 reduction in maximum surface area baseline equals 20 of maximum area this is also consistent with growing season reductions of 10 when retiring just the pothole considering changes from all drainage and tillage levels the presence of perennials in retirement had a larger effect in the early and late growing season with maximum flood extents reduced by 10 27 this was not the case during june and july this may stem from similar water use requirements between cropped and retired systems during the maturation stage of crop growth the presence of perennials earlier and later in the season have a more pronounced difference both in terms of surface roughness and water use compared to bare soil 3 2 flood days the number of days a pothole is flooded is of interest when considering their impact on management scheduling and crop survival flooding impacts when managers can till spray plant or harvest and extended periods of flooding kills crops additionally understanding the permanence of standing water in a pothole helps provide their legal classification for farmability and conservation the range of total annual days of inundation are displayed as boxplots in fig 3 representing the range of values across variable annual precipitation and individual pothole differences each boxplot in the top panel represents 6 samples potholes with 25 years of simulation boxplots are grouped by increasing drainage from left to right d0 through d3 more informative is the distribution of annual days flooded in relation to total annual precipitation panel b of fig 3 splits the data from panel a based on ranked total annual precipitation representing 9 8 and 8 years of data respectively the highest precipitation years include 1998 2007 2008 2009 2010 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 this shows that 6 of the last 10 years in the simulation had abnormally high annual precipitation in agreement with observed and expected climate trends for the region splitting the data as such high precipitation years induce a significant change in the median number of days per year of inundation the medians are averaged by drainage status within each simulation in table 4 for increasing drainage the median increases from 24 7 to 67 9 days 10 2 33 1 days 6 3 22 7 days and 3 7 15 days per year when comparing between medium and high precipitation years in years where rainfall is high 15 days of inundation could be expected based on the median even with subsurface drainage and inlets installed d3 these are the conditions to be expected within the des moines lobe with much of the rainfall occurring during early growing season months the number of days that potholes are inundated has implications for both crop survival and farming operations based on simulations the most effective practice while maintaining cropping system is to install drainage but connecting multiple surface inlets to drain tile may not provide significant benefit over a single inlet the benefits of additional drainage can potentially be limited by downstream capacity despite the increased drainage potential from surface inlets as many systems are undersized castellano et al 2019 however increasing drainage leads to increased nutrient export and increased streamflow among other effects schottler et al 2014 amado et al 2017 3 2 1 effects of drainage the largest differences occur based on the presence or absence of any artificial drainage which is enumerated in table 5 these data represent summaries of the annual averages per simulation not the raw data which includes every year individually both the medians and ranges of the data are large when no drainage is present expressing both a wide variability of natural drainage and highlighting the impact of extreme weather on unaltered systems discussed in more detail previously the average maximum and minimum annual days of flooding across all potholes and undrained scenarios d0 without including the d0 r r scenario ranges from 5 4 to 118 9 days with an iqr of 20 0 64 4 days retirement of the entire watershed reduces the range and iqr to 1 37 4 days and 4 8 23 7 days respectively d0 r r with any drainage the minimum number of days is not significantly reduced while the average of maximum values is reduced from 118 9 to 55 7 38 8 and 26 5 average annual days for low medium and high drainage conditions respectively 3 2 2 effects of management activities the influence of tillage is less pronounced shown in table 6 conservation and no till management do not significantly affect the lower range of flood days but slightly increased the averages in the simulations however tillage helped reduce the upper 50 of the data the median days flooded decreased from 14 2 days under conventional management to 13 8 and 12 6 days under conservation and no till respectively similarly maximum values decreased from 66 6 days to 61 4 and 51 9 days for conservation and no till management full retirement was shown to significantly reduce flooding the effect of retiring only the pothole is minimal when considering the annual days flooded shown in table 6 the median annual flood days were reduced by 0 4 days and 1 6 days for conservation and no till respectively while full watershed retirement induced the largest change decreasing the median from 14 2 to 4 5 days retiring only the pothole b column 2 from conventional management reduced the median from 14 3 to 12 8 days considering these changes in the context of biophysical risk to crops it is unlikely that a reduction of less than 2 days annually would significantly increase the chance of crop survival throughout the growing season we see that full watershed retirement has a significant reduction this result is less concerning for farmers but may help conservationists with restoration monitoring and management 3 3 flood events the frequency of long flood events is of interest due to the direct impact on crop survival average total number of inundation events for each simulation average of 6 pothole simulations for each scenario was 238 events 185 events 146 events and 107 events for simulations with the d0 d1 d2 and d3 levels respectively excluding the dx r r whole watershed retired scenario fig 4 reports these values by scenario and bins the length of events into 1 day events 2 to 4 day events 5 to 9 day events and events greater than 10 days in length for scenarios with the whole watershed retired the number of events in the simulation are 119 83 64 and 47 events for the d0 d1 d2 and d3 levels in general the addition of drainage decreases the number of flood events for all bins within fig 4 however in panel b the number of 1 day events increased from panel a for 6 of the scenarios this is likely due to the shortening of flood events due to increased drainage though the increased drainage does not eliminate the inundation events 3 3 1 effects of drainage the effects of drainage are presented on an annual basis in table 7 the presence of subsurface drainage as represented in the model increases the average number of 1 day events compared to no drainage but decreases all other average event lengths the presence of an inlet reduces the average number of events for all durations regardless of drainage condition simulations had an average of 3 1 day events 2 26 2 to 4 day events 0 65 5 to 9 day events and 0 32 10 day events per year installation of subsurface drainage would be expected to halve the number of 5 to 9 day events and reduce the number of long 10 day events by over 67 3 3 2 effects of management activities the effects of tillage and pothole retirement are presented on an annual basis in table 8 conservation tillage on average has no measurable effect on the annual count of events other than for events of 10 days however no till on average can produce some measurable reduction in the number of flood events which was similarly shown in section 3 2 2 by the incremental reduction in median annual days flooded table 5 retirement of the watershed and pothole returns pronounced effect on the number of events in each bin with a greater than 50 reduction retirement of the pothole only results in minimal reduction of the mean number of flood events with changes noticeable only on the 2 to 10 year time horizons 3 4 area inundation frequency curves how frequently a pothole fills or significantly floods enables landowners to assess the viability of farming a pothole using a long term outlook this most clearly depicts the extents of risk to crop that a landowner might face annually allowing them to weigh options in an informed manner fig 5 depicts the fraction of the years in the 25 year simulation where the aerial flood extent reaches at least a certain fraction of the maximum pothole area where the maximum pothole area occurs at its overflow elevation the bottom right corner of each graph represents that no flooding occurs at least 100 of the years while the top left corner represents that 100 of the pothole floods only a fraction of the years or in some scenarios never from this data we see that 100 of bunny floods in 4 20 of years based on all alternative scenarios for walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth the percent of years where the pothole was 100 flooded are 4 8 16 40 4 24 8 36 and 44 84 of years respectively depending on the scenario while these values represent a range of real and simulated conditions they show the respective character of each pothole and have implications for efficient management for example mouth floods completely a high percentage of the years reflecting that it may be a good target for conservation the fact that mouth is the only pothole studies to exist in a retired state supports that argument similar trends are observable at smaller pothole extents we see that 50 of the pothole area is inundated at least once 48 80 36 68 68 96 60 96 84 100 and 72 100 of years for bunny walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth respectively the low end of this data reflects the number of years in which it is nearly guaranteed to experience crop loss due to drowning in 50 of the crop area thus potholes with smaller flood extents that occur infrequently such as bunny and walnut may be good targets for drainage as crops could be viable in at least 50 of the pothole greater than 50 of the time conversely other potholes that experience 50 aerial inundation a minimum of 1 in 3 or every other year 33 50 may be more suited for retirement or alternative management when considering profitability 3 4 1 effects of drainage fig 6a shows the smoothing of all scenarios based on drainage condition excluding instances where the whole watershed was retired and excluded mouth simulations smoothing was completed using defaults of the loess method within the geom smooth function in the ggplot2 package in r the frequency of flooding for mouth behaves significantly different compared to most other watersheds mouth floods to a greater spatial extent in a high percentage of the simulated years compared to other modeled potholes this may be due to its low overflow depth which correlates to its small storage volume coupled with the largest watershed area to pothole area ratio observed in the dataset this might suggest that separate curves are necessary for smaller potholes in watersheds with a larger yield the effects of drainage on the frequency and extent of inundation are less pronounced for extreme events at the top left of figs 6a and 6b while the smoothing and confidence bands do not represent the full range of inundation observed for the modeled potholes we can observe that drainage does not significantly alter the frequency of events which inundate the pothole to 90 of its area at the other extreme additional drainage may help reduce the certainty of 20 of the pothole flooding annually to approximately 8 for the d3 condition additionally we find that drainage can reduce the 2 year return period surface area by up to 20 based on the smoothed data 3 4 2 effects of management activities fig 6b shows the smoothing of all scenarios based on drainage condition excluding simulations where the whole watershed was retired and excluded all mouth simulations due to its irregularity with confidence bands we see that there is minimal effect of tillage and retirement on the extreme ends of the data inundation with a probability 0 25 remains consistent across all scenarios except the retired watershed while the high probability events 0 9 are also consistent when smoothed however there is some observable effect of tillage and retirement practices where no till practices help reduce the area which floods in 50 of years by approximately 10 of the maximum area full watershed retired produces a significant decrease at all levels but is a less likely scenario to be adopted by landowners however a retired pothole watershed would help reduce extreme inundation percentages by 15 and 30 at the 4 year and 2 year return intervals this has implications for major wetland restoration activities and should be considered when addressing restoration activities which reintroduce wildlife components that are highly sensitive to wetland hydroperiod 4 discussion drainage has the single largest effect on all inundation metrics assessed but despite many substantial and realistic improvements in drainage capacity the expected reduction in crop loss within farmed prairie potholes may not tip the scales of profitability the representation of subsurface drainage and surface inlets in annagnps models consistently reduced the number of days that a pothole flooded which generally increased the percentage of inundation events that were short 1 3 days long while this helps farmers in a practical sense being able to navigate equipment through potholes during more days throughout the growing season a high proportion of the inundation events across all potholes would still be harmful to corn and soybean plants while the intensity of flooding that individual crops experience measured by the length of inundation may be reduced the total area of crops exposed to stress remains largely unchanged as shown that the addition of drainage may only save 20 of the typical maximum flood extents experienced biannually fig 6 this implies that similar pothole extents will remain a concern year after year despite continued monetary investment retiring potholes from production can marginally reduce the spatial extent and duration of flooding within a pothole retiring the entire pothole watershed in effect the entire field from production significantly reduces the pothole flooding this would be an expected result based on changes to infiltration and evapotranspiration rates and soil health additionally retiring only the pothole area tends to reduce the amount of ponded water while maintaining field management practices this can be beneficial when considering how much land needs to be retired the risk of inundating the surrounding field edges would not increase based on pothole retirement when potholes are retired and drainage is removed however care needs to be taken regarding how much land is retired the balance of conserved area has implications for restoration activities that incorporate plants or attempt to attract wildlife that are sensitive to variations in hydroperiod or can affect adjacent planted areas via weed pressure for example the lesser scaup has been seen to prefer larger open water densities and high amphipod density full watershed retirement could significantly reduce the extents of flooding but would provide more consistent natural habitat overall this could have other consequences regarding monitoring and success as the restored wetland delineation may be smaller than farmed conditions this could have further implications for subsidy programs that credit wetland conservation on an aerial basis as well conservation tillage including no till practices moderately affected the flooding conservation tillage provides minimal reduction in flooding while no till had a more pronounced effect on flood reduction however field studies show that these practices can significantly improve infiltration via preferential flow through macropores over time which may not be fully captured in the long term simulation with the model through changes to the baseline cn based on land management conversely field studies reporting a consensus on the effects of tillage practices on curve number which is more dependent on residue cover are limited regardless there may be a more significant interaction between potholes and shallow subsurface flow when infiltration in the field is increased unless water is being routed significantly far from the pothole the surface and shallow subsurface flow may be largely interchangeable more study on the effects of tillage in poorly drained areas would help improve model validation by developing a more quantitatively robust understanding of the effect on infiltration and runoff generation modeling a variety of potholes across the ppr would significantly improve the characterization of their flooding under different climatic and field conditions further work in the precision farming realm should

9974,farmed prairie potholes are small isolated depressions frequently classified as semi permanent wetlands that make up a significant portion of land area in the des moines lobe dml of the larger prairie pothole region ppr historically these depressions have been subjected to significant drainage to improve their agricultural capacity however many assessments of the economic return of continuing to farm these depressions suggest that continued attempts to produce conventional row crops is not profitable and has other ecological consequences beyond crop drownout this study expands the existing discussion of land use and drainage alternatives in a watershed modeling context this study utilized the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps model to individually simulate the long term hydrology of 6 prairie potholes using a matrix of land use and drainage modifications results suggest the presence of artificial drainage is the dominant factor in prairie pothole hydrology while retirement and no till practices can provide moderate reductions in flood inundation conservation tillage induces minimal change on flood metrics results show that average annual maximum inundated surface area is reduced by at most 50 across all simulations and the median annual days flooded could be reduced by 25 days though this is less consistent when isolating high precipitation years regardless of drainage status in all scenarios there are on average more than two inundations events per year lasting 2 4 days longer events occur approximately once per year on average area inundation frequency curves suggest up to a 20 reduction in maximum pothole area inundated annually can be achieved at the 2 year return frequency the availability of this data helps characterize the hydrology of farmed potholes more generally over a wide range of conditions providing a reference for the prioritization of potholes for conservation or alternative management keywords prairie potholes annagnps precision agriculture targeted conservation farmed wetlands 1 introduction prairie potholes are surface depressions left behind after deglaciation in regions of the midwest montana and three canadian provinces known as the prairie pothole region ppr these hydrologically isolated depressions are small shallow semi permanent waterbodies fed mostly by surface runoff the des moines lobe dml of the ppr extends from central iowa through state s north central region and into southern minnesota this region is of interest due to its intensive agriculture and significant historic modifications made to pothole hydrology it has been estimated that surface and subsurface drainage activities have directly affected over 95 of potholes green et al 2019 despite these changes frequent flood events continue to have an impact on crop survival upadhyay et al 2018 rhine et al 2010 zaidi et al 2004 furthermore they are a nuisance for farmers delaying fieldwork due to their wetness or necessitating driving around them to avoid getting stuck and often cause economic losses because of this crop failure fey et al 2016 management practices within potholes generally mirror those of the field but programs and practices exist that improve either the environmental or economic outcomes of potholes and have gained some traction the conservation reserve program crp is a us federal government program that provides economic incentive for agricultural landowners to remove marginal or sensitive land from production in long term contracts gleason et al 2011 more recently the nrcs released the prairie pothole water quality and wildlife program which makes prairie potholes located in the dml up to 2 acres 0 80 ha in size eligible for payments through the environmental quality incentives program eqip if they are retired from production usda 2020 other practices to keep these areas in production include investing in more drainage or modifying tillage practices to improve soil quality and infiltration capacity in the field thereby reducing direct runoff to potholes landowners frequently need to evaluate drainage upgrades or alternative management because the extensive drainage network is aging and potentially undersized or increasingly overwhelmed due to higher precipitation as a result of climate change castellano et al 2019 pothole inundation causes significant agricultural management problems impacts include agricultural economics water quality management and natural resource conservation to name a few investing in seed fertilizer or drainage infrastructure in potholes reduces profitability despite frequent yield reductions or total crop loss in that area fey et al 2016 pothole drainage results in high nitrate and potentially high phosphorus export from the field martin et al 2019b king et al 2015 these wetlands once drained are removed from the historic wetland network that was once pervasive across north central iowa this wetland network can provide high quality nesting sites and energy sources for migratory birds or other species if restored and maintained janke et al 2019 these issues highlight the importance of monitoring and modeling pothole hydrology water quality and crop failure comprehensive monitoring leads to robust model calibration which can be used to create decision making frameworks for farmers public entities and policymakers classification of the issues presented as wicked problems churchman 1967 is becoming more widely recognized for example the extreme hypoxia experienced in the gulf of mexico due to high nitrate loading from the mississippi watershed patterson et al 2013 local scale support is undoubtedly required to empower change through modeling and decision support tools modeling prairie potholes has been of interest in recent years due to their ambiguous definition under the clean water act waters of the us cohen et al 2016 golden et al 2014 this includes understanding their surface water connectivity or spill and fill dynamics that have been modeled in a modified soil and water assessment tool swat model evenson et al 2016 and using a new and highly specific u s geological survey model the pothole hydrology linked systems simulator phyliss mckenna et al 2018 these studies attempt to show the connectivity of geographically isolated wetlands such as potholes and assess their impact on downstream waters understanding individual pothole dynamics is as important as understanding watershed scale dynamics for enabling local decision making understanding hydrologic fluxes in prairie potholes at the field scale allows for specific and targeted input into how they are managed something difficult to do when assessing watershed hydrology at scale individual potholes have been modeled using the usda annualized agricultural non point source pollution model annagnps by modifying the cell and reach resolution and wetland parameters upadhyay et al 2018 annagnps is well suited to very small watersheds such as those that drain to prairie potholes calibration of these models found moderate success in simulating flood depth but updates to the source code provided stronger calibration to standing water volume in the pothole at a daily time step nahkala 2020 furthermore upadhyay et al 2019 included an exploratory study of how simple changes in the annagnps model might affect flooding in farmed prairie pothole systems this limited exploration included modeling two individual prairie potholes using three different land management scenarios and did not consider different drainage strategies thus a more extensive study including a larger number of potholes and deeper exploration of land use and drainage intensities is needed the current study is adds to our understanding of pothole flood dynamics by 1 introducing four more potholes to the assessment completed by upadhyay et al 2019 and by 2 modeling a range of natural to intensive drainage conditions perennial and row crop land uses and conventional and conservation oriented tillage strategies that can be used in prairie pothole systems this watershed modeling in annagnps includes all combinations of drainage tillage and land use variables described later that reflect real management alternatives for landowners the goal of this study is thus to more broadly describe the influence of a multitude of land management practices on prairie pothole flooding via watershed modeling by quantifying impacts of model inputs on the temporal and spatial extent of flooding 2 methods 2 1 study area the prairie pothole study area sits on the border of two adjacent huc 12 watersheds near ames ia within the dml of the ppr five potholes reside in two adjacent fields managed by iowa state university isu that straddle the walnut creek and worrell creek watersheds on the border of story and boone county fig 1 a sixth pothole resides approximately 6 km northwest on an isu research farm these potholes named bunny walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth have been previously modeled on an individual basis upadhyay et al 2018 2019 nahkala 2020 and are the only potholes described in this study with the exception of mouth all modeled potholes were conventionally farmed during the 2016 2018 model calibration period which included a corn and soybean rotation conventional tillage no irrigation and standard fertilizer and pesticide application the western portion of mouth is registered in the conservation reserve program while the eastern portion is also conventionally farmed the potholes have varying surface and subsurface drainage which has been extensively described in previous studies at this location martin et al 2019a bunny is the most intensely drained with multiple surface inlets while hen and mouth are assumed to have no surface or subsurface drainage lettuce has subsurface drainage while walnut and cardinal have a surface inlet connected to subsurface drainage hourly water levels were recorded during the growing seasons of 2016 2018 using pressure transducers installed at the bottom of each pothole and the methods are fully described by martin et al 2019a 2 2 scenarios individual models of the six potholes shown in fig 1 were built using the annagnps model and were calibrated to daily water level and volume data nahkala 2020 then we identified alternative management scenarios that might affect prairie pothole inundation changes to the drainage intensity switching to tillage practices that improve infiltration modifying the planting schedule and retiring the pothole or its entire microwatershed these scenarios are realistic alternatives for common practices within the des moines lobe and did not consider emerging agricultural markets and pothole agricultural uses such as biofuel production in marginal areas feng et al 2017 model scenarios are listed in table 1 which lists modifications to runoff curve number cn for the hydrologic soil groups at these sites and to the modeled infiltration of the pothole other data files for field management and schedule were modified to call the correct management inputs within the model but only management schedule directly references hydrologic parameters that differ between the scenarios we investigated changes to the baseline calibrated models included 1 modifying artificial drainage by changing infiltration to represent additional or removed infrastructure 2 changing tillage practices by changing cn in the pothole or field to conservation or no till 3 retiring the pothole to perennial vegetation or in one scenario retiring the whole watershed by replacing the cropping system with pasture which includes modifying cn and management schedule including crop seeding within the model and 4 modifying the planting schedule across all years simulated table 1 displays a matrix of the most significant changes of interest drainage tillage and land retirement are presented in to represent all scenarios modeled for each pothole the simulation identifiers for this study are listed in this table which includes drainage status codes field land use codes and tillage practice codes the planting schedule changes four additional scenarios are not included in this table but are discussed separately later for those scenarios planting schedule was modified while maintaining the existing conditions for each pothole these scenarios adjusted all planting operations by 2 week increments representing a range of 2 weeks to 6 weeks from normal operation changes in planting schedule represent one component of uncertainty within the existing model as planting date can change significantly year to year based on soil temperature and wetness zipper 2018 2 3 data and model construction annagnps utilizes topographic climatic soil and land use data for watershed simulations and calculates outputs at a daily time step topographic data includes a dem that is converted to spatially aggregated cells or subwatersheds dominant soil class is assigned to each cell which influences infiltration rates land use data includes land cover or cropping information included management schedules vegetative cover curve number and other land use parameters a wetland data section includes data on where wetlands are placed on the reach network within a watershed this data includes surface area infiltration and overflow parameters to calculate a water balance within the wetland 2 3 1 model setup and calibration a 1 m dem was used for the delineation of subwatershed cell and reach networks the basic units used by annagnps to determine runoff and routing the data parameters and process used for physical model setup is previously described in upadhyay et al 2019 and nahkala 2020 briefly the modeled pothole wetlands were placed at the end of the cell and reach network for the respective microwatershed pressure transducers installed at the lowest elevation of each pothole measured hourly water level during the growing season approx may september in 2016 2017 and 2018 these data were aggregated to a daily time step to match the annagnps model time step and the model was driven using the weather data described below an iterative method using python was performed to calibrate agricultural curve numbers and infiltration within the pothole matching the simulated daily ponded water volume to the observed values using multiple statistical metrics details for this method can be found in nahkala 2020 these values were then used as the baseline model and changes to model inputs described below allowed for the simulation of additional 2 3 2 land use data and representation these calibrated values of scs cn and wetland pothole infiltration were then the baseline for modifications to simulate scenarios beyond the actual field conditions from monitoring the water balance of these potholes approximately 33 and 50 of infiltrated outflow was accounted for by surface inlets in bunny and walnut respectively martin et al 2019a which were used to inflate the infiltration rate in the pothole for medium d2 and high d3 drainage a value of 10 was chosen where only low drainage d1 was present where no drainage was present the maximum drainage from d soils 24 mm d 1 was used from huffman et al 2013 where this value was higher than the calibrated value of infiltration for current conditions the appropriate drainage outflow contribution ratio 10 33 or 50 was used to estimate a natural drainage condition this was necessary for the walnut model where values of 14 16 and 22 mm d 1 where used to represent d0 d1 and d2 these values are within the natural infiltration range for monitored potholes in iowa schilling et al 2019 roth and capel 2018 table 2 shows the typical values for each cn parameter and any modifications made during calibration calibrated models used modified curve numbers for conventional tillage where cn was adjusted upwards compared to nrcs standard published values for bunny walnut lettuce and cardinal cn was calibrated downwards from standard values for hen and mouth conservation tillage was represented by row crop straight row rc sr in good conditions and no modifications were made to the standard values additionally the rc sr no till value was used without modifications nrcs 2008 these cn values are closely correlated with surface residue irrespective of specific tillage practice but are not specific in situ measurements within these poorly drained areas elhakeem and papanicolaou 2009 retirement to perennial plantings was represented by pasture in good conditions with no modifications to the standard values 2 3 3 climate the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and the sustaining the earth s watersheds agricultural research data system stewards were combined to create a climate dataset for this study daily precipitation was sourced from prism which include statistically generated precipitation depths with high spatial resolution based on local weather stations other climate parameters including wind velocity wind direction maximum and minimum temperature dew point temperature and solar radiation were sourced from stewards from a weather station within 6 km from the managed field plots the years 1992 2018 were used with the first two years accounting for a model warmup period the long term simulation is necessary to generate appropriate confidence in the range of annual and seasonal precipitation expected when assessing flood events in the potholes 2 4 assessment methods we treated the modifications to planting date as a simple way to measure sensitivity of the curve number to planting date these were analyzed separately from the main output evaluation but were used for context when considering the uncertainty of the model the rest of the following analyses were conducted considering the drainage tillage and land use matrix described in table 1 we assessed the maximum surface area flooded during each month in the simulation and calculated as an average of all years in the simulation the volumetric time series output from the model was converted to surface area via two regressions prior studies had determined depth volume area relationships using a quadratic relationship between depth and volume and depth and area martin et al 2019a for depths less than 0 1 m a linear model was used these models were fit resulting in an r2 of greater than 0 99 for all potholes for the analysis in this study a conditional solving algorithm was used to solve the quadratic for water depth the depth time series was then converted to area using the second quadratic relationship we then calculated the maximum inundation area in each month of the simulation and averaged these values by month for all years in the simulation we assessed the number of flood days in the growing season annagnps is a daily time step model and thus this was denoted by the presence or absence of water at the end of a simulated day this assessment was summarized on a monthly basis to understand how flood dynamics of consequences in the agricultural operational system we counted the number of consecutive days of inundation each series of consecutive days was considered a flood event the length of flood events is directly related to the biophysical risk a crop experiences during the growing season scenarios were compared based on the frequency and total number of events that lasted long enough to threaten crops general risk began at events longer than 2 days especially during the first half of the growing season while extreme risk was considered to be events of 4 days or longer at any point during the growing season deboer and ritter 1970 mukhtar et al 1990 rhine et al 2010 analogous to flow duration curves for streams area inundation frequency curves were generated for each scenario and pothole these graphs could be replicated for pothole depths or volume however key operational parameters in flood risk assessments and risk management for farmers are typically communicated on an aerial basis as seen through 100 year floodplain mapping through fema programs or the acre by acre yield and soil mapping utilized in precision agriculture a frequency curve was created describing the frequency percent of simulated years with which incremental extents of the pothole surface area were flooded as a percentage of total pothole surface area the percent of years that a pothole flooded to incremental pothole extents as a percentage of the maximum area was calculated at increments of 10 of the total surface area individual scenarios were compared while further comparison was done between constant drainage or land use characteristics the loess smoothing method was used to aggregate the curves based on drainage and land use conditions for a general comparison 3 results the results of changes in planting date reflect a general sensitivity of the model to land management activities these dates can be highly variable year to year as most keenly observed during wet years such as 2018 and 2019 when many farmers were prevented from planting millions of acres for extended periods of time due to wet conditions these simulations span an 8 week planting window from mid april until mid june suggesting that in the early stages of crop growth ponding will go largely unaffected simply based on planting schedule median differences in ponding when ponding was present volume not equal to zero were 12 28 47 and 84 cubic meters across all potholes for 2 weeks early 2 weeks late 4 weeks late and 6 weeks late respectively daily median pothole volumes changed by less than 3 across all potholes due to planting date modifications this shows that the explicit change in hydrology due to management activities with implications for parameters such as scs cn are minimally affected by realistic temporal changes in scheduling 3 1 maximum surface area the flood extents on an aerial basis are of interest when assessing potential damage to row crops the typical land cover in prairie potholes assessing potential maximum land extents where yield is reduced or eliminated helps understand the economic return based on agronomic inputs and outputs the averages of monthly maximum inundated areas are reported by pothole and simulation scenario in fig 2 shown as a fraction of each pothole s maximum surface area each bar represents the 25 year average of the maximum monthly surface area flooded these data are reported for each scenario and pothole combination representing the full spectrum of drainage tillage and land use characteristics data are grouped by drainage in each subpanel a d the greatest reductions in inundated area whether in scenarios with changed drainage tillage or retirement occurred outside of the growing season this is possibly observed because improved infiltration from better management or drainage installation has a potential to handle the more frequent smaller storms that occur outside of the april june time period a period of more intense rainfall 3 1 1 effects of drainage an assessment of the maximum area inundated based on drainage condition is presented in table 3 this table does not include dx r r scenarios in the averages if d0 is considered the baseline the presence of subsurface drainage d1 produces an average monthly decrease in maximum surface area by 35 for drainage statuses d2 and d3 this value is 49 and 61 respectively representing incremental percent differences of 40 and 24 between each drainage level this data suggests installing more drainage via surface inlets has diminishing returns despite significant increases in the volumetric drainage capacity provided by those inlets infiltration values were inflated by 10 33 and 50 for d1 d2 and d3 growing season april september reductions were smaller than off season reductions average reductions from the 27 to 54 surface area flooded table 3 for the growing season only were 25 36 and 48 for d1 d2 and d3 within the growing season drainage helped reduce the monthly maximum most in june and july ranges of reduction within the growing season from the baseline for d1 d2 and d3 levels by pothole varied from 15 32 30 42 and 40 53 respectively 3 1 2 effects of management activities the effects of conservation tillage were minimal during the growing season the average monthly reduction in maximum inundated area during the growing season was 4 and 17 for conservation tillage and no till respectively from an average of 27 of the maximum pothole area tillage practices had a bigger impact later in the growing season greater than 10 reduction in maximum surface area was observed for the months of july through december from a baseline 20 of the maximum area retirement of the entire watershed from conventional operations produces a 56 reduction all months baseline 30 of maximum area in maximum monthly surface area when there is no additional drainage present however when drainage remains in place and the watershed is retired from conventional management retirement only provides an average 10 reduction in maximum surface area baseline equals 20 of maximum area this is also consistent with growing season reductions of 10 when retiring just the pothole considering changes from all drainage and tillage levels the presence of perennials in retirement had a larger effect in the early and late growing season with maximum flood extents reduced by 10 27 this was not the case during june and july this may stem from similar water use requirements between cropped and retired systems during the maturation stage of crop growth the presence of perennials earlier and later in the season have a more pronounced difference both in terms of surface roughness and water use compared to bare soil 3 2 flood days the number of days a pothole is flooded is of interest when considering their impact on management scheduling and crop survival flooding impacts when managers can till spray plant or harvest and extended periods of flooding kills crops additionally understanding the permanence of standing water in a pothole helps provide their legal classification for farmability and conservation the range of total annual days of inundation are displayed as boxplots in fig 3 representing the range of values across variable annual precipitation and individual pothole differences each boxplot in the top panel represents 6 samples potholes with 25 years of simulation boxplots are grouped by increasing drainage from left to right d0 through d3 more informative is the distribution of annual days flooded in relation to total annual precipitation panel b of fig 3 splits the data from panel a based on ranked total annual precipitation representing 9 8 and 8 years of data respectively the highest precipitation years include 1998 2007 2008 2009 2010 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 this shows that 6 of the last 10 years in the simulation had abnormally high annual precipitation in agreement with observed and expected climate trends for the region splitting the data as such high precipitation years induce a significant change in the median number of days per year of inundation the medians are averaged by drainage status within each simulation in table 4 for increasing drainage the median increases from 24 7 to 67 9 days 10 2 33 1 days 6 3 22 7 days and 3 7 15 days per year when comparing between medium and high precipitation years in years where rainfall is high 15 days of inundation could be expected based on the median even with subsurface drainage and inlets installed d3 these are the conditions to be expected within the des moines lobe with much of the rainfall occurring during early growing season months the number of days that potholes are inundated has implications for both crop survival and farming operations based on simulations the most effective practice while maintaining cropping system is to install drainage but connecting multiple surface inlets to drain tile may not provide significant benefit over a single inlet the benefits of additional drainage can potentially be limited by downstream capacity despite the increased drainage potential from surface inlets as many systems are undersized castellano et al 2019 however increasing drainage leads to increased nutrient export and increased streamflow among other effects schottler et al 2014 amado et al 2017 3 2 1 effects of drainage the largest differences occur based on the presence or absence of any artificial drainage which is enumerated in table 5 these data represent summaries of the annual averages per simulation not the raw data which includes every year individually both the medians and ranges of the data are large when no drainage is present expressing both a wide variability of natural drainage and highlighting the impact of extreme weather on unaltered systems discussed in more detail previously the average maximum and minimum annual days of flooding across all potholes and undrained scenarios d0 without including the d0 r r scenario ranges from 5 4 to 118 9 days with an iqr of 20 0 64 4 days retirement of the entire watershed reduces the range and iqr to 1 37 4 days and 4 8 23 7 days respectively d0 r r with any drainage the minimum number of days is not significantly reduced while the average of maximum values is reduced from 118 9 to 55 7 38 8 and 26 5 average annual days for low medium and high drainage conditions respectively 3 2 2 effects of management activities the influence of tillage is less pronounced shown in table 6 conservation and no till management do not significantly affect the lower range of flood days but slightly increased the averages in the simulations however tillage helped reduce the upper 50 of the data the median days flooded decreased from 14 2 days under conventional management to 13 8 and 12 6 days under conservation and no till respectively similarly maximum values decreased from 66 6 days to 61 4 and 51 9 days for conservation and no till management full retirement was shown to significantly reduce flooding the effect of retiring only the pothole is minimal when considering the annual days flooded shown in table 6 the median annual flood days were reduced by 0 4 days and 1 6 days for conservation and no till respectively while full watershed retirement induced the largest change decreasing the median from 14 2 to 4 5 days retiring only the pothole b column 2 from conventional management reduced the median from 14 3 to 12 8 days considering these changes in the context of biophysical risk to crops it is unlikely that a reduction of less than 2 days annually would significantly increase the chance of crop survival throughout the growing season we see that full watershed retirement has a significant reduction this result is less concerning for farmers but may help conservationists with restoration monitoring and management 3 3 flood events the frequency of long flood events is of interest due to the direct impact on crop survival average total number of inundation events for each simulation average of 6 pothole simulations for each scenario was 238 events 185 events 146 events and 107 events for simulations with the d0 d1 d2 and d3 levels respectively excluding the dx r r whole watershed retired scenario fig 4 reports these values by scenario and bins the length of events into 1 day events 2 to 4 day events 5 to 9 day events and events greater than 10 days in length for scenarios with the whole watershed retired the number of events in the simulation are 119 83 64 and 47 events for the d0 d1 d2 and d3 levels in general the addition of drainage decreases the number of flood events for all bins within fig 4 however in panel b the number of 1 day events increased from panel a for 6 of the scenarios this is likely due to the shortening of flood events due to increased drainage though the increased drainage does not eliminate the inundation events 3 3 1 effects of drainage the effects of drainage are presented on an annual basis in table 7 the presence of subsurface drainage as represented in the model increases the average number of 1 day events compared to no drainage but decreases all other average event lengths the presence of an inlet reduces the average number of events for all durations regardless of drainage condition simulations had an average of 3 1 day events 2 26 2 to 4 day events 0 65 5 to 9 day events and 0 32 10 day events per year installation of subsurface drainage would be expected to halve the number of 5 to 9 day events and reduce the number of long 10 day events by over 67 3 3 2 effects of management activities the effects of tillage and pothole retirement are presented on an annual basis in table 8 conservation tillage on average has no measurable effect on the annual count of events other than for events of 10 days however no till on average can produce some measurable reduction in the number of flood events which was similarly shown in section 3 2 2 by the incremental reduction in median annual days flooded table 5 retirement of the watershed and pothole returns pronounced effect on the number of events in each bin with a greater than 50 reduction retirement of the pothole only results in minimal reduction of the mean number of flood events with changes noticeable only on the 2 to 10 year time horizons 3 4 area inundation frequency curves how frequently a pothole fills or significantly floods enables landowners to assess the viability of farming a pothole using a long term outlook this most clearly depicts the extents of risk to crop that a landowner might face annually allowing them to weigh options in an informed manner fig 5 depicts the fraction of the years in the 25 year simulation where the aerial flood extent reaches at least a certain fraction of the maximum pothole area where the maximum pothole area occurs at its overflow elevation the bottom right corner of each graph represents that no flooding occurs at least 100 of the years while the top left corner represents that 100 of the pothole floods only a fraction of the years or in some scenarios never from this data we see that 100 of bunny floods in 4 20 of years based on all alternative scenarios for walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth the percent of years where the pothole was 100 flooded are 4 8 16 40 4 24 8 36 and 44 84 of years respectively depending on the scenario while these values represent a range of real and simulated conditions they show the respective character of each pothole and have implications for efficient management for example mouth floods completely a high percentage of the years reflecting that it may be a good target for conservation the fact that mouth is the only pothole studies to exist in a retired state supports that argument similar trends are observable at smaller pothole extents we see that 50 of the pothole area is inundated at least once 48 80 36 68 68 96 60 96 84 100 and 72 100 of years for bunny walnut lettuce cardinal hen and mouth respectively the low end of this data reflects the number of years in which it is nearly guaranteed to experience crop loss due to drowning in 50 of the crop area thus potholes with smaller flood extents that occur infrequently such as bunny and walnut may be good targets for drainage as crops could be viable in at least 50 of the pothole greater than 50 of the time conversely other potholes that experience 50 aerial inundation a minimum of 1 in 3 or every other year 33 50 may be more suited for retirement or alternative management when considering profitability 3 4 1 effects of drainage fig 6a shows the smoothing of all scenarios based on drainage condition excluding instances where the whole watershed was retired and excluded mouth simulations smoothing was completed using defaults of the loess method within the geom smooth function in the ggplot2 package in r the frequency of flooding for mouth behaves significantly different compared to most other watersheds mouth floods to a greater spatial extent in a high percentage of the simulated years compared to other modeled potholes this may be due to its low overflow depth which correlates to its small storage volume coupled with the largest watershed area to pothole area ratio observed in the dataset this might suggest that separate curves are necessary for smaller potholes in watersheds with a larger yield the effects of drainage on the frequency and extent of inundation are less pronounced for extreme events at the top left of figs 6a and 6b while the smoothing and confidence bands do not represent the full range of inundation observed for the modeled potholes we can observe that drainage does not significantly alter the frequency of events which inundate the pothole to 90 of its area at the other extreme additional drainage may help reduce the certainty of 20 of the pothole flooding annually to approximately 8 for the d3 condition additionally we find that drainage can reduce the 2 year return period surface area by up to 20 based on the smoothed data 3 4 2 effects of management activities fig 6b shows the smoothing of all scenarios based on drainage condition excluding simulations where the whole watershed was retired and excluded all mouth simulations due to its irregularity with confidence bands we see that there is minimal effect of tillage and retirement on the extreme ends of the data inundation with a probability 0 25 remains consistent across all scenarios except the retired watershed while the high probability events 0 9 are also consistent when smoothed however there is some observable effect of tillage and retirement practices where no till practices help reduce the area which floods in 50 of years by approximately 10 of the maximum area full watershed retired produces a significant decrease at all levels but is a less likely scenario to be adopted by landowners however a retired pothole watershed would help reduce extreme inundation percentages by 15 and 30 at the 4 year and 2 year return intervals this has implications for major wetland restoration activities and should be considered when addressing restoration activities which reintroduce wildlife components that are highly sensitive to wetland hydroperiod 4 discussion drainage has the single largest effect on all inundation metrics assessed but despite many substantial and realistic improvements in drainage capacity the expected reduction in crop loss within farmed prairie potholes may not tip the scales of profitability the representation of subsurface drainage and surface inlets in annagnps models consistently reduced the number of days that a pothole flooded which generally increased the percentage of inundation events that were short 1 3 days long while this helps farmers in a practical sense being able to navigate equipment through potholes during more days throughout the growing season a high proportion of the inundation events across all potholes would still be harmful to corn and soybean plants while the intensity of flooding that individual crops experience measured by the length of inundation may be reduced the total area of crops exposed to stress remains largely unchanged as shown that the addition of drainage may only save 20 of the typical maximum flood extents experienced biannually fig 6 this implies that similar pothole extents will remain a concern year after year despite continued monetary investment retiring potholes from production can marginally reduce the spatial extent and duration of flooding within a pothole retiring the entire pothole watershed in effect the entire field from production significantly reduces the pothole flooding this would be an expected result based on changes to infiltration and evapotranspiration rates and soil health additionally retiring only the pothole area tends to reduce the amount of ponded water while maintaining field management practices this can be beneficial when considering how much land needs to be retired the risk of inundating the surrounding field edges would not increase based on pothole retirement when potholes are retired and drainage is removed however care needs to be taken regarding how much land is retired the balance of conserved area has implications for restoration activities that incorporate plants or attempt to attract wildlife that are sensitive to variations in hydroperiod or can affect adjacent planted areas via weed pressure for example the lesser scaup has been seen to prefer larger open water densities and high amphipod density full watershed retirement could significantly reduce the extents of flooding but would provide more consistent natural habitat overall this could have other consequences regarding monitoring and success as the restored wetland delineation may be smaller than farmed conditions this could have further implications for subsidy programs that credit wetland conservation on an aerial basis as well conservation tillage including no till practices moderately affected the flooding conservation tillage provides minimal reduction in flooding while no till had a more pronounced effect on flood reduction however field studies show that these practices can significantly improve infiltration via preferential flow through macropores over time which may not be fully captured in the long term simulation with the model through changes to the baseline cn based on land management conversely field studies reporting a consensus on the effects of tillage practices on curve number which is more dependent on residue cover are limited regardless there may be a more significant interaction between potholes and shallow subsurface flow when infiltration in the field is increased unless water is being routed significantly far from the pothole the surface and shallow subsurface flow may be largely interchangeable more study on the effects of tillage in poorly drained areas would help improve model validation by developing a more quantitatively robust understanding of the effect on infiltration and runoff generation modeling a variety of potholes across the ppr would significantly improve the characterization of their flooding under different climatic and field conditions further work in the precision farming realm should
