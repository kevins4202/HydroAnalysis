13190,nanofiltration nf membrane has been applied for the treatment of wastewater owing to its unique features such as higher selectivity towards divalent polyvalent ions while allowing permeation for monovalent ions and small molecules of less than 100 da thus the use of nf in wastewater treatment is promising for water recycling reuse and recovery of other valuable products in industrial wastewater treatment this review highlights the current application of nf for water recycling reuse and product recovery within multiple industries such as textile food oil and gas mining tannery pharmaceutical as well as pulp and paper industry the performance of nf either as stand alone or integrated with other processes for improving the overall treatment efficiency and minimizing membrane issues is discussed finally future perspectives for nf applications in industrial wastewater treatment for water recycling reuse and product recovery are discussed keywords nanofiltration membrane technology water recycling reuse industrial wastewater product recovery 1 introduction in this era of climate change which is very challenging for the global population the importance of water as a beneficial commodity for humankind is indisputable the demand for water is expected to increase annually and it has been estimated that by 2030 the water demand for the whole world will be approximately 6900 billion m3 this amount is approximately 64 more than the amount of water accessible to most nations 1 thus increasing the supply of clean water by alternative means such as desalination and water recycling and reuse should be one of the main priorities of the world towards this end the united nations un through the sustainable development goals sdg initiative has set the goal for water namely through goal no 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all under this goal water recycling and reuse have been seen as one of the important methods to achieve the goal two specific targets that have been specifically mentioned are that by 2030 the world should i improve water quality by minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials reducing pollution halving the proportion of untreated wastewater eliminating dumping and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally and ii expand capacity building support and international cooperation to developing countries in water and sanitation related activities and programmes including water efficiency water harvesting wastewater treatment desalination recycling and reuse technologies 2 over the last decade data have shown that water recycling and reuse activities have increased exponentially 3 various projects have been initiated to treat wastewater from different industries especially from municipal sources for either non potable or potable applications multiple technologies for tertiary treatment of the effluent have been used including membrane technologies adsorption and advanced oxidation however a recent report by the global water market 2017 indicated that there is still a vast potential for research and innovation as well as the implementation of water recycling and reuse which can still be explored 4 their data showed that up to 2017 the amount of water that has been reused and recycled was only 1 2 billion m3 per year which constituted only about 4 of the total estimated wastewater the use of membrane technologies such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro within the tertiary processes for water recycling and reuse has also been increasing over the years apart from that membrane bioreactor mbr has also been popular as part of the processes by combining biological treatment with membrane separation capability these membrane technologies have been well received by many industries because of their efficiencies small footprint high productivity modular system and clean process yang et al 3 have provided an excellent review on the use of membrane technologies for water recycling and reuse focusing specifically on effluent from municipal sewage plants apart from that other reviews have also been published generally on the use of membrane technologies in combination with other processes for water recycling and reuse for different industries such as oil and gas 5 pulp and paper 6 dairy and soy processing 7 and acid mine drainage 8 this review is intended to focus only on the use of nf as one of the membrane technologies that have been applied for water recycling and reuse within various industries besides water recycling and reuse numerous published works have shown that nf is also promising for the recovery of valuable products or by products from wastewater nf is unique in comparison to uf since it demonstrates better retention of small molecules such as peptides sugars and amino acids 9 compared to ro nf has higher fluxes and greater selectivity towards divalent polyvalent ions while allowing permeation for monovalent ions and small molecules of less than 100 da ro generally rejects almost all ions and molecules and only allows water to pass through thus in terms of water recycling reuse and product recovery nf is more suitable for the purpose excellent reviews on nf have been published by quite a number of authors on various aspects of nf membranes including the overall nf technology and development 10 nf membrane fabrication 11 nf for water purification 12 and nf for removal of micropollutants 13 however there has not been any review specifically on the use of nf for water recycling reuse and product recovery from various industries which is the primary purpose of this review paper the industries that will be focused upon will be the food textile oil and gas mining pharmaceutical pulp and paper and tannery industries these are the main industries upon which nf membranes have found widespread applications fig 1 shows the number of publications of nf application in various industrial wastewater treatments that have been reported in the scopus database since the year 2000 the keywords nanofiltration and specific industrial wastewater term such as textile food pharmaceutical pulp and paper mining oil and gas tannery were used for the data search a total of 411 articles were found to be relevant to the issues and were categorized as shown in fig 1 2 overview of nanofiltration and its separation mechanisms the understanding on the nf membranes processes has been well established over the last few decades since it was first recognized in the early 90s commercially nf is known as membranes with a pore size of about 1 nm in addition to having a molecular weight cut off mwco of 300 500 da and salt rejection that is low 10 30 for monovalent salts such as nacl and very high 80 100 for divalent salts such as na2so4 these fundamental properties differentiate the nf membranes from ro membranes thus allowing nf to have greater selectivity for different classes of small molecules and ions this in turn enables nf to be applied in niche applications in various industries especially water and wastewater treatment pharmaceutical and biotechnology and food engineering 10 apart from nf with mwco smaller than 500 da tight nf loose nf mwco 500 2000 da has also been introduced and applied in numerous applications such as polyphenol fractionation and sugar separation 14 its lower salt rejection higher separation selectivity to small molecules and higher permeability is promising for resource recovery especially in textile wastewater treatment unlike tight nf which is widely available in the market due to its stable performance the competitive products of loose nf and its market demand are still limited 14 in terms of membrane materials the polymeric nf has widespread application in the wastewater treatment field but its fouling issue and long term stability are the major concern 15 on the other hand the ceramic membrane with high thermal and chemical stability good mechanical strength ease of cleaning procedure and long membrane lifetime is a promising alternative to the polymeric membrane 16 however its packing density and high investment cost require further improvement table 1 provides descriptions of several commercially available nf membranes made from various materials over the last two decades various studies have confirmed the separation mechanism of nf membranes which basically consists of steric donnan and dielectric effects as shown in fig 2 28 32 the steric effect which is also a common rejection mechanism in mf and uf is basically due to the exclusion of molecular size by the membrane pores solutes with larger molecular size in comparison to the membrane pore size are effectively rejected by the membranes solutes smaller than the membrane pore size will be able to permeate through depending on the hindered diffusion transport phenomena across the membrane pores 33 for nf membranes the steric effect will be influential for permeation of small solutes such as saccharides glucose sucrose and raffinose 30 polyethylene glycol peg 34 hormones 35 and phenolic compounds 36 the donnan effect or the electrostatic repulsion effect comes into play due to the presence of charge on the membrane surface 31 33 small ions with either positive or negative charges will not be affected by the steric exclusion effect but will be significantly affected by the donnan effect the presence of a fixed charge on the membrane surface will create a potential difference called donnan potential at the membrane bulk interface this potential will cause the counter ion species to be repelled due to the electrostatic repulsion effect to maintain the electroneutrality condition of the solution the co ion will also be simultaneously rejected the higher the charge of the counter ion the higher the rejection that will take place as a result of the aforementioned events electrostatic attraction or repulsion occurs in accordance with the ion valence and the membrane s fixed charge which may evolve depending on the localized ionic environment the third effect which is the dielectric effect refers to the solvation energy barrier formed when an ion passes from a solvent of one dielectric constant to a solvent of a different dielectric constant 37 38 zhu et al 38 demonstrated that electric field behavior and ion concentration distribution inside the nanopore reflect the variation of the dielectric effect consequently the dielectric effect affects the repulsive force to co ions and hence the rejection performance the combination of these separation mechanism effects has allowed nf membranes to be effective for various types of applications that will be elucidated in this review for different industries 3 application of nanofiltration for water recycling reuse and product recovery the presence of contaminants in industrial wastewaters is one of the global environmental problems textile food oil and gas mining tannery pharmaceutical as well as pulp and paper industries are examples of industrial sectors that consume a huge amount of water in their processes and generate wastewater that negatively influences the ecosystem water bodies soil and human health due to the increasing freshwater scarcity and environmental protection concerns water recycling and reuse as well as other resource recovery have been promoted in industries 39 in this context nf is one of the attractive technologies for that purpose this section discusses the application of nf in the industries as mentioned earlier for water recycling reuse and resource recovery 3 1 textile industry the textile industry which is one of the most water intensive sectors consumes a massive amount of water during the multiple production stages and generates up to 200 350 m3 of wastewater per ton of finished products 40 the generated wastewater is usually rich in color dyes chemical oxygen demand cod inorganic salts suspended solids and trace heavy metals 41 42 dyes appear to be the most problematic contaminant among these compounds due to their persistent carcinogenic and poor biodegradability properties the discharge of improperly treated textile effluent will adversely affect flora and fauna present in the water bodies and at the same time deplete the availability of clean water resources for human consumption hence advanced treatment processes are required to handle the textile effluent containing recalcitrant dyes and inorganic salts where both could be potentially recovered and reused in the textile industry the sustainable concept of recovering dyes and salt solutions from textile effluent could be materialized with nf membrane since the nf process can separate the dyes and salts particularly monovalent salts into two different streams this approach not only recovers valuable resources from textile effluent but also achieves multiple benefits such as preventing the release of hazardous pollutants to the environment minimizing the consumption of resources e g dyes water and salts and saving costs for instance chu et al 43 demonstrated the use of hollow fiber loose polyethersulfone nf membrane that could attain high fractionation efficiency of dye salt mixtures where the rejection of dye congo red 0 1 g l is as high as 99 9 while allowing more than 93 of nacl salt 1 g l to pass through the membrane their result highlights the potential of loose nf to recover dyes and salt solutions in textile effluent treatment the nf process could also remove other impurities present in the textile effluent 44 this is reflected in the study of tavangar et al 45 where real textile industry wastewater was used for nf filtration the textile effluent contained a wide range of reactive dyes with different structures monoazo diazo triazo and multiazo and molecular weights 300 1200 g mol as well as high turbidity 1500 ntu cod 2690 mg l and total dissolved solids tds 7500 mg l apart from separating the color rejection of 87 and allowing most inorganic salts to pass through 96 the use of loose nf membrane nadir np010 also reduced 74 of cod and 99 of turbidity this treatment produced salt solution with good quality for reuse in the factory and eased the handling of concentrated dye solution generally the separation mechanisms of nf in treating textile wastewater could be attributed to size exclusion and donnan exclusion effects in comparison to inorganic salt ions dyes with larger molecular weight tend to be rejected better by nf membrane hence explaining the high dye salt fractionation efficiency of the membrane through size exclusion mechanism as an example ji et al 46 observed that their prepared nf membranes attained high rejection for large molecular weight dyes i e congo red 99 9 and direct yellow 24 97 7 in comparison only about 78 5 of smaller molecular weight dye such as acid orange 10 was removed salahshoor et al 47 described the interplay between size exclusion and donnan effect mechanisms of negatively charged nf membrane surface charge of 9 4 to 19 91 mv and mwco 789 da in rejecting two oppositely charged dyes of rr195 anionic and mb cationic and various molecular weight 1136 3 and 319 8 da respectively the slightly higher retention of rr195 97 2 compared to mb 90 2 could be attributed to its larger molecular size and stronger electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion that repels anionic rr195 dyes from the negatively charged membrane surface despite the promising dyes rejection and dye salt fractionation performance of nf membrane the process feasibility is hindered by one challenge fouling which is a typical problem found in any membrane operation fouling is a phenomenon whereby impurities are deposited on a membrane surface or in membrane pores such that the membrane performance is greatly affected and degraded 48 the interactions between the membrane surface and the foulants especially dyes in textile effluent are the dominant factor affecting the severity of fouling 49 the positively charged dye molecules could be attracted and accumulated on the surface of negatively charged membrane which subsequently adsorbed to the membrane through hydrophobic interaction and blocked the membrane pores 50 the integrated process which combines the membrane unit with other processes in a treatment train is one of the feasible strategies in fouling mitigation 51 the aim of integrated process is to achieve better performance than any of the individual processes whereby the shortcomings of the stand alone process have been minimized or negated 52 previously the nf process has been integrated with numerous processes to minimize fouling propensity and achieve targeted permeate quality that can fulfil the water reuse criteria in the textile industry table 2 for example the integration of electrocoagulation as pre treatment significantly enhanced the steady membrane flux 15 lmh and flux recovery ratio 67 99 of nf as compared to stand alone nf at 2 lmh and 11 68 45 this could be attributed to the reduction of pollutants cod and suspended solids in textile wastewater by electrocoagulation pre treatment which has also reduced the thickness of foulant cake layer on nf membrane that enabled higher water permeation in another study nf was employed to further polish the treated effluent from mbr such that the treated water could be reused in fabric dyeing 53 the nf270 membrane was found to reduce the cod and turbidity of mbr effluent to below 5 mg l and 0 3 ntu respectively which subsequently has been reclaimed for reuse in fabric dyeing test surprisingly the results showed that no adverse effects were observed on the quality of the product in the dyeing experiment indicating that the integration of nf as post treatment polishing process to mbr enabled the recovery of water from textile effluent for reuse application lebron et al 54 combined the nf treatment with mf and advanced oxidation process aop photo fenton to recover water from textile industry effluent in their work two configurations namely mf nf aop c and mf aop nf fig 3 were investigated and compared the nf permeate from both configurations complied with the water reuse criteria for yarn washing off and equipment washing down nevertheless a higher fouling rate and lower permeate flux 19 lmh was observed for nf membrane in the second treatment train mf aop nf due to the high iron content in the effluent after being subjected to aop treatment which promoted the concentration polarization effect meanwhile the first configuration mf nf aop c has achieved higher nf permeate flux 38 lmh and the application of aop as post treatment step for nf concentrate has effectively removed cod and color about 70 and 98 5 respectively even so the effluent from aop post treatment did not fulfil the standard for reuse in noble application owing to its high iron content the cost analysis revealed that the mf nf aop c treatment requires a lower operating cost 0 421 us m3 than that of mf aop nf 0 736 us m3 suggesting that the first configuration is more suitable for textile effluent treatment due to its cost effectiveness in the textile industry the highly alkaline effluent from caustic main bath discharges is a potential resource for naoh recovery that can be reused in the causticization process for this type of effluent treatment the use of a ceramic membrane is promising since it has higher chemical resistance than polymeric nf membrane 55 moreover common polymeric nf membranes are only suitable for feed with low naoh content 0 1 0 4 56 therefore recent work by ağtaş et al 26 used the commercial ceramic nf atech 1000 da in the uf nf integrated process to recover caustic chemicals from caustic containing textile wastewater it was found that installation of nf after uf treatment has resulted in higher contaminant removal efficiency than that of single uf treatment the total organic carbon toc cod color and total hardness were removed by 67 71 92 and 42 respectively while at least 50 sodium was recovered using the uf nf treatment it was proposed that the recovered caustic solution could be reused in the causticization process by mixing with some amount of concentrated commercial caustic solution the economic analysis estimated that the application of ceramic uf nf membrane treatment could achieve a caustic recovery of 480 m3 year while caustic usage cost could be reduced by 50 by reusing the caustic solution besides integrated process utilization of nanomaterials in nf membrane modification or synthesis is another strategy that has been proposed to address the membrane fouling issue and to enhance the membrane performance 57 58 graphene oxide go 58 59 tio2 60 and cellulose nanocrystals cnc 61 are examples of nanomaterials which have been applied to fabricate or modify nf for dye salt separation very recently seah et al 58 prepared thin film nanocomposite tfn nf incorporated with surface coated go aiming to recover nacl from textile wastewater which can be further reused it was found that the tfn containing acrylic acid aa modified go exhibited 24 9 improvement of pure water permeability over the control membrane without go due to enhanced hydrophilicity moreover the tfn aa go successfully produced saline permeate with nacl recovery of 79 86 and contained pigment less than 0 28 suggesting potential reuse in dyeing process even so it shall be noted this promising result was based on the performance test using simulated textile wastewater despite extensive works in textile effluent treatment challenges such as membrane fouling the economic feasibility of integrated nf process including investment in the system and savings from reclaimed water and the large scale production of novel nf membrane still hinder the widespread application of nf in textile wastewater treatment more pilot scale data and economic evaluation should be conducted to convince the stakeholders of the benefits and possibility of reclaiming water from textile effluent using an integrated nf process furthermore the loose nf membranes with high permeability simple synthesis procedure exceptional antifouling properties and excellent dye salt separation efficiency should be further developed and explored for textile wastewater treatment 3 2 food industry water is one of the intensively consumed resources in the food industry where it is used in various aspects from being an ingredient in the production processes and products housekeeping and general cleaning and sanitation and disinfection purposes the characteristics of the wastewater generated from the agro food industry can vary significantly depending on the operation processes and type of products generally the wastewater contains a few types of major pollutants such as cod total suspended solids tss fats oils and nutrients 64 some micropollutants e g hormones surfactants antibiotics and pesticides can also be found in certain types of food industry effluent hence the food industry effluents need to be treated before being discharged since these pollutants will cause damage to the environment and ecosystem rather than being used for treatment purposes the nf membrane could be utilized to reclaim treated water for reuse in the food processing industry and recover value added compounds found in the effluents the former strategy could help to reduce the water consumption of the food industry while the latter approach enables the recovered compounds to be used in the food chain as functional additives in different products both these measures will help to progress the food industry towards sustainable development to achieve water and resource recovery with desired reuse criteria various integrated processes equipped with nf as a post treatment step have been proposed in food industry wastewater treatment table 3 for instance nf has been employed as a tertiary treatment to further polish the dairy effluent treated by mbr by removing the dissolved solids leftover in the mbr permeate 65 the integrated mbr nf treatment process achieved overall removal efficiencies of 99 9 for cod and 93 1 for total solids ts where the nf permeate met all the standards for water reuse in cooling and low pressure steam generation the minimization of water consumption has also been applied to citric acid production wastewater treatment where nf was utilized to remove the inhibitory compounds na and mg2 in effluent treated by anaerobic digestion and uf such that the reclaimed water could be reused in the fermentation of citric acid production 66 the capability of nf membrane to reject monovalent and divalent ions salinity in wastewater has attracted the attention of olive mill wastewater operators the existing physicochemical processes which consists of natural precipitation fenton like reaction flocculation sedimentation and olive stone filtration in series could not remove the dissolved ions in olive mill wastewater this prohibited the treated water from being reused or discharged to the environment in this scenario the inclusion of nf at the end of the treatment train could help to reduce the electroconductivity of the effluent as in the case reported by ochando pulido et al 67 where the ec value was reduced from 3 2 3 6 to 1 5 ms cm the final permeate possessed quality suitable to be reused for irrigation in addition to a wide range of organic contaminants and dissolved ions the phenolic compounds in olive mill wastewater also pose a challenge to the environment phenolic compounds are phytotoxic and antimicrobial resulting in difficult degradation under normal conditions and adversely impacting the viability of microorganisms and plants however their antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties have made it attractive to the food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries hence olive mill wastewater appears to be a feasible source for the recovery of value added phenolic compounds 68 69 ochando pulido et al 70 have shown that nf membrane could be used to treat the olive mill wastewater for water reclamation and phenols recovery the nf process produced permeate stream with good quality for irrigation reuse since it was practically free of phenolic content the interesting finding was that nf process managed to enrich the high added value phenols up to 75 7 1315 7 mg l in retentate which could be a potential source to satisfy the demand in cosmetics food pharmaceuticals and biotechnological industries the profit from phenols recovery could help to convince the stakeholders to adopt the nf treatment process since it can potentially offset a portion of the capital and operation costs of the nf process nonetheless pilot scale study and economic evaluation should be properly conducted to verify this benefit direct filtration of nf with dairy wastewater is not feasible due to the presence of impurities that will foul the membrane to address this issue chen et al 71 demonstrated that the incorporation of isoelectric precipitation as pre treatment could control and minimize nf membrane fouling the isoelectric precipitation process removed caseins the main protein in dairy effluent that also appears to be the main foulant for membrane operation consequently the fouling severity has been minimized as reflected by the mild increase of transmembrane pressure tmp from 2 to 3 bar as compared to without pre treatment tmp rose from 2 to 34 bar the nf permeate could be reused in the plant while the retentate without caseins was found to be a better source for anaerobic fermentation to produce a higher proportion of volatile fatty acids and biogas for subsequent utilization this integrated process highlighted the potential of resource recovery from dairy wastewater through the proper design of treatment technologies in a subsequent study chen et al 72 modified the integrated process for recovering water proteins cells and lactic acid from model dairy wastewater fig 4 the isoelectric precipitation acted as pre treatment to minimize concentration polarization and fouling of following uf and nf processes the uf produced two useful streams permeate with reduced foulants for nf and retentate rich in whey protein for recovery apart from producing reusable water nf also concentrated the lactose in its reject stream which can be further post treated using lactic acid fermentation process it was found that use of thermophilic bacillus coagulans ipe22 in the fermentation process successfully consumed lactose after 37 h producing 37 6 g l and 5 42 g l of lactic acid and cell mass respectively the cells and lactic acid recovered from the fermentation step could be used as animal food and raw material for bioplastic production hence mitigating the retentate sludge disposal issue besides olive mill and dairy wastewater nf membranes also have been used to treat the palm oil mill effluent pome 73 78 most of the studies have focused on the integrated use of nf membranes and other processes for tertiary treatment of the pome in the palm oil industry it is estimated that 5 7 5 t of water are utilized to generate 1 t of crude palm oil with more than 50 of this water being discarded as pome 79 even though the biological treatment process is commonly used to treat the pome this technique is ineffective in generating treated water with reusable criteria 73 hence a study conducted by ghani et al 74 adapted the nf process as a polishing step to reclaim water from diluted aerobic digested pome for recycling and reuse this work demonstrated that the pome treatment using commercial nf membrane nf270 was capable of removing the cod tds color phosphorus and turbidity by 95 93 99 80 and 99 respectively since the final cod concentration in nf permeate was slightly higher than that of boiler feed water criteria the authors proposed that the permeate could be reused for machine or factory cleaning activities however the severe fouling issue in the nf membrane during long term filtration of pome needs to be addressed in lupin beans production the processes to make these beans edible by removing lupanine toxic alkaloid consume a huge amount of freshwater however the lupanine in lupin beans wastewater is a valuable resource since it can be used as starting material for the synthesis of other alkaloids such as sparteine in the pharmaceutical industry esteves et al 22 have developed an integrated process consisted of nf solvent extraction and or resin adsorption for the recovery of water and lupanine from the wastewater the nf membrane showed remarkable high rejections for lupanine 99 5 allowing around 80 of the wastewater to be reclaimed and reused in the processing however the lupanine rich retentate requires further purification and isolation steps before subsequent use since the nf reject stream also contained high amount of total organic species 94 1 rejection the post treatment of nf retentate using several solvent extraction steps i e ethyl acetate as solvent was found to be capable to isolate 95 4 of lupanine with 78 purity which could be further converted to sparteine with a final purity above 95 the finding signifies the role of nf as a process to reclaim water and facilitate subsequent value added compound recovery in food wastewater handling the food industry wastewater typically contains organic impurities that will easily foul the nf membrane thus the nf membrane must be integrated with other treatment processes to alleviate the fouling phenomena by removing these impurities in the pre treatment stage furthermore the integration of different technologies enables the whole treatment process to recover water and valuable resources in the effluent such as phenols and lupanine these strategies will minimize the water consumption of the food industry and extract high added value compounds from the wastewater 3 3 oil and gas industry the effluent produced by the oil and gas industry is one of the main contributors to environmental pollution the extraction of oil and gas using hydraulic fracturing generates a massive amount of waste stream namely produced water pw it is anticipated that more than 70 billion barrels of pw have been produced annually 80 82 hydrocarbon corrosion inhibitor salts dissolved organic carbon heavy metals suspended solids and dissolved gases e g h2s and co2 are typical constituents of pw 5 besides oil and gas extraction the oil refinery process also consumes a huge amount of water during the cracking reforming and topping activities each barrel of crude oil requires 246 340 l of water resulting in the effluent that is 0 4 1 6 times the volume of oil treated 83 to reduce the freshwater consumption in oil and gas industry the reuse of treated water has been promoted which requires the development of efficient technologies to reclaim water from challenging wastewater such as pw and oil refinery effluent numerous studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of nf to treat the wastewater from the oil and gas industries for further reuse table 4 gamal khedr 84 developed an integrated pilot scale system comprised of coagulation sand filtration nf to treat the pw from the suez gulf region which can be reused for injection purposes in the oil formation to increase oil production conventional coagulation sand filtration system applied in suez gulf pw treatment is not efficient to remove the tds hardness components and metal ions e g uranium from the pw resulting in biofilm and solid scale formation as well as microbial corrosion phenomenon in the injection pipelines moreover the injection of poorly treated pw which contain high so4 2 content would destroy the porous structure of the oil formation to overcome these issues gamal khedr 84 installed the polyamide thin film composite nf membrane after the coagulation filtration during the pw treatment it was found that the integrated system was highly efficient in removing so4 2 uranium and other cations such as cu2 pb2 cr3 and ra2 from pw unlike single coagulation treatment which possessed lower uranium rejection 15 45 removal at ph 4 6 the adoption of nf membrane as the post treatment step has successfully achieved more than 80 uranium removal efficiency across the ph range the coagulation nf integrated system also completely removed the so4 2 ions and material of bacteria growth while the tds other hardness cations and monovalent cations were rejected by approximately 34 76 80 and 35 37 respectively thus the use of nf membrane was capable to upgrade the quality of treated pw for injection purposes which is important to inhibit the scale and corrosion formation in the pipelines internal reuse of pw for hydraulic fracturing operation is now the most prevalent and cost effective alternative in the shale gas industry however the pw needs to be properly treated where removal of divalent ions is necessary prior to recycling for internal reuse the presence of divalent cations in the recycled pw may have a detrimental effect on shale gas production by precipitating sulfate and the formation of stable carbonate 24 85 thus the application of the nf membrane is beneficial to treat the pw since it can remove divalent ions however adopting a proper pre treatment is essential during the wastewater treatment to prolong the lifetime of the nf membrane in this context chang et al 24 used the coagulation uf configuration to pre treat the pw before nf process for internal reuse unlike common filtration techniques such as sand filtration the uf is more promising to reduce turbidity it was found that the use of iron coagulation uf as the pre treatment unit has enhanced the nf permeate flux up to 23 the integrated iron coagulation uf nf 200 psi system has successfully produced the permeate that fulfils the flowback pw reuse specification in marcellus shale play 24 86 the final concentration of so4 2 mg2 ca2 sr2 ba2 in the treated water were 1 0 mg l 3 7 mg l 63 4 mg l 14 5 mg l and 23 2 mg l respectively which represents the 72 8 91 7 removal efficiency besides coagulation biological pre treatment such as biologically active filtration baf has also been proposed to be coupled with uf nf for treating pw for hydraulic fracturing reuse 87 88 the baf unit which contains the biofilm supported on filter media can effectively degrade organic matter from the oil and gas industry wastewater riley et al 87 reported that the baf uf nf configuration fig 5 had reduced the tds level in pw feed from 12 615 mg l to 685 mg l 94 removal by increasing the pressure up to 300 psi the installation of baf uf pre treatment has also mitigated the fouling in the nf membrane however this result may not be indicative of long term fouling since this water treatment was only conducted under short term operation 60 h recently attempts have been made to explore the potential of flowback pw as a resource for lithium recovery increasing global demand for lithium supply particularly for lithium based battery production has promoted the exploration of potential lithium resources a study conducted by seip et al 89 proposed the integration of nf with manganese based ion exchange sorbents for lithium recovery from flowback pw the presence of small organic molecules 250 da in untreated flowback pw can reduce the manganese in the sorbent during the lithium recovery causing the sorbent loss via reductive dissolution thus the pw was subjected to nf treatment using da synder filtration nfs membrane 100 250 da to remove the small organic molecules before the lithium recovery step the removal of non purgeable organic carbon npoc content from 180 ppm to 85 ppm after nf treatment has minimized the sorbent loss in acid desorption of lithium signifying the importance of nf in improving the efficiency of the integrated process for lithium recovery in the petroleum refinery wastewater treatment nf has been integrated with mbr and aop to produce permeate water that can be reused in the cooling systems 90 in a recent study moser et al 90 investigated the effect of aop i e uv h2o2 process pre treatment on the nf dow filmtec nf90 performance and assessed the overall efficiency of the integrated system in treating petrochemical effluent taken from a refinery plant in brazil it was observed that the nf permeate flux was enhanced since the fouling potential in nf was reduced the uv h2o2 pre treatment has altered the fouling characteristics which make it easily removed and thus less nf cleaning frequency was required moreover the use of nf as post treatment was found to effectively remove the toxic intermediate substance produced by the uv h2o2 process the integrated treatment has successfully removed the tds calcium ammonia chloride cod toc and toxicity level by more than 98 the final nf permeate contained 28 mg l of tds 0 3 mg l of ammonia 7 2 mg l of chloride and 0 96 mg l of toc complying with the water standard quality for cooling system the potential of nf to treat the spent caustic solution for reuse in crude oil refinery was explored by santos et al 91 the commercial composite polymeric nf seiro mps 34 with the alkaline resistant feature was installed in a pilot plant to treat spent caustic with a conductivity of 110 ms cm ph 13 7 polar oil and grease content of 11 300 mg l and cod of 81 571 mg l the crossflow operation mode was applied in that study and the performance of ceramic uf membrane carbosep m2 15 kda was also evaluated separately for comparison purposes unlike ceramic uf membrane which failed to reduce the polar oil and grease content in the permeate side to below 20 ppm the performance of nf membrane seems more promising since it can attain the polar oil and grease and cod removal efficiency of 99 9 and 97 7 respectively at 15 bar operating pressure a restorable and stable nf permeate flux was observed until the volume concentration factor of 3 also the nf operation under this condition was capable of recovering the sodium resulting in a purified permeate caustic solution that can be recycled back for further reuse in the refinery process the economic analysis revealed that the reuse of the purified permeate could benefit the oil refinery by offering a significant saving of 1 5 m per year overall most of the studies related to nf application in oil and gas industry wastewater treatment have focused on water recovery and reuse however limited studies related to by products recovery such as lithium recovery from pw has been reported in the literature thus further investigation is required in the future to explore the potential of membrane based technologies such as nf in the integrated process for resource recovery in oil and gas industry wastewater treatment 3 4 mining industry the mining industry generates several types of effluents during mining activities and processing one of the major mining effluents is acid mine drainage amd which was formed due to the exposure of rocks containing sulfur to water and air 16 92 amd commonly shows a high level of sulfate content 1 20 g l low ph value ph 2 4 high concentration of heavy metals and toxic components 16 93 in gold mining activity a large volume of acidic effluent containing substantial metal concentration is generated by the pressure oxidation process conventional mining effluent treatment involves the use of lime neutralization technique that can precipitate the sulfate and metals 94 95 nevertheless this method produces a tremendous amount of sludge which presents an environmental threat and requires proper disposal 93 96 therefore the application of membrane technologies such as nf is a promising alternative that can produce permeate for reuse and allow the recovery of acid and valuable metals from mining industrial effluent as reported in several studies 93 96 102 and summarized in table 5 mullett et al 96 compared the performance of two types of commercial polyamide nf membranes namely dow nf270 and trisep ts 80 in treating the amd for recovering valuable metals such as copper the nf270 membrane demonstrated 95 removal efficiency for all multivalent ions i e ca2 cu2 mg2 mn3 at feed ph less than 3 while higher sulfur rejection 95 97 was achieved at high ph conditions ph 3 unlike the nf270 membrane the ts 80 membrane showed that the removal efficiency for sulfur and all multivalent ions was less affected by the feed ph higher rejection 95 can be attained by the ts 80 membrane across the studied ph range despite its promising performance for mine water treatment ts 80 membrane required higher operating pressure than nf270 membrane which thus consumed more energy the recovery test of the ts 80 membrane revealed that increasing the feed ph higher than the membrane isoelectric point iep would result in 2 4 kg h of the copper loss in permeate which corresponded to copper loss of around 69 000 year such findings highlighted the necessity of understanding the relationship between solution chemistry and membrane properties to achieve optimal recovery and avoid significant loss in capital and operating cost the potential of nf for amd reclamation in both lab scale and pilot scale studies was further investigated by wadekar et al 93 initial screening in a lab scale study using cross flow module showed that the use of polyamide nf membrane nf90 would be preferable to polypiperazine amide nf membrane nf270 for treating actual amd the nf90 membrane which possessed a smaller pore size has demonstrated better rejection for all ions 97 with sulfate removal in excess of 99 the performance of the nf90 membrane was further assessed in a pilot plant where the real amd feed was pre treated first using aeration sedimentation bag filtration and uf process prior to nf filtration at 10 bar these pre treatment steps have efficiently removed iron from the amd feed and thus prevented the fouling due to inorganic or iron scales resulting in long term stability of nf system the long term operation 208 h of the integrated system indicated that the nf membrane successfully achieved stable water recovery of 57 with tds rejection of more than 98 besides high removal of magnesium calcium and sulfate ions 99 the tight nf90 membrane also was able to reject about 90 of monovalent ion chloride from the amd the final nf permeate which is comprised of low tds content 50 mg l sulfate 10 mg l calcium 1 mg l and magnesium 0 3 mg l could be reused for industrial applications such as for the cooling system meanwhile it has been proposed that the nf concentrate with high sulfate content 4000 mg l could be used to treat the flowback and pw the mixing of flowback water and sulfate rich amd concentrate has the potential to remove the barium and strontium ions from flowback water via sulfate precipitation process as reported by others 103 besides amd treatment the polyamide nf90 membrane has also been applied in gold mining effluent reclamation reis et al 99 assessed the performance nf90 to recover water from the gas scrubber effluent taken from a gold mining plant in brazil which mainly contained tds 7085 mg l sulfate 4852 mg l calcium 258 mg l magnesium 134 mg l and some arsenic as v and as iii unlike wadekar et al s finding 93 which showed high tds rejection 98 for amd reclamation reis et al 99 found that the nf90 membrane demonstrated a lower tds rejection 86 during water recovery from gold mining wastewater at 10 bar pressure such discrepancy could be attributed to the higher contaminant concentration in gold mining effluent where its tds and sulfate content level is five times higher than that of amd moreover the gold mining effluent in reis et al s study 99 was just pre treated using mf filtration to remove the suspended solids even though the nf permeate did not fulfil the water quality standard for reuse in boilers or cooling systems the authors proposed that it can be reused in other mining processes that employ water with a low ph value hence decreasing the expense of ph adjustment ricci et al 97 combined the mf nf with the ro process to improve the permeate quality and recover noble metals and sulfuric acid during the treatment of gold mining effluent generated by pressure oxidation process fig 6 the role of nf in the integrated system was to produce metal enriched retentate and obtain sulfuric acid enriched permeate for further separation in the ro unit it was found that the combination of nf membrane mpf 34 and mf has successfully retained more than 95 valuable metals such as copper cobalt and nickel in the retentate streams enabling further treatment in the metal recovery process since the post treatment stage of the metal enriched retentate was not covered in their study the potential of integrating mf nf system with bioelectrochemical technology such as microbial fuel cell which is promising for heavy metal recovery 104 can be further explored in future basically the mpf 34 nf membrane iep 4 5 was positively charged under exposure to acidic gold mining effluent ph 1 46 97 so it possessed high metal cations rejection but low hso4 anion rejection this nf property allowed 82 acid permeation resulting in a high sulfuric acid recovery in the nf permeate stream which was further concentrated up to 99 by ro tfc hr membrane it was proposed that the recovered acid could be recycled and reused to control the acidity in the pressure oxidation stage in gold mining processing meanwhile the integrated system also has reduced the tds level in the gold mining effluent from 23 973 to 192 mg l 99 removal producing final permeate with quality that was suitable for reuse in boilers system despite these promising results further investigation by ricci et al 98 revealed that the nickel and cobalt rejection of mpf 34 nf membrane was reduced by 33 upon continuous exposure to the gold mining effluent for eight weeks based on this finding it can be suggested that a more stable nf membrane shall be applied in gold mining effluent treatment to prevent the noble metal loss in permeate side under long term operation mode in a recent work by ramos et al 100 the performances and chemical stability of various commercial nf membranes including dk duracid nf90 nf270 and mpf 34 were compared to seek a more chemically stable nf that can stand the acidic gold mining effluent in integrated uf nf ro system among the investigated nf membranes dk appeared as the most promising nf membrane for gold mining effluent treatment due to its high permeate flux 25 lmh low fouling tendency and high noble metals rejection 94 for copper cobalt and nickel unlike mpf 34 performance in previous work 98 the dk membrane possessed higher chemical stability under long term exposure 180 days to gold mining effluent with a conductivity of 18 64 ms cm and ph 1 53 the final permeate water from the integrated uf nf ro system contained low acid concentration ph 2 5 that could be reused in the gold mining process which does not require ph adjustment moreover the integrated system was capable of recovering sulfuric acid with high purity for further reuse in the mining production process their findings indicate that proper membrane selection is a vital component in designing process to recover water and valuable resources from challenging wastewater overall it can be observed that polymeric nf membrane has been commonly applied for water recycling and reuse and product recovery from mining wastewater despite the excellent separation performance of polymeric nf its long term stability issue in highly acidic mining effluent remains a significant concern thus to overcome the limitation of polymeric nf future studies can explore the performance of ceramic nf membrane for water recycling and reuse as well as product recovery in the mining industry 3 5 tannery industry the tannery industry releases very high volumes of toxic effluent including numerous recalcitrant pollutants which have a devastating effect on surface water it has been estimated that global leather production generates about 600 million m3 of wastewater annually 105 the pre tanning and tanning activities in skin hides processing are the major sources of pollution in the tannery industry 106 these processes discharged wastewater containing high levels of chromium chloride sulfate sulfide and suspended solids 105 106 among tannery effluent pollutants chromium cr is the contaminant of primary concern due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties 20 107 given the toxicity of the tannery wastewater an efficient technique is required to treat this effluent prior to discharge or reuse several investigations have been carried out to study the performance of the nf process in the treatment of tannery effluent for water and resource recovery as well as reuse applications table 6 romero dondiz et al 108 compared the performance of various types of commercial nf membranes namely dk ck tfc sr3 and mpf 34 for tannins and water recovery from real vegetable tannin liquor the nf membranes allowed the tannins recovery due to the charge repulsion and molecular sieving mechanism where the highest tannins rejection 97 6 was achieved by the mpf 34 membrane it was proposed that the tannin rich retentate stream could be reused in the production of a new liquor tannin solution despite its high tannin recovery mpf 34 showed a significant drop in permeate flux in contrast the dk membrane showed the highest permeate flux 17 17 lmh and a low fouling tendency but its tannin recovery rate is not sufficient compared to the other nf membranes the tannery industry produces sulfate rich effluent due to the usage of abundant amounts of sulfuric acid and sulfide application in the unhairing stage which was further oxidized into sulfate therefore galiana aleixandre et al 109 applied the nf process as a pollution prevention technique in reducing sulfate concentration in the tannery effluent sulfate retention of 97 was achieved in the nf treatment of the tanning washing wastewater where the sulfate rich concentrate could be reused in the tanning drums the high sulfate rejection was due to the size exclusion mechanism since there was no charge interaction as the ph of the tanning washing effluent ph 4 was equal to the iep of the applied nf membrane desal 5dl it was estimated that the implementation of nf membrane with 97 sulfate retention for treating 50 m3 tanning washing effluent would be able to recover 61 63 t of sulfate per year for recycling and reuse in tanning drums religa et al 110 applied nf membrane for recirculation of cr iii from tannery wastewater concentrate salt mixture solution at very low ph four types of commercial nf membranes namely hl dk dl and ck were tested to compare their performance upon exposure to synthetic chromium tannery wastewater with a ph range of 3 6 3 9 the thin selective skin layer of dl membrane ensures both low chlorine retention 7 11 in conjunction with high cr iii retention 94 97 and a high permeate flux they concluded that the use of nf membrane with low iep value such as dl iep 3 was more preferred for the treatment of tannery wastewater at ph below 4 in that condition the negatively charged nf membrane could facilitate the chloride ions permeation minimizing the concentration polarization phenomenon and increasing the permeate flux the obtained chromium rich concentrate and chloride rich permeate from the nf process could be reused as tanning and pickling baths respectively to improve the efficiency of tannery wastewater treatment nf has been integrated with other technologies in several works for instance gando ferreira et al 111 integrated nf with ion exchange pre treatment processes to recover cr iii salts from simulated tannery wastewater containing a typical concentration range of cl cr iii and so4 2 in industrial effluents of tanneries the ion exchange pre treatment unit was installed for uptaking the chloride ions from the tannery effluent enabling the generation of cr iii rich retentate by nf their results demonstrated that the nf performance was affected by the cl so4 2 ratio the ratio of 0 082 led to the best operating conditions for the integrated process producing 90 cr iii enriching retentate for reuse in the tanning process in another work dasgupta et al 20 employed the coagulation nf based integrated treatment scheme to achieve maximum removal of toxic cr vi species from tannery wastewater the coagulation pre treatment has successfully mitigated the fouling in nf membrane and high cr vi removal efficiency 98 was achieved by the hybrid process the installation of nf after coagulation pre treatment has successfully improved the permeate quality up to the standard criteria for water reuse in tannery operation a new go based nanocomposite membrane was developed by pal et al 105 for the application in an aop nf integrated process that was specifically designed to recover water from real tannery wastewater for recycling and reuse the surface of the freshly casted polyethersulfone membrane was modified using go nanomaterials in a layer by layer l b l assembly method trimesoyl chloride tmc acted as a cross linking reagent that helps the go layer to adhere firmly onto the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 7 high rejection efficiency of 99 cod 96 tds and 99 chromium with high flux at 210 220 lmh under operating pressure of 16 bar indicated the effectiveness of the aop nf system for water reclamation from leather industry wastewater a pilot scale forward osmosis fo and nf integrated closed loop system was developed by pal et al 112 for continuous reclamation of clean water from tannery wastewater at a rate of 52 55 lmh at 1 6 bar pressure continuous recovery for recycling the draw solute was done by nf of diluted draw solution at an operating pressure of 12 bar and volumetric crossflow rate of 700 l h the work of pal et al 112 culminated in the development of a compact efficient and low cost tannery industrial wastewater treatment and reclamation technology with the maximum cod rejection of 98 5 chloride rejection of 97 2 and sulfate rejection of 98 2 the treatment cost of 1 m3 tannery wastewater was calculated to be 0 72 these findings are useful in the design and operation of an industrial scale tannery wastewater treatment plant as the cost analysis is likely to raise the confidence level in scale up installation subsequently pal et al 113 developed a model for the fo nf closed loop system in validating the context of real tannery wastewater the developed mathematical model for the proposed system showed low relative error 0 1 high overall correlation coefficient r2 0 98 and high wilmot d index 0 95 thereby indicating reasonably high performance prediction capability the findings from these studies 112 113 demonstrated that the integrated fo nf system is promising for clean water recovery from tannery effluent 3 6 pulp and paper industry the wastewater generated by the pulp and paper industry is one of the common sources of industrial water pollution the pulp and paper industry consumes a lot of freshwater 273 455 m3 per tonne paper and generates significant amounts of contaminated wastewater 220 380 m3 per tonne paper 114 115 the wastewater generated by the pulp and paper industry contains various types of contaminants and composition depending on the substrate type e g recycled paper softwood and hardwood and the manufacturing process i e pulping bleaching and papermaking 116 117 for instance pulping process discharges effluent with cod of 500 115 000 mg l ph range of 6 3 6 8 and high lignin concentration 11 000 25 000 mg l the bleaching process generates effluent containing toxic pollutants such as phenols organic halogen and chlorinated organic compounds that can harm living organisms meanwhile the wastewater from the papermaking process contains high cod tds phosphates sulfate and chloride 117 to reduce freshwater consumption in the pulp and paper industry advanced water treatment such as membrane technology has been developed to recover water for recycling and reuse in the manufacturing process in this scenario nf is one of the promising membrane treatments since it that can reject multivalent ions from pulp and paper industrial effluent for instance lee et al 118 used the commercial nf90 membranes to study the phosphorus ions removal from simulated wastewater comprising 14 5 mg l phosphorus which corresponded to typical concentration in the pulp and paper industrial effluent the phosphorus rejection of 99 77 and permeate flux of 88 74 lmh were recorded under optimized conditions at ph of 7 2 9 3 bar and 34 c previously the nf process has been used either as stand alone or integrated with numerous processes to achieve targeted permeate quality that can fulfil the reuse criteria in the pulp and paper industry table 7 although most of the paper mills use the biological treatments such as activated sludge process to pre treat their effluents the treated water is not clean enough to enable the reuse of water in producing most of paper grades 119 thus desalting process using membrane technologies such as nf is required to polish the water quality for reuse in the manufacturing processes in a recent work conducted by caldeira et al 120 nf was applied after pre treatments comprised of flotation up flow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor uasb and activated sludge process during water recovery from simulated thermo mechanical pulp mill effluent for internal reuse the nf membrane attained rejection of 89 99 82 74 and 57 for cu2 mn2 fe2 ca2 and mg2 ions respectively while the overall permeate quality was suitable for industrial processes it was found that the reuse of 100 of the treated effluent in the bleaching process did not significantly affect the pulp quality in terms of brightness and brightness reversion despite this promising result it should be noted that the membrane performance was based on exposure to synthetic wastewater a study reported by gönder et al 121 further revealed the potential of nf in pulp and paper industry wastewater reclamation in their work the real pulp and paper wastewater pre treated using biological treatment was subjected to two step nf process to recover water with quality up to water reuse standard the use of fm np010 membrane in the first step of the nf process has rejected 92 total hardness 91 cod and 98 sulfate under optimized conditions the fm np030 membrane was further used as the second step in the nf treatment system and successfully produced permeate with quality that meets the actual process water a minimal fouling effect was observed by increasing the feed ph up to ph 10 under this condition the negatively charged membrane could repel the negatively charged contaminants in the pulp wastewater reducing the solutes adsorption onto the membrane the treatment of paper machine circulation wastewater whitewater by a two step nf process was carried out by kaya et al 122 like gonder et al s study the fm np010 membrane loose nf and fm np030 tight nf were used in the first and second stage nf respectively the results showed that the combination of loose and tight nf membranes successfully recovered water that can be reused as shower water for paper machines the best performance was observed at the pressure of 32 bar and ph of 5 6 where all the contaminants with the exception of chloride ions were efficiently removed suspended solids tp sulfate and color were removed more than 99 after passing through the tight nf resulting in sufficient permeate quality for shower water application khosravi et al 119 evaluated the nf and low pressure ro membranes in mbr for mazandaran pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment the measured parameters such as color organic carbon and uv absorption were almost completely rejected by the nf270 membrane but monovalent ions especially nitrate and chloride ions and inorganic carbon permeated easily through the membrane therefore nf is attractive in purifying discharge water for reuse in the paper manufacturing process as long as the discharge water does not contain too high amounts of monovalent ions bleached sulfite pulp mills generate a considerable amount of brown colored effluents rich in cod and valuable waste products such as lignin derivatives 123 the recovery of lignin derivatives is advantageous since these materials can be further used in the production of biobased products including resins biofuels and fine chemicals in this context ebrahimi et al 123 investigated the possibility of recovering lignin from pulp and paper industry wastewater using ceramic tubular membrane technology the average cod and lignin retention efficiencies achieved by the two stage uf nf treatment were 35 40 and 45 66 respectively however the two stage process of mf uf configuration showed better treatment efficiency for alkaline bleaching effluent lowering the overall cod by 35 45 and residual lignin concentration by 60 73 shukla et al 124 designed an integrated membrane filtration system comprised of uf nf and ro membranes in series to treat the effluent generated by extraction stages and chlorination c stage in a bleach plant at an indian pulp and paper mill the majority of the constituents in the c stage effluent were too small to be rejected even by a very dense uf membrane however significant removal of the pollutants was obtained via the nf process with 45 18 81 48 tds 46 27 80 78 cod 100 color and 47 90 68 34 adsorbable organic halides aox on the other hand comparative removal was observed for the treatment of effluent from the extraction stage during the nf process removals ranging from 40 53 48 78 for tds 25 04 54 20 for cod 75 30 96 51 for color and 43 27 81 98 for aox were observed at different pressure excellent removals of all pollutants were achieved by ro where the overall removal of the lab scale membrane treatment plant was 100 tds 75 98 cod 100 color and 91 98 aox for c stage effluent and 100 tds 90 100 cod 100 color and 93 99 aox for extraction stage effluent the installation of nf prior to ro has enhanced the pollutants removal efficiencies of ro signifying the importance of an integrated membrane system in clean water recovery from pulp and paper industry wastewater 3 7 pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is one of the fastest growth industries and its global market size is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 11 34 from 2021 to 2028 125 hence it is expected that more pharmaceutical wastewater will be produced in the coming years since water is mainly used in pharmaceutical manufacturing process such as chemical synthesis and fermentation stages pharmaceutical effluent may contain organic and inorganic pollutants pharmaceutical active compounds phacs e g tranquilizers antibiotics diuretics and psychiatric drug and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 126 the removal of phacs and edcs from pharmaceutical wastewater has emerged as one of the most pressing issues since these compounds are harmful to human health and environment besides there has been an increased emphasis on water reuse in pharmaceutical sector in recent years 127 thus the development of efficient methods for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is mandatory the effective removal of phacs can be achieved via membrane technologies such as nf since most of the phacs possess molecular weight greater than 250 da 128 it is expected that the phacs can be well retained by the membrane through molecular sieving if the membrane mwco is greater than the molecular weights of phacs in this scenario the application of tight nf with small mwco 500 da is a promising option and has been frequently applied for the removal of phacs table 8 129 131 for example yangali quintanilla et al 131 examined the performance of tight nf membranes namely nf 90 and nf 200 membranes for treating synthetic water solution containing 17 compounds including various phacs and edcs the performance of ro membrane bw30 le and espa2 was also studied for comparison purpose and the filtration test was conducted in bench pilot and full scale to generate reusable water it was revealed the nf 90 had higher rejections than nf 200 due to a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion furthermore nf and ro attained 97 and 99 average rejection of ionic compounds respectively and the removal of neutral compounds was approximately 82 and 85 respectively thus they concluded that the tight nf membranes were a viable option to ro since nf can also achieve effective removal of phacs or edcs at lower operating cost in another work azaïs et al 130 investigated the performance of nf 90 and nf 270 membranes during the treatment of pre treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant spiked with phacs the influences of solute solute interaction and fouling on the phacs rejection i e acetaminophen act atenolol atl carbamazepine cbz and diatrizoic acid dtz was studied and the nf permeate quality was assessed to explore its suitability for reuse in terms of phacs removal excellent rejection 90 was achieved by nf 90 membrane which contained smaller pores than nf 270 unlike nf 270 membrane which possessed lower removal of phacs due to cake enhanced concentration polarization it was found that the solute solute interaction phacs binding and fouling has less effect on the phacs rejection of nf 90 membrane moreover the permeate quality analysis revealed that the recovered water using nf 90 membrane has fulfilled the irrigation water standard suggesting that a tight nf membrane such as nf 90 is promising for wastewater reuse tight nf has demonstrated good phacs removal efficiency but irreversible fouling is the main issue in tight nf with low mwco therefore maryam et al 132 proposed the use of loose nf hydracore nf 50 with mwco of 1000 da for the removal of three types of phacs namely ibuprofen ibu diclofenac dic and paracetamol para from synthetic wastewater in their work the efficiency and behavior of loose nf was assessed under extreme ph condition using pilot plant dead end system at 8 bar it was found that loose nf removed 99 7 dic at ph 3 80 5 ibu at neutral ph and 36 2 para at ph 12 even though the permeate flux changed due to drugs chemical properties no apparent fouling was observed for nf 50 since this negatively charged membrane surface could repel the negatively charged drug molecules thus they suggested that the application of loose nf with large mwco can also be a promising alternative technique for removal of phacs from effluent nevertheless the low rejection of paracetamol needs to be addressed the limitation of biological treatment to remove inorganic compounds and salt in pharmaceutical wastewater requires installation of post treatment unit to polish the effluent quality up to water reuse criteria in the case of mbr low removal efficiency of some micropollutants has been reported 133 134 therefore the application of integrated process comprised of nf as polishing step can be used to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for recycling and reuse in a study conducted by wang et al 133 a pilot scale membrane system comprised of mbr nf was installed at a pharmaceutical company in wuxi china to recover water from antibiotic production effluent for industrial reuse two commercial polyimide nf membranes filmtec nf 90 and nf 2540 were installed in parallel and operated at tmp of 5 0 7 5 bar at a cross flowrate of 2 0 m3 h the performance of integrated system was assessed over three month period and part of the nf concentrate was recycled to the mbr on the day 62 during the process the organic pollutants e g protein humid substances and polysaccharides were accumulated and further biodegraded in mbr by recycling the nf retentate their result demonstrated that the strategy of nf concentrate recycling has resulted in effective antibiotic wastewater treatment with high water yield 92 the integrated process successfully generated final permeate with turbidity of 0 15 ntu conductivity of 2 5 ms cm toc of 5 52 mg l and tp of 0 34 mg l complying with china s water quality standard for industrial usage moreover it shall be noted that the application of nf as post treatment step not only improve the antibiotic removal 95 but it also helps to reduce the acute toxicity of the effluent despite this promising result further economic evaluation is required to analyse the cost of the membrane treatment system including the cost saving after water reuse implementation to mitigate the fouling in nf membrane amadou yacouba et al 134 proposed the application of ozone based aop to pre treat the mbr effluent prior to nf process in their study the real mbr effluent from a wastewater treatment plant spiked with four pharmaceuticals i e acetaminophen act carbamazepine cbz sulfamethoxazole sul and tetracyclin tet and herbicide was used as the feed it was found that the nf 90 membrane operated using crossflow system at 10 bar successfully removed the organic micropollutants with rejection of 84 98 moreover the pre ozonation has reduced the fouling resistance by about 40 due to degradation of dissolved organic matters which consequently turned them into more hydrophilic constituents with less tendency for irreversible fouling however it shall be noted that the efficiency of nf 90 membrane to remove ozonation by products was not evaluated in this work and thus remains questionable besides mbr the nf also has been paired with other membrane technologies such fo during pharmaceutical wastewater reclamation for instance thakura et al 135 applied the nf after fo process for draw solution regeneration reconcentration and recycling while at the same time extracting the clean water trapped inside the draw solution during the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the installation of downstream nf module at 12 bar tmp achieved the draw solution recovery and recycle of 99 while generating high permeate flux 58 60 lmh which can be reused in industry besides the promising water treatment performance the cost analysis is important to enhance the confidence level in scale up installation thus economic analysis was also evaluated in their work for a wastewater plant with plant capacity of 50 000 l day it was found that the total operational cost was 17 800 year but this cost could be further reduced to 13 300 year by implementing the water reutilization in terms of resource recovery the potential of nf to recover organic solvent and phacs from waste stream generated by pharmaceutical production process has been reported in previous studies 136 137 the recovery of pharmaceutical compound namely 1 5 bromo fur 2 il 2 bromo 2 nitroethane g 1 from residual ethanol stream generated by g 1 purification stage was investigated by brito martínez et al 137 commercial nf membranes namely duramem 150 and nf 90 have attained high g 1 retention 60 via one step separation highlighting the potential of nf for valuable phacs recovery moreover heavy metals such as nickel are another by product that can be found in pharmaceutical industry effluent 128 however limited studies have been focused on the valuable metal recovery from pharmaceutical wastewater thus there should be more emphasis on this resource recovery aspect using nf based integrated process for pharmaceutical effluent treatment in future work even though the by product reuse application within pharmaceutical industry is often restricted by the stringent quality control requirement the waste exchange which involves the transfer of the recovered products to another industry or company can be done as alternative to promote recycling and reuse 128 4 outlook and future perspective the unique feature of nf which allows selective separation of targeted species is promising for water and resource recovery from industrial effluent the reclaimed water and valuable products from wastewater via integrated nf process fulfilled certain standard criteria that enable resource recovery and water recycling and reuse nevertheless more studies need to be conducted in the future to promote resource recovery as well as water recycling and reuse practice in industrial wastewater treatment using membrane technologies especially the nf the aspects that need to be considered in future research are summarized as follow 4 1 membrane materials and design for industrial effluents that are highly acidic or alkaline such as gold mining effluent and caustic containing wastewater in the textile and oil refinery industry few studies involving the use of nf for resource recovery and reuse application have been reported hence the development of polymeric nf that possesses highly acidic or alkaline resistant feature can be investigated more in the future to explore the potential of nf for product recovery from these industrial effluents the utilization of nanomaterials nanotechnology to fabricate higher resistance nf membranes should be explored further in this direction meanwhile ceramic nf is a promising alternative for industrial wastewater treatment involving extreme ph or high temperature condition nevertheless the application of ceramic nf for industrial wastewater treatment is still limited compared to polymeric nf probably due to its high capital cost thus it is essential to find strategies for reducing the cost of the ceramic membrane to make it economically viable in comparison to the polymeric membrane for instance future studies can explore waste derived materials inexpensive precursors or new technique to fabricate cost efficient ceramic nf in the context of textile industrial effluent treatment the development of loose nf membranes with high permeability superior antifouling property and excellent dye salt separation efficiency that can be easily synthesized and mass produced can also be explored 4 2 pre treatment processes most of the works reported have also highlighted the issues with membrane fouling due to the complexity of the wastewater from these various industries effective pre treatment processes are vital to minimize the issues with nf membranes and allow for a more sustainable and long term operation of membranes various pre treatment processes have been reported such as coagulation flocculation precipitation adsorption membrane based processes and aop more studies should be conducted to determine the most optimum configuration and its impact on the nf membrane as well as the overall performance 4 3 retentate post treatment processes besides the concern on nf permeate quality for reuse the retentate or brine management is also a vital issue common disposal techniques i e evaporation ponds surface water discharge land application and deep well injection could impart negative influences on soil groundwater and marine environment 138 rather than being disposed the retentate could be post treated if it contains value added compounds numerous techniques such as resin adsorption solvent extraction microbial fuel cell and membrane crystallization unit are promising for treating the nf retentate depending on the nature of the by products to be recovered there should be extensive research to investigate the effect of these post treatment techniques on the purity of the recovered by products to unlock their potential for reuse application and thus achieving zero liquid discharge 4 4 long term assessment the separation performance from most of the published works so far were based on short term assessment future works shall focus on investigating the long term performance upon exposure to real industrial wastewater in order to investigate the fouling propensity behavior membrane stability and its performance in challenging conditions the installation of a suitable nf membrane based on the consideration of long term chemical stability real separation performance and less fouling propensity will increase the process sustainability during the water or by products recovery from the industrial wastewater 4 5 economic analysis to mitigate the membrane fouling and to improve the permeate characteristics up to a certain standard that enables the reuse within the industrial process the nf has been commonly integrated with other processes during the industrial wastewater treatment despite the good water or by products recovery performance of the integrated process most studies did not report the economic analysis including the overall cost treatment in addition the analysis on water or chemical saving cost after reuse implementation is essential to convince the industries to invest in the integrated water treatment process for recycling and reuse therefore future studies should also analyse the practicability of the treatment process from the economic perspective 4 6 reuse application most of the studies related to the application of nf in the industrial effluent treatment reported that the treated water fulfilled the standard quality for internal reuse application such as for the manufacturing process in the case of reuse applications involving product fabrication limited data on the effect of recycled water or other recovered components from nf based treatments on the product quality has been reported such data is essential to explore the potential of reclaimed water or other by products for recycling and reuse within industries thus future studies can also consider this aspect of investigation moreover it shall be noted that little attention has been paid on the application of the reclaimed water via nf or integrated nf process for external reuse including irrigation purposes in the context of produced water treatment many governments have expressed interest in reusing produced water for purposes outside the internal industry due to the increasing global water demand 5 139 for irrigation application the effect of treated industrial wastewater on plant growth and soil quality must be investigated comprehensively in the future to provide supporting data that enable more reuse applications of treated industrial wastewater 4 7 large scale process the promising performance demonstrated by the integrated nf process in the lab scale study should be further studied in the context of pilot scale in this way a full assessment of the feasibility and viability of the water treatment process e g technical aspects cost and performance in industrial wastewater reclamation can be done the data will provide a more thorough understanding of the potential of integrated nf process for recycling and reuse moreover the development of predictive models for scaling up from laboratory scale to large scale application as well as cost assessment is helpful to explore the profitability of the integrated nf treatment in industrial operation 5 conclusions nf has drawn a lot of attention in industrial wastewater reclamation recycling reuse and resource recovery applications due to its capability to separate the divalent polyvalent ions from monovalent ions and small molecules in this review the application of nf within various industrial wastewater treatments for water recycling reuse and product recovery targets has been highlighted the nf treatment can be integrated with other membrane technologies or processes to mitigate the fouling prolong the membrane lifespan and enhance the membrane performance upon exposure to real industrial wastewater in most integrated processes nf has been commonly adopted as a post treatment step to polish the treated effluent quality up to the standard reuse criteria and recover other by products that can be recycled most of the studies found that nf is promising to remove a wide range of pollutants in various industries and thus capable to generate reusable water nevertheless less attention has been paid on the nf retentate or concentrate

13190,nanofiltration nf membrane has been applied for the treatment of wastewater owing to its unique features such as higher selectivity towards divalent polyvalent ions while allowing permeation for monovalent ions and small molecules of less than 100 da thus the use of nf in wastewater treatment is promising for water recycling reuse and recovery of other valuable products in industrial wastewater treatment this review highlights the current application of nf for water recycling reuse and product recovery within multiple industries such as textile food oil and gas mining tannery pharmaceutical as well as pulp and paper industry the performance of nf either as stand alone or integrated with other processes for improving the overall treatment efficiency and minimizing membrane issues is discussed finally future perspectives for nf applications in industrial wastewater treatment for water recycling reuse and product recovery are discussed keywords nanofiltration membrane technology water recycling reuse industrial wastewater product recovery 1 introduction in this era of climate change which is very challenging for the global population the importance of water as a beneficial commodity for humankind is indisputable the demand for water is expected to increase annually and it has been estimated that by 2030 the water demand for the whole world will be approximately 6900 billion m3 this amount is approximately 64 more than the amount of water accessible to most nations 1 thus increasing the supply of clean water by alternative means such as desalination and water recycling and reuse should be one of the main priorities of the world towards this end the united nations un through the sustainable development goals sdg initiative has set the goal for water namely through goal no 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all under this goal water recycling and reuse have been seen as one of the important methods to achieve the goal two specific targets that have been specifically mentioned are that by 2030 the world should i improve water quality by minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials reducing pollution halving the proportion of untreated wastewater eliminating dumping and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally and ii expand capacity building support and international cooperation to developing countries in water and sanitation related activities and programmes including water efficiency water harvesting wastewater treatment desalination recycling and reuse technologies 2 over the last decade data have shown that water recycling and reuse activities have increased exponentially 3 various projects have been initiated to treat wastewater from different industries especially from municipal sources for either non potable or potable applications multiple technologies for tertiary treatment of the effluent have been used including membrane technologies adsorption and advanced oxidation however a recent report by the global water market 2017 indicated that there is still a vast potential for research and innovation as well as the implementation of water recycling and reuse which can still be explored 4 their data showed that up to 2017 the amount of water that has been reused and recycled was only 1 2 billion m3 per year which constituted only about 4 of the total estimated wastewater the use of membrane technologies such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro within the tertiary processes for water recycling and reuse has also been increasing over the years apart from that membrane bioreactor mbr has also been popular as part of the processes by combining biological treatment with membrane separation capability these membrane technologies have been well received by many industries because of their efficiencies small footprint high productivity modular system and clean process yang et al 3 have provided an excellent review on the use of membrane technologies for water recycling and reuse focusing specifically on effluent from municipal sewage plants apart from that other reviews have also been published generally on the use of membrane technologies in combination with other processes for water recycling and reuse for different industries such as oil and gas 5 pulp and paper 6 dairy and soy processing 7 and acid mine drainage 8 this review is intended to focus only on the use of nf as one of the membrane technologies that have been applied for water recycling and reuse within various industries besides water recycling and reuse numerous published works have shown that nf is also promising for the recovery of valuable products or by products from wastewater nf is unique in comparison to uf since it demonstrates better retention of small molecules such as peptides sugars and amino acids 9 compared to ro nf has higher fluxes and greater selectivity towards divalent polyvalent ions while allowing permeation for monovalent ions and small molecules of less than 100 da ro generally rejects almost all ions and molecules and only allows water to pass through thus in terms of water recycling reuse and product recovery nf is more suitable for the purpose excellent reviews on nf have been published by quite a number of authors on various aspects of nf membranes including the overall nf technology and development 10 nf membrane fabrication 11 nf for water purification 12 and nf for removal of micropollutants 13 however there has not been any review specifically on the use of nf for water recycling reuse and product recovery from various industries which is the primary purpose of this review paper the industries that will be focused upon will be the food textile oil and gas mining pharmaceutical pulp and paper and tannery industries these are the main industries upon which nf membranes have found widespread applications fig 1 shows the number of publications of nf application in various industrial wastewater treatments that have been reported in the scopus database since the year 2000 the keywords nanofiltration and specific industrial wastewater term such as textile food pharmaceutical pulp and paper mining oil and gas tannery were used for the data search a total of 411 articles were found to be relevant to the issues and were categorized as shown in fig 1 2 overview of nanofiltration and its separation mechanisms the understanding on the nf membranes processes has been well established over the last few decades since it was first recognized in the early 90s commercially nf is known as membranes with a pore size of about 1 nm in addition to having a molecular weight cut off mwco of 300 500 da and salt rejection that is low 10 30 for monovalent salts such as nacl and very high 80 100 for divalent salts such as na2so4 these fundamental properties differentiate the nf membranes from ro membranes thus allowing nf to have greater selectivity for different classes of small molecules and ions this in turn enables nf to be applied in niche applications in various industries especially water and wastewater treatment pharmaceutical and biotechnology and food engineering 10 apart from nf with mwco smaller than 500 da tight nf loose nf mwco 500 2000 da has also been introduced and applied in numerous applications such as polyphenol fractionation and sugar separation 14 its lower salt rejection higher separation selectivity to small molecules and higher permeability is promising for resource recovery especially in textile wastewater treatment unlike tight nf which is widely available in the market due to its stable performance the competitive products of loose nf and its market demand are still limited 14 in terms of membrane materials the polymeric nf has widespread application in the wastewater treatment field but its fouling issue and long term stability are the major concern 15 on the other hand the ceramic membrane with high thermal and chemical stability good mechanical strength ease of cleaning procedure and long membrane lifetime is a promising alternative to the polymeric membrane 16 however its packing density and high investment cost require further improvement table 1 provides descriptions of several commercially available nf membranes made from various materials over the last two decades various studies have confirmed the separation mechanism of nf membranes which basically consists of steric donnan and dielectric effects as shown in fig 2 28 32 the steric effect which is also a common rejection mechanism in mf and uf is basically due to the exclusion of molecular size by the membrane pores solutes with larger molecular size in comparison to the membrane pore size are effectively rejected by the membranes solutes smaller than the membrane pore size will be able to permeate through depending on the hindered diffusion transport phenomena across the membrane pores 33 for nf membranes the steric effect will be influential for permeation of small solutes such as saccharides glucose sucrose and raffinose 30 polyethylene glycol peg 34 hormones 35 and phenolic compounds 36 the donnan effect or the electrostatic repulsion effect comes into play due to the presence of charge on the membrane surface 31 33 small ions with either positive or negative charges will not be affected by the steric exclusion effect but will be significantly affected by the donnan effect the presence of a fixed charge on the membrane surface will create a potential difference called donnan potential at the membrane bulk interface this potential will cause the counter ion species to be repelled due to the electrostatic repulsion effect to maintain the electroneutrality condition of the solution the co ion will also be simultaneously rejected the higher the charge of the counter ion the higher the rejection that will take place as a result of the aforementioned events electrostatic attraction or repulsion occurs in accordance with the ion valence and the membrane s fixed charge which may evolve depending on the localized ionic environment the third effect which is the dielectric effect refers to the solvation energy barrier formed when an ion passes from a solvent of one dielectric constant to a solvent of a different dielectric constant 37 38 zhu et al 38 demonstrated that electric field behavior and ion concentration distribution inside the nanopore reflect the variation of the dielectric effect consequently the dielectric effect affects the repulsive force to co ions and hence the rejection performance the combination of these separation mechanism effects has allowed nf membranes to be effective for various types of applications that will be elucidated in this review for different industries 3 application of nanofiltration for water recycling reuse and product recovery the presence of contaminants in industrial wastewaters is one of the global environmental problems textile food oil and gas mining tannery pharmaceutical as well as pulp and paper industries are examples of industrial sectors that consume a huge amount of water in their processes and generate wastewater that negatively influences the ecosystem water bodies soil and human health due to the increasing freshwater scarcity and environmental protection concerns water recycling and reuse as well as other resource recovery have been promoted in industries 39 in this context nf is one of the attractive technologies for that purpose this section discusses the application of nf in the industries as mentioned earlier for water recycling reuse and resource recovery 3 1 textile industry the textile industry which is one of the most water intensive sectors consumes a massive amount of water during the multiple production stages and generates up to 200 350 m3 of wastewater per ton of finished products 40 the generated wastewater is usually rich in color dyes chemical oxygen demand cod inorganic salts suspended solids and trace heavy metals 41 42 dyes appear to be the most problematic contaminant among these compounds due to their persistent carcinogenic and poor biodegradability properties the discharge of improperly treated textile effluent will adversely affect flora and fauna present in the water bodies and at the same time deplete the availability of clean water resources for human consumption hence advanced treatment processes are required to handle the textile effluent containing recalcitrant dyes and inorganic salts where both could be potentially recovered and reused in the textile industry the sustainable concept of recovering dyes and salt solutions from textile effluent could be materialized with nf membrane since the nf process can separate the dyes and salts particularly monovalent salts into two different streams this approach not only recovers valuable resources from textile effluent but also achieves multiple benefits such as preventing the release of hazardous pollutants to the environment minimizing the consumption of resources e g dyes water and salts and saving costs for instance chu et al 43 demonstrated the use of hollow fiber loose polyethersulfone nf membrane that could attain high fractionation efficiency of dye salt mixtures where the rejection of dye congo red 0 1 g l is as high as 99 9 while allowing more than 93 of nacl salt 1 g l to pass through the membrane their result highlights the potential of loose nf to recover dyes and salt solutions in textile effluent treatment the nf process could also remove other impurities present in the textile effluent 44 this is reflected in the study of tavangar et al 45 where real textile industry wastewater was used for nf filtration the textile effluent contained a wide range of reactive dyes with different structures monoazo diazo triazo and multiazo and molecular weights 300 1200 g mol as well as high turbidity 1500 ntu cod 2690 mg l and total dissolved solids tds 7500 mg l apart from separating the color rejection of 87 and allowing most inorganic salts to pass through 96 the use of loose nf membrane nadir np010 also reduced 74 of cod and 99 of turbidity this treatment produced salt solution with good quality for reuse in the factory and eased the handling of concentrated dye solution generally the separation mechanisms of nf in treating textile wastewater could be attributed to size exclusion and donnan exclusion effects in comparison to inorganic salt ions dyes with larger molecular weight tend to be rejected better by nf membrane hence explaining the high dye salt fractionation efficiency of the membrane through size exclusion mechanism as an example ji et al 46 observed that their prepared nf membranes attained high rejection for large molecular weight dyes i e congo red 99 9 and direct yellow 24 97 7 in comparison only about 78 5 of smaller molecular weight dye such as acid orange 10 was removed salahshoor et al 47 described the interplay between size exclusion and donnan effect mechanisms of negatively charged nf membrane surface charge of 9 4 to 19 91 mv and mwco 789 da in rejecting two oppositely charged dyes of rr195 anionic and mb cationic and various molecular weight 1136 3 and 319 8 da respectively the slightly higher retention of rr195 97 2 compared to mb 90 2 could be attributed to its larger molecular size and stronger electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion that repels anionic rr195 dyes from the negatively charged membrane surface despite the promising dyes rejection and dye salt fractionation performance of nf membrane the process feasibility is hindered by one challenge fouling which is a typical problem found in any membrane operation fouling is a phenomenon whereby impurities are deposited on a membrane surface or in membrane pores such that the membrane performance is greatly affected and degraded 48 the interactions between the membrane surface and the foulants especially dyes in textile effluent are the dominant factor affecting the severity of fouling 49 the positively charged dye molecules could be attracted and accumulated on the surface of negatively charged membrane which subsequently adsorbed to the membrane through hydrophobic interaction and blocked the membrane pores 50 the integrated process which combines the membrane unit with other processes in a treatment train is one of the feasible strategies in fouling mitigation 51 the aim of integrated process is to achieve better performance than any of the individual processes whereby the shortcomings of the stand alone process have been minimized or negated 52 previously the nf process has been integrated with numerous processes to minimize fouling propensity and achieve targeted permeate quality that can fulfil the water reuse criteria in the textile industry table 2 for example the integration of electrocoagulation as pre treatment significantly enhanced the steady membrane flux 15 lmh and flux recovery ratio 67 99 of nf as compared to stand alone nf at 2 lmh and 11 68 45 this could be attributed to the reduction of pollutants cod and suspended solids in textile wastewater by electrocoagulation pre treatment which has also reduced the thickness of foulant cake layer on nf membrane that enabled higher water permeation in another study nf was employed to further polish the treated effluent from mbr such that the treated water could be reused in fabric dyeing 53 the nf270 membrane was found to reduce the cod and turbidity of mbr effluent to below 5 mg l and 0 3 ntu respectively which subsequently has been reclaimed for reuse in fabric dyeing test surprisingly the results showed that no adverse effects were observed on the quality of the product in the dyeing experiment indicating that the integration of nf as post treatment polishing process to mbr enabled the recovery of water from textile effluent for reuse application lebron et al 54 combined the nf treatment with mf and advanced oxidation process aop photo fenton to recover water from textile industry effluent in their work two configurations namely mf nf aop c and mf aop nf fig 3 were investigated and compared the nf permeate from both configurations complied with the water reuse criteria for yarn washing off and equipment washing down nevertheless a higher fouling rate and lower permeate flux 19 lmh was observed for nf membrane in the second treatment train mf aop nf due to the high iron content in the effluent after being subjected to aop treatment which promoted the concentration polarization effect meanwhile the first configuration mf nf aop c has achieved higher nf permeate flux 38 lmh and the application of aop as post treatment step for nf concentrate has effectively removed cod and color about 70 and 98 5 respectively even so the effluent from aop post treatment did not fulfil the standard for reuse in noble application owing to its high iron content the cost analysis revealed that the mf nf aop c treatment requires a lower operating cost 0 421 us m3 than that of mf aop nf 0 736 us m3 suggesting that the first configuration is more suitable for textile effluent treatment due to its cost effectiveness in the textile industry the highly alkaline effluent from caustic main bath discharges is a potential resource for naoh recovery that can be reused in the causticization process for this type of effluent treatment the use of a ceramic membrane is promising since it has higher chemical resistance than polymeric nf membrane 55 moreover common polymeric nf membranes are only suitable for feed with low naoh content 0 1 0 4 56 therefore recent work by ağtaş et al 26 used the commercial ceramic nf atech 1000 da in the uf nf integrated process to recover caustic chemicals from caustic containing textile wastewater it was found that installation of nf after uf treatment has resulted in higher contaminant removal efficiency than that of single uf treatment the total organic carbon toc cod color and total hardness were removed by 67 71 92 and 42 respectively while at least 50 sodium was recovered using the uf nf treatment it was proposed that the recovered caustic solution could be reused in the causticization process by mixing with some amount of concentrated commercial caustic solution the economic analysis estimated that the application of ceramic uf nf membrane treatment could achieve a caustic recovery of 480 m3 year while caustic usage cost could be reduced by 50 by reusing the caustic solution besides integrated process utilization of nanomaterials in nf membrane modification or synthesis is another strategy that has been proposed to address the membrane fouling issue and to enhance the membrane performance 57 58 graphene oxide go 58 59 tio2 60 and cellulose nanocrystals cnc 61 are examples of nanomaterials which have been applied to fabricate or modify nf for dye salt separation very recently seah et al 58 prepared thin film nanocomposite tfn nf incorporated with surface coated go aiming to recover nacl from textile wastewater which can be further reused it was found that the tfn containing acrylic acid aa modified go exhibited 24 9 improvement of pure water permeability over the control membrane without go due to enhanced hydrophilicity moreover the tfn aa go successfully produced saline permeate with nacl recovery of 79 86 and contained pigment less than 0 28 suggesting potential reuse in dyeing process even so it shall be noted this promising result was based on the performance test using simulated textile wastewater despite extensive works in textile effluent treatment challenges such as membrane fouling the economic feasibility of integrated nf process including investment in the system and savings from reclaimed water and the large scale production of novel nf membrane still hinder the widespread application of nf in textile wastewater treatment more pilot scale data and economic evaluation should be conducted to convince the stakeholders of the benefits and possibility of reclaiming water from textile effluent using an integrated nf process furthermore the loose nf membranes with high permeability simple synthesis procedure exceptional antifouling properties and excellent dye salt separation efficiency should be further developed and explored for textile wastewater treatment 3 2 food industry water is one of the intensively consumed resources in the food industry where it is used in various aspects from being an ingredient in the production processes and products housekeeping and general cleaning and sanitation and disinfection purposes the characteristics of the wastewater generated from the agro food industry can vary significantly depending on the operation processes and type of products generally the wastewater contains a few types of major pollutants such as cod total suspended solids tss fats oils and nutrients 64 some micropollutants e g hormones surfactants antibiotics and pesticides can also be found in certain types of food industry effluent hence the food industry effluents need to be treated before being discharged since these pollutants will cause damage to the environment and ecosystem rather than being used for treatment purposes the nf membrane could be utilized to reclaim treated water for reuse in the food processing industry and recover value added compounds found in the effluents the former strategy could help to reduce the water consumption of the food industry while the latter approach enables the recovered compounds to be used in the food chain as functional additives in different products both these measures will help to progress the food industry towards sustainable development to achieve water and resource recovery with desired reuse criteria various integrated processes equipped with nf as a post treatment step have been proposed in food industry wastewater treatment table 3 for instance nf has been employed as a tertiary treatment to further polish the dairy effluent treated by mbr by removing the dissolved solids leftover in the mbr permeate 65 the integrated mbr nf treatment process achieved overall removal efficiencies of 99 9 for cod and 93 1 for total solids ts where the nf permeate met all the standards for water reuse in cooling and low pressure steam generation the minimization of water consumption has also been applied to citric acid production wastewater treatment where nf was utilized to remove the inhibitory compounds na and mg2 in effluent treated by anaerobic digestion and uf such that the reclaimed water could be reused in the fermentation of citric acid production 66 the capability of nf membrane to reject monovalent and divalent ions salinity in wastewater has attracted the attention of olive mill wastewater operators the existing physicochemical processes which consists of natural precipitation fenton like reaction flocculation sedimentation and olive stone filtration in series could not remove the dissolved ions in olive mill wastewater this prohibited the treated water from being reused or discharged to the environment in this scenario the inclusion of nf at the end of the treatment train could help to reduce the electroconductivity of the effluent as in the case reported by ochando pulido et al 67 where the ec value was reduced from 3 2 3 6 to 1 5 ms cm the final permeate possessed quality suitable to be reused for irrigation in addition to a wide range of organic contaminants and dissolved ions the phenolic compounds in olive mill wastewater also pose a challenge to the environment phenolic compounds are phytotoxic and antimicrobial resulting in difficult degradation under normal conditions and adversely impacting the viability of microorganisms and plants however their antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties have made it attractive to the food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries hence olive mill wastewater appears to be a feasible source for the recovery of value added phenolic compounds 68 69 ochando pulido et al 70 have shown that nf membrane could be used to treat the olive mill wastewater for water reclamation and phenols recovery the nf process produced permeate stream with good quality for irrigation reuse since it was practically free of phenolic content the interesting finding was that nf process managed to enrich the high added value phenols up to 75 7 1315 7 mg l in retentate which could be a potential source to satisfy the demand in cosmetics food pharmaceuticals and biotechnological industries the profit from phenols recovery could help to convince the stakeholders to adopt the nf treatment process since it can potentially offset a portion of the capital and operation costs of the nf process nonetheless pilot scale study and economic evaluation should be properly conducted to verify this benefit direct filtration of nf with dairy wastewater is not feasible due to the presence of impurities that will foul the membrane to address this issue chen et al 71 demonstrated that the incorporation of isoelectric precipitation as pre treatment could control and minimize nf membrane fouling the isoelectric precipitation process removed caseins the main protein in dairy effluent that also appears to be the main foulant for membrane operation consequently the fouling severity has been minimized as reflected by the mild increase of transmembrane pressure tmp from 2 to 3 bar as compared to without pre treatment tmp rose from 2 to 34 bar the nf permeate could be reused in the plant while the retentate without caseins was found to be a better source for anaerobic fermentation to produce a higher proportion of volatile fatty acids and biogas for subsequent utilization this integrated process highlighted the potential of resource recovery from dairy wastewater through the proper design of treatment technologies in a subsequent study chen et al 72 modified the integrated process for recovering water proteins cells and lactic acid from model dairy wastewater fig 4 the isoelectric precipitation acted as pre treatment to minimize concentration polarization and fouling of following uf and nf processes the uf produced two useful streams permeate with reduced foulants for nf and retentate rich in whey protein for recovery apart from producing reusable water nf also concentrated the lactose in its reject stream which can be further post treated using lactic acid fermentation process it was found that use of thermophilic bacillus coagulans ipe22 in the fermentation process successfully consumed lactose after 37 h producing 37 6 g l and 5 42 g l of lactic acid and cell mass respectively the cells and lactic acid recovered from the fermentation step could be used as animal food and raw material for bioplastic production hence mitigating the retentate sludge disposal issue besides olive mill and dairy wastewater nf membranes also have been used to treat the palm oil mill effluent pome 73 78 most of the studies have focused on the integrated use of nf membranes and other processes for tertiary treatment of the pome in the palm oil industry it is estimated that 5 7 5 t of water are utilized to generate 1 t of crude palm oil with more than 50 of this water being discarded as pome 79 even though the biological treatment process is commonly used to treat the pome this technique is ineffective in generating treated water with reusable criteria 73 hence a study conducted by ghani et al 74 adapted the nf process as a polishing step to reclaim water from diluted aerobic digested pome for recycling and reuse this work demonstrated that the pome treatment using commercial nf membrane nf270 was capable of removing the cod tds color phosphorus and turbidity by 95 93 99 80 and 99 respectively since the final cod concentration in nf permeate was slightly higher than that of boiler feed water criteria the authors proposed that the permeate could be reused for machine or factory cleaning activities however the severe fouling issue in the nf membrane during long term filtration of pome needs to be addressed in lupin beans production the processes to make these beans edible by removing lupanine toxic alkaloid consume a huge amount of freshwater however the lupanine in lupin beans wastewater is a valuable resource since it can be used as starting material for the synthesis of other alkaloids such as sparteine in the pharmaceutical industry esteves et al 22 have developed an integrated process consisted of nf solvent extraction and or resin adsorption for the recovery of water and lupanine from the wastewater the nf membrane showed remarkable high rejections for lupanine 99 5 allowing around 80 of the wastewater to be reclaimed and reused in the processing however the lupanine rich retentate requires further purification and isolation steps before subsequent use since the nf reject stream also contained high amount of total organic species 94 1 rejection the post treatment of nf retentate using several solvent extraction steps i e ethyl acetate as solvent was found to be capable to isolate 95 4 of lupanine with 78 purity which could be further converted to sparteine with a final purity above 95 the finding signifies the role of nf as a process to reclaim water and facilitate subsequent value added compound recovery in food wastewater handling the food industry wastewater typically contains organic impurities that will easily foul the nf membrane thus the nf membrane must be integrated with other treatment processes to alleviate the fouling phenomena by removing these impurities in the pre treatment stage furthermore the integration of different technologies enables the whole treatment process to recover water and valuable resources in the effluent such as phenols and lupanine these strategies will minimize the water consumption of the food industry and extract high added value compounds from the wastewater 3 3 oil and gas industry the effluent produced by the oil and gas industry is one of the main contributors to environmental pollution the extraction of oil and gas using hydraulic fracturing generates a massive amount of waste stream namely produced water pw it is anticipated that more than 70 billion barrels of pw have been produced annually 80 82 hydrocarbon corrosion inhibitor salts dissolved organic carbon heavy metals suspended solids and dissolved gases e g h2s and co2 are typical constituents of pw 5 besides oil and gas extraction the oil refinery process also consumes a huge amount of water during the cracking reforming and topping activities each barrel of crude oil requires 246 340 l of water resulting in the effluent that is 0 4 1 6 times the volume of oil treated 83 to reduce the freshwater consumption in oil and gas industry the reuse of treated water has been promoted which requires the development of efficient technologies to reclaim water from challenging wastewater such as pw and oil refinery effluent numerous studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of nf to treat the wastewater from the oil and gas industries for further reuse table 4 gamal khedr 84 developed an integrated pilot scale system comprised of coagulation sand filtration nf to treat the pw from the suez gulf region which can be reused for injection purposes in the oil formation to increase oil production conventional coagulation sand filtration system applied in suez gulf pw treatment is not efficient to remove the tds hardness components and metal ions e g uranium from the pw resulting in biofilm and solid scale formation as well as microbial corrosion phenomenon in the injection pipelines moreover the injection of poorly treated pw which contain high so4 2 content would destroy the porous structure of the oil formation to overcome these issues gamal khedr 84 installed the polyamide thin film composite nf membrane after the coagulation filtration during the pw treatment it was found that the integrated system was highly efficient in removing so4 2 uranium and other cations such as cu2 pb2 cr3 and ra2 from pw unlike single coagulation treatment which possessed lower uranium rejection 15 45 removal at ph 4 6 the adoption of nf membrane as the post treatment step has successfully achieved more than 80 uranium removal efficiency across the ph range the coagulation nf integrated system also completely removed the so4 2 ions and material of bacteria growth while the tds other hardness cations and monovalent cations were rejected by approximately 34 76 80 and 35 37 respectively thus the use of nf membrane was capable to upgrade the quality of treated pw for injection purposes which is important to inhibit the scale and corrosion formation in the pipelines internal reuse of pw for hydraulic fracturing operation is now the most prevalent and cost effective alternative in the shale gas industry however the pw needs to be properly treated where removal of divalent ions is necessary prior to recycling for internal reuse the presence of divalent cations in the recycled pw may have a detrimental effect on shale gas production by precipitating sulfate and the formation of stable carbonate 24 85 thus the application of the nf membrane is beneficial to treat the pw since it can remove divalent ions however adopting a proper pre treatment is essential during the wastewater treatment to prolong the lifetime of the nf membrane in this context chang et al 24 used the coagulation uf configuration to pre treat the pw before nf process for internal reuse unlike common filtration techniques such as sand filtration the uf is more promising to reduce turbidity it was found that the use of iron coagulation uf as the pre treatment unit has enhanced the nf permeate flux up to 23 the integrated iron coagulation uf nf 200 psi system has successfully produced the permeate that fulfils the flowback pw reuse specification in marcellus shale play 24 86 the final concentration of so4 2 mg2 ca2 sr2 ba2 in the treated water were 1 0 mg l 3 7 mg l 63 4 mg l 14 5 mg l and 23 2 mg l respectively which represents the 72 8 91 7 removal efficiency besides coagulation biological pre treatment such as biologically active filtration baf has also been proposed to be coupled with uf nf for treating pw for hydraulic fracturing reuse 87 88 the baf unit which contains the biofilm supported on filter media can effectively degrade organic matter from the oil and gas industry wastewater riley et al 87 reported that the baf uf nf configuration fig 5 had reduced the tds level in pw feed from 12 615 mg l to 685 mg l 94 removal by increasing the pressure up to 300 psi the installation of baf uf pre treatment has also mitigated the fouling in the nf membrane however this result may not be indicative of long term fouling since this water treatment was only conducted under short term operation 60 h recently attempts have been made to explore the potential of flowback pw as a resource for lithium recovery increasing global demand for lithium supply particularly for lithium based battery production has promoted the exploration of potential lithium resources a study conducted by seip et al 89 proposed the integration of nf with manganese based ion exchange sorbents for lithium recovery from flowback pw the presence of small organic molecules 250 da in untreated flowback pw can reduce the manganese in the sorbent during the lithium recovery causing the sorbent loss via reductive dissolution thus the pw was subjected to nf treatment using da synder filtration nfs membrane 100 250 da to remove the small organic molecules before the lithium recovery step the removal of non purgeable organic carbon npoc content from 180 ppm to 85 ppm after nf treatment has minimized the sorbent loss in acid desorption of lithium signifying the importance of nf in improving the efficiency of the integrated process for lithium recovery in the petroleum refinery wastewater treatment nf has been integrated with mbr and aop to produce permeate water that can be reused in the cooling systems 90 in a recent study moser et al 90 investigated the effect of aop i e uv h2o2 process pre treatment on the nf dow filmtec nf90 performance and assessed the overall efficiency of the integrated system in treating petrochemical effluent taken from a refinery plant in brazil it was observed that the nf permeate flux was enhanced since the fouling potential in nf was reduced the uv h2o2 pre treatment has altered the fouling characteristics which make it easily removed and thus less nf cleaning frequency was required moreover the use of nf as post treatment was found to effectively remove the toxic intermediate substance produced by the uv h2o2 process the integrated treatment has successfully removed the tds calcium ammonia chloride cod toc and toxicity level by more than 98 the final nf permeate contained 28 mg l of tds 0 3 mg l of ammonia 7 2 mg l of chloride and 0 96 mg l of toc complying with the water standard quality for cooling system the potential of nf to treat the spent caustic solution for reuse in crude oil refinery was explored by santos et al 91 the commercial composite polymeric nf seiro mps 34 with the alkaline resistant feature was installed in a pilot plant to treat spent caustic with a conductivity of 110 ms cm ph 13 7 polar oil and grease content of 11 300 mg l and cod of 81 571 mg l the crossflow operation mode was applied in that study and the performance of ceramic uf membrane carbosep m2 15 kda was also evaluated separately for comparison purposes unlike ceramic uf membrane which failed to reduce the polar oil and grease content in the permeate side to below 20 ppm the performance of nf membrane seems more promising since it can attain the polar oil and grease and cod removal efficiency of 99 9 and 97 7 respectively at 15 bar operating pressure a restorable and stable nf permeate flux was observed until the volume concentration factor of 3 also the nf operation under this condition was capable of recovering the sodium resulting in a purified permeate caustic solution that can be recycled back for further reuse in the refinery process the economic analysis revealed that the reuse of the purified permeate could benefit the oil refinery by offering a significant saving of 1 5 m per year overall most of the studies related to nf application in oil and gas industry wastewater treatment have focused on water recovery and reuse however limited studies related to by products recovery such as lithium recovery from pw has been reported in the literature thus further investigation is required in the future to explore the potential of membrane based technologies such as nf in the integrated process for resource recovery in oil and gas industry wastewater treatment 3 4 mining industry the mining industry generates several types of effluents during mining activities and processing one of the major mining effluents is acid mine drainage amd which was formed due to the exposure of rocks containing sulfur to water and air 16 92 amd commonly shows a high level of sulfate content 1 20 g l low ph value ph 2 4 high concentration of heavy metals and toxic components 16 93 in gold mining activity a large volume of acidic effluent containing substantial metal concentration is generated by the pressure oxidation process conventional mining effluent treatment involves the use of lime neutralization technique that can precipitate the sulfate and metals 94 95 nevertheless this method produces a tremendous amount of sludge which presents an environmental threat and requires proper disposal 93 96 therefore the application of membrane technologies such as nf is a promising alternative that can produce permeate for reuse and allow the recovery of acid and valuable metals from mining industrial effluent as reported in several studies 93 96 102 and summarized in table 5 mullett et al 96 compared the performance of two types of commercial polyamide nf membranes namely dow nf270 and trisep ts 80 in treating the amd for recovering valuable metals such as copper the nf270 membrane demonstrated 95 removal efficiency for all multivalent ions i e ca2 cu2 mg2 mn3 at feed ph less than 3 while higher sulfur rejection 95 97 was achieved at high ph conditions ph 3 unlike the nf270 membrane the ts 80 membrane showed that the removal efficiency for sulfur and all multivalent ions was less affected by the feed ph higher rejection 95 can be attained by the ts 80 membrane across the studied ph range despite its promising performance for mine water treatment ts 80 membrane required higher operating pressure than nf270 membrane which thus consumed more energy the recovery test of the ts 80 membrane revealed that increasing the feed ph higher than the membrane isoelectric point iep would result in 2 4 kg h of the copper loss in permeate which corresponded to copper loss of around 69 000 year such findings highlighted the necessity of understanding the relationship between solution chemistry and membrane properties to achieve optimal recovery and avoid significant loss in capital and operating cost the potential of nf for amd reclamation in both lab scale and pilot scale studies was further investigated by wadekar et al 93 initial screening in a lab scale study using cross flow module showed that the use of polyamide nf membrane nf90 would be preferable to polypiperazine amide nf membrane nf270 for treating actual amd the nf90 membrane which possessed a smaller pore size has demonstrated better rejection for all ions 97 with sulfate removal in excess of 99 the performance of the nf90 membrane was further assessed in a pilot plant where the real amd feed was pre treated first using aeration sedimentation bag filtration and uf process prior to nf filtration at 10 bar these pre treatment steps have efficiently removed iron from the amd feed and thus prevented the fouling due to inorganic or iron scales resulting in long term stability of nf system the long term operation 208 h of the integrated system indicated that the nf membrane successfully achieved stable water recovery of 57 with tds rejection of more than 98 besides high removal of magnesium calcium and sulfate ions 99 the tight nf90 membrane also was able to reject about 90 of monovalent ion chloride from the amd the final nf permeate which is comprised of low tds content 50 mg l sulfate 10 mg l calcium 1 mg l and magnesium 0 3 mg l could be reused for industrial applications such as for the cooling system meanwhile it has been proposed that the nf concentrate with high sulfate content 4000 mg l could be used to treat the flowback and pw the mixing of flowback water and sulfate rich amd concentrate has the potential to remove the barium and strontium ions from flowback water via sulfate precipitation process as reported by others 103 besides amd treatment the polyamide nf90 membrane has also been applied in gold mining effluent reclamation reis et al 99 assessed the performance nf90 to recover water from the gas scrubber effluent taken from a gold mining plant in brazil which mainly contained tds 7085 mg l sulfate 4852 mg l calcium 258 mg l magnesium 134 mg l and some arsenic as v and as iii unlike wadekar et al s finding 93 which showed high tds rejection 98 for amd reclamation reis et al 99 found that the nf90 membrane demonstrated a lower tds rejection 86 during water recovery from gold mining wastewater at 10 bar pressure such discrepancy could be attributed to the higher contaminant concentration in gold mining effluent where its tds and sulfate content level is five times higher than that of amd moreover the gold mining effluent in reis et al s study 99 was just pre treated using mf filtration to remove the suspended solids even though the nf permeate did not fulfil the water quality standard for reuse in boilers or cooling systems the authors proposed that it can be reused in other mining processes that employ water with a low ph value hence decreasing the expense of ph adjustment ricci et al 97 combined the mf nf with the ro process to improve the permeate quality and recover noble metals and sulfuric acid during the treatment of gold mining effluent generated by pressure oxidation process fig 6 the role of nf in the integrated system was to produce metal enriched retentate and obtain sulfuric acid enriched permeate for further separation in the ro unit it was found that the combination of nf membrane mpf 34 and mf has successfully retained more than 95 valuable metals such as copper cobalt and nickel in the retentate streams enabling further treatment in the metal recovery process since the post treatment stage of the metal enriched retentate was not covered in their study the potential of integrating mf nf system with bioelectrochemical technology such as microbial fuel cell which is promising for heavy metal recovery 104 can be further explored in future basically the mpf 34 nf membrane iep 4 5 was positively charged under exposure to acidic gold mining effluent ph 1 46 97 so it possessed high metal cations rejection but low hso4 anion rejection this nf property allowed 82 acid permeation resulting in a high sulfuric acid recovery in the nf permeate stream which was further concentrated up to 99 by ro tfc hr membrane it was proposed that the recovered acid could be recycled and reused to control the acidity in the pressure oxidation stage in gold mining processing meanwhile the integrated system also has reduced the tds level in the gold mining effluent from 23 973 to 192 mg l 99 removal producing final permeate with quality that was suitable for reuse in boilers system despite these promising results further investigation by ricci et al 98 revealed that the nickel and cobalt rejection of mpf 34 nf membrane was reduced by 33 upon continuous exposure to the gold mining effluent for eight weeks based on this finding it can be suggested that a more stable nf membrane shall be applied in gold mining effluent treatment to prevent the noble metal loss in permeate side under long term operation mode in a recent work by ramos et al 100 the performances and chemical stability of various commercial nf membranes including dk duracid nf90 nf270 and mpf 34 were compared to seek a more chemically stable nf that can stand the acidic gold mining effluent in integrated uf nf ro system among the investigated nf membranes dk appeared as the most promising nf membrane for gold mining effluent treatment due to its high permeate flux 25 lmh low fouling tendency and high noble metals rejection 94 for copper cobalt and nickel unlike mpf 34 performance in previous work 98 the dk membrane possessed higher chemical stability under long term exposure 180 days to gold mining effluent with a conductivity of 18 64 ms cm and ph 1 53 the final permeate water from the integrated uf nf ro system contained low acid concentration ph 2 5 that could be reused in the gold mining process which does not require ph adjustment moreover the integrated system was capable of recovering sulfuric acid with high purity for further reuse in the mining production process their findings indicate that proper membrane selection is a vital component in designing process to recover water and valuable resources from challenging wastewater overall it can be observed that polymeric nf membrane has been commonly applied for water recycling and reuse and product recovery from mining wastewater despite the excellent separation performance of polymeric nf its long term stability issue in highly acidic mining effluent remains a significant concern thus to overcome the limitation of polymeric nf future studies can explore the performance of ceramic nf membrane for water recycling and reuse as well as product recovery in the mining industry 3 5 tannery industry the tannery industry releases very high volumes of toxic effluent including numerous recalcitrant pollutants which have a devastating effect on surface water it has been estimated that global leather production generates about 600 million m3 of wastewater annually 105 the pre tanning and tanning activities in skin hides processing are the major sources of pollution in the tannery industry 106 these processes discharged wastewater containing high levels of chromium chloride sulfate sulfide and suspended solids 105 106 among tannery effluent pollutants chromium cr is the contaminant of primary concern due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties 20 107 given the toxicity of the tannery wastewater an efficient technique is required to treat this effluent prior to discharge or reuse several investigations have been carried out to study the performance of the nf process in the treatment of tannery effluent for water and resource recovery as well as reuse applications table 6 romero dondiz et al 108 compared the performance of various types of commercial nf membranes namely dk ck tfc sr3 and mpf 34 for tannins and water recovery from real vegetable tannin liquor the nf membranes allowed the tannins recovery due to the charge repulsion and molecular sieving mechanism where the highest tannins rejection 97 6 was achieved by the mpf 34 membrane it was proposed that the tannin rich retentate stream could be reused in the production of a new liquor tannin solution despite its high tannin recovery mpf 34 showed a significant drop in permeate flux in contrast the dk membrane showed the highest permeate flux 17 17 lmh and a low fouling tendency but its tannin recovery rate is not sufficient compared to the other nf membranes the tannery industry produces sulfate rich effluent due to the usage of abundant amounts of sulfuric acid and sulfide application in the unhairing stage which was further oxidized into sulfate therefore galiana aleixandre et al 109 applied the nf process as a pollution prevention technique in reducing sulfate concentration in the tannery effluent sulfate retention of 97 was achieved in the nf treatment of the tanning washing wastewater where the sulfate rich concentrate could be reused in the tanning drums the high sulfate rejection was due to the size exclusion mechanism since there was no charge interaction as the ph of the tanning washing effluent ph 4 was equal to the iep of the applied nf membrane desal 5dl it was estimated that the implementation of nf membrane with 97 sulfate retention for treating 50 m3 tanning washing effluent would be able to recover 61 63 t of sulfate per year for recycling and reuse in tanning drums religa et al 110 applied nf membrane for recirculation of cr iii from tannery wastewater concentrate salt mixture solution at very low ph four types of commercial nf membranes namely hl dk dl and ck were tested to compare their performance upon exposure to synthetic chromium tannery wastewater with a ph range of 3 6 3 9 the thin selective skin layer of dl membrane ensures both low chlorine retention 7 11 in conjunction with high cr iii retention 94 97 and a high permeate flux they concluded that the use of nf membrane with low iep value such as dl iep 3 was more preferred for the treatment of tannery wastewater at ph below 4 in that condition the negatively charged nf membrane could facilitate the chloride ions permeation minimizing the concentration polarization phenomenon and increasing the permeate flux the obtained chromium rich concentrate and chloride rich permeate from the nf process could be reused as tanning and pickling baths respectively to improve the efficiency of tannery wastewater treatment nf has been integrated with other technologies in several works for instance gando ferreira et al 111 integrated nf with ion exchange pre treatment processes to recover cr iii salts from simulated tannery wastewater containing a typical concentration range of cl cr iii and so4 2 in industrial effluents of tanneries the ion exchange pre treatment unit was installed for uptaking the chloride ions from the tannery effluent enabling the generation of cr iii rich retentate by nf their results demonstrated that the nf performance was affected by the cl so4 2 ratio the ratio of 0 082 led to the best operating conditions for the integrated process producing 90 cr iii enriching retentate for reuse in the tanning process in another work dasgupta et al 20 employed the coagulation nf based integrated treatment scheme to achieve maximum removal of toxic cr vi species from tannery wastewater the coagulation pre treatment has successfully mitigated the fouling in nf membrane and high cr vi removal efficiency 98 was achieved by the hybrid process the installation of nf after coagulation pre treatment has successfully improved the permeate quality up to the standard criteria for water reuse in tannery operation a new go based nanocomposite membrane was developed by pal et al 105 for the application in an aop nf integrated process that was specifically designed to recover water from real tannery wastewater for recycling and reuse the surface of the freshly casted polyethersulfone membrane was modified using go nanomaterials in a layer by layer l b l assembly method trimesoyl chloride tmc acted as a cross linking reagent that helps the go layer to adhere firmly onto the membrane surface as illustrated in fig 7 high rejection efficiency of 99 cod 96 tds and 99 chromium with high flux at 210 220 lmh under operating pressure of 16 bar indicated the effectiveness of the aop nf system for water reclamation from leather industry wastewater a pilot scale forward osmosis fo and nf integrated closed loop system was developed by pal et al 112 for continuous reclamation of clean water from tannery wastewater at a rate of 52 55 lmh at 1 6 bar pressure continuous recovery for recycling the draw solute was done by nf of diluted draw solution at an operating pressure of 12 bar and volumetric crossflow rate of 700 l h the work of pal et al 112 culminated in the development of a compact efficient and low cost tannery industrial wastewater treatment and reclamation technology with the maximum cod rejection of 98 5 chloride rejection of 97 2 and sulfate rejection of 98 2 the treatment cost of 1 m3 tannery wastewater was calculated to be 0 72 these findings are useful in the design and operation of an industrial scale tannery wastewater treatment plant as the cost analysis is likely to raise the confidence level in scale up installation subsequently pal et al 113 developed a model for the fo nf closed loop system in validating the context of real tannery wastewater the developed mathematical model for the proposed system showed low relative error 0 1 high overall correlation coefficient r2 0 98 and high wilmot d index 0 95 thereby indicating reasonably high performance prediction capability the findings from these studies 112 113 demonstrated that the integrated fo nf system is promising for clean water recovery from tannery effluent 3 6 pulp and paper industry the wastewater generated by the pulp and paper industry is one of the common sources of industrial water pollution the pulp and paper industry consumes a lot of freshwater 273 455 m3 per tonne paper and generates significant amounts of contaminated wastewater 220 380 m3 per tonne paper 114 115 the wastewater generated by the pulp and paper industry contains various types of contaminants and composition depending on the substrate type e g recycled paper softwood and hardwood and the manufacturing process i e pulping bleaching and papermaking 116 117 for instance pulping process discharges effluent with cod of 500 115 000 mg l ph range of 6 3 6 8 and high lignin concentration 11 000 25 000 mg l the bleaching process generates effluent containing toxic pollutants such as phenols organic halogen and chlorinated organic compounds that can harm living organisms meanwhile the wastewater from the papermaking process contains high cod tds phosphates sulfate and chloride 117 to reduce freshwater consumption in the pulp and paper industry advanced water treatment such as membrane technology has been developed to recover water for recycling and reuse in the manufacturing process in this scenario nf is one of the promising membrane treatments since it that can reject multivalent ions from pulp and paper industrial effluent for instance lee et al 118 used the commercial nf90 membranes to study the phosphorus ions removal from simulated wastewater comprising 14 5 mg l phosphorus which corresponded to typical concentration in the pulp and paper industrial effluent the phosphorus rejection of 99 77 and permeate flux of 88 74 lmh were recorded under optimized conditions at ph of 7 2 9 3 bar and 34 c previously the nf process has been used either as stand alone or integrated with numerous processes to achieve targeted permeate quality that can fulfil the reuse criteria in the pulp and paper industry table 7 although most of the paper mills use the biological treatments such as activated sludge process to pre treat their effluents the treated water is not clean enough to enable the reuse of water in producing most of paper grades 119 thus desalting process using membrane technologies such as nf is required to polish the water quality for reuse in the manufacturing processes in a recent work conducted by caldeira et al 120 nf was applied after pre treatments comprised of flotation up flow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor uasb and activated sludge process during water recovery from simulated thermo mechanical pulp mill effluent for internal reuse the nf membrane attained rejection of 89 99 82 74 and 57 for cu2 mn2 fe2 ca2 and mg2 ions respectively while the overall permeate quality was suitable for industrial processes it was found that the reuse of 100 of the treated effluent in the bleaching process did not significantly affect the pulp quality in terms of brightness and brightness reversion despite this promising result it should be noted that the membrane performance was based on exposure to synthetic wastewater a study reported by gönder et al 121 further revealed the potential of nf in pulp and paper industry wastewater reclamation in their work the real pulp and paper wastewater pre treated using biological treatment was subjected to two step nf process to recover water with quality up to water reuse standard the use of fm np010 membrane in the first step of the nf process has rejected 92 total hardness 91 cod and 98 sulfate under optimized conditions the fm np030 membrane was further used as the second step in the nf treatment system and successfully produced permeate with quality that meets the actual process water a minimal fouling effect was observed by increasing the feed ph up to ph 10 under this condition the negatively charged membrane could repel the negatively charged contaminants in the pulp wastewater reducing the solutes adsorption onto the membrane the treatment of paper machine circulation wastewater whitewater by a two step nf process was carried out by kaya et al 122 like gonder et al s study the fm np010 membrane loose nf and fm np030 tight nf were used in the first and second stage nf respectively the results showed that the combination of loose and tight nf membranes successfully recovered water that can be reused as shower water for paper machines the best performance was observed at the pressure of 32 bar and ph of 5 6 where all the contaminants with the exception of chloride ions were efficiently removed suspended solids tp sulfate and color were removed more than 99 after passing through the tight nf resulting in sufficient permeate quality for shower water application khosravi et al 119 evaluated the nf and low pressure ro membranes in mbr for mazandaran pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment the measured parameters such as color organic carbon and uv absorption were almost completely rejected by the nf270 membrane but monovalent ions especially nitrate and chloride ions and inorganic carbon permeated easily through the membrane therefore nf is attractive in purifying discharge water for reuse in the paper manufacturing process as long as the discharge water does not contain too high amounts of monovalent ions bleached sulfite pulp mills generate a considerable amount of brown colored effluents rich in cod and valuable waste products such as lignin derivatives 123 the recovery of lignin derivatives is advantageous since these materials can be further used in the production of biobased products including resins biofuels and fine chemicals in this context ebrahimi et al 123 investigated the possibility of recovering lignin from pulp and paper industry wastewater using ceramic tubular membrane technology the average cod and lignin retention efficiencies achieved by the two stage uf nf treatment were 35 40 and 45 66 respectively however the two stage process of mf uf configuration showed better treatment efficiency for alkaline bleaching effluent lowering the overall cod by 35 45 and residual lignin concentration by 60 73 shukla et al 124 designed an integrated membrane filtration system comprised of uf nf and ro membranes in series to treat the effluent generated by extraction stages and chlorination c stage in a bleach plant at an indian pulp and paper mill the majority of the constituents in the c stage effluent were too small to be rejected even by a very dense uf membrane however significant removal of the pollutants was obtained via the nf process with 45 18 81 48 tds 46 27 80 78 cod 100 color and 47 90 68 34 adsorbable organic halides aox on the other hand comparative removal was observed for the treatment of effluent from the extraction stage during the nf process removals ranging from 40 53 48 78 for tds 25 04 54 20 for cod 75 30 96 51 for color and 43 27 81 98 for aox were observed at different pressure excellent removals of all pollutants were achieved by ro where the overall removal of the lab scale membrane treatment plant was 100 tds 75 98 cod 100 color and 91 98 aox for c stage effluent and 100 tds 90 100 cod 100 color and 93 99 aox for extraction stage effluent the installation of nf prior to ro has enhanced the pollutants removal efficiencies of ro signifying the importance of an integrated membrane system in clean water recovery from pulp and paper industry wastewater 3 7 pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is one of the fastest growth industries and its global market size is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 11 34 from 2021 to 2028 125 hence it is expected that more pharmaceutical wastewater will be produced in the coming years since water is mainly used in pharmaceutical manufacturing process such as chemical synthesis and fermentation stages pharmaceutical effluent may contain organic and inorganic pollutants pharmaceutical active compounds phacs e g tranquilizers antibiotics diuretics and psychiatric drug and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 126 the removal of phacs and edcs from pharmaceutical wastewater has emerged as one of the most pressing issues since these compounds are harmful to human health and environment besides there has been an increased emphasis on water reuse in pharmaceutical sector in recent years 127 thus the development of efficient methods for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is mandatory the effective removal of phacs can be achieved via membrane technologies such as nf since most of the phacs possess molecular weight greater than 250 da 128 it is expected that the phacs can be well retained by the membrane through molecular sieving if the membrane mwco is greater than the molecular weights of phacs in this scenario the application of tight nf with small mwco 500 da is a promising option and has been frequently applied for the removal of phacs table 8 129 131 for example yangali quintanilla et al 131 examined the performance of tight nf membranes namely nf 90 and nf 200 membranes for treating synthetic water solution containing 17 compounds including various phacs and edcs the performance of ro membrane bw30 le and espa2 was also studied for comparison purpose and the filtration test was conducted in bench pilot and full scale to generate reusable water it was revealed the nf 90 had higher rejections than nf 200 due to a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion furthermore nf and ro attained 97 and 99 average rejection of ionic compounds respectively and the removal of neutral compounds was approximately 82 and 85 respectively thus they concluded that the tight nf membranes were a viable option to ro since nf can also achieve effective removal of phacs or edcs at lower operating cost in another work azaïs et al 130 investigated the performance of nf 90 and nf 270 membranes during the treatment of pre treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant spiked with phacs the influences of solute solute interaction and fouling on the phacs rejection i e acetaminophen act atenolol atl carbamazepine cbz and diatrizoic acid dtz was studied and the nf permeate quality was assessed to explore its suitability for reuse in terms of phacs removal excellent rejection 90 was achieved by nf 90 membrane which contained smaller pores than nf 270 unlike nf 270 membrane which possessed lower removal of phacs due to cake enhanced concentration polarization it was found that the solute solute interaction phacs binding and fouling has less effect on the phacs rejection of nf 90 membrane moreover the permeate quality analysis revealed that the recovered water using nf 90 membrane has fulfilled the irrigation water standard suggesting that a tight nf membrane such as nf 90 is promising for wastewater reuse tight nf has demonstrated good phacs removal efficiency but irreversible fouling is the main issue in tight nf with low mwco therefore maryam et al 132 proposed the use of loose nf hydracore nf 50 with mwco of 1000 da for the removal of three types of phacs namely ibuprofen ibu diclofenac dic and paracetamol para from synthetic wastewater in their work the efficiency and behavior of loose nf was assessed under extreme ph condition using pilot plant dead end system at 8 bar it was found that loose nf removed 99 7 dic at ph 3 80 5 ibu at neutral ph and 36 2 para at ph 12 even though the permeate flux changed due to drugs chemical properties no apparent fouling was observed for nf 50 since this negatively charged membrane surface could repel the negatively charged drug molecules thus they suggested that the application of loose nf with large mwco can also be a promising alternative technique for removal of phacs from effluent nevertheless the low rejection of paracetamol needs to be addressed the limitation of biological treatment to remove inorganic compounds and salt in pharmaceutical wastewater requires installation of post treatment unit to polish the effluent quality up to water reuse criteria in the case of mbr low removal efficiency of some micropollutants has been reported 133 134 therefore the application of integrated process comprised of nf as polishing step can be used to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment for recycling and reuse in a study conducted by wang et al 133 a pilot scale membrane system comprised of mbr nf was installed at a pharmaceutical company in wuxi china to recover water from antibiotic production effluent for industrial reuse two commercial polyimide nf membranes filmtec nf 90 and nf 2540 were installed in parallel and operated at tmp of 5 0 7 5 bar at a cross flowrate of 2 0 m3 h the performance of integrated system was assessed over three month period and part of the nf concentrate was recycled to the mbr on the day 62 during the process the organic pollutants e g protein humid substances and polysaccharides were accumulated and further biodegraded in mbr by recycling the nf retentate their result demonstrated that the strategy of nf concentrate recycling has resulted in effective antibiotic wastewater treatment with high water yield 92 the integrated process successfully generated final permeate with turbidity of 0 15 ntu conductivity of 2 5 ms cm toc of 5 52 mg l and tp of 0 34 mg l complying with china s water quality standard for industrial usage moreover it shall be noted that the application of nf as post treatment step not only improve the antibiotic removal 95 but it also helps to reduce the acute toxicity of the effluent despite this promising result further economic evaluation is required to analyse the cost of the membrane treatment system including the cost saving after water reuse implementation to mitigate the fouling in nf membrane amadou yacouba et al 134 proposed the application of ozone based aop to pre treat the mbr effluent prior to nf process in their study the real mbr effluent from a wastewater treatment plant spiked with four pharmaceuticals i e acetaminophen act carbamazepine cbz sulfamethoxazole sul and tetracyclin tet and herbicide was used as the feed it was found that the nf 90 membrane operated using crossflow system at 10 bar successfully removed the organic micropollutants with rejection of 84 98 moreover the pre ozonation has reduced the fouling resistance by about 40 due to degradation of dissolved organic matters which consequently turned them into more hydrophilic constituents with less tendency for irreversible fouling however it shall be noted that the efficiency of nf 90 membrane to remove ozonation by products was not evaluated in this work and thus remains questionable besides mbr the nf also has been paired with other membrane technologies such fo during pharmaceutical wastewater reclamation for instance thakura et al 135 applied the nf after fo process for draw solution regeneration reconcentration and recycling while at the same time extracting the clean water trapped inside the draw solution during the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the installation of downstream nf module at 12 bar tmp achieved the draw solution recovery and recycle of 99 while generating high permeate flux 58 60 lmh which can be reused in industry besides the promising water treatment performance the cost analysis is important to enhance the confidence level in scale up installation thus economic analysis was also evaluated in their work for a wastewater plant with plant capacity of 50 000 l day it was found that the total operational cost was 17 800 year but this cost could be further reduced to 13 300 year by implementing the water reutilization in terms of resource recovery the potential of nf to recover organic solvent and phacs from waste stream generated by pharmaceutical production process has been reported in previous studies 136 137 the recovery of pharmaceutical compound namely 1 5 bromo fur 2 il 2 bromo 2 nitroethane g 1 from residual ethanol stream generated by g 1 purification stage was investigated by brito martínez et al 137 commercial nf membranes namely duramem 150 and nf 90 have attained high g 1 retention 60 via one step separation highlighting the potential of nf for valuable phacs recovery moreover heavy metals such as nickel are another by product that can be found in pharmaceutical industry effluent 128 however limited studies have been focused on the valuable metal recovery from pharmaceutical wastewater thus there should be more emphasis on this resource recovery aspect using nf based integrated process for pharmaceutical effluent treatment in future work even though the by product reuse application within pharmaceutical industry is often restricted by the stringent quality control requirement the waste exchange which involves the transfer of the recovered products to another industry or company can be done as alternative to promote recycling and reuse 128 4 outlook and future perspective the unique feature of nf which allows selective separation of targeted species is promising for water and resource recovery from industrial effluent the reclaimed water and valuable products from wastewater via integrated nf process fulfilled certain standard criteria that enable resource recovery and water recycling and reuse nevertheless more studies need to be conducted in the future to promote resource recovery as well as water recycling and reuse practice in industrial wastewater treatment using membrane technologies especially the nf the aspects that need to be considered in future research are summarized as follow 4 1 membrane materials and design for industrial effluents that are highly acidic or alkaline such as gold mining effluent and caustic containing wastewater in the textile and oil refinery industry few studies involving the use of nf for resource recovery and reuse application have been reported hence the development of polymeric nf that possesses highly acidic or alkaline resistant feature can be investigated more in the future to explore the potential of nf for product recovery from these industrial effluents the utilization of nanomaterials nanotechnology to fabricate higher resistance nf membranes should be explored further in this direction meanwhile ceramic nf is a promising alternative for industrial wastewater treatment involving extreme ph or high temperature condition nevertheless the application of ceramic nf for industrial wastewater treatment is still limited compared to polymeric nf probably due to its high capital cost thus it is essential to find strategies for reducing the cost of the ceramic membrane to make it economically viable in comparison to the polymeric membrane for instance future studies can explore waste derived materials inexpensive precursors or new technique to fabricate cost efficient ceramic nf in the context of textile industrial effluent treatment the development of loose nf membranes with high permeability superior antifouling property and excellent dye salt separation efficiency that can be easily synthesized and mass produced can also be explored 4 2 pre treatment processes most of the works reported have also highlighted the issues with membrane fouling due to the complexity of the wastewater from these various industries effective pre treatment processes are vital to minimize the issues with nf membranes and allow for a more sustainable and long term operation of membranes various pre treatment processes have been reported such as coagulation flocculation precipitation adsorption membrane based processes and aop more studies should be conducted to determine the most optimum configuration and its impact on the nf membrane as well as the overall performance 4 3 retentate post treatment processes besides the concern on nf permeate quality for reuse the retentate or brine management is also a vital issue common disposal techniques i e evaporation ponds surface water discharge land application and deep well injection could impart negative influences on soil groundwater and marine environment 138 rather than being disposed the retentate could be post treated if it contains value added compounds numerous techniques such as resin adsorption solvent extraction microbial fuel cell and membrane crystallization unit are promising for treating the nf retentate depending on the nature of the by products to be recovered there should be extensive research to investigate the effect of these post treatment techniques on the purity of the recovered by products to unlock their potential for reuse application and thus achieving zero liquid discharge 4 4 long term assessment the separation performance from most of the published works so far were based on short term assessment future works shall focus on investigating the long term performance upon exposure to real industrial wastewater in order to investigate the fouling propensity behavior membrane stability and its performance in challenging conditions the installation of a suitable nf membrane based on the consideration of long term chemical stability real separation performance and less fouling propensity will increase the process sustainability during the water or by products recovery from the industrial wastewater 4 5 economic analysis to mitigate the membrane fouling and to improve the permeate characteristics up to a certain standard that enables the reuse within the industrial process the nf has been commonly integrated with other processes during the industrial wastewater treatment despite the good water or by products recovery performance of the integrated process most studies did not report the economic analysis including the overall cost treatment in addition the analysis on water or chemical saving cost after reuse implementation is essential to convince the industries to invest in the integrated water treatment process for recycling and reuse therefore future studies should also analyse the practicability of the treatment process from the economic perspective 4 6 reuse application most of the studies related to the application of nf in the industrial effluent treatment reported that the treated water fulfilled the standard quality for internal reuse application such as for the manufacturing process in the case of reuse applications involving product fabrication limited data on the effect of recycled water or other recovered components from nf based treatments on the product quality has been reported such data is essential to explore the potential of reclaimed water or other by products for recycling and reuse within industries thus future studies can also consider this aspect of investigation moreover it shall be noted that little attention has been paid on the application of the reclaimed water via nf or integrated nf process for external reuse including irrigation purposes in the context of produced water treatment many governments have expressed interest in reusing produced water for purposes outside the internal industry due to the increasing global water demand 5 139 for irrigation application the effect of treated industrial wastewater on plant growth and soil quality must be investigated comprehensively in the future to provide supporting data that enable more reuse applications of treated industrial wastewater 4 7 large scale process the promising performance demonstrated by the integrated nf process in the lab scale study should be further studied in the context of pilot scale in this way a full assessment of the feasibility and viability of the water treatment process e g technical aspects cost and performance in industrial wastewater reclamation can be done the data will provide a more thorough understanding of the potential of integrated nf process for recycling and reuse moreover the development of predictive models for scaling up from laboratory scale to large scale application as well as cost assessment is helpful to explore the profitability of the integrated nf treatment in industrial operation 5 conclusions nf has drawn a lot of attention in industrial wastewater reclamation recycling reuse and resource recovery applications due to its capability to separate the divalent polyvalent ions from monovalent ions and small molecules in this review the application of nf within various industrial wastewater treatments for water recycling reuse and product recovery targets has been highlighted the nf treatment can be integrated with other membrane technologies or processes to mitigate the fouling prolong the membrane lifespan and enhance the membrane performance upon exposure to real industrial wastewater in most integrated processes nf has been commonly adopted as a post treatment step to polish the treated effluent quality up to the standard reuse criteria and recover other by products that can be recycled most of the studies found that nf is promising to remove a wide range of pollutants in various industries and thus capable to generate reusable water nevertheless less attention has been paid on the nf retentate or concentrate treatment more aspects associated with nf concentrate treatment long term membrane stability and fouling cost assessment membrane materials and design process configuration process scaling up and reuse application can be further explored in the future to promote the implementation of nf technology for water recycling reuse and resource recovery declaration of competing interest the authors

co ltd shanghai china 2 6 calculation of initial anammox and nitrifying activities during the precultivation the anammox bacteria would proliferate in ab with the injection of ammonium and nitrite therefore when anammox process had been the dominated process the anammox activities after precultivation would be far more than the initial activities to determine the initial anammox activities in ab the calculation methods can be expressed as follows 1 l 0 l t e at where l0 initial anammox activities mg nh4 n m2 d lt anammox activities after precultivation mg nh4 n m2 d a reported generation

of w1 and w2 are shown in table 3 cod and tp in influent of w1 reached as high as 642 136 and 5 13 1 22 mg l respectively while in w2 they were as low as 249 37 and 3 86 0 68 mg l during the survey in addition nh4 n and tn in influent of w1 were similar to that of w2 based on the results of effluent characteristics both wwtps had good removal efficiencies for most pollutants the average removal efficiencies of cod were 96 7 1 5 and 92 8 1 4 respectively and the average tn removal efficiencies were 82 2 1 1 and 81 3 1 2 the typical pollutants change along the process were illustrated in fig s3 3 2 microbial community analysis the main functional bacteria at phylum level in ab and as is presented in fig 1 a the microbial community in ab were significantly different from that in as containing more proteobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes bacteria at phylum level proteobacteria dominated in ab with the relative abundance of 24 63 in w1 and 28 85 in w2 this phylum has been previously recognized to include members capable of nitrification and denitrification the relative abundance of planctomycetes in ab was 1 97 in w1 and 2 82 in w2 respectively which were higher than that in as w1 0 70 w2 1 14 this phylum has been reported to include all known anammox bacteria 1 22 fig 1 b presents the main functional bacteria for nitrogen conversion at genus level for ab and as anammox bacteria of ca brocadia responsible for nitrogen removal was determined in ab with relative abundance of 0 95 0 21 and 0 71 0 14 respectively significantly higher than that in as regarding aob nitrosomonas like bacteria responsible for ammonium oxidation were detected in both ab and as with relatively low abundance as w1 0 11 ab w1 0 05 as w2 0 05 ab w2 0 01 in addition relatively abundant nitrospira responsible for nitrite oxidation as w1 0 77 ab w1 0 98 as w2 1 50 ab w2 0 63 a common genus of nob in the wastewater treatment process were detected in ab and as a comparison of anammox relative abundance or copy numbers with reported research is shown in table 4 compared with as a relatively high abundance of anammox was detected in ab which suggested that ab could provide a habitat for anammox bacteria the fish images fig 2 shows that anammox bacteria were uniformly distributed in ab where dissolved oxygen in the bulk could not reach through diffusion so that an anoxic microenvironment for anammox growth could be created besides anammox bacteria tended to aggregate in microcolony 3 3 activities of functional community the activities of anammox bacteria were investigated through precultivation before precultivation the ratio of removed nitrite to released ammonium endogenous denitrification of heterotrophic bacteria were 0 96 and 0 98 fig s4 respectively which suggested that endogenous heterotrophic denitrification was the dominated process after nearly 15 days anoxic precultivation for ab of w1 the ratio of produced nitrate to removed ammonium tended to be 0 06 and the removed nitrite to removed ammonium was 1 55 fig s5 a as for ab of w2 the ratio of removed nitrate to removed ammonium and removed nitrite to removed ammonium were 0 20 and 1 80 fig s5 b these results indicated that anammox process had been the leading process after precultivation rather than endogenous denitrification process based on the reported generation time 11 20 d 23 24 the initial anammox activities could be calculated the anammox and nitrification activities of as and ab were shown in fig 3 the estimated saa in ab of w1 and w2 were 5 98 1 32 mg nh4 n vss d 54 80 12 07 mg nh4 n m2 d and 1 36 0 25 mg nh4 n vss d 19 18 3 52 mg nh4 n m2 d the saoa and snoa in ab were determined to be 75 84 6 96 mg nh4 n gvss d 695 45 63 82 mg nh4 n m2 d and 111 60 10 80 mg no2 n gvss d 1023 37 99 04 mg no2 n m2 d for w1 which was nearly the same as those in as the saoa and snoa in ab were 31 44 3 60 mg nh4 n gvss d 444 88 50 94 mg nh4 n m2 d and 40 32 7 44 mg no2 n gvss d 570 53 105 28 mg no2 n m2 d for w2 which were much less than those in as for nitrifying activities of w2 the saoa and snoa in ab were significantly lower than that in as which differed greatly from w1 one possible explanation for this phenomenon was the difference in ammonium concentration in influent of carrier zone table s1 the influent ammonium concentration was above 5 mg l in w1 and below 2 mg l in w2 respectively which resulted in the substrates limitation for nitrifying bacteria in w2 3 4 contribution to nitrogen removal by carrier zone the tn loss in in carries zone and the whole process of w1 and w2 were presented in table 5 based on these results the contribution to nitrogen removal in carrier zone were 2 49 0 87 w1 and 2 89 2 06 w2 through mass balance calculation it was concluded that the contribution to nitrogen removal in carrier zone could be ignored and traditional nitrification denitrification still was the dominated process in these two wwtps according to the measured anammox activities the theoretical maximum nitrogen removal rate could be computed as follows 6 l 2 l 0 b c τ 1000 where l is the tn removal rate by anammox on the ab mg l d l 0 is the initial anammox activity mg m2 d b is filling ratio of carrier c is the specific surface area of carrier m2 m3 τ is the temperature correction factor 25 74 15 c 25 the maximum theoretical nitrogen removal rate through anammox process estimated to be 4 23 mg n l d in w1 and 1 23 mg n l d in w2 notably the actual averaged nitrogen removal rate in carrier zone were 3 67 mg n l d and 1 00 mg n l d respectively which were slightly smaller than the theoretical values considering the cell synthesis and denitrification in carrier zone the contribution to nitrogen removal by anammox would be much lower 3 5 possible mechanism of anammox reaction in the ab the enrichment of anammox bacteria in wwtps treating low strength ammonium wastewater is difficult although pn and partial denitrification pd process both could produce the nitrite for anammox growth considering that the available cod in carrier zone were insufficient and then pd process would be weakened one possible pathway for the occurrence of anammox was the nitrite production from ammonium oxidation in aerobic zone and then fed to anammox bacteria in ab the ammonium to nitrite process could be easily performed by aob in both as and ab as for the produced nitrite which would be split into two parts one was further oxidized into nitrate by nob the other is converted to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria the more nitrite consumed by anammox the more anammox bacteria enriched in carrier zone the do concentration could reach as high as 3 4 mg l and the influent ammonium concentration was as low as 5 mg l considering the influence of the do inhibition for anammox bacteria 2 and nitrite to nitrate process by nob at high do concentration 26 27 the nitrite fed to anammox was limited for optimization of anammox contribute to nitrogen removal in wwtps the condition of operating should be adjusted to verify the performance of nitrogen removal under optimization a mbbr seeded with ab taken from w2 was established with 50 mg l influent ammonium the working volume of the reactor was 5 l in which 150 pieces of carriers were filled filling rate 30 air was supplied by an air pump to maintain the do concentration of 0 47 0 18 mg l the temperature was maintained at 20 25 c and the ph was controlled at a constant of 7 5 0 5 through adding sodium bicarbonate the results showed that anammox activities increased to 211 50 mg nh4 n m2 d after operation of 50 d with nitrite produced by aob fig s6 which indicated that partial nitritation process might play a crucial role in the metabolism of anammox but need further research to describe the phenomena a concept model for anammox bacteria growing in the ab is constructed fig 4 in the ab bacteria are multiply layered based on their acceptability to obtain the substrates and the environment aerobic bacteria like aob and nob would be distributed in the surface of the ab to acquire substrates especially oxygen whereas anammox bacteria could accumulate in the bottom of the ab an outer rim was created to protect anoxic or anaerobic bacteria far away from oxygen inhibition with this special structure ammonium was oxidized into nitrite by aob at aerobic zone of the ab and the produced nitrite could be used by nob and anammox except for anoxic condition for anammox growth the long srt low affinity for substrates and low decay coefficient also favor the growth of anammox bacteria the aerobic carrier with long srt improve the capacity of biomass retention which effectively avoid anammox loss in ab the low affinities of anammox bacteria for ammonium and nitrite 2 would ensure that anammox bacteria have apparent advantage to compete with nob for nitrite in addition the low decay coefficient may have contributed anammox bacteria enrichment in the ab as reported by scaglione et al 28 the decay coefficient of anammox bacteria was 0 0048 d 1 at 35 c which was far lower than that of aob 0 04 d 1 at 30 c and nob 0 06 d 1 at 30 c 29 once the anammox bacteria proliferate which would accumulate and exist in the ab 3 6 potential engineering implications and further studies for the treatment of municipal wastewater by mbbr most previous studies have focused on the ab because of its advanced in high biomass content especially at the improvement of nitrification ability due to the high do concentration in aerobic zone it is hypothesized that anammox could not exist in the ab this study verified the existence of anammox in ab through microbial community and microbial activities which suggested that the ab could have great potential for enhanced nitrogen removal however more studies on possible mechanism should be considered including nitrite source for anammox bacteria the microbial competition and the environmental factors in the biosystem based on such results some upgrading transformations could be necessary to increase the contribution of nitrogen removal by anammox the possible upgrading transformation are as follows 1 decreasing aeration in the carrier zone as reported by strous et al 30 anammox bacteria would be inhibited by oxygen especially in carrier zone where do concentration could reach as high as 3 4 mg l to enhance anammox nitrogen removal in carrier zone more nitrite should be provided for anammox process from the conversion of nitrite it is generally associated with two different pathways one is partial nitrification ammonium to nitrite and the other is reduction of nitrate nitrate to nitrite in pn process the repression of nob has been recognized as one of the main challenges to repress nob over aob during long term operation many strategies included applying fa and fna inhibition keeping a low do concentration have been proposed due to the low fa concentration in raw water the low do concentration was regarded as the main selection factor as for pd process it prefers anoxic condition rather than aerobic condition 31 32 thereafter to improve the contribution to nitrogen removal by anammox process the do concentration in carrier zone should be controlled within a relative low level 2 increasing the filling ratio of carrier in the aerobic area due to the low volume ratio of carrier zone to the total aerobic zone w1 17 70 w2 22 00 the contribution to nitrogen removal could be neglected however with the increasing volume ratio in entire operating system a larger surface area for microbial colonization would be provided which would favor the accumulation of anammox bacteria in ab and then enhance nitrogen removal in these two wwtps 3 introducing partial raw wastewater into the carrier zone with variation of temperature the ammonium concentration in the aerobic zone appears seasonal changes in winter the nitrification activities are weak the dominant nitrogen substance in effluent is ammonium and the concentration of nitrate is low ammonium concentration 1 4 mg l nitrate concentration 0 4 mg l in summer with the increase of nitrification activities the nitrate begins to be the dominant nitrogen substance nitrate concentration 7 11 mg l ammonium concentration 0 1 mg l to satisfy the demands for pn or pd in ab the introduction of raw water into carrier zone is necessary introducing pretreated raw water into the zone has two advantages one is to supplement the shortage of ammonium in summer and the other is to supplement organic carbon for the reduction of nitrate introducing raw water not only promote the growth of anammox but also improve the effectiveness of carbon utilization increasing the removal efficiency of contaminants 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that ab could provide a habitat for anammox bacterial survival in wwtps high throughput sequencing results showed that anammox bacteria of ca brocadia with relative abundance of 0 95 0 21 in w1 and 0 71 0 14 in w2 were determined and the anammox activities measured to be 5 98 1 32 mg nh4 n gvss d in w1 and 1 36 0 25 mg nh4 n gvss d in w2 respectively enhanced batch test demonstrated that partial nitritation process might play an important role in anammox enrichment but need further research overall this study suggested that aerobic biofilm might be a candidate to enhance nitrogen

co ltd shanghai china 2 6 calculation of initial anammox and nitrifying activities during the precultivation the anammox bacteria would proliferate in ab with the injection of ammonium and nitrite therefore when anammox process had been the dominated process the anammox activities after precultivation would be far more than the initial activities to determine the initial anammox activities in ab the calculation methods can be expressed as follows 1 l 0 l t e at where l0 initial anammox activities mg nh4 n m2 d lt anammox activities after precultivation mg nh4 n m2 d a reported generation

of w1 and w2 are shown in table 3 cod and tp in influent of w1 reached as high as 642 136 and 5 13 1 22 mg l respectively while in w2 they were as low as 249 37 and 3 86 0 68 mg l during the survey in addition nh4 n and tn in influent of w1 were similar to that of w2 based on the results of effluent characteristics both wwtps had good removal efficiencies for most pollutants the average removal efficiencies of cod were 96 7 1 5 and 92 8 1 4 respectively and the average tn removal efficiencies were 82 2 1 1 and 81 3 1 2 the typical pollutants change along the process were illustrated in fig s3 3 2 microbial community analysis the main functional bacteria at phylum level in ab and as is presented in fig 1 a the microbial community in ab were significantly different from that in as containing more proteobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes bacteria at phylum level proteobacteria dominated in ab with the relative abundance of 24 63 in w1 and 28 85 in w2 this phylum has been previously recognized to include members capable of nitrification and denitrification the relative abundance of planctomycetes in ab was 1 97 in w1 and 2 82 in w2 respectively which were higher than that in as w1 0 70 w2 1 14 this phylum has been reported to include all known anammox bacteria 1 22 fig 1 b presents the main functional bacteria for nitrogen conversion at genus level for ab and as anammox bacteria of ca brocadia responsible for nitrogen removal was determined in ab with relative abundance of 0 95 0 21 and 0 71 0 14 respectively significantly higher than that in as regarding aob nitrosomonas like bacteria responsible for ammonium oxidation were detected in both ab and as with relatively low abundance as w1 0 11 ab w1 0 05 as w2 0 05 ab w2 0 01 in addition relatively abundant nitrospira responsible for nitrite oxidation as w1 0 77 ab w1 0 98 as w2 1 50 ab w2 0 63 a common genus of nob in the wastewater treatment process were detected in ab and as a comparison of anammox relative abundance or copy numbers with reported research is shown in table 4 compared with as a relatively high abundance of anammox was detected in ab which suggested that ab could provide a habitat for anammox bacteria the fish images fig 2 shows that anammox bacteria were uniformly distributed in ab where dissolved oxygen in the bulk could not reach through diffusion so that an anoxic microenvironment for anammox growth could be created besides anammox bacteria tended to aggregate in microcolony 3 3 activities of functional community the activities of anammox bacteria were investigated through precultivation before precultivation the ratio of removed nitrite to released ammonium endogenous denitrification of heterotrophic bacteria were 0 96 and 0 98 fig s4 respectively which suggested that endogenous heterotrophic denitrification was the dominated process after nearly 15 days anoxic precultivation for ab of w1 the ratio of produced nitrate to removed ammonium tended to be 0 06 and the removed nitrite to removed ammonium was 1 55 fig s5 a as for ab of w2 the ratio of removed nitrate to removed ammonium and removed nitrite to removed ammonium were 0 20 and 1 80 fig s5 b these results indicated that anammox process had been the leading process after precultivation rather than endogenous denitrification process based on the reported generation time 11 20 d 23 24 the initial anammox activities could be calculated the anammox and nitrification activities of as and ab were shown in fig 3 the estimated saa in ab of w1 and w2 were 5 98 1 32 mg nh4 n vss d 54 80 12 07 mg nh4 n m2 d and 1 36 0 25 mg nh4 n vss d 19 18 3 52 mg nh4 n m2 d the saoa and snoa in ab were determined to be 75 84 6 96 mg nh4 n gvss d 695 45 63 82 mg nh4 n m2 d and 111 60 10 80 mg no2 n gvss d 1023 37 99 04 mg no2 n m2 d for w1 which was nearly the same as those in as the saoa and snoa in ab were 31 44 3 60 mg nh4 n gvss d 444 88 50 94 mg nh4 n m2 d and 40 32 7 44 mg no2 n gvss d 570 53 105 28 mg no2 n m2 d for w2 which were much less than those in as for nitrifying activities of w2 the saoa and snoa in ab were significantly lower than that in as which differed greatly from w1 one possible explanation for this phenomenon was the difference in ammonium concentration in influent of carrier zone table s1 the influent ammonium concentration was above 5 mg l in w1 and below 2 mg l in w2 respectively which resulted in the substrates limitation for nitrifying bacteria in w2 3 4 contribution to nitrogen removal by carrier zone the tn loss in in carries zone and the whole process of w1 and w2 were presented in table 5 based on these results the contribution to nitrogen removal in carrier zone were 2 49 0 87 w1 and 2 89 2 06 w2 through mass balance calculation it was concluded that the contribution to nitrogen removal in carrier zone could be ignored and traditional nitrification denitrification still was the dominated process in these two wwtps according to the measured anammox activities the theoretical maximum nitrogen removal rate could be computed as follows 6 l 2 l 0 b c τ 1000 where l is the tn removal rate by anammox on the ab mg l d l 0 is the initial anammox activity mg m2 d b is filling ratio of carrier c is the specific surface area of carrier m2 m3 τ is the temperature correction factor 25 74 15 c 25 the maximum theoretical nitrogen removal rate through anammox process estimated to be 4 23 mg n l d in w1 and 1 23 mg n l d in w2 notably the actual averaged nitrogen removal rate in carrier zone were 3 67 mg n l d and 1 00 mg n l d respectively which were slightly smaller than the theoretical values considering the cell synthesis and denitrification in carrier zone the contribution to nitrogen removal by anammox would be much lower 3 5 possible mechanism of anammox reaction in the ab the enrichment of anammox bacteria in wwtps treating low strength ammonium wastewater is difficult although pn and partial denitrification pd process both could produce the nitrite for anammox growth considering that the available cod in carrier zone were insufficient and then pd process would be weakened one possible pathway for the occurrence of anammox was the nitrite production from ammonium oxidation in aerobic zone and then fed to anammox bacteria in ab the ammonium to nitrite process could be easily performed by aob in both as and ab as for the produced nitrite which would be split into two parts one was further oxidized into nitrate by nob the other is converted to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria the more nitrite consumed by anammox the more anammox bacteria enriched in carrier zone the do concentration could reach as high as 3 4 mg l and the influent ammonium concentration was as low as 5 mg l considering the influence of the do inhibition for anammox bacteria 2 and nitrite to nitrate process by nob at high do concentration 26 27 the nitrite fed to anammox was limited for optimization of anammox contribute to nitrogen removal in wwtps the condition of operating should be adjusted to verify the performance of nitrogen removal under optimization a mbbr seeded with ab taken from w2 was established with 50 mg l influent ammonium the working volume of the reactor was 5 l in which 150 pieces of carriers were filled filling rate 30 air was supplied by an air pump to maintain the do concentration of 0 47 0 18 mg l the temperature was maintained at 20 25 c and the ph was controlled at a constant of 7 5 0 5 through adding sodium bicarbonate the results showed that anammox activities increased to 211 50 mg nh4 n m2 d after operation of 50 d with nitrite produced by aob fig s6 which indicated that partial nitritation process might play a crucial role in the metabolism of anammox but need further research to describe the phenomena a concept model for anammox bacteria growing in the ab is constructed fig 4 in the ab bacteria are multiply layered based on their acceptability to obtain the substrates and the environment aerobic bacteria like aob and nob would be distributed in the surface of the ab to acquire substrates especially oxygen whereas anammox bacteria could accumulate in the bottom of the ab an outer rim was created to protect anoxic or anaerobic bacteria far away from oxygen inhibition with this special structure ammonium was oxidized into nitrite by aob at aerobic zone of the ab and the produced nitrite could be used by nob and anammox except for anoxic condition for anammox growth the long srt low affinity for substrates and low decay coefficient also favor the growth of anammox bacteria the aerobic carrier with long srt improve the capacity of biomass retention which effectively avoid anammox loss in ab the low affinities of anammox bacteria for ammonium and nitrite 2 would ensure that anammox bacteria have apparent advantage to compete with nob for nitrite in addition the low decay coefficient may have contributed anammox bacteria enrichment in the ab as reported by scaglione et al 28 the decay coefficient of anammox bacteria was 0 0048 d 1 at 35 c which was far lower than that of aob 0 04 d 1 at 30 c and nob 0 06 d 1 at 30 c 29 once the anammox bacteria proliferate which would accumulate and exist in the ab 3 6 potential engineering implications and further studies for the treatment of municipal wastewater by mbbr most previous studies have focused on the ab because of its advanced in high biomass content especially at the improvement of nitrification ability due to the high do concentration in aerobic zone it is hypothesized that anammox could not exist in the ab this study verified the existence of anammox in ab through microbial community and microbial activities which suggested that the ab could have great potential for enhanced nitrogen removal however more studies on possible mechanism should be considered including nitrite source for anammox bacteria the microbial competition and the environmental factors in the biosystem based on such results some upgrading transformations could be necessary to increase the contribution of nitrogen removal by anammox the possible upgrading transformation are as follows 1 decreasing aeration in the carrier zone as reported by strous et al 30 anammox bacteria would be inhibited by oxygen especially in carrier zone where do concentration could reach as high as 3 4 mg l to enhance anammox nitrogen removal in carrier zone more nitrite should be provided for anammox process from the conversion of nitrite it is generally associated with two different pathways one is partial nitrification ammonium to nitrite and the other is reduction of nitrate nitrate to nitrite in pn process the repression of nob has been recognized as one of the main challenges to repress nob over aob during long term operation many strategies included applying fa and fna inhibition keeping a low do concentration have been proposed due to the low fa concentration in raw water the low do concentration was regarded as the main selection factor as for pd process it prefers anoxic condition rather than aerobic condition 31 32 thereafter to improve the contribution to nitrogen removal by anammox process the do concentration in carrier zone should be controlled within a relative low level 2 increasing the filling ratio of carrier in the aerobic area due to the low volume ratio of carrier zone to the total aerobic zone w1 17 70 w2 22 00 the contribution to nitrogen removal could be neglected however with the increasing volume ratio in entire operating system a larger surface area for microbial colonization would be provided which would favor the accumulation of anammox bacteria in ab and then enhance nitrogen removal in these two wwtps 3 introducing partial raw wastewater into the carrier zone with variation of temperature the ammonium concentration in the aerobic zone appears seasonal changes in winter the nitrification activities are weak the dominant nitrogen substance in effluent is ammonium and the concentration of nitrate is low ammonium concentration 1 4 mg l nitrate concentration 0 4 mg l in summer with the increase of nitrification activities the nitrate begins to be the dominant nitrogen substance nitrate concentration 7 11 mg l ammonium concentration 0 1 mg l to satisfy the demands for pn or pd in ab the introduction of raw water into carrier zone is necessary introducing pretreated raw water into the zone has two advantages one is to supplement the shortage of ammonium in summer and the other is to supplement organic carbon for the reduction of nitrate introducing raw water not only promote the growth of anammox but also improve the effectiveness of carbon utilization increasing the removal efficiency of contaminants 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that ab could provide a habitat for anammox bacterial survival in wwtps high throughput sequencing results showed that anammox bacteria of ca brocadia with relative abundance of 0 95 0 21 in w1 and 0 71 0 14 in w2 were determined and the anammox activities measured to be 5 98 1 32 mg nh4 n gvss d in w1 and 1 36 0 25 mg nh4 n gvss d in w2 respectively enhanced batch test demonstrated that partial nitritation process might play an important role in anammox enrichment but need further research overall this study suggested that aerobic biofilm might be a candidate to enhance nitrogen

13192,currently the serious problem of contamination by antibiotics is a reality the scientific evidence of its negative effects on the aquatic environment and human health are numerous and unquestionable therefore it is essential to intensify research into effective and efficient processes for removing antibiotics from the aquatic environment in this paper on the one hand a review of the concentrations detected in all types of waters of some antibiotics is developed in concrete of ciprofloxacin cip erythromycin ery levofloxacin lev metronidazole met norfloxacin nor ofloxacin ofl

some of the main methods to eliminate antibiotics from the aquatic environment are defined and classified the methods are compared indicating their advantages and disadvantages combined processes are also mentioned as a good alternative finally the removal percentages achieved by each method in some representative publications are detailed in this regard it can be said that the methods with the best elimination percentages range 80 100 are biological methods biological aerated filter anaerobic digestion biological activated carbon filter and membrane technology nanofiltration reverse osmosis

antibiotics is known to have existed since the ancient egypt and in the middle age and that there were numerous contributions from different authors since the 19th century alexander fleming can be pointed out as an important figure in the invention of them he was a british scientist who in 1928 accidentally discovered in one of his forgotten colonies of staphylococcus aureus that a fungus penicillium notatum inhibited its growth the concerning molecule was purified and called penicillin 1 in the modern medicine the word antibiotic initially referred to any agent with biological activity against living organisms while now it alludes to substances with antibacterial antifungal or antiparasitic activity one of the possible modern definitions pretends to qualify antibiotics as chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit or eliminate the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria fungi or protozoa 2 there are several different kinds of antibiotics and they can be classified based on their chemical structure action mechanism action spectrum and the route of administration out of these classifications the most popular one is their mechanism of action and based on it the most common groups are β lactams sulfonamides monobactams carbapenems aminoglycosides glycopeptides lincomycin macrolides polypeptides polyenes rifamycin tetracyclines chloramphenicol quinolones and fluoroquinolones 3 another way is to divide them into the following groups beta lactams that include cephalosporins penicillin monobactams carbapenems macrolides lincosamines tetracyclines aminoglycosides amphenicols peptides including polypeptides glucopeptides lipopeptides polymyxins oxazolidinones nitro derivatives fusidanos phosphonates pleuromulins quinolones sulfonamides diaminopyridines 4 in fig 1 the diagram explains through the human food chain the connection between the use of antibiotics and human health it starts with the normal intake of antibiotics followed by the contamination of food and drinking water and finally leading to infections by drug resistant bacteria which are more difficult to treat 5 there are other ways to explain the entry routes of antibiotics to the environment that have an impact on human health we can classify them in two groups antibiotics used in human medicine and the antibiotics used in veterinary medicine one of the gateways of contamination of waters by human antibiotics is the following humans take antibiotics and then excrete them the excretions reach the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and after their treatment they generate biosolids and effluent discharges that cause pollution of the soil and the aquatic environment surface toilet and groundwater moreover in veterinary medicine the antibiotics are given to livestock and then excreted excretions generate manure storage tanks and lagoons that cause contamination of the soil and the aquatic environment surface water and groundwater within this section an especially representative case that directly causes pollution of the aquatic environment surface toilet and groundwater is the use of antibiotics in aquaculture 6 there are also unconventional pathways of contamination of environment for example due to the lack of recycling of expired drugs the recycling of medicines can be a possibility against this route of entry for this it is necessary to study different methodologies to recycle active drugs from expired pharmaceutical products studies admit that when a drug expires it can contain 90 or even more of the active pharmaceutical ingredients therefore suitable chromatographic methods and analytical techniques could be adopted for the isolation and eventual quantification of the active ingredients in order to successfully recycle them into useful products this approach would be ecological 7 in all cases the contamination of the soil and the aquatic environment surface water and groundwater leads to direct and indirect routes that then get to human beings directly because the contaminated waters access the water treatment plant wtp where the drinking water comes from indirectly because the contaminated waters are used for irrigation which drives to the contamination of crops that humans and livestock animals then eat these agents are then discharged into the sea contaminating the fish we eat this water is also used as drinking water for livestock animals which humans then eat too 6 in addition to the human consumption of antibiotics there are many other anthropogenic activities such as the use of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture and non human applications of antibiotics and waste disposal which generate large environmental resistance reserves 8 and virulence genes with their respective organisms that host them 9 multiple genetic and genomic studies of wastewater treatment plants have shown that these are important deposits of resistant genes and organisms 10 11 frequently these genes are transported as genomic islands in transmissible plasmids and represent sources of resistance 12 the main entry routes of pharmaceutical residues including antibiotics into the aquatic environment are excretions after use poor disposal of unused medicines and the waste generated after their production from the routes of entry they arrive to the wwtp 13 from an environmental point of view the incorporation of antibiotics metabolites and antibiotic resistance genes into the natural environment is of great concern studies have shown that contaminants based on antibiotic residues can influence microbial populations through bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects leading to the disappearance of key microbial groups associated with ecological activities or affecting their physiological functions the detection monitoring and characterization of these components in the aquatic environment are important to evaluate their toxic teratogenic and mutagenic effects in ecosystems 14 the problem is that these wwtp are not prepared to eliminate these type of waste products in this regard there are studies whose experimental results indicate the limitations of primary treatment methods when it comes to breaking down pharmaceutical products 15 all the above suggests the need of new treatments focused on the removal of antibiotics from the different waters regarding the high consumption of antibiotics it is important to underline that in europe according to data from fedesa in 1997 approximately 10 000 t year of antibiotics were consumed of which half were used in medicine and the other half in animal health 16 in spain the consumption of antibiotics has fallen but remains high in 1985 the overall consumption of antibiotics was 21 9 dhd doses defined by 1000 habitants and day while in 2000 it was 20 4 dhd 17 statistics on the use of anti infective for systemic use in the primary care sector in europe in 2017 show that the consumption measured in dhd in central southern europe ranges between 19 317 and 32 148 it can be classified into three blocks in the first range 19 317 23 594 there are countries such as italy in the second range 23 594 27 871 we find countries such as spain or france in the third range 27 871 32 148 we find countries such as greece or romania on the lower end in northern europe in countries such as england sweden norway denmark or germany consumption is fixed in the range 10 763 19 317 18 the objectives of this bibliographic review are summarized in on the one hand to determine the concentrations of a series of high consumption antibiotics in developed countries as well as the analytical techniques used on the other hand classify and define some of the main antibiotic elimination processes including single and combined finally determine for the antibiotics mentioned the percentages of elimination of some of the main previous processes compare and discuss these percentages are also included 2 occurrence in water regarding analysis techniques it begins by showing in table 1 the evolution that analysis techniques have followed in the last 50 years determination of pharmaceuticals in different water samples can be performed by various chromatographic techniques including high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet hplc uv 19 high performance liquid chromatography diode array detection hplc dad 20 21 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms 22 24 and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 25 26 currently due to their high sensitivity and selectivity methods based on mass spectrometry are the most applied approach to determine sulfonamides residues at low concentrations mgkg 1 or mg kg 1 within methods the use of liquid chromatography electrospray quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry hplc esi qqlit ms ms permits analysis with high specificity and adequate limits of detection 27 32 high performance liquid chromatography hplc is the most common method used for separation and determination of these compounds because most pharmaceuticals are non volatile 33 as the residue of pharmaceutical compounds is usually present at very low concentrations in the environmental water a sample preparation and pre concentration step are necessary before analysis 34 35 several procedures have been reported for the pre concentration of pharmaceuticals from water matrices including solid phase extraction spe 22 36 liquid liquid extraction lle 37 quick easy cheap effective rugged safe quechers method 38 magnetic solid phase extraction mspe 39 hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction hflpm 40 and salting out assisted liquid liquid extraction for non steroid anti inflammatory drugs nsaids 41 46 among those commonly used methods solid phase extraction spe was the most extensively used technique 47 49 as a conclusion to say that the main technique of analysis to detect these concentrations is liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 50 51 previously the samples must be treated to preconcentrate them using solid phase extraction spe 30 52 regarding antibiotics eight types were selected this selection is due to the search for amply spectrum antibiotics under the reasoning that this should lead to wide use and therefore large discharge to the aquatic environment in addition we learned from the spanish agency for medicines and health products that for example fluoroquinolones have increased their use in spain by 26 in 12 years between 1997 and 2009 the selection includes quinolones ciprofloxacin levofloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin were chosen because they are antibiotics that are used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of urinary respiratory genital gastrointestinal skin bone and joint bacterial infections nitroimidazoles metronidazole and trimethoprim were selected because they are antimicrobials with bactericidal action that present a moderately broad antibacterial spectrum they are used in infections of the urinary tract ears lungs intestines and liver macrolides erythromycin are used to treat infections caused by bacteria in the respiratory and urinary tracts as well as ear intestinal gynecological dermatological and sexually transmitted infections sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic that combined with the trimethoprim is used to treat multiple types of bacterial infections ear urinary tract pneumonias and intestinal after reviewing the bibliography and limiting the study to the analysis of these eight types of antibiotics whose descriptions are shown in table 2 we will highlight part of the most representative information in each case authors location water source maximum concentrations detected in ng l see table 3 from the total of tests cited in table 3 two conclusions can be drawn on the one hand it should be noted that the antibiotics lev smx and tmp have the highest concentrations while met is the one with the least as can be seen in fig 2 on the other hand regarding the percentage of times that each antibiotic was studied it can be seen in fig 3 that the antibiotics smx and tmp are detected in more than 80 of the studies next are cip ery nor and ofl with percentages between 30 and 50 finally the least detected is lev which does not reach 5 3 removal 3 1 processes some of the single treatment processes for the elimination of emerging pollutants in general and antibiotics for different types of water can be grouped into six large blocks and each in turn is divided into different elimination techniques as shown in fig 4 first are the chemical processes where the coagulation flocculation method cf is the most prominent they can be applied at different stages of water treatment pretreatment of industrial effluents before entering municipal sewers 95 primary treatment of urban wastewater 96 tertiary urban wastewater treatment 97 drinking water treatment plants interesting studies have been published regarding the detection of pharmacological products in drinking water plants 98 as well as during the primary treatment of municipal wastewater 99 regarding the removal of antibiotics in wastewater there are also published paper 100 second group are adsorption highlighting activated carbon it is a promising advanced treatment process that can remove many of the pharmacological products that are usually detected in wastewater 101 there are studies that include the elimination of antibiotics in wastewater and hospital wastewater both using the powdered activated carbon pac 102 and granular activated carbon gac techniques 103 another adsorption option is to use cellulose membranes with this method in a study with cip a 27 elimination was obtained 104 there are also studies that used zeolites for the adsorption of ciprofloxacin with this method elimination percentages between 90 and 97 have been obtained these are shown to be promising for future applications for the disposal of this drug in wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry as well as other drugs with similar structural characteristics 105 third are physicochemical aops which include electrochemical oxidation eo technology that produces strong oxidants to degrade pollutants through electrode reactions 106 the ozonation process op which in turn has two mechanisms for ozone based antibiotic degradation the direct oxidation of ozone and indirect oxidation through the generation of free radicals 107 the fenton process fp in this process the reagents h2o2 and fe2 react with each other to generate oh radicals which then oxidize and break down the antibiotics 108 ultraviolet rays uv h2o2 in this method h2o2 decomposes to produce oh with uv irradiation 109 a good alternative is the aops based on ultraviolet rays uv h2o2 but its high costs derived mainly from the need for upstream pretreatment and downstream h2o2 cooling are a significant inconvenient 110 on the other hand ozone is presented as a very interesting alternative because its efficiency is like the previous one but with lower costs due to lower chemical and energy requirements 111 antibiotic elimination studies using this process have been reviewed all of them in wastewater and commonly in pilot plants but also in municipal treatment plants 110 112 fourth are the membrane technology in this process pollutants are intercepted as the wastewater passes through small pores in the membrane they can be divided into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in this regard it should be noted that membrane filtration technologies have been tested on a real scale in pilot plants and at the laboratory level to remove pharmaceutical products including antibiotics from different types of waters 58 113 118 fifth are biological treatments which can be classified as aerobic anaerobic and combined aerobic and anaerobic methods the main aerobic method is the biological aerated filter system baf this is a new type of process used for wastewater treatment that combines oxidation and filtration by biological contact 119 includes a solid phase to support microbial growth a liquid phase to submerge the solid material and a gas phase for air input 120 the main anaerobic methods are the anaerobic digestion ad upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic filter af and anaerobic baffled reactor abr processes in concrete stand out ad that includes four stages hydrolysis acidification hydrogen production and acetic acid and methane production 121 the problem you have is that the treated sewage and sludge residue could still cause damage to the surrounding environment 122 the main combined aerobic and anaerobic methods are the sequencing batch reactor sbr and the membrane bioreactor mbr processes the sbr is based on one or more aeration reaction tanks and the sewage enters the tank in batches this reactor operates in five sequences influent feeding anoxic phase aerobic phase sludge settling and effluent discharge 123 the mbr processes which combines modern membrane separation technology and biological technology its advantages are long sludge retention time flexible operation low sludge production and high nitrification performance its disadvantages are its high energy consumption and operating costs 124 highlight that they can retain more than 5 and 2 log units of bacteria and viruses respectively pilot studies have been developed in hospital wastewater that demonstrate the efficacy of mbr for some pharmacological products even eliminating more than 95 of them 125 127 within the biological ones there are also the attached growth treatment and the suspended growth treatment in the attached growth treatment there are the processes biological activated carbon filter bac this process consists of a fixed bed of granular activated carbon that supports the growth of bacteria attached to its surface they have been used for years to treat drinking water demonstrating their effectiveness in eliminating natural organic matter 128 they can be considered an interesting alternative on the one hand because biofiltration systems in general tend to be robust simple to build and require little energy 129 on the other hand because bac filtration costs can be expected to be in the same range as sand filtration 130 sixth are constructed wetlands it is an artificial wastewater treatment ecosystem which uses the combined action of soil plants and microorganisms to treat wastewater entering the wetland wastewater purification is achieved by filtration adsorption co precipitation ion exchange plant adsorption and microbial decomposition 131 this treatment can be classified as free water surface flow constructed wetlands fws cws horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hsf cws and vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands vsf cws according to the direction of water flow 106 3 1 1 comparative swot analysis in this section a comparison of some the antibiotic removal processes from water wastewater is made for this the selected technique is swot analysis because it is a simple tool for strategic analysis that is very widespread in decision making it has been decided to carry out a swot analysis for each elimination method to decide which techniques should be used according to the case and the intended objective unlabelled table 3 1 2 removal percentage tests unfortunately there is no specific type of treatment that manages to eliminate several micropollutants due to their different properties to date there are no reliable processes that allow the elimination of both bulk substances and micropollutants 72 a bibliographic review was carried out including some of the main studies that have been performed for the elimination of antibiotics from different types of water see table 4 in each case it is specified the treatment used the method used if appropriate the water source analyzed the most representative specifications of the test the percentage of elimination obtained and finally the reference of the study from the data expressed in the table 4 it can be concluded that there are multiple techniques that achieve excellent elimination percentages 90 therefore it appears that the decision to use one or the other method will depend on the facilities already in place at the site in question in section 4 we will proceed to discuss the results obtained in table 4 3 2 combined processes currently many combined processes are used to remove all types of emerging pollutants including antibiotics from waters some of the most representative are listed below first nanofiltration combined with ozone based advanced oxidation processes in wastewater in a study on the elimination of antibiotics in a wastewater treatment plant in china uv254 photolysis ozonation and uv o3 processes were used to treat the nanofiltration concentrate the conclusions were on the one hand nanofiltration efficiently removed antibiotics from the effluent on the other hand uv254 photolysis was not effective in degrading antibiotics lastly the uv o3 process was able to further remove the antibiotics in the nanofiltration concentrate effectively in addition the synergistic effect between o3 and uv in the degradation of antibiotics is observed results show high antibiotic rejections 98 in all sets of experiments thus zero discharge of micropollutants from wwtps is possible through the proposed scheme in the study 139 second in a important study of the processes for removing antibiotics from rearing wastewater combined treatments were analyzed to improve removal efficiency this study concludes that the combined treatments show a high efficiency of elimination of antibiotics they have broad prospects for development and application in the treatment of breeding wastewater 106 this paper quotes some important authors in this sense ben et al studied on degradation of antibiotics in swine wastewater using a combined biological fenton process in this method the sbr was used to perform the biological treatment and then the fenton process was used for further treatment the final removal rates of macrolides and sulfonamide were as high as 99 and 92 97 respectively therefore the integration of an aop and a biological method can effectively remove antibiotics from breeding wastewater 140 qian et al conducted a study in which swine wastewater was pretreated using an up flow anaerobic sludge layer and sbr process and then the wastewater was treated with the fenton process to remove antibiotics the average antibiotic removal efficiency was 74 141 han et al showed that the antibiotic removal rate was as high as 92 when the sbr and ad methods were combined to treat swine wastewater 142 in addition promising techniques using microalgae or with biofuel cells driven by microalgae bacteria have also been studied 143 third z al qodah et al has published a series of very interesting articles on combined processes that include electrocoagulation a first paper on the performance of electrocoagulation assisted biological treatment processes determines that the electrocoagulation process is simple cost effective and efficient when used as a pretreatment prior to biological processes advantages are the elimination of toxic materials that could inhibit biocatalysts in the biological treatment stage the reduction of the high organic load and the reduction of membrane fouling in mbr finally he proposes increasing research and expresses the possibility of expanding its use to an industrial treatment scale 144 a second paper is a review on combined electrocoagulation processes as a novel approach for enhanced pollutants removal including the combination of electrocoagulation with chemical coagulation adsorption magnetic separation and reverse osmosis in this review the author detects the following problems that are reproduced in many investigations on the one hand in most of the studies carried out synthetic wastewater was used instead of real samples consequently the production results may not be representative of the real case systems on the other hand no attempt has been cited to increase adsorption chemical coagulation magnetic field and reverse osmosis assisted electrocoagulation systems finally very few studies have considered the application of kinetic models to predict these combined systems in addition it proposes using sustainable energy resources to cover the electrical energy required by electrocoagulation processes and thus reduce operating costs he also expresses that more attempts must be made in search of more sustainable electrodes apart from fe and al 145 in a third paper the author reviews the main results obtained from studies on the performance of biological treatment combined with electrocoagulation as a post treatment process the most representative conclusion is the demonstration that electrocoagulation is an efficient and promising post treatment process for biological treatment processes especially for anaerobically treated effluents that need more chemical oxygen demand and removal of color besides the author insists on the need for additional studies that combine biological treatment and electrocoagulation as a post treatment process and to compare them to select the most profitable 146 finally the author cites some interesting studies regarding using a combined process that consists of two subsequent biological and electrocoagulation steps 147 150 as well as of process of biological with electrocoagulation as a post treatment process 151 152 4 discussion in this section we proceed to discuss the results obtained in the bibliographic review carried out pointing out the most representative aspects of the concentrations of antibiotics detected the most prominent removal methods and the elimination tests consulted regarding the review of the concentrations of antibiotics detected in water in international studies it should be noted that the most studied antibiotic is sulfamethoxazole appearing in 96 of the analyzes while the least studied is levofloxacin which only appears in the 4 too the antibiotics with the highest concentration are sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin all 20 000 ng l while the lowest concentration is metronidazole 1800 ng l another important issue to highlight is that 53 of the studies consulted use wastewater as a source while for example only 18 of the papers use river water as a source therefore increasing the water analysis in other water sources is very interesting for the scientific community as to the main analysis techniques examined highlight the great variety existing in the physical and chemical foundations on which they are based membrane process chemicals absorption filters oxidation this allows you to choose between one method or another depending on the water source the infrastructures developed in the place and the emerging pollutant that you want to eliminate respect of removal percentage tests consulted emphasize that among the different methods analyzed those with the best elimination results ranges between 80 and 100 are aops op membrane technology nf ro biological baf ad bac while the one with the worst result are chemical c f constructed wetlands hsf cws in general the following criticisms and evaluations can be made on the one hand in biological treatments the elimination of antibiotics is affected by factors such as process parameters water quality conditions and environmental factors this must be considered if this option is chosen on the other hand aops and combined treatments for the elimination of antibiotics show high efficiency they have broad development and application prospects in wastewater treatment lastly membrane technologies are effective in removing antibiotics but it is true that they are rarely used in wastewater today choosing this technology is a viable option 106 next the ro will be studied in more detail not because it is a more suitable technique than the others but because in locations with water scarcity where ro desalination plants abound as is the case of the place where this paper is made canary islands spain proving the validity of this technology for the elimination of antibiotics is very encouraging if the analysis of membrane processes is investigated to a greater extent it is observed that there are multiple studies that prove the efficacy of ro to eliminate antibiotic concentrations in different types of water following some of the main successful studies selected for their relevance in terms of rejection of contaminants are explained in greater detail first the pilot unit of croatia with wastewaters and an initial concentration of tim of 406 μg l the operation conditions were 25 c of temperature and 5 98 ph the membranes utilized were xle of dow film tec the results of rejection were 99 99 134 second the theoretical practical case of gran canaria spain with synthetic seawater and an initial concentration of cip of 50 200 and 500 μg l the membranes used were re2521 of csm toray chemical korea inc the operation conditions were in the initial phase 22 30 c of temperature and 7 0 2 ph and in the optimization phase 25 c and 7 0 2 ph the results of rejection were in the initial phase 99 72 97 91 and 99 55 respectively for 50 200 and 500 μg l and in the optimization phase 95 96 99 69 and 99 83 respectively 50 200 and 500 μg l 153 the data of the elimination percentages consulted in the international literature review establish ranges from 93 to 99 99 repeating values higher than 99 regularly in summary ro presents magnificent percentages of antibiotic removal in different types of water ro is also positioned as a candidate technology as one of the main allies in the purpose of eliminating concentrations of antibiotics in the aquatic environment competing with other techniques such as activated carbon adsorption ozonation and advanced oxidation processes attached growth treatment processes or other membrane process 5 future perspectives the future perspectives go through mitigating preventing and controlling antibiotic resistance which is one of the global priorities recognized by the competent authorities future studies should include improvement of wastewater management practices and monitoring of environmental water contamination by antibiotics multiclass methods are required that allow simultaneous analysis of antibiotics and their by products at very low concentrations all to combat concerns with antibiotic mixtures and their effects on human health and the environment derived from chronic low level exposure 6 the risk of development and proliferation of resistance to antibiotics is critical and adequate methods to assess this risk must be developed in future lines of research studies carried out in rivers of china revealed that the concentration of antibiotics depends on three major conditioning factors first economic factors for example population density and its corresponding release of antibiotics second geochemical factor for example the texture of the sediments and the content of sedimentary organic carbon third geographic and hydrological factors for example rainfall and currents 154 consequently the locations for monitoring the concentrations of antibiotics in the aquatic environment cannot be chosen arbitrarily a strategy is needed to determine the strategic points where monitoring should be performed research in southern lake michigan concludes that concentrations of pharmaceuticals can have potential harmful effects on aquatic organisms and humans through exposure to drinking water this study shows that conducting more in depth research to quantify potential threats is critical 155 it is important to emphasize that risk assessments of emerging contaminants for example antibiotics are always helpful but your results should be treated with caution because single compound exposure scenarios are not realistic multiple pollutants are reproduced in combination with effects that are unknown and of considerable ecological concern therefore prospects are to carry out more specific analyzes to define possible adverse effects on the aquatic environment and whether synergistic effects between pollutants can occur 156 as a summary regarding the fight against antibiotic resistance add that there are authors who establish a series of major future lines of action first carry out prevention and awareness campaigns to reduce the consumption of antibiotics as well as greater control of the elimination of expired drugs second optimize the performance of existing wwtps through the implementation of tertiary treatment techniques third increase research on new and more innovative techniques for water treatment fourth a strict and uniform regulation on the application of sludge from urban wwtps and livestock manure as fertilizers in agricultural activities since they are sources of contamination of agricultural soils and in some cases of harvested crops fifth conduct more research focused on the ecotoxicological risks associated with pharmaceutical contamination this would allow deciding which compounds represent a threat to the aquatic environment and therefore must be monitored and included in the lists of priority substances defined in legislative frameworks such as directive 2013 39 ec 157 also in the future it is necessary to globalize studies there are knowledge gaps that must be filled through studies of the fate and transport of emerging pollutants in countries located in a wider range of climates from tropical to arctic especially there is a significant lack of information from countries such as indonesia india canada russia and countries in africa and south america 63 an interesting line of investigation for the future is to use renewable sources for the elimination of antibiotics from the aquatic environment in a study in almeria south of spain treatment by solar photo fenton was effectively used to remove antibiotics from real secondary effluents from two different wastewater treatment plants in it 7 out of 10 antibiotics detected in the investigated wastewater samples were effectively eliminated 60 100 however it was also shown that the process was ineffective in eliminating antibiotic resistance genes so it was not possible for them to conclude that the process can effectively minimize the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance to the environment further research on more intensive oxidative conditions is needed 158 another line of work for the future may be based on advancing and refining the methods that make it possible to determine a standardized elimination efficiency by compound types for example for antibiotics these proceeds because there is scientific evidence that determines serious difficulties in comparing the efficacy of the different treatment processes because the elimination of organic micropollutants seems to be specific to each compound 159 160 the prospects also include reducing the costs of eliminating antibiotics from the aquatic environment for example there are relatively recent studies on hospital effluents that establish that total costs range between 4 1 m3 and 5 5 m3 in the case of incorporating secondary treatment using a membrane biological reactor and advanced oxidation processes 161 finally say that in countries with large coastal areas and especially in the ones that have islands with water scarcity wastewater treatment and desalination are essential to meet their water needs a good example is the case of gran canaria island spain where desalination represents approximately 45 of the total water produced being used as follows agricultural 14 recreational 9 urban 73 tourism 73 and industrial 60 the technology used widely for desalination on the island is ro it is implemented in the 85 of the existing desalination plants therefore it can be said that ro in this island is a mature reliable and experienced technology 162 taking advantage of this experience and these infrastructures of ro for the objective of eliminating antibiotics from the aquatic environment is an opportunity in this type of location in this sense to say that ro can also be used as one more treatment within a concatenated series of treatments this was done in a study in a wwtp in northern spain in which the concentrations of 77 emerging pollutants including antibiotics in raw municipal wastewater and secondary treatment effluent in a wwtp were monitored for two years in it a wastewater treatment scheme was used that integrates activated sludge uf ro and electro oxidation to eliminate them their results dictated that the amount of micropollutants removed during secondary treatment varied widely by compound while the uf removal efficiency for the different compounds varied significantly although it was less than 20 for most excellent removal rates were achieved in the reverse osmosis treatment they rejected more than 99 of all target compounds finally electrooxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes removed more than 95 of most of the compounds studied from the ro effluent 163 6 conclusions the human and animal waste that is produced after the consumption of antibiotics causes the contamination of the aquatic environment this ends up harming human health by generating resistance to antibiotics to fight against this problem and protect the aquatic environment numerous efforts are being made around the world the problem is not easy because there are multiple routes of entry for antibiotic residues of human and animal origin into the aquatic environment and the consumption of antibiotics for medical and veterinary use has high levels in developed countries if means for their elimination from the aquatic environment are not studied the problem will worsen over time because of higher global consumption large discharges excreted into the aquatic environment which will be added to the existing concentrations in this bibliographic review the study has focused on analyzing the concentrations detected and the elimination percentages experienced of the following antibiotics ciprofloxacin erythromycin levofloxacin metronidazole norfloxacin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim in addition this study includes countries around the world as well as different types of waters sewage wastewater hospital domestic synthetic water reclamation facility rivers surface water drinking water and synthetic seawater i the most studied antibiotic is sulfamethoxazole appearing in 96 of the analyzes while the least studied is levofloxacin which only appears in 4 regarding the concentrations detected the antibiotics with the highest concentrations are sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin all 20 000 ng l while the one with the lowest concentration is metronidazole 1800 ng l ii multiple techniques have been experimented with to tackle the removal of concentrations of these antibiotics from the aquatic environment with different results among the different methods analyzed the ones that present the best results of elimination range

13192,currently the serious problem of contamination by antibiotics is a reality the scientific evidence of its negative effects on the aquatic environment and human health are numerous and unquestionable therefore it is essential to intensify research into effective and efficient processes for removing antibiotics from the aquatic environment in this paper on the one hand a review of the concentrations detected in all types of waters of some antibiotics is developed in concrete of ciprofloxacin cip erythromycin ery levofloxacin lev metronidazole met norfloxacin nor ofloxacin ofl sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tim of the publications consulted it can be noted that the most detected is smx while those with the highest concentrations are cip smx and tim on the other hand some of the main methods to eliminate antibiotics from the aquatic environment are defined and classified the methods are compared indicating their advantages and disadvantages combined processes are also mentioned as a good alternative finally the removal percentages achieved by each method in some representative publications are detailed in this regard it can be said that the methods with the best elimination percentages range 80 100 are biological methods biological aerated filter anaerobic digestion biological activated carbon filter and membrane technology nanofiltration reverse osmosis

antibiotics is known to have existed since the ancient egypt and in the middle age and that there were numerous contributions from different authors since the 19th century alexander fleming can be pointed out as an important figure in the invention of them he was a british scientist who in 1928 accidentally discovered in one of his forgotten colonies of staphylococcus aureus that a fungus penicillium notatum inhibited its growth the concerning molecule was purified and called penicillin 1 in the modern medicine the word antibiotic initially referred to any agent with biological activity against living organisms while now it alludes to substances with antibacterial antifungal or antiparasitic activity one of the possible modern definitions pretends to qualify antibiotics as chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit or eliminate the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria fungi or protozoa 2 there are several different kinds of antibiotics and they can be classified based on their chemical structure action mechanism action spectrum and the route of administration out of these classifications the most popular one is their mechanism of action and based on it the most common groups are β lactams sulfonamides monobactams carbapenems aminoglycosides glycopeptides lincomycin macrolides polypeptides polyenes rifamycin tetracyclines chloramphenicol quinolones and fluoroquinolones 3 another way is to divide them into the following groups beta lactams that include cephalosporins penicillin monobactams carbapenems macrolides lincosamines tetracyclines aminoglycosides amphenicols peptides including polypeptides glucopeptides lipopeptides polymyxins oxazolidinones nitro derivatives fusidanos phosphonates pleuromulins quinolones sulfonamides diaminopyridines 4 in fig 1 the diagram explains through the human food chain the connection between the use of antibiotics and human health it starts with the normal intake of antibiotics followed by the contamination of food and drinking water and finally leading to infections by drug resistant bacteria which are more difficult to treat 5 there are other ways to explain the entry routes of antibiotics to the environment that have an impact on human health we can classify them in two groups antibiotics used in human medicine and the antibiotics used in veterinary medicine one of the gateways of contamination of waters by human antibiotics is the following humans take antibiotics and then excrete them the excretions reach the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and after their treatment they generate biosolids and effluent discharges that cause pollution of the soil and the aquatic environment surface toilet and groundwater moreover in veterinary medicine the antibiotics are given to livestock and then excreted excretions generate manure storage tanks and lagoons that cause contamination of the soil and the aquatic environment surface water and groundwater within this section an especially representative case that directly causes pollution of the aquatic environment surface toilet and groundwater is the use of antibiotics in aquaculture 6 there are also unconventional pathways of contamination of environment for example due to the lack of recycling of expired drugs the recycling of medicines can be a possibility against this route of entry for this it is necessary to study different methodologies to recycle active drugs from expired pharmaceutical products studies admit that when a drug expires it can contain 90 or even more of the active pharmaceutical ingredients therefore suitable chromatographic methods and analytical techniques could be adopted for the isolation and eventual quantification of the active ingredients in order to successfully recycle them into useful products this approach would be ecological 7 in all cases the contamination of the soil and the aquatic environment surface water and groundwater leads to direct and indirect routes that then get to human beings directly because the contaminated waters access the water treatment plant wtp where the drinking water comes from indirectly because the contaminated waters are used for irrigation which drives to the contamination of crops that humans and livestock animals then eat these agents are then discharged into the sea contaminating the fish we eat this water is also used as drinking water for livestock animals which humans then eat too 6 in addition to the human consumption of antibiotics there are many other anthropogenic activities such as the use of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture and non human applications of antibiotics and waste disposal which generate large environmental resistance reserves 8 and virulence genes with their respective organisms that host them 9 multiple genetic and genomic studies of wastewater treatment plants have shown that these are important deposits of resistant genes and organisms 10 11 frequently these genes are transported as genomic islands in transmissible plasmids and represent sources of resistance 12 the main entry routes of pharmaceutical residues including antibiotics into the aquatic environment are excretions after use poor disposal of unused medicines and the waste generated after their production from the routes of entry they arrive to the wwtp 13 from an environmental point of view the incorporation of antibiotics metabolites and antibiotic resistance genes into the natural environment is of great concern studies have shown that contaminants based on antibiotic residues can influence microbial populations through bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects leading to the disappearance of key microbial groups associated with ecological activities or affecting their physiological functions the detection monitoring and characterization of these components in the aquatic environment are important to evaluate their toxic teratogenic and mutagenic effects in ecosystems 14 the problem is that these wwtp are not prepared to eliminate these type of waste products in this regard there are studies whose experimental results indicate the limitations of primary treatment methods when it comes to breaking down pharmaceutical products 15 all the above suggests the need of new treatments focused on the removal of antibiotics from the different waters regarding the high consumption of antibiotics it is important to underline that in europe according to data from fedesa in 1997 approximately 10 000 t year of antibiotics were consumed of which half were used in medicine and the other half in animal health 16 in spain the consumption of antibiotics has fallen but remains high in 1985 the overall consumption of antibiotics was 21 9 dhd doses defined by 1000 habitants and day while in 2000 it was 20 4 dhd 17 statistics on the use of anti infective for systemic use in the primary care sector in europe in 2017 show that the consumption measured in dhd in central southern europe ranges between 19 317 and 32 148 it can be classified into three blocks in the first range 19 317 23 594 there are countries such as italy in the second range 23 594 27 871 we find countries such as spain or france in the third range 27 871 32 148 we find countries such as greece or romania on the lower end in northern europe in countries such as england sweden norway denmark or germany consumption is fixed in the range 10 763 19 317 18 the objectives of this bibliographic review are summarized in on the one hand to determine the concentrations of a series of high consumption antibiotics in developed countries as well as the analytical techniques used on the other hand classify and define some of the main antibiotic elimination processes including single and combined finally determine for the antibiotics mentioned the percentages of elimination of some of the main previous processes compare and discuss these percentages are also included 2 occurrence in water regarding analysis techniques it begins by showing in table 1 the evolution that analysis techniques have followed in the last 50 years determination of pharmaceuticals in different water samples can be performed by various chromatographic techniques including high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet hplc uv 19 high performance liquid chromatography diode array detection hplc dad 20 21 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms 22 24 and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 25 26 currently due to their high sensitivity and selectivity methods based on mass spectrometry are the most applied approach to determine sulfonamides residues at low concentrations mgkg 1 or mg kg 1 within methods the use of liquid chromatography electrospray quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry hplc esi qqlit ms ms permits analysis with high specificity and adequate limits of detection 27 32 high performance liquid chromatography hplc is the most common method used for separation and determination of these compounds because most pharmaceuticals are non volatile 33 as the residue of pharmaceutical compounds is usually present at very low concentrations in the environmental water a sample preparation and pre concentration step are necessary before analysis 34 35 several procedures have been reported for the pre concentration of pharmaceuticals from water matrices including solid phase extraction spe 22 36 liquid liquid extraction lle 37 quick easy cheap effective rugged safe quechers method 38 magnetic solid phase extraction mspe 39 hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction hflpm 40 and salting out assisted liquid liquid extraction for non steroid anti inflammatory drugs nsaids 41 46 among those commonly used methods solid phase extraction spe was the most extensively used technique 47 49 as a conclusion to say that the main technique of analysis to detect these concentrations is liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 50 51 previously the samples must be treated to preconcentrate them using solid phase extraction spe 30 52 regarding antibiotics eight types were selected this selection is due to the search for amply spectrum antibiotics under the reasoning that this should lead to wide use and therefore large discharge to the aquatic environment in addition we learned from the spanish agency for medicines and health products that for example fluoroquinolones have increased their use in spain by 26 in 12 years between 1997 and 2009 the selection includes quinolones ciprofloxacin levofloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin were chosen because they are antibiotics that are used for the treatment of a wide spectrum of urinary respiratory genital gastrointestinal skin bone and joint bacterial infections nitroimidazoles metronidazole and trimethoprim were selected because they are antimicrobials with bactericidal action that present a moderately broad antibacterial spectrum they are used in infections of the urinary tract ears lungs intestines and liver macrolides erythromycin are used to treat infections caused by bacteria in the respiratory and urinary tracts as well as ear intestinal gynecological dermatological and sexually transmitted infections sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic that combined with the trimethoprim is used to treat multiple types of bacterial infections ear urinary tract pneumonias and intestinal after reviewing the bibliography and limiting the study to the analysis of these eight types of antibiotics whose descriptions are shown in table 2 we will highlight part of the most representative information in each case authors location water source maximum concentrations detected in ng l see table 3 from the total of tests cited in table 3 two conclusions can be drawn on the one hand it should be noted that the antibiotics lev smx and tmp have the highest concentrations while met is the one with the least as can be seen in fig 2 on the other hand regarding the percentage of times that each antibiotic was studied it can be seen in fig 3 that the antibiotics smx and tmp are detected in more than 80 of the studies next are cip ery nor and ofl with percentages between 30 and 50 finally the least detected is lev which does not reach 5 3 removal 3 1 processes some of the single treatment processes for the elimination of emerging pollutants in general and antibiotics for different types of water can be grouped into six large blocks and each in turn is divided into different elimination techniques as shown in fig 4 first are the chemical processes where the coagulation flocculation method cf is the most prominent they can be applied at different stages of water treatment pretreatment of industrial effluents before entering municipal sewers 95 primary treatment of urban wastewater 96 tertiary urban wastewater treatment 97 drinking water treatment plants interesting studies have been published regarding the detection of pharmacological products in drinking water plants 98 as well as during the primary treatment of municipal wastewater 99 regarding the removal of antibiotics in wastewater there are also published paper 100 second group are adsorption highlighting activated carbon it is a promising advanced treatment process that can remove many of the pharmacological products that are usually detected in wastewater 101 there are studies that include the elimination of antibiotics in wastewater and hospital wastewater both using the powdered activated carbon pac 102 and granular activated carbon gac techniques 103 another adsorption option is to use cellulose membranes with this method in a study with cip a 27 elimination was obtained 104 there are also studies that used zeolites for the adsorption of ciprofloxacin with this method elimination percentages between 90 and 97 have been obtained these are shown to be promising for future applications for the disposal of this drug in wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry as well as other drugs with similar structural characteristics 105 third are physicochemical aops which include electrochemical oxidation eo technology that produces strong oxidants to degrade pollutants through electrode reactions 106 the ozonation process op which in turn has two mechanisms for ozone based antibiotic degradation the direct oxidation of ozone and indirect oxidation through the generation of free radicals 107 the fenton process fp in this process the reagents h2o2 and fe2 react with each other to generate oh radicals which then oxidize and break down the antibiotics 108 ultraviolet rays uv h2o2 in this method h2o2 decomposes to produce oh with uv irradiation 109 a good alternative is the aops based on ultraviolet rays uv h2o2 but its high costs derived mainly from the need for upstream pretreatment and downstream h2o2 cooling are a significant inconvenient 110 on the other hand ozone is presented as a very interesting alternative because its efficiency is like the previous one but with lower costs due to lower chemical and energy requirements 111 antibiotic elimination studies using this process have been reviewed all of them in wastewater and commonly in pilot plants but also in municipal treatment plants 110 112 fourth are the membrane technology in this process pollutants are intercepted as the wastewater passes through small pores in the membrane they can be divided into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in this regard it should be noted that membrane filtration technologies have been tested on a real scale in pilot plants and at the laboratory level to remove pharmaceutical products including antibiotics from different types of waters 58 113 118 fifth are biological treatments which can be classified as aerobic anaerobic and combined aerobic and anaerobic methods the main aerobic method is the biological aerated filter system baf this is a new type of process used for wastewater treatment that combines oxidation and filtration by biological contact 119 includes a solid phase to support microbial growth a liquid phase to submerge the solid material and a gas phase for air input 120 the main anaerobic methods are the anaerobic digestion ad upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic filter af and anaerobic baffled reactor abr processes in concrete stand out ad that includes four stages hydrolysis acidification hydrogen production and acetic acid and methane production 121 the problem you have is that the treated sewage and sludge residue could still cause damage to the surrounding environment 122 the main combined aerobic and anaerobic methods are the sequencing batch reactor sbr and the membrane bioreactor mbr processes the sbr is based on one or more aeration reaction tanks and the sewage enters the tank in batches this reactor operates in five sequences influent feeding anoxic phase aerobic phase sludge settling and effluent discharge 123 the mbr processes which combines modern membrane separation technology and biological technology its advantages are long sludge retention time flexible operation low sludge production and high nitrification performance its disadvantages are its high energy consumption and operating costs 124 highlight that they can retain more than 5 and 2 log units of bacteria and viruses respectively pilot studies have been developed in hospital wastewater that demonstrate the efficacy of mbr for some pharmacological products even eliminating more than 95 of them 125 127 within the biological ones there are also the attached growth treatment and the suspended growth treatment in the attached growth treatment there are the processes biological activated carbon filter bac this process consists of a fixed bed of granular activated carbon that supports the growth of bacteria attached to its surface they have been used for years to treat drinking water demonstrating their effectiveness in eliminating natural organic matter 128 they can be considered an interesting alternative on the one hand because biofiltration systems in general tend to be robust simple to build and require little energy 129 on the other hand because bac filtration costs can be expected to be in the same range as sand filtration 130 sixth are constructed wetlands it is an artificial wastewater treatment ecosystem which uses the combined action of soil plants and microorganisms to treat wastewater entering the wetland wastewater purification is achieved by filtration adsorption co precipitation ion exchange plant adsorption and microbial decomposition 131 this treatment can be classified as free water surface flow constructed wetlands fws cws horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hsf cws and vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands vsf cws according to the direction of water flow 106 3 1 1 comparative swot analysis in this section a comparison of some the antibiotic removal processes from water wastewater is made for this the selected technique is swot analysis because it is a simple tool for strategic analysis that is very widespread in decision making it has been decided to carry out a swot analysis for each elimination method to decide which techniques should be used according to the case and the intended objective unlabelled table 3 1 2 removal percentage tests unfortunately there is no specific type of treatment that manages to eliminate several micropollutants due to their different properties to date there are no reliable processes that allow the elimination of both bulk substances and micropollutants 72 a bibliographic review was carried out including some of the main studies that have been performed for the elimination of antibiotics from different types of water see table 4 in each case it is specified the treatment used the method used if appropriate the water source analyzed the most representative specifications of the test the percentage of elimination obtained and finally the reference of the study from the data expressed in the table 4 it can be concluded that there are multiple techniques that achieve excellent elimination percentages 90 therefore it appears that the decision to use one or the other method will depend on the facilities already in place at the site in question in section 4 we will proceed to discuss the results obtained in table 4 3 2 combined processes currently many combined processes are used to remove all types of emerging pollutants including antibiotics from waters some of the most representative are listed below first nanofiltration combined with ozone based advanced oxidation processes in wastewater in a study on the elimination of antibiotics in a wastewater treatment plant in china uv254 photolysis ozonation and uv o3 processes were used to treat the nanofiltration concentrate the conclusions were on the one hand nanofiltration efficiently removed antibiotics from the effluent on the other hand uv254 photolysis was not effective in degrading antibiotics lastly the uv o3 process was able to further remove the antibiotics in the nanofiltration concentrate effectively in addition the synergistic effect between o3 and uv in the degradation of antibiotics is observed results show high antibiotic rejections 98 in all sets of experiments thus zero discharge of micropollutants from wwtps is possible through the proposed scheme in the study 139 second in a important study of the processes for removing antibiotics from rearing wastewater combined treatments were analyzed to improve removal efficiency this study concludes that the combined treatments show a high efficiency of elimination of antibiotics they have broad prospects for development and application in the treatment of breeding wastewater 106 this paper quotes some important authors in this sense ben et al studied on degradation of antibiotics in swine wastewater using a combined biological fenton process in this method the sbr was used to perform the biological treatment and then the fenton process was used for further treatment the final removal rates of macrolides and sulfonamide were as high as 99 and 92 97 respectively therefore the integration of an aop and a biological method can effectively remove antibiotics from breeding wastewater 140 qian et al conducted a study in which swine wastewater was pretreated using an up flow anaerobic sludge layer and sbr process and then the wastewater was treated with the fenton process to remove antibiotics the average antibiotic removal efficiency was 74 141 han et al showed that the antibiotic removal rate was as high as 92 when the sbr and ad methods were combined to treat swine wastewater 142 in addition promising techniques using microalgae or with biofuel cells driven by microalgae bacteria have also been studied 143 third z al qodah et al has published a series of very interesting articles on combined processes that include electrocoagulation a first paper on the performance of electrocoagulation assisted biological treatment processes determines that the electrocoagulation process is simple cost effective and efficient when used as a pretreatment prior to biological processes advantages are the elimination of toxic materials that could inhibit biocatalysts in the biological treatment stage the reduction of the high organic load and the reduction of membrane fouling in mbr finally he proposes increasing research and expresses the possibility of expanding its use to an industrial treatment scale 144 a second paper is a review on combined electrocoagulation processes as a novel approach for enhanced pollutants removal including the combination of electrocoagulation with chemical coagulation adsorption magnetic separation and reverse osmosis in this review the author detects the following problems that are reproduced in many investigations on the one hand in most of the studies carried out synthetic wastewater was used instead of real samples consequently the production results may not be representative of the real case systems on the other hand no attempt has been cited to increase adsorption chemical coagulation magnetic field and reverse osmosis assisted electrocoagulation systems finally very few studies have considered the application of kinetic models to predict these combined systems in addition it proposes using sustainable energy resources to cover the electrical energy required by electrocoagulation processes and thus reduce operating costs he also expresses that more attempts must be made in search of more sustainable electrodes apart from fe and al 145 in a third paper the author reviews the main results obtained from studies on the performance of biological treatment combined with electrocoagulation as a post treatment process the most representative conclusion is the demonstration that electrocoagulation is an efficient and promising post treatment process for biological treatment processes especially for anaerobically treated effluents that need more chemical oxygen demand and removal of color besides the author insists on the need for additional studies that combine biological treatment and electrocoagulation as a post treatment process and to compare them to select the most profitable 146 finally the author cites some interesting studies regarding using a combined process that consists of two subsequent biological and electrocoagulation steps 147 150 as well as of process of biological with electrocoagulation as a post treatment process 151 152 4 discussion in this section we proceed to discuss the results obtained in the bibliographic review carried out pointing out the most representative aspects of the concentrations of antibiotics detected the most prominent removal methods and the elimination tests consulted regarding the review of the concentrations of antibiotics detected in water in international studies it should be noted that the most studied antibiotic is sulfamethoxazole appearing in 96 of the analyzes while the least studied is levofloxacin which only appears in the 4 too the antibiotics with the highest concentration are sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin all 20 000 ng l while the lowest concentration is metronidazole 1800 ng l another important issue to highlight is that 53 of the studies consulted use wastewater as a source while for example only 18 of the papers use river water as a source therefore increasing the water analysis in other water sources is very interesting for the scientific community as to the main analysis techniques examined highlight the great variety existing in the physical and chemical foundations on which they are based membrane process chemicals absorption filters oxidation this allows you to choose between one method or another depending on the water source the infrastructures developed in the place and the emerging pollutant that you want to eliminate respect of removal percentage tests consulted emphasize that among the different methods analyzed those with the best elimination results ranges between 80 and 100 are aops op membrane technology nf ro biological baf ad bac while the one with the worst result are chemical c f constructed wetlands hsf cws in general the following criticisms and evaluations can be made on the one hand in biological treatments the elimination of antibiotics is affected by factors such as process parameters water quality conditions and environmental factors this must be considered if this option is chosen on the other hand aops and combined treatments for the elimination of antibiotics show high efficiency they have broad development and application prospects in wastewater treatment lastly membrane technologies are effective in removing antibiotics but it is true that they are rarely used in wastewater today choosing this technology is a viable option 106 next the ro will be studied in more detail not because it is a more suitable technique than the others but because in locations with water scarcity where ro desalination plants abound as is the case of the place where this paper is made canary islands spain proving the validity of this technology for the elimination of antibiotics is very encouraging if the analysis of membrane processes is investigated to a greater extent it is observed that there are multiple studies that prove the efficacy of ro to eliminate antibiotic concentrations in different types of water following some of the main successful studies selected for their relevance in terms of rejection of contaminants are explained in greater detail first the pilot unit of croatia with wastewaters and an initial concentration of tim of 406 μg l the operation conditions were 25 c of temperature and 5 98 ph the membranes utilized were xle of dow film tec the results of rejection were 99 99 134 second the theoretical practical case of gran canaria spain with synthetic seawater and an initial concentration of cip of 50 200 and 500 μg l the membranes used were re2521 of csm toray chemical korea inc the operation conditions were in the initial phase 22 30 c of temperature and 7 0 2 ph and in the optimization phase 25 c and 7 0 2 ph the results of rejection were in the initial phase 99 72 97 91 and 99 55 respectively for 50 200 and 500 μg l and in the optimization phase 95 96 99 69 and 99 83 respectively 50 200 and 500 μg l 153 the data of the elimination percentages consulted in the international literature review establish ranges from 93 to 99 99 repeating values higher than 99 regularly in summary ro presents magnificent percentages of antibiotic removal in different types of water ro is also positioned as a candidate technology as one of the main allies in the purpose of eliminating concentrations of antibiotics in the aquatic environment competing with other techniques such as activated carbon adsorption ozonation and advanced oxidation processes attached growth treatment processes or other membrane process 5 future perspectives the future perspectives go through mitigating preventing and controlling antibiotic resistance which is one of the global priorities recognized by the competent authorities future studies should include improvement of wastewater management practices and monitoring of environmental water contamination by antibiotics multiclass methods are required that allow simultaneous analysis of antibiotics and their by products at very low concentrations all to combat concerns with antibiotic mixtures and their effects on human health and the environment derived from chronic low level exposure 6 the risk of development and proliferation of resistance to antibiotics is critical and adequate methods to assess this risk must be developed in future lines of research studies carried out in rivers of china revealed that the concentration of antibiotics depends on three major conditioning factors first economic factors for example population density and its corresponding release of antibiotics second geochemical factor for example the texture of the sediments and the content of sedimentary organic carbon third geographic and hydrological factors for example rainfall and currents 154 consequently the locations for monitoring the concentrations of antibiotics in the aquatic environment cannot be chosen arbitrarily a strategy is needed to determine the strategic points where monitoring should be performed research in southern lake michigan concludes that concentrations of pharmaceuticals can have potential harmful effects on aquatic organisms and humans through exposure to drinking water this study shows that conducting more in depth research to quantify potential threats is critical 155 it is important to emphasize that risk assessments of emerging contaminants for example antibiotics are always helpful but your results should be treated with caution because single compound exposure scenarios are not realistic multiple pollutants are reproduced in combination with effects that are unknown and of considerable ecological concern therefore prospects are to carry out more specific analyzes to define possible adverse effects on the aquatic environment and whether synergistic effects between pollutants can occur 156 as a summary regarding the fight against antibiotic resistance add that there are authors who establish a series of major future lines of action first carry out prevention and awareness campaigns to reduce the consumption of antibiotics as well as greater control of the elimination of expired drugs second optimize the performance of existing wwtps through the implementation of tertiary treatment techniques third increase research on new and more innovative techniques for water treatment fourth a strict and uniform regulation on the application of sludge from urban wwtps and livestock manure as fertilizers in agricultural activities since they are sources of contamination of agricultural soils and in some cases of harvested crops fifth conduct more research focused on the ecotoxicological risks associated with pharmaceutical contamination this would allow deciding which compounds represent a threat to the aquatic environment and therefore must be monitored and included in the lists of priority substances defined in legislative frameworks such as directive 2013 39 ec 157 also in the future it is necessary to globalize studies there are knowledge gaps that must be filled through studies of the fate and transport of emerging pollutants in countries located in a wider range of climates from tropical to arctic especially there is a significant lack of information from countries such as indonesia india canada russia and countries in africa and south america 63 an interesting line of investigation for the future is to use renewable sources for the elimination of antibiotics from the aquatic environment in a study in almeria south of spain treatment by solar photo fenton was effectively used to remove antibiotics from real secondary effluents from two different wastewater treatment plants in it 7 out of 10 antibiotics detected in the investigated wastewater samples were effectively eliminated 60 100 however it was also shown that the process was ineffective in eliminating antibiotic resistance genes so it was not possible for them to conclude that the process can effectively minimize the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance to the environment further research on more intensive oxidative conditions is needed 158 another line of work for the future may be based on advancing and refining the methods that make it possible to determine a standardized elimination efficiency by compound types for example for antibiotics these proceeds because there is scientific evidence that determines serious difficulties in comparing the efficacy of the different treatment processes because the elimination of organic micropollutants seems to be specific to each compound 159 160 the prospects also include reducing the costs of eliminating antibiotics from the aquatic environment for example there are relatively recent studies on hospital effluents that establish that total costs range between 4 1 m3 and 5 5 m3 in the case of incorporating secondary treatment using a membrane biological reactor and advanced oxidation processes 161 finally say that in countries with large coastal areas and especially in the ones that have islands with water scarcity wastewater treatment and desalination are essential to meet their water needs a good example is the case of gran canaria island spain where desalination represents approximately 45 of the total water produced being used as follows agricultural 14 recreational 9 urban 73 tourism 73 and industrial 60 the technology used widely for desalination on the island is ro it is implemented in the 85 of the existing desalination plants therefore it can be said that ro in this island is a mature reliable and experienced technology 162 taking advantage of this experience and these infrastructures of ro for the objective of eliminating antibiotics from the aquatic environment is an opportunity in this type of location in this sense to say that ro can also be used as one more treatment within a concatenated series of treatments this was done in a study in a wwtp in northern spain in which the concentrations of 77 emerging pollutants including antibiotics in raw municipal wastewater and secondary treatment effluent in a wwtp were monitored for two years in it a wastewater treatment scheme was used that integrates activated sludge uf ro and electro oxidation to eliminate them their results dictated that the amount of micropollutants removed during secondary treatment varied widely by compound while the uf removal efficiency for the different compounds varied significantly although it was less than 20 for most excellent removal rates were achieved in the reverse osmosis treatment they rejected more than 99 of all target compounds finally electrooxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes removed more than 95 of most of the compounds studied from the ro effluent 163 6 conclusions the human and animal waste that is produced after the consumption of antibiotics causes the contamination of the aquatic environment this ends up harming human health by generating resistance to antibiotics to fight against this problem and protect the aquatic environment numerous efforts are being made around the world the problem is not easy because there are multiple routes of entry for antibiotic residues of human and animal origin into the aquatic environment and the consumption of antibiotics for medical and veterinary use has high levels in developed countries if means for their elimination from the aquatic environment are not studied the problem will worsen over time because of higher global consumption large discharges excreted into the aquatic environment which will be added to the existing concentrations in this bibliographic review the study has focused on analyzing the concentrations detected and the elimination percentages experienced of the following antibiotics ciprofloxacin erythromycin levofloxacin metronidazole norfloxacin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim in addition this study includes countries around the world as well as different types of waters sewage wastewater hospital domestic synthetic water reclamation facility rivers surface water drinking water and synthetic seawater i the most studied antibiotic is sulfamethoxazole appearing in 96 of the analyzes while the least studied is levofloxacin which only appears in 4 regarding the concentrations detected the antibiotics with the highest concentrations are sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin all 20 000 ng l while the one with the lowest concentration is metronidazole 1800 ng l ii multiple techniques have been experimented with to tackle the removal of concentrations of these antibiotics from the aquatic environment with different results among the different methods analyzed the ones that present the best results of elimination range 80 100 are nf ro biological baf ad bac while the one with the worst result under 60 are chemical c f constructed wetlands hsf cws iii ro is an effective technique with elimination percentages higher

13193,the occurrence of antibiotics residue in wastewater easily enriches antibiotic resistance genes args and seriously threatens the ecological environment and human health as one of the effective tertiary treatment technologies the ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have been drawn more attentions due to its high efficiency energy saving and environment friendly characteristics hence this review covers the strengths and weaknesses of uv h2o2 uv chlorine and uv persulfate induced aops and uv tio2 catalyzed aop in removing antibiotics pollutants in wastewater focuses on the influence of wastewater matrix components process optimization and their applications the inorganic and organic substances in wastewaters presented a complex impact on the performance of uv based aops through a series of reactions such as reactive species scavenging and light attenuation effects the uv based aops might be optimized by selecting dominant oxidants enhancing process parameters adopting uv led as ultraviolet light sources etc consequently the modified uv based aops were effective to remove antibiotics antibiotics resistant bacteria arb and args and demonstrated

treatment plant keywords ultraviolet advanced oxidation process antibiotics pollutants water matrix composition wastewater 1 introduction in recent years antibiotics have been widely used in medical treatment animal husbandry and aquaculture 1 3 discharging substantial antibiotics containing wastewater 4 5 posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health 6 7 the most typical problem followed is the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance 8 antibiotics in wastewater exert selective pressure to promote the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and enrich the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args 9 on the other hand sensitive bacteria obtain antibiotic resistance by horizontal gene transfer including conjugation transformation and transduction 6 7 it is assumed that effluents from conventional biological treatment processes are the main anthropogenic sources for the spread of antibiotic resistance to the environment because many bacteria in the activated sludge are continuously exposed to low concentrations of antibiotics and activated sludge has become an important reservoir of args 10 thereby allowing antibiotic resistance to enter the environment and adversely affecting terrestrial and aquatic organisms even affecting human health through drinking water 11 args have been identified as emerging pollutants in urgent need of treatment 12 antibiotic resistance affects the sustainable development of health food security clean water and sanitation facilities 13 and may lead to the human disease and a huge economic burden in the future 14 consequently there is an urgent need to find an effective method to remove the antibiotics pollutants from the wastewater conventional secondary biological treatment processes such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr are not capable to effectively remove antibiotics pollutants in wastewater 15 and biological treatment processes are even ideal environments for the emergence and propagation 16 of antibiotic resistance 10 therefore tertiary treatment is urgently required to control the spread of antibiotics and args in wastewater traditional tertiary treatment processes such as chlorination 17 ultraviolet radiation 18 and ozone 19 have been confirmed not to effectively remove antibiotics and args however the integrated processes such as ultraviolet uv radiation cooperating with some oxidants reveal significant pollution removal ability which is called advanced oxidation process aop 20 21 aops are a chemical treatment category that generally use the hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 hydrated electron produced via activating oxidants h2o2 persulfate oxygen for the remediation of organic contaminants and they have been confirmed to effectively remove antibiotics pollutants in various wastewaters 22 25 in particular the combination of ultraviolet uv irradiation with oxidants seems to be more powerful in wastewater treatment furthermore the addition of heterogeneous catalysts may improve the process efficiency by promoting electron transfer between pollutants and oxidants and producing surface bound reactive species 26 among different aops the ozone oxidation process is costly 24 25 and has low ozone utilization rate 25 the fenton oxidation process produces much iron containing sludge 27 similarly the electrochemical oxidation process requires high energy 28 while the photochemical especially uv based photochemical aop can avoid these disadvantages and has been getting more and more attentions 22 29 uv based photochemical aops are commonly divided into uv induced oxidation and uv catalyzed oxidation the uv induced aop mainly includes uv h2o2 uv chlorine and uv persulfate processes among them uv activates h2o2 to generate oh eq 1 30 uv induces hypochlorite to produce reactive chlorine species rcs including cl cl2 and clo etc eqs 2 5 31 32 uv induces persulfate including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxodisulfate pds to produce so4 eqs 6 7 33 34 which in turn produce ho eqs 8 9 35 to enhance the removal of antibiotics pollutants as for uv catalyzed aop tio2 is the most commonly used catalyst when tio2 absorbs ultraviolet energy greater than its band gap electrons are excited from the valance band to the conduction band forming electrons e with high reducing ability and holes h with high oxidizing ability eq 11 36 electrons reduce oxygen to produce o2 while the holes normally react with h2o to form the strong oxidants oh eqs 12 13 37 1 h2o2 hv 2ho φ 1 0 mol e 1 2 hclo clo hv 2ho o cl

photolysis by uv radiation or indirect photolysis by free radicals produced by the activation of h2o2 chlorine and persulfate 38 the removal of arb and args can be achieved by free radical attack uv self sterilization and oxidant oxidation 25 in uv catalyzed aop antibiotics degradation and arb inactivation are mainly ascribed to o2 or oh produced in catalyzing process sometimes arb adhere onto tio2 particles and cause photocatalytic killing the inactivation of arb leads to increase of cell membrane permeability and oxidative attack of cell inner components this further results in conformational change of genetic material and single dna strand breaks which provides possibility of args damage 25 many studies have proved the great potential of uv based aops in the tertiary treatment of wastewater 39 40 to our best knowledge there appear several reviews on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by uv based aops including principles 28 process performances 41 42 and their applications 22 25 while the research progress on the impact of wastewater constituents processes optimization and improvement have not yet been summarized herein this review i comprehensively summarized the influence of wastewater matrix components inorganic matter organic matter etc on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by various uv based aops ii analyzed the processes optimization and application performances of uv based aops and iii based on existing results future perspectives were proposed where we encourage the researchers to focus on water quality parameters modeling multi wavelength combination process design green and efficient heterogeneous catalyst oxidant system development technical conditions optimization so as to promote the environmental applications of uv based aops 2 influence of water matrix components when uv based aops are applied in the wastewater treatment process the water matrix plays a vital role 43 46 all components fall into two groups i e promoter or inhibitor for the uv induced aop in the wastewater 45 natural organic matter in wastewater may become inhibitors through light attenuation and scavenging free radicals 47 or become promoters as photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species ros 48 inorganic ions such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrate nitrite sulfate chloride and bromide may become inhibitors through free radical scavenging reactions or become promoters through other reactions such as the photolysis of nitrate 43 46 the specific influence is related to the ion concentration and the type of oxidant 44 the impact of water matrix constituents on uv catalyzed aop might be divided into direct and indirect aspects on the one hand the components may directly interfere the fundamental physicochemical processes during uv photocatalysis including photon absorption surface adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on the other hand the catalytic stability and aggregation state are likely to be changed to alter the photocatalytic reactivity 49 in addition different antibiotics pollutants in wastewater also interact with each other 2 1 inorganic substances inorganic substances in wastewater including carbonate bicarbonate nitrate nitrite sulfate chloride and bromide 43 46 50 generally react with free radicals to generate daughter radicals with lower oxidation reduction potential 51 or compete for free radicals with antibiotics pollutants 43 45 and thus affect the degradation of antibiotics pollutants in uv induced aop in the presence of inorganic ions uv photocatalytic degradation capacity may be inhibited by specific surface adsorption active sites competing on tio2 surfaces and reactive species quenching effect 49 2 1 1 halogen ion halogen ions are always present in all kinds of wastewater 43 46 50 cl scavenged free radical rapidly but reversibly eqs 14 17 52 53 so cl insignificantly affected the concentration of oh and rcs in uvc h2o2 and uvc chlorine 54 therefore cl only slightly inhibited the degradation of florfenicol ff 38 ofloxacin ofl levofloxacin lev 55 sulfamethazine smt 56 chloramphenicol cap thiamphenicol tap 57 by uvc h2o2 and the degradation of cip by uvc chlorine table 1 in addition there have been numerous studies showed the concentration dependent dual effect of cl in the uv pds system table 1 in some studies low concentrations cl slightly promoted the degradation of tap 58 and cap 59 because cl scavenged free radicals to generate highly reactive cl e0 2 40 v eqs 14 18 60 and promote free radical chain propagation reaction 61 while high concentration cl scavenged cl 59 and initiated mutual quenching reactions of free radicals eqs 19 20 62 which restrained the degradation of cap 59 tap 58 sulfamethoxazole smx 62 sulfadimethoxine sdm 63 ofl 64 amoxicillin amx 65 and lev 55 in uvc pds system 14 cl oh cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 15 cloh cl oh k 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 16 cl cl cl 2 k 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 17 cl 2 cl cl k 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 18 so4 cl so4

then reduced aggregate size and reactivity of tio2 which slightly inhibited the removal of metronidazole mnz 37 on the other hand cl might react with holes h to produce rcs with strong oxidizing ability so it had no considerable influence on the degradation of norfloxacin 66 br accelerated the degradation of smx 62 and ofl 64 by uv pds due to the formation of highly oxidative and selective reactive bromine radicals br and br 2 eqs 21 22 the impact of br on uv based aops is also related to the characteristic of antibiotics 64 21 so4 br so4 2 br k 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 22 br br br 2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 2 1 2 carbonate and bicarbonate bicarbonate had a mild inhibitory effect on the degradation of ff tap 58 and amx 65 by uvc h2o2 because hco3 scavenged free radical with a slower rate 67 however with the increase of hco3 concentration the free radical scavenging effect was enhanced 68 and co3 with low oxidizing capacity e0 1 63 v was generated eq 23 25 69 resulting in a significant inhibitory effect of ff tap cap 57 smx 70 ciprofloxacin cip 71 degradation at neutral ph the alkalinity is equal to the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 72 and the concentration of hco3 and co3 2 impact the ph of the solution therefore the influence of hco3 and co3 2 on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by uv based aops is not only related to the free radical reactions involved eqs 23 27 but also related to the change in ph value of solution 73 hco3 promoted the removal of oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc chlortetracycline ctc and doxycycline dxc 73 but co3 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of ff tap 38 and tetracycline antibiotics otc tc ctc and dxc 73 by uvc h2o2 which depend on the combined effect of scavenging free radicals and adjusting the ph 73 the addition of hco3 increased the ph value it may affect the number and composition of active species 74 such as causing the mutual quenching of ho and so4 eq 28 on the other hand it altered the speciation of antibiotics 75 for example in case of smx the increase in ph reduced the proportion of amide groups that release protons 62 23 hco3 oh co3 h2o k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 24 hco3 cl co3 h cl k 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 25 so4 hco3

and metronidazole degradation 37 in the presence of hco3 owing to specific interactions with tio2 surface hco3 resulted in the stabilization of tio2 aggregates and thus increased photogenerated hole and other reactive species production however this positive effect was immediately counteracted as reactive species was quickly quenched by hco3 49 2 1 3 nitrate and nitrite nitrate and nitrite commonly exist in different wastewaters which impact the performance of uv based aops 43 46 nitrate had a slight negative effect on the degradation of amx 65 and tap 58 by uvc h2o2 and uvc pds but slightly enhanced the degradation of ff tha by uvc h2o2 57 and the degradation of cap by uvc pds 59 table 1 which is caused by the combined effect of producing ho and scavenging free radicals ho was generated from the photolysis of no3 under uv irradiation eqs 32 33 76 77 which improved the photo degradation of pollutants 78 80 but the quantum yield of no3 is quite low φno3 0 0017 mol einstein which has not enhanced the degradation of antibiotics such as ff tap 57 and cap 59 on the other hand no3 scavenged free radical slowly 81 and generated no3 eqs 29 30 35 82 with a certain oxidizing ability e0 2 3 2 5 v which has not significantly inhibited the degradation of antibiotics 83 the reason why no3 inhibited the degradation of ofl and lev by uvc h2o2 and uv pds was that the photolysis of no3 simultaneously produces o and no2 eq 31 the later one strongly quenched free radicals 84 85 moreover even a low concentration of no2 strongly quenched so4 eq 36 86 thus no2 markedly restrained the degradation of ff tap 38 by uvc h2o2 and the degradation of cap 59 by uvc pds process 29 h no3 hno3 k 4 4 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 30 hno3 oh no3 h2o k 0 88 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 31 no3 hν no2 o 32 no3 hν o no2 33 o h2o ho oh 34 no2 oh no2 oh 35 so4 no3 no3 so4 2 k 5 0 104 m 1 s 1 36 so4 no2 so4 2 no2 similarly as reported by tran et al 37 no3 slightly inhibited the removal of mnz in uvc degussa p25 tio2 system and farner budarz et al 49 considered that no3 might restrain the generation of reactive species by competing tio2 adsorption sites or scavenging free radical 2 1 4 sulfate so4 2 insignificantly affected the degradation of otc tc ctc dxc 73 smt 56 amx 65 ofl lev 55 and β lactam antibiotics 87 by uvc h2o2 and did not affect the degradation of smx 62 ofl 64 amx 65 and β lactam antibiotics 87 by uvc pds so4 2 neither changes the ph value of solution nor it is a strong scavenger of free radicals 88 however though the free radical scavenging reaction was relatively slow 73 high concentration of so4 2 further quenched so4 and oh eqs 37 38 56 thus slightly inhibiting cip degradation 71 37 so4 2 ho so4 oh k 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 38 so4 2 so4 s2o82 eaq so4 2 inhibited the removal of metronidazole 37 and norfloxacin 66 by uv tio2 aop so4 2 slightly interacted with tio2 surface 49 and scavenged free radical on tio2 surface to produce so4 which had a larger molecular structure than oh preventing the reaction with antibiotic molecule 37 2 1 5 other inorganic substances 0 3 4 mg l 1 nh4 has slightly refrained the degradation of otc tc ctc and dxc by uvc h2o2 73 0 5 m inorganic ammonia partially suppressed the indirect photolysis of smx in the uvc pds process and almost completely restrained the indirect photolysis of acetyl smx and tmp 89 inorganic ammonia scavenged free radicals and generated reactive nitrogen species rns eqs 39 40 which selectively oxidize electron rich antibiotics such as smx 89 39 nh3 ho nh2 h2o k 9 107 m 1 s 1 40 nh3 so4 nh2 h so4 2 k 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 the impact of cations on uv tio2 basically followed the order of transition metal cations cu2 fe3 divalent alkaline earth metal cations ca2 mg2 monovalent cations k na 66 the inhibition of transition metal cations and divalent alkaline earth metal cations was mainly attributed to filtering the radiation required for the activation of tio2 66 cu2 and fe3 showed higher inhibition on the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin because the tio2 surface reacted slowly with transition metal complexes in addition cu2 scavenged the photoelectrons produced by irradiated photocatalyst and fe3 decreased the solution ph leading to a decreased photodegradation efficiency of metronidazole 37 the strong adsorption and ph alteration effect of h2po4 resulted in the sharper inhibition of mnz photodegradation 37 on the one side phosphate was drawn to specifically interact with tio2 surface resulting in the occupation of surface sites and aggregation of tio2 particles this restricted aggregation of target pollutants and increased scavengers near the tio2 surface thus preventing uv photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics on the other side the lower ph caused protonation of tio2 surface making it easier for tio2 surface to adsorb and interact with phosphate 49 2 2 organic substances the actual wastewater comprises a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds including natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp trace organic matter and others 89 which impact the removal of antibiotics pollutants in uv based aops 90 2 2 1 natural organic matter the nom present in natural water generally restrained the degradation of antibiotics by uv induced aop table 2 and it was mainly because 1 the light attenuation effect caused by suspended particulate matter 91 inhibited the direct photolysis of antibiotics 92 93 2 the free radical scavenging effect 94 and the competition effect of active species 95 inhibited the indirect photolysis of antibiotics 96 however other studies contradicted that nom promoted the degradation of antibiotics in some cases zhao et al 73 revealed that humic acid ha accelerated the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics otc tc ctc and dxc by uvc h2o2 low concentration of ha acted as a strong photosensitizer 73 which absorbed ultraviolet light to generate 3ha and promoted the indirect photolysis of tcs through energy transfer 97 michael kordatou et al 98 found that ha promoted the degradation of erythromycin ery by uv pds to a certain extent because the ha quinone functional group effectively activated oxidants such as pds 99 and promoted the generation of hydrated electron and ho 100 in addition the appropriate concentration of fa might oxidize ff 101 and slightly promoted its degradation 57 for uv catalyzed aop though ha adsorption on tio2 promoted the formation of tio2 organic complexes and favored moxifloxacin mox adsorption the addition of ha decreased the mox degradation rate indicating that reactive species scavenging and uv light shielding were the main influencing mechanisms 102 some researchers claimed that the inhibiting effect of ha on mnz removal by uv tio2 was largely attributed to the interference of antibiotics photodegradation by light shielding and adsorption sites competing effect 37 2 2 2 dissolved effluent organic matter dissolved effluent organic matter defom present in the secondary wastewater consists of dissolved nom derived from drinking water sources soluble microbial products derived from activated sludge micro pollutants and disinfection by products etc 103 104 it is worth noting that defom also comprises of a mixture of emerging biological micro pollutants such as arb and args 105 compared with ha defom exhibited a greater inhibition effect on the degradation of antibiotics by uv based aops 98 smp as the main portion of defom consisting of organic compounds with unsaturated bonds such as dissolved organic nitrogen 106 may strongly scavenge free radicals 105 mao et al 107 adopted the electro peroxone process to pretreat doc which notably reduced disinfection by product formation sun et al 108 adopted pre ozonation to treat the dissolved organic matter dom which prominently alleviated the negative effect of dom on uv based aops indicating the necessity to pretreat dom in wastewater 2 3 interaction of different resistant pollutants microorganisms and organic matter existing in wastewater may interact with each other such as the free radical competition effect between microorganisms and antibiotic 110 as well as the antibiotic adsorption effect of microorganisms 111 for different resistant pollutants michael kordatou et al 98 found that ery refrained the removal of ery resistant e coli kim et al 112 observed the mutual inhibition effect between ciprofloxacin and cip resistance enterococcus faecalis hu et al 113 discovered the inhibitory effect of arb on resistance gene sul1 inti1 removal different resistant pollutants had a competitive effect on oxidant ultraviolet absorption and free radical consumption 112 hu et al 113 demonstrated that arb did not notably impact the degradation of smx due to its fast degradation rate 114 in addition smx had a slight promoting effect on the removal of args in the initial 5 min but it was inhibited after 5 min because smx consumed ho rapidly to promote chain propagation reaction in the first 5 min but smx secondary products competed for free radicals with args after 5 min 113 antibiotic as organic compounds and arb as microorganisms may compete for free radicals or participate in other interactions thereby influencing each other s removal by the uv based aops in the future the specific interactions and interaction mechanism of different antibiotics pollutants during the simultaneous removal process need to be further studied 3 process optimization when applied to wastewater treatment the process performance of uv based aops was inhibited to a certain extent therefore it is essential to optimize the process to improve its effectiveness in treating antibiotics pollutants 3 1 selection of oxidants as the oxidant of aop persulfate exhibited certain advantages such as high efficiency to oxidize pollutants containing unsaturated bonds wide ph range 34 there have numerous studies shown the better performance of uvc persulfate on the degradation of a large number of antibiotics ofl 115 amx 87 cip 116 smx 117 and other sulfonamide antibiotics 118 compared with uvc h2o2 this was mainly due to firstly persulfate had a higher radical quantum yield than h2o2 eqs 1 6 87 secondly the recombination of so4 k 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 was 10 times slower than ho k 5 2 109 m 1 s 1 119 thirdly so4 produced in uvc persulfate process was an electrophilic group 118 which reacted selectively with the rich electronic antibiotics 120 in addition uv pds was less negatively affected by various water matrix components for instance compared with uv h2o2 the inhibitory effects of cl no3 ammonia and ha on the degradation of ofl lev 55 and amx 65 by uv pds were apparently weaker this was related to the rate constant of free radical scavenging reaction and the selectivity of free radicals 121 cl 65 no3 83 ammonia 89 and ha 122 had markedly lower scavenging levels of so4 than oh 123 and the inhibiting effect of 500 mm hco3 on the degradation of smx by uv pds was also lower than that of uv h2o2 process 89 because co3 generated by high concentration hco3 quenched the oxidant and the quenching rate of h2o2 was faster than that of pds 89 for the removal of some args such as blakpc 3 genes uvc pds showed a better removal effect than uvc h2o2 indicating the great potential of uvc pds for args removal 124 3 2 enhancement of process performance uv induced aop had good effect on the degradation of quinolone antibiotics cip 71 ofl 64 sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 and macrolide antibiotics ery 98 β lactam antibiotics amx 126 chloram phenicols ff cap and tap 57 and tetracycline antibiotics otc dtc 127 however the mineralization degree of antibiotics in wastewater by uv induced aop is not always acceptable the limitations of experimental conditions such as low uv fluence 87 and insufficient oxidant concentration may lead to low mineralization rate by optimizing process parameters such as adding fe2 catalyst 128 or extending the reaction time 129 the mineralization rate of antibiotics was dramatically increased the application of uv radiation and fe2 catalyst exhibited satisfactory synergetic effect and achieved dual activation of pds 128 in addition adding pre magnetized fe0 catalyst to uv h2o2 system achieved deep mineralization of secondary wastewater 130 in the heterogeneous uv pre magnetized fe0 h2o2 system the uv light facilitated the oxidation of fe0 to fe2 which could catalyze the homogeneous fenton like reaction and improve the degradation and mineralization of antibiotics in secondary effluents 130 the uv based photocatalytic oxidation reactions might take place in both on the catalyst surfaces with heterogeneous catalyst and in solution with homogeneous oxidant simultaneously 131 the addition of heterogeneous tio2 catalyst to uv induced system and the addition of oxidant to uv catalyzed aop significantly improved original process performance adding tio2 to uv pds system enhanced the pollutant elimination efficiency considering that the photogenerated holes and electrons generated on the tio2 surface may increase the production of free radicals thus promoting the activation of pds in the solution media 131 besides in heterogeneous uv tio2 system additional h2o2 in the solution enhanced reaction with conduction band electron and o2 to form additional oh doubling the degradation efficiency of amx amp and cloxacillin clx 132 hence the combination of uv light catalyst and oxidant in heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation system revealed great application potential in addition it has been reported that the toxicity of wastewater treated by uv based aops might increase 125 antibiotics were likely to be oxidized to produce toxic organic intermediates 125 which could be further degraded by extending reaction time 57 73 thus the phytotoxicity of urban wastewater treated by uvc pds was significantly increased first and then markedly decreased 98 however as for uv chlorine aop the biotoxicity was increased by high free chlorine concentration 112 and long reaction time 71 because byproducts such as dcan and chloral might be produced 71 thus it is necessary to control the reaction time and free chlorine injection in uv chlorine process hospital wastewater was completely detoxified by uv chlorine treatment with low concentration free chlorine and appropriate reaction time 112 3 3 modification of uv light sources low pressure mercury lamps emitting 254 nm monochromatic light are commonly used as uv light sources which contain harmful mercury 133 according to the minamata convention on mercury a variety of mercury containing products should be phased out before 2020 and alternative mercury free uv sources must be used in uv based aops 111 in recent years the emerging ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have been widely used due to their energy saving environmental friendliness and the flexibility to combine with specific wavelengths 134 135 compared with traditional mercury lamps uv led had the advantage of setting the ultraviolet radiation wavelength to the maximum damage wavelength of protein 136 or the maximum absorption wavelength of antibiotics so uv led 275 nm chlorine effectively eliminated ery 137 and cip 112 uv led 275 nm h2o2 112 uv led 280 nm h2o2 138 uv led 280 nm pds 139 also degraded cip effectively however the low irradiation intensity of uv led led to low photo quantum yield and low generating efficiency of free radical in uv based aops which in turn contributed to the low mineralization efficiency of antibiotics 138 so further improvements are needed such as coupling dozens of uv led chips to improve irradiance intensity 140 which has huge application potential 141 in addition compared with traditional mercury lamps uv leds showed the following advantages in removing arb and args first high efficiency and low energy uv leds were more suitable for removing args that required larger uv fluence 142 second uv led reduced antibiotic resistance better than low pressure mercury lamps 142 and uv led combined with low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l 1 notably refrained the horizontal gene transfer of args 143 144 third uv led could be efficiently turned on and off at high frequencies thereby providing higher photonic efficiency for uv based aops 145 and it was more suitable for small scale facilities such as hospital wastewater treatment plants 112 there is great potential of using uv led based aops to remove antibiotics pollutants in wastewater in the process of uv induced aop using uv led as the light source we can combine the maximum absorption wavelength of antibiotics the maximum damage wavelength of protein 275 280 nm the maximum damage wavelength of dna 260 270 nm to explore the possibility of eliminating antibiotic arb and args to the maximum extent at the same time 4 performance of uv based aops in various water matrix the complexity of wastewater had a certain influence on the uv based aops to treat antibiotics pollutants therefore investigating the removal of antibiotics pollutants in wastewater by uv based aops is an indispensable step to promote uv based aops from laboratory research to practical applications uv based aops significantly removed quinolone antibiotics cip 71 ofl 64 sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 macrolide antibiotics ery 99 β lactam antibiotics amx 126 chloramphenicols ff cap and tap 57 tetracycline antibiotics otc dtc 127 a variety of sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 sulfathiazole sulfisoxazole sulfamonomethoxine sulfamethoxypyridazine sulfadiazine 118 as well as arb 125 and args 146 in general as the complexity of the water matrix increased the effectiveness of uv based aops in removing antibiotics pollutants decreased 45 4 1 artificial water due to the effectiveness of uv induced aop good removal efficiency of antibiotics was obtained in ion containing mixed water 71 or bottled water 99 and the effect of ions in ionized water on uv induced aop was negligible table 3 because inorganic ions scavenged free radical 147 and generated daughter radicals with certain oxidizing ability 148 4 2 natural water although not as good as ionized water uv induced aop was effective in the degradation of the antibiotic in natural water bodies for instance smx achieved 90 degradation in natural water by uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 149 cip reached 80 3 degradation in surface water by uvc chlorine 71 table 3 since the nom absorbed ultraviolet light and quenched free radicals 150 151 the combined effect of ultraviolet radiation and oxidant such as h2o2 in natural waters was poor in the degradation of cip 127 hence it is essential to pretreat the nom in natural water bodies 107 152 the photocatalytic performance of uv catalyzed aop in natural water matrices was commonly inhibited which could be attributed to the abilities of ions to compete for the reactive species and to adsorb on the tio2 surface sites 66 meanwhile high ionic strengths in natural water made tio2 particles form larger agglomerate reducing the effective surface area and thus inhibiting the light absorption and mass transfer process in uv tio2 system 153 4 3 secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant in the secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant the removal effect of antibiotics by uv based aops was significantly reduced 99 for example the degradation efficiency of cap was reduced by 10 in the process of uvc h2o2 154 and the removal efficiency of cip was decreased by 25 8 in the process of uvc chlorine 71 table 3 the high toc and high turbidity and defom in the secondary wastewater may cause uv light shielding and free radical scavenging effects thereby affecting the direct and indirect photolysis of antibiotics 105 compared with natural water bodies the removal of antibiotics in complex water bodies such as secondary wastewater required higher oxidant dosage 39 and uv fluence 155 the high concentration organic substances in wastewater reacted with most of the active species to inhibit the inactivation of arb 156 however in the study of uv induced aop to remove arb in secondary wastewater 125 and municipal wastewater 124 researchers found that wastewater matrix had no significant effect on the inactivation of arb even the organic and inorganic substances in the secondary wastewater acted as light filters 157 and free radical scavengers 110 the uv light still had a strong and rapid disinfection effect on arb 157 in addition sheldon et al 158 discover that secondary wastewater matrix was beneficial to the inactivation of resistant e coli during uvc chlorine treatment which may be related to the interaction between arb and water matrix components 158 it is known that cod ammonia nitrogen suspended solids dissolved oxygen and temperature of wastewater may affect the relative content of args and have different effects on different args 160 161 however mckinney et al 146 found that the secondary wastewater had almost no effect on the removal of some args ampc teta meca and vana by uv chlorine in addition compared with clean water the removal of args in secondary wastewater required a higher uv fluence 162 the uv fluence and oxidant dosage required for the removal of antibiotics pollutants in the wastewater are higher than the theoretical value the inhibition effect on antibiotic photocatalytic degradation was highly relevant to the combined effect of the mixed matrix constituents in real secondary effluent 102 dimitrakopoulou et al 159 claimed that inorganic ions and organic matter in secondary effluent demonstrated reactive species scavenging effects and thus considerably inhibited amx degradation in simulated secondary wastewater the complete degradation of smx was achieved by increasing the reaction time of uva tio2 to 5 times 132 besides the use of tio2 immobilized system seemed to be less negatively affected by the chemical composition of wastewater 132 4 4 other types of water urine inhibited the degradation process of antibiotics by uv induced aop but it was not as significant as secondary wastewater 118 the inhibitory effect of fresh urine on the degradation of smx by uvc h2o2 and uvc pds was stronger than that of hydrolyzed urine unlike the citric acid and urea in fresh urine the inorganic urine components chloride carbonate and ammonia in hydrolyzed urine reacted with free radicals to generate daughter radicals such as rns to oxidize antibiotics 89 in addition zhu et al 64 found that the seawater matrix promoted the removal of ofloxacin by uv pds which is related to the free radical reaction involving high concentration br hco3 and cl 148 5 conclusions and prospects as a developing tertiary treatment process uv based aops effectively removed various antibiotics arb and args in the wastewater most inorganic ions and organic substances in wastewater presented certain impact on the performance of uv based aops through a series of reactions such as reactive species scavenging in addition antibiotics arb and args in wastewater might interact with each other during the simultaneous removal process although uv based aops faced the challenges such as being easily affected by water matrix constituents causing the incomplete degradation of antibiotics and the generation of toxic organic intermediates these disadvantages can be overcomed by selecting dominant oxidants optimizing process parameters selecting energy saving and environmentally friendly uv led as ultraviolet light sources etc through process parameters optimization the degradation process of antibiotics from various kind of wastewater by uv based aops could be improved and the inhibition effect of different water matrix components could be eliminated overall this review provides a critical summary of antibiotics pollutants removal by uv based aops in wastewater thus achieving antibiotics pollutants removal with cost saving and environment friendly prospects in wastewater based on the current applications of uv based aops on the removal of antibiotics pollutants in wastewater the following perspectives are proposed for future research i due to the different types and concentrations of water matrix components and antibiotics pollutants in wastewaters uv based aops present a certain degree of complexity in the practical application process water quality parameter modeling and simultaneous removal modeling of antibiotics pollutants are necessary to simulate the complex reaction of uv based aops in wastewater it is difficult to quantificationally assess the heterogeneous mass transfer process in uv catalyzed aop so other methods should be carried out to evaluate the application process of uv based aops in real wastewater such as introducing a parameter like total free radical scavenging rate to analyze the impact of matrix components ii in order to thoroughly control the antibiotic resistance dissemination risk the mineralization rate and transformation of antibiotics intermediate products should be examined the photoreactivation and dark repair of arb and the spread of antibiotic resistant determinants should be detected to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of uv based aops iii the heterogeneous catalyst oxidant system reveals great sustainable application perspective when using heterogeneous catalyst in uv based aops for antibiotics pollutants treatment the reduction of energy consumption and reagents dosage the catalytic performance and stability of catalysts are the major concerns iv uv leds have developed as an alternative source of uv irradiation with low operational cost and excellent sustainability the combination of multi wavelength and potential synergistic effect as well as different operational conditions such as pulse irradiation should be explored in turn to investigate the process efficacy of simultaneous removal of different resistant pollutants in wastewater in addition the vacuum ultraviolet irradiation has also emerged as an efficient candidate for uv based aops it is a promising and competitive technology which needs further research v the safety of treated wastewater by uv based aops ought to be assessed by using a complete set of toxicity assessment methods and the environmental impact of the uv based aops needs to be explored and improved appropriate post processing could be introduced to moderate the process impact and the green and harmless catalyst should be developed to maintain a safe public health and protect the environment in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13193,the occurrence of antibiotics residue in wastewater easily enriches antibiotic resistance genes args and seriously threatens the ecological environment and human health as one of the effective tertiary treatment technologies the ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have been drawn more attentions due to its high efficiency energy saving and environment friendly characteristics hence this review covers the strengths and weaknesses of uv h2o2 uv chlorine and uv persulfate induced aops and uv tio2 catalyzed aop in removing antibiotics pollutants in wastewater focuses on the influence of wastewater matrix components process optimization and their applications the inorganic and organic substances in wastewaters presented a complex impact on the performance of uv based aops through a series of reactions such as reactive species scavenging and light attenuation effects the uv based aops might be optimized by selecting dominant oxidants enhancing process

treatment plant keywords ultraviolet advanced oxidation process antibiotics pollutants water matrix composition wastewater 1 introduction in recent years antibiotics have been widely used in medical treatment animal husbandry and aquaculture 1 3 discharging substantial antibiotics containing wastewater 4 5 posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health 6 7 the most typical problem followed is the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance 8 antibiotics in wastewater exert selective pressure to promote the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and enrich the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args 9 on the other hand sensitive bacteria obtain antibiotic resistance by horizontal gene transfer including conjugation transformation and transduction 6 7 it is assumed that effluents from conventional biological treatment processes are the main anthropogenic sources for the spread of antibiotic resistance to the environment because many bacteria in the activated sludge are continuously exposed to low concentrations of antibiotics and activated sludge has become an important reservoir of args 10 thereby allowing antibiotic resistance to enter the environment and adversely affecting terrestrial and aquatic organisms even affecting human health through drinking water 11 args have been identified as emerging pollutants in urgent need of treatment 12 antibiotic resistance affects the sustainable development of health food security clean water and sanitation facilities 13 and may lead to the human disease and a huge economic burden in the future 14 consequently there is an urgent need to find an effective method to remove the antibiotics pollutants from the wastewater conventional secondary biological treatment processes such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr are not capable to effectively remove antibiotics pollutants in wastewater 15 and biological treatment processes are even ideal environments for the emergence and propagation 16 of antibiotic resistance 10 therefore tertiary treatment is urgently required to control the spread of antibiotics and args in wastewater traditional tertiary treatment processes such as chlorination 17 ultraviolet radiation 18 and ozone 19 have been confirmed not to effectively remove antibiotics and args however the integrated processes such as ultraviolet uv radiation cooperating with some oxidants reveal significant pollution removal ability which is called advanced oxidation process aop 20 21 aops are a chemical treatment category that generally use the hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 hydrated electron produced via activating oxidants h2o2 persulfate oxygen for the remediation of organic contaminants and they have been confirmed to effectively remove antibiotics pollutants in various wastewaters 22 25 in particular the combination of ultraviolet uv irradiation with oxidants seems to be more powerful in wastewater treatment furthermore the addition of heterogeneous catalysts may improve the process efficiency by promoting electron transfer between pollutants and oxidants and producing surface bound reactive species 26 among different aops the ozone oxidation process is costly 24 25 and has low ozone utilization rate 25 the fenton oxidation process produces much iron containing sludge 27 similarly the electrochemical oxidation process requires high energy 28 while the photochemical especially uv based photochemical aop can avoid these disadvantages and has been getting more and more attentions 22 29 uv based photochemical aops are commonly divided into uv induced oxidation and uv catalyzed oxidation the uv induced aop mainly includes uv h2o2 uv chlorine and uv persulfate processes among them uv activates h2o2 to generate oh eq 1 30 uv induces hypochlorite to produce reactive chlorine species rcs including cl cl2 and clo etc eqs 2 5 31 32 uv induces persulfate including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxodisulfate pds to produce so4 eqs 6 7 33 34 which in turn produce ho eqs 8 9 35 to enhance the removal of antibiotics pollutants as for uv catalyzed aop tio2 is the most commonly used catalyst when tio2 absorbs ultraviolet energy greater than its band gap electrons are excited from the valance band to the conduction band forming electrons e with high reducing ability and holes h with high oxidizing ability eq 11 36 electrons reduce oxygen to produce o2 while the holes normally react with h2o to form the strong oxidants oh eqs 12 13 37 1 h2o2 hv 2ho φ 1 0 mol e 1 2 hclo clo hv 2ho o cl

photolysis by uv radiation or indirect photolysis by free radicals produced by the activation of h2o2 chlorine and persulfate 38 the removal of arb and args can be achieved by free radical attack uv self sterilization and oxidant oxidation 25 in uv catalyzed aop antibiotics degradation and arb inactivation are mainly ascribed to o2 or oh produced in catalyzing process sometimes arb adhere onto tio2 particles and cause photocatalytic killing the inactivation of arb leads to increase of cell membrane permeability and oxidative attack of cell inner components this further results in conformational change of genetic material and single dna strand breaks which provides possibility of args damage 25 many studies have proved the great potential of uv based aops in the tertiary treatment of wastewater 39 40 to our best knowledge there appear several reviews on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by uv based aops including principles 28 process performances 41 42 and their applications 22 25 while the research progress on the impact of wastewater constituents processes optimization and improvement have not yet been summarized herein this review i comprehensively summarized the influence of wastewater matrix components inorganic matter organic matter etc on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by various uv based aops ii analyzed the processes optimization and application performances of uv based aops and iii based on existing results future perspectives were proposed where we encourage the researchers to focus on water quality parameters modeling multi wavelength combination process design green and efficient heterogeneous catalyst oxidant system development technical conditions optimization so as to promote the environmental applications of uv based aops 2 influence of water matrix components when uv based aops are applied in the wastewater treatment process the water matrix plays a vital role 43 46 all components fall into two groups i e promoter or inhibitor for the uv induced aop in the wastewater 45 natural organic matter in wastewater may become inhibitors through light attenuation and scavenging free radicals 47 or become promoters as photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species ros 48 inorganic ions such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrate nitrite sulfate chloride and bromide may become inhibitors through free radical scavenging reactions or become promoters through other reactions such as the photolysis of nitrate 43 46 the specific influence is related to the ion concentration and the type of oxidant 44 the impact of water matrix constituents on uv catalyzed aop might be divided into direct and indirect aspects on the one hand the components may directly interfere the fundamental physicochemical processes during uv photocatalysis including photon absorption surface adsorption and photocatalytic degradation on the other hand the catalytic stability and aggregation state are likely to be changed to alter the photocatalytic reactivity 49 in addition different antibiotics pollutants in wastewater also interact with each other 2 1 inorganic substances inorganic substances in wastewater including carbonate bicarbonate nitrate nitrite sulfate chloride and bromide 43 46 50 generally react with free radicals to generate daughter radicals with lower oxidation reduction potential 51 or compete for free radicals with antibiotics pollutants 43 45 and thus affect the degradation of antibiotics pollutants in uv induced aop in the presence of inorganic ions uv photocatalytic degradation capacity may be inhibited by specific surface adsorption active sites competing on tio2 surfaces and reactive species quenching effect 49 2 1 1 halogen ion halogen ions are always present in all kinds of wastewater 43 46 50 cl scavenged free radical rapidly but reversibly eqs 14 17 52 53 so cl insignificantly affected the concentration of oh and rcs in uvc h2o2 and uvc chlorine 54 therefore cl only slightly inhibited the degradation of florfenicol ff 38 ofloxacin ofl levofloxacin lev 55 sulfamethazine smt 56 chloramphenicol cap thiamphenicol tap 57 by uvc h2o2 and the degradation of cip by uvc chlorine table 1 in addition there have been numerous studies showed the concentration dependent dual effect of cl in the uv pds system table 1 in some studies low concentrations cl slightly promoted the degradation of tap 58 and cap 59 because cl scavenged free radicals to generate highly reactive cl e0 2 40 v eqs 14 18 60 and promote free radical chain propagation reaction 61 while high concentration cl scavenged cl 59 and initiated mutual quenching reactions of free radicals eqs 19 20 62 which restrained the degradation of cap 59 tap 58 sulfamethoxazole smx 62 sulfadimethoxine sdm 63 ofl 64 amoxicillin amx 65 and lev 55 in uvc pds system 14 cl oh cloh k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 15 cloh cl oh k 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 16 cl cl cl 2 k 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 17 cl 2 cl cl k 1 1 105 m 1 s 1 18 so4 cl so4

then reduced aggregate size and reactivity of tio2 which slightly inhibited the removal of metronidazole mnz 37 on the other hand cl might react with holes h to produce rcs with strong oxidizing ability so it had no considerable influence on the degradation of norfloxacin 66 br accelerated the degradation of smx 62 and ofl 64 by uv pds due to the formation of highly oxidative and selective reactive bromine radicals br and br 2 eqs 21 22 the impact of br on uv based aops is also related to the characteristic of antibiotics 64 21 so4 br so4 2 br k 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 22 br br br 2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 2 1 2 carbonate and bicarbonate bicarbonate had a mild inhibitory effect on the degradation of ff tap 58 and amx 65 by uvc h2o2 because hco3 scavenged free radical with a slower rate 67 however with the increase of hco3 concentration the free radical scavenging effect was enhanced 68 and co3 with low oxidizing capacity e0 1 63 v was generated eq 23 25 69 resulting in a significant inhibitory effect of ff tap cap 57 smx 70 ciprofloxacin cip 71 degradation at neutral ph the alkalinity is equal to the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 72 and the concentration of hco3 and co3 2 impact the ph of the solution therefore the influence of hco3 and co3 2 on the removal of antibiotics pollutants by uv based aops is not only related to the free radical reactions involved eqs 23 27 but also related to the change in ph value of solution 73 hco3 promoted the removal of oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc chlortetracycline ctc and doxycycline dxc 73 but co3 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of ff tap 38 and tetracycline antibiotics otc tc ctc and dxc 73 by uvc h2o2 which depend on the combined effect of scavenging free radicals and adjusting the ph 73 the addition of hco3 increased the ph value it may affect the number and composition of active species 74 such as causing the mutual quenching of ho and so4 eq 28 on the other hand it altered the speciation of antibiotics 75 for example in case of smx the increase in ph reduced the proportion of amide groups that release protons 62 23 hco3 oh co3 h2o k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 24 hco3 cl co3 h cl k 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 25 so4 hco3

and metronidazole degradation 37 in the presence of hco3 owing to specific interactions with tio2 surface hco3 resulted in the stabilization of tio2 aggregates and thus increased photogenerated hole and other reactive species production however this positive effect was immediately counteracted as reactive species was quickly quenched by hco3 49 2 1 3 nitrate and nitrite nitrate and nitrite commonly exist in different wastewaters which impact the performance of uv based aops 43 46 nitrate had a slight negative effect on the degradation of amx 65 and tap 58 by uvc h2o2 and uvc pds but slightly enhanced the degradation of ff tha by uvc h2o2 57 and the degradation of cap by uvc pds 59 table 1 which is caused by the combined effect of producing ho and scavenging free radicals ho was generated from the photolysis of no3 under uv irradiation eqs 32 33 76 77 which improved the photo degradation of pollutants 78 80 but the quantum yield of no3 is quite low φno3 0 0017 mol einstein which has not enhanced the degradation of antibiotics such as ff tap 57 and cap 59 on the other hand no3 scavenged free radical slowly 81 and generated no3 eqs 29 30 35 82 with a certain oxidizing ability e0 2 3 2 5 v which has not significantly inhibited the degradation of antibiotics 83 the reason why no3 inhibited the degradation of ofl and lev by uvc h2o2 and uv pds was that the photolysis of no3 simultaneously produces o and no2 eq 31 the later one strongly quenched free radicals 84 85 moreover even a low concentration of no2 strongly quenched so4 eq 36 86 thus no2 markedly restrained the degradation of ff tap 38 by uvc h2o2 and the degradation of cap 59 by uvc pds process 29 h no3 hno3 k 4 4 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 30 hno3 oh no3 h2o k 0 88 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 31 no3 hν no2 o 32 no3 hν o no2

system and farner budarz et al 49 considered that no3 might restrain the generation of reactive species by competing tio2 adsorption sites or scavenging free radical 2 1 4 sulfate so4 2 insignificantly affected the degradation of otc tc ctc dxc 73 smt 56 amx 65 ofl lev 55 and β lactam antibiotics 87 by uvc h2o2 and did not affect the degradation of smx 62 ofl 64 amx 65 and β lactam antibiotics 87 by uvc pds so4 2 neither changes the ph value of solution nor it is a strong scavenger of free radicals 88 however though the free radical scavenging reaction was relatively slow 73 high concentration of so4 2 further quenched so4 and oh eqs 37 38 56 thus slightly inhibiting cip degradation 71 37 so4 2 ho so4 oh k 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 38 so4 2 so4 s2o82 eaq so4 2 inhibited the removal of metronidazole 37 and norfloxacin 66 by uv tio2 aop so4 2 slightly interacted with tio2 surface 49 and scavenged free radical on tio2 surface to produce so4 which had a larger molecular structure than oh preventing the reaction with antibiotic molecule 37 2 1 5 other inorganic substances 0 3 4 mg l 1 nh4 has slightly refrained the degradation of otc tc ctc and dxc by uvc h2o2 73 0 5 m inorganic ammonia partially suppressed the indirect photolysis of smx in the uvc pds process and almost completely restrained the indirect photolysis of acetyl smx and tmp 89 inorganic ammonia scavenged free radicals and generated reactive nitrogen species rns eqs 39 40 which selectively oxidize electron rich antibiotics such as smx 89 39 nh3 ho nh2 h2o k 9 107 m 1 s 1 40 nh3 so4 nh2 h so4 2 k 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 the impact of cations on uv tio2 basically followed the order of transition metal cations cu2 fe3 divalent alkaline earth metal cations ca2 mg2 monovalent cations k na 66 the inhibition of transition metal cations and divalent alkaline earth metal cations was mainly attributed to filtering the radiation required for the activation of tio2 66 cu2 and fe3 showed higher inhibition on the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin because the tio2 surface reacted slowly with transition metal complexes in addition cu2 scavenged the photoelectrons produced by irradiated photocatalyst and fe3 decreased the solution ph leading to a decreased photodegradation efficiency of metronidazole 37 the strong adsorption and ph alteration effect of h2po4 resulted in the sharper inhibition of mnz photodegradation 37 on the one side phosphate was drawn to specifically interact with tio2 surface resulting in the occupation of surface sites and aggregation of tio2 particles this restricted aggregation of target pollutants and increased scavengers near the tio2 surface thus preventing uv photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics on the other side the lower ph caused protonation of tio2 surface making it easier for tio2 surface to adsorb and interact with phosphate 49 2 2 organic substances the actual wastewater comprises a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds including natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products smp trace organic matter and others 89 which impact the removal of antibiotics pollutants in uv based aops 90 2 2 1 natural organic matter the nom present in natural water generally restrained the degradation of antibiotics by uv induced aop table 2 and it was mainly because 1 the light attenuation effect caused by suspended particulate matter 91 inhibited the direct photolysis of antibiotics 92 93 2 the free radical scavenging effect 94 and the competition effect of active species 95 inhibited the indirect photolysis of antibiotics 96 however other studies contradicted that nom promoted the degradation of antibiotics in some cases zhao et al 73 revealed that humic acid ha accelerated the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics otc tc ctc and dxc by uvc h2o2 low concentration of ha acted as a strong photosensitizer 73 which absorbed ultraviolet light to generate 3ha and promoted the indirect photolysis of tcs through energy transfer 97 michael kordatou et al 98 found that ha promoted the degradation of erythromycin ery by uv pds to a certain extent because the ha quinone functional group effectively activated oxidants such as pds 99 and promoted the generation of hydrated electron and ho 100 in addition the appropriate concentration of fa might oxidize ff 101 and slightly promoted its degradation 57 for uv catalyzed aop though ha adsorption on tio2 promoted the formation of tio2 organic complexes and favored moxifloxacin mox adsorption the addition of ha decreased the mox degradation rate indicating that reactive species scavenging and uv light shielding were the main influencing mechanisms 102 some researchers claimed that the inhibiting effect of ha on mnz removal by uv tio2 was largely attributed to the interference of antibiotics photodegradation by light shielding and adsorption sites competing effect 37 2 2 2 dissolved effluent organic matter dissolved effluent organic matter defom present in the secondary wastewater consists of dissolved nom derived from drinking water sources soluble microbial products derived from activated sludge micro pollutants and disinfection by products etc 103 104 it is worth noting that defom also comprises of a mixture of emerging biological micro pollutants such as arb and args 105 compared with ha defom exhibited a greater inhibition effect on the degradation of antibiotics by uv based aops 98 smp as the main portion of defom consisting of organic compounds with unsaturated bonds such as dissolved organic nitrogen 106 may strongly scavenge free radicals 105 mao et al 107 adopted the electro peroxone process to pretreat doc which notably reduced disinfection by product formation sun et al 108 adopted pre ozonation to treat the dissolved organic matter dom which prominently alleviated the negative effect of dom on uv based aops indicating the necessity to pretreat dom in wastewater 2 3 interaction of different resistant pollutants microorganisms and organic matter existing in wastewater may interact with each other such as the free radical competition effect between microorganisms and antibiotic 110 as well as the antibiotic adsorption effect of microorganisms 111 for different resistant pollutants michael kordatou et al 98 found that ery refrained the removal of ery resistant e coli kim et al 112 observed the mutual inhibition effect between ciprofloxacin and cip resistance enterococcus faecalis hu et al 113 discovered the inhibitory effect of arb on resistance gene sul1 inti1 removal different resistant pollutants had a competitive effect on oxidant ultraviolet absorption and free radical consumption 112 hu et al 113 demonstrated that arb did not notably impact the degradation of smx due to its fast degradation rate 114 in addition smx had a slight promoting effect on the removal of args in the initial 5 min but it was inhibited after 5 min because smx consumed ho rapidly to promote chain propagation reaction in the first 5 min but smx secondary products competed for free radicals with args after 5 min 113 antibiotic as organic compounds and arb as microorganisms may compete for free radicals or participate in other interactions thereby influencing each other s removal by the uv based aops in the future the specific interactions and interaction mechanism of different antibiotics pollutants during the simultaneous removal process need to be further studied 3 process optimization when applied to wastewater treatment the process performance of uv based aops was inhibited to a certain extent therefore it is essential to optimize the process to improve its effectiveness in treating antibiotics pollutants 3 1 selection of oxidants as the oxidant of aop persulfate exhibited certain advantages such as high efficiency to oxidize pollutants containing unsaturated bonds wide ph range 34 there have numerous studies shown the better performance of uvc persulfate on the degradation of a large number of antibiotics ofl 115 amx 87 cip 116 smx 117 and other sulfonamide antibiotics 118 compared with uvc h2o2 this was mainly due to firstly persulfate had a higher radical quantum yield than h2o2 eqs 1 6 87 secondly the recombination of so4 k 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 was 10 times slower than ho k 5 2 109 m 1 s 1 119 thirdly so4 produced in uvc persulfate process was an electrophilic group 118 which reacted selectively with the rich electronic antibiotics 120 in addition uv pds was less negatively affected by various water matrix components for instance compared with uv h2o2 the inhibitory effects of cl no3 ammonia and ha on the degradation of ofl lev 55 and amx 65 by uv pds were apparently weaker this was related to the rate constant of free radical scavenging reaction and the selectivity of free radicals 121 cl 65 no3 83 ammonia 89 and ha 122 had markedly lower scavenging levels of so4 than oh 123 and the inhibiting effect of 500 mm hco3 on the degradation of smx by uv pds was also lower than that of uv h2o2 process 89 because co3 generated by high concentration hco3 quenched the oxidant and the quenching rate of h2o2 was faster than that of pds 89 for the removal of some args such as blakpc 3 genes uvc pds showed a better removal effect than uvc h2o2 indicating the great potential of uvc pds for args removal 124 3 2 enhancement of process performance uv induced aop had good effect on the degradation of quinolone antibiotics cip 71 ofl 64 sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 and macrolide antibiotics ery 98 β lactam antibiotics amx 126 chloram phenicols ff cap and tap 57 and tetracycline antibiotics otc dtc 127 however the mineralization degree of antibiotics in wastewater by uv induced aop is not always acceptable the limitations of experimental conditions such as low uv fluence 87 and insufficient oxidant concentration may lead to low mineralization rate by optimizing process parameters such as adding fe2 catalyst 128 or extending the reaction time 129 the mineralization rate of antibiotics was dramatically increased the application of uv radiation and fe2 catalyst exhibited satisfactory synergetic effect and achieved dual activation of pds 128 in addition adding pre magnetized fe0 catalyst to uv h2o2 system achieved deep mineralization of secondary wastewater 130 in the heterogeneous uv pre magnetized fe0 h2o2 system the uv light facilitated the oxidation of fe0 to fe2 which could catalyze the homogeneous fenton like reaction and improve the degradation and mineralization of antibiotics in secondary effluents 130 the uv based photocatalytic oxidation reactions might take place in both on the catalyst surfaces with heterogeneous catalyst and in solution with homogeneous oxidant simultaneously 131 the addition of heterogeneous tio2 catalyst to uv induced system and the addition of oxidant to uv catalyzed aop significantly improved original process performance adding tio2 to uv pds system enhanced the pollutant elimination efficiency considering that the photogenerated holes and electrons generated on the tio2 surface may increase the production of free radicals thus promoting the activation of pds in the solution media 131 besides in heterogeneous uv tio2 system additional h2o2 in the solution enhanced reaction with conduction band electron and o2 to form additional oh doubling the degradation efficiency of amx amp and cloxacillin clx 132 hence the combination of uv light catalyst and oxidant in heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation system revealed great application potential in addition it has been reported that the toxicity of wastewater treated by uv based aops might increase 125 antibiotics were likely to be oxidized to produce toxic organic intermediates 125 which could be further degraded by extending reaction time 57 73 thus the phytotoxicity of urban wastewater treated by uvc pds was significantly increased first and then markedly decreased 98 however as for uv chlorine aop the biotoxicity was increased by high free chlorine concentration 112 and long reaction time 71 because byproducts such as dcan and chloral might be produced 71 thus it is necessary to control the reaction time and free chlorine injection in uv chlorine process hospital wastewater was completely detoxified by uv chlorine treatment with low concentration free chlorine and appropriate reaction time 112 3 3 modification of uv light sources low pressure mercury lamps emitting 254 nm monochromatic light are commonly used as uv light sources which contain harmful mercury 133 according to the minamata convention on mercury a variety of mercury containing products should be phased out before 2020 and alternative mercury free uv sources must be used in uv based aops 111 in recent years the emerging ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have been widely used due to their energy saving environmental friendliness and the flexibility to combine with specific wavelengths 134 135 compared with traditional mercury lamps uv led had the advantage of setting the ultraviolet radiation wavelength to the maximum damage wavelength of protein 136 or the maximum absorption wavelength of antibiotics so uv led 275 nm chlorine effectively eliminated ery 137 and cip 112 uv led 275 nm h2o2 112 uv led 280 nm h2o2 138 uv led 280 nm pds 139 also degraded cip effectively however the low irradiation intensity of uv led led to low photo quantum yield and low generating efficiency of free radical in uv based aops which in turn contributed to the low mineralization efficiency of antibiotics 138 so further improvements are needed such as coupling dozens of uv led chips to improve irradiance intensity 140 which has huge application potential 141 in addition compared with traditional mercury lamps uv leds showed the following advantages in removing arb and args first high efficiency and low energy uv leds were more suitable for removing args that required larger uv fluence 142 second uv led reduced antibiotic resistance better than low pressure mercury lamps 142 and uv led combined with low dose chlorine 1 2 mg l 1 notably refrained the horizontal gene transfer of args 143 144 third uv led could be efficiently turned on and off at high frequencies thereby providing higher photonic efficiency for uv based aops 145 and it was more suitable for small scale facilities such as hospital wastewater treatment plants 112 there is great potential of using uv led based aops to remove antibiotics pollutants in wastewater in the process of uv induced aop using uv led as the light source we can combine the maximum absorption wavelength of antibiotics the maximum damage wavelength of protein 275 280 nm the maximum damage wavelength of dna 260 270 nm to explore the possibility of eliminating antibiotic arb and args to the maximum extent at the same time 4 performance of uv based aops in various water matrix the complexity of wastewater had a certain influence on the uv based aops to treat antibiotics pollutants therefore investigating the removal of antibiotics pollutants in wastewater by uv based aops is an indispensable step to promote uv based aops from laboratory research to practical applications uv based aops significantly removed quinolone antibiotics cip 71 ofl 64 sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 macrolide antibiotics ery 99 β lactam antibiotics amx 126 chloramphenicols ff cap and tap 57 tetracycline antibiotics otc dtc 127 a variety of sulfonamide antibiotics smx 125 sdm 63 sulfathiazole sulfisoxazole sulfamonomethoxine sulfamethoxypyridazine sulfadiazine 118 as well as arb 125 and args 146 in general as the complexity of the water matrix increased the effectiveness of uv based aops in removing antibiotics pollutants decreased 45 4 1 artificial water due to the effectiveness of uv induced aop good removal efficiency of antibiotics was obtained in ion containing mixed water 71 or bottled water 99 and the effect of ions in ionized water on uv induced aop was negligible table 3 because inorganic ions scavenged free radical 147 and generated daughter radicals with certain oxidizing ability 148 4 2 natural water although not as good as ionized water uv induced aop was effective in the degradation of the antibiotic in natural water bodies for instance smx achieved 90 degradation in natural water by uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 149 cip reached 80 3 degradation in surface water by uvc chlorine 71 table 3 since the nom absorbed ultraviolet light and quenched free radicals 150 151 the combined effect of ultraviolet radiation and oxidant such as h2o2 in natural waters was poor in the degradation of cip 127 hence it is essential to pretreat the nom in natural water bodies 107 152 the photocatalytic performance of uv catalyzed aop in natural water matrices was commonly inhibited which could be attributed to the abilities of ions to compete for the reactive species and to adsorb on the tio2 surface sites 66 meanwhile high ionic strengths in natural water made tio2 particles form larger agglomerate reducing the effective surface area and thus inhibiting the light absorption and mass transfer process in uv tio2 system 153 4 3 secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant in the secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant the removal effect of antibiotics by uv based aops was significantly reduced 99 for example the degradation efficiency of cap was reduced by 10 in the process of uvc h2o2 154 and the removal efficiency of cip was decreased by 25 8 in the process of uvc chlorine 71 table 3 the high toc and high turbidity and defom in the secondary wastewater may cause uv light shielding and free radical scavenging effects thereby affecting the direct and indirect photolysis of antibiotics 105 compared with natural water bodies the removal of antibiotics in complex water bodies such as secondary wastewater required higher oxidant dosage 39 and uv fluence 155 the high concentration organic substances in wastewater reacted with most of the active species to inhibit the inactivation of arb 156 however in the study of uv induced aop to remove arb in secondary wastewater 125 and municipal wastewater 124 researchers found that wastewater matrix had no significant effect on the inactivation of arb even the organic and inorganic substances in the secondary wastewater acted as light filters 157 and free radical scavengers 110 the uv light still had a strong and rapid disinfection effect on arb 157 in addition sheldon et al 158 discover that secondary wastewater matrix was beneficial to the inactivation of resistant e coli during uvc chlorine treatment which may be related to the interaction between arb and water matrix components 158 it is known that cod ammonia nitrogen suspended solids dissolved oxygen and temperature of wastewater may affect the relative content of args and have different effects on different args 160 161 however mckinney et al 146 found that the secondary wastewater had almost no effect on the removal of some args ampc teta meca and vana by uv chlorine in addition compared with clean water the removal of args in secondary wastewater required a higher uv fluence 162 the uv fluence and oxidant dosage required for the removal of antibiotics pollutants in the wastewater are higher than the theoretical value the inhibition effect on antibiotic photocatalytic degradation was highly relevant to the combined effect of the mixed matrix constituents in real secondary effluent 102 dimitrakopoulou et al 159 claimed that inorganic ions and organic matter in secondary effluent demonstrated reactive species scavenging effects and thus considerably inhibited amx degradation in simulated secondary wastewater the complete degradation of smx was achieved by increasing the reaction time of uva tio2 to 5 times 132 besides the use of tio2 immobilized system seemed to be less negatively affected by the chemical composition of wastewater 132 4 4 other types of water urine inhibited the degradation process of antibiotics by uv induced aop but it was not as significant as secondary wastewater 118 the inhibitory effect of fresh urine on the degradation of smx by uvc h2o2 and uvc pds was stronger than that of hydrolyzed urine unlike the citric acid and urea in fresh urine the inorganic urine components chloride carbonate and ammonia in hydrolyzed urine reacted with free radicals to generate daughter radicals such as rns to oxidize antibiotics 89 in addition zhu et al 64 found that the seawater matrix promoted the removal of ofloxacin by uv pds which is related to the free radical reaction involving high concentration br hco3 and cl 148 5 conclusions and prospects as a developing tertiary treatment process uv based aops effectively removed various antibiotics arb and args in the wastewater most inorganic ions and organic substances in wastewater presented certain impact on the performance of uv based aops through a series of reactions such as reactive species scavenging in addition antibiotics arb and args in wastewater might interact with each other during the simultaneous removal process although uv based aops faced the challenges such as being easily affected by water matrix constituents causing the incomplete degradation of antibiotics and the generation of toxic organic intermediates these disadvantages can be overcomed by selecting dominant oxidants optimizing process parameters selecting energy saving and environmentally friendly uv led as ultraviolet light sources etc through process parameters optimization the degradation process of antibiotics from various kind of wastewater by uv based aops could be improved and the inhibition effect of different water matrix components could be eliminated overall this review provides a critical summary of antibiotics pollutants removal by uv based aops in wastewater thus achieving antibiotics pollutants removal with cost saving and environment friendly prospects in wastewater based on the current applications of uv based aops on the removal of antibiotics pollutants in wastewater the following perspectives are proposed for future research i due to the different types and concentrations of water matrix components and antibiotics pollutants in wastewaters uv based aops present a certain degree of complexity in the practical application process water quality parameter modeling and simultaneous removal modeling of antibiotics pollutants are necessary to simulate the complex reaction of uv based aops in wastewater it is difficult to quantificationally assess the heterogeneous mass transfer process in uv catalyzed aop so other methods should be carried out to evaluate the application process of uv based aops in real wastewater such as introducing a parameter like total free radical scavenging rate to analyze the impact of matrix components ii in order to thoroughly control the antibiotic resistance dissemination risk the mineralization rate and transformation of antibiotics intermediate products should be examined the photoreactivation and dark repair of arb and the spread of antibiotic resistant determinants should be detected to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of uv based aops iii the heterogeneous catalyst oxidant system reveals great sustainable application perspective when using heterogeneous catalyst in uv based aops for antibiotics pollutants treatment the reduction of energy consumption and reagents dosage the catalytic performance and stability of catalysts are the major concerns iv uv leds have developed as an alternative source of uv irradiation with low operational cost and excellent sustainability the combination of multi wavelength and potential synergistic effect as well as different operational conditions such as pulse irradiation should be explored in turn to investigate the process efficacy of simultaneous removal of different resistant pollutants in wastewater in addition the vacuum ultraviolet irradiation has also emerged as an efficient candidate for uv based aops it is a promising and competitive technology which needs further research v the safety of treated wastewater by uv based aops ought to be assessed by using a complete set of toxicity assessment methods and the environmental impact of the uv based aops needs to be explored and improved appropriate post processing could be introduced to moderate the process impact and the green and harmless catalyst should be developed to maintain a safe public health and protect the environment in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13194,the removal of natural organic matter nom from water was studied using polyacrylonitrile pan electrospun nanofibrous membrane enm coated with haops heated aluminum oxide particles the removal efficiencies of virgin pan and haop coated pan were examined and the suitability of pan as a support material for haops was studied the membranes were characterized with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds as well as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps several analytical techniques were applied to both the feed and the permeate to assess the effectiveness of nom removal in filtration of lake water haops efficiency in nom removal was 56 measured by uv254 absorbance but when it comes to virgin pan membrane the removal efficiency was only 13 in case of filtration of nom s high molecular weight component such as humic acid ha the rejection rate of ha was maintained above 97 of aromatic compounds of nom and above 43 of total organic carbon toc additionally ha adsorption by haops were fitted to isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich models the results showed that langmuir model could fit the data better than freundlich model the kinetics of ha adsorption by haops were also fitted to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order and for the initial ha concentration of 19 9 mg l the pseudo first order equation fitted the experimental data better with correlation coefficient of r2 0 8336 the results demonstrate that pan enm filtration has the potential to be employed as a pretreatment in water treatment and haop coated pan enm can significantly enhance the removal of nom keywords membrane fouling natural organic matter pan membrane electrospun nanofiber membranes haops precoated filtration 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a type of water contaminant that needs to be removed in the process of water treatment noms form a heterogeneous mixture of naturally occurring organic compounds such as biopolymers proteins and organic acids they are derived from degradation of biological materials that vary greatly in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics 1 given their complex nature there is no definitive way yet of quantitatively assessing noms presence in water the most commonly used surrogates include measurement of concentrations of toc total organic carbon doc dissolved organic carbon cod chemical oxygen demand in water as well as uv absorbance 2 humic substances hs are widely considered to be the main component of nom the hs can be divided into three groups depending on the method of isolation fulvic acid fa humic acid ha and humin 3 the presence of hs deteriorates organoleptic properties of water including color taste and odor and increases the amount of disinfectant needed in addition nom may also affect formation of biological growth in drinking water s distribution system because carbon is the main constituent of nom measuring concentrations of doc and toc have been considered reliable methods in quantitative determination of nom total concentration uv absorbance on the other hand provide an approximation of color based organics mostly ha brandstetter et al 1996 reported close correlation between doc concentration and uv absorbance at 254 nm 4 suva specific ultraviolet absorption is the fraction of the uv absorbance divided by doc concentration another surrogate used to assess the amount of nom is cod that is a measurement of the oxygen required to oxidize soluble and particulate organic matter in water other measures of presence of noms in water are hydrophobicity molecular weight aromaticity and presence of specific functional groups using different analytical methods spectroscopic chromatographic mass spectrometric etc as the requirements for quality of drinking water are becoming more and more stringent nowadays more complex treatment systems are in demand the most common methods for nom removal are enhanced coagulation and adsorption other methods include ion exchange membrane filtration and ozonation in the past few decades membrane processes have been used widely for removal of nom and a number of other contaminants from water in more complex situations where more stringent water quality is at hand coupling membranes with other processes such as coagulation adsorption on activated carbon oxidation biofiltration or ion exchange has been practiced of these an integrated process combining low pressure membrane filtration with adsorption has recently received more attention the downside of direct membrane application for nom removal is membrane flux decline due to accumulation of the substances on the surface of the membrane rejection of nom by low pressure filtration membranes is highly dependent on the individual characteristics of the membrane itself chemistry and pore size distribution and the specific characteristics of nom 1 many studies reported that pre treatment prior to a membrane process plays a critical role in the performance life expectancy and the overall operating costs of these systems 1 5 6 adsorptive membranes am combine the functions of adsorption and filtration in this process the adsorbents are embedded in the surface and pore wall of polymer membranes instead of being added to the feed water during water filtration through the membrane the active binding sites of the membrane adsorb the target pollutants and efficiently remove them from water 7 the removal mechanism of am has been attributed to several factors including electro viscous effect ion exchange and complexation electrostatic attraction and exclusion electrostatic attraction and complexation and size and charge exclusion 5 7 for example many synthesized polymers with special functional groups e g amine carboxyl and sulfonic acid have been reported to exhibit highly efficient adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions 6 7 different approaches have been implemented in order to fabricate am for instance using membrane precursors with an affinity to target compounds modification of the membrane surface with functional groups or embedding adsorbents into membrane matrices 8 recently more attention has been given to the membranes prepared via electrospinning technique electrospun nanofibrous membranes enms have found applications in direct filtration or as a support layer for thin film composites tfcs 9 13 enms enhance adsorption and have good filtration properties among various polymers that have been used for fabricating enms the most common is polyacrylonitrile pan pan membranes have been reported to have good thermal and mechanical stability and good performance in aqueous filtration 6 12 most of the work to date on the modification of these membranes has been dedicated to enhancing the anti fouling performance and functionalization of pan groups the most common approach to enhance pan efficiency in aqueous filtration is modification of the enm surface with a thin selective coating layer through crosslinking or interfacial polymerization the most widely used techniques for this purpose are oxidation plasma treatment surface nanoparticles coating grafting and solvent vapor treatment there are also approaches to surface modification by interfacial polymerization or treatment with chemicals or heat 10 13 14 electrospun pan nanofibrous membranes were tested for their ability to filter biofouling 15 many recent studies reported modified pan enm as adsorptive membrane to remove heavy metals 16 24 in most of these studies the surface of the membrane was functionalized with diethylenetriamine for adsorption of cu2 ag fe2 and pb2 ions 16 other researchers modified the adsorptive pan membrane surface by implementation of hydroxylamine hydrochloride 22 or application of chelating group 17 chauque et al 2016 reported that modification of pan surface with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid increased the efficiency of cr3 and cd2 removal from water 19 while yang et al 2014 created pan thiol modified nanofibrous cellulose in order to increase removal of cr3 and pb2 6 chemical precipitation or coagulation and flocculation with various aluminum or iron salts have been widely used in water treatment for removal of organic matter from water haops heated aluminum oxide particles are based on aluminum sulphate particles and were recommended to use in a hybrid adsorption system followed by membrane filtration originally they were used as a layer pre deposited onto the ultrafiltration membrane surface as opposed to the support structure to remove major components of organic matter responsible for fouling the biggest advantage of immobilizing haops on the membrane surface is its effectiveness in removing high molecular weight nom with high specific uv absorbance at 254 nm and relatively easy removal of an already depleted haops layer various studies are currently underway to develop the most favorable structure to support haops molecules and implement them in a fully automated pilot system 25 33 in this paper the new application of pan membrane was investigated this study utilized pan active membrane layer and pan layer coated with haops the removal efficiency of electrospun pan nanofibrous membranes was tested for adsorption of nom from aqueous solution the main objective was to improve the physical properties of the membrane to remove nom the physical modification consisted of depositing haops onto pan membrane surface the benefits of passing water through a pre deposited layer of haops has been reported before 28 30 the main advantage of this solution is that the haops were deposited on the membrane instead of being added to feed water haops were shown to preferentially adsorb foulant over non foulant nom molecules 26 28 however until now the adsorption properties of pan membrane itself have not been verified on natural water so far most of the research on pan membrane efficiency have been focused on adsorption of organic dyes as a substitute of organic impurities in order to simulate the composition of freshwater commonly found in lakes and rivers 2 materials and methods raw water was collected from lake ontario lo toronto on the water contained from 2 to 6 8 mg l of toc and exhibited uv254 absorbance between 0 024 and 0 038 1 cm haops were synthesized according to kim et al 2010 briefly hydrated aluminum sulfate was neutralized to ph 7 and then was heated at 110 c in closed containers for 24 h then cooled down to room temperature before use 31 humic acid ha and polyacrylonitrile pan polymer with an average molecular weight of 150 kda were purchased from sigma aldrich canada the solvent for polymer solution was reagent grade dimethylformamide dmf from caledon laboratory chemicals canada 2 1 fabrication of pan the electrospinning apparatus used to prepare the enms was a kh 1 1 type electrostatic spinning machine manufactured by ji nan liang rui technology co china high voltage power supply dalian had an adjustable output voltage of 0 50 kv at an output power up to 0 3 kw it was powered from a standard single phase source at 110 v and 60 hz the polymer solution was delivered to a nozzle where high voltage was applied applied electrospinning conditions are presented in table 1 electrospinning was carried out using a standard single nozzle setup ne 1600 new era pump systems usa and the produced fibers were captured on a rotating drum the enams were collected after 16 h of electrospinning a detailed description of the process can be found in 34 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of carbon in the feed and permeate water samples were measured using hach toc analyzer uv spectra were recorded with lambda 25 uv vis spectrometer at wavelengths from 200 to 700nm a particular attention was paid to 254 nm which is known as an indicator of nom s aromatic substance content the uv254 nm was monitored during the filtration process in both feed and permeate to allow determining the removal efficiency mass spectrometry was used for qualitative and quantitative detection of compounds the non targeted analysis was implemented to elucidate the structures of unknown ions by full scan mass spectra mass detection was performed using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface esi the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter ftir technique with the perkin elmer uatr single bounce with znse diamond crystal was utilized to study the different chemical bonds present in the feed and the permeate morphologies of surface and cross sections of membranes were examined by the field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi su5000 equipped with a bruker xflash 6160 energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the eds measurements were performed by using an using accelerating voltage of 15 kv x ray spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a thermo scientific k alpha instrument to evaluate chemical composition of the membrane s surface the main purpose was to investigate changes in both topography and chemical functionality of pan surface the wettability of enms fibers was determined by contact angle measurements the measurements were carried out using video based optical contact angle measuring system oca 15ec the sessile drop method was applied to the tests pan membranes were cut into 47mm diameter discs fit into the filter cartridge pall co new york ny the unit was running in a dead end mode at operating conditions of 100 l m2 h lmh the ambient temperature was 25 2 c before starting the experiments membranes were soaked in deionized di water for about 3h water flux was calculated as follows 1 j w v a m t where j w is water flux l m2 h v is the volume of water passed through the membrane l t is the duration of the filtration h and a m is the effective membrane area m2 the rejection rate can be expressed by the following formula 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where r is rejection rate c p is the permeate concentration mg l and cf is the feed concentration mg l the same equation was used to calculate the removal efficiency 2 3 adsorption isotherm and kinetics for adsorption isotherms the mass of 5 mg of haops was added to 100 ml of water containing different concentrations of ha 1 77 4 67 6 37 12 mgc l first the solution was stirred for 24 h and water samples were collected every 30 min for the initial 3 h then followed by collection every hour and analyzed to determine the equilibrium concentration c e the equilibrium was determined when the difference between 3 consecutive measurements was smaller than 5 data analysis indicated that equilibrium was attained after 90 min the adsorbed quantity q e was calculated according to 3 q e c o c e v m where qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g co is the initial concentration

respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface characterization sem was used to obtain images of pan enms with and without haop coating before and after filtration fig 1 shows images of these membranes images 1 a to 1 c depict virgin pan before filtration at three resolutions images 1 d to 1 f show virgin pan after filtering raw water from lake ontario images 1 g to 1 i illustrate haop coated pan before filtration and images 1 j to 1 k show the haop coated pan after raw water is filtered through it the virgin pan images 1 a to 1 c contained fibers with an average diameter of 255 nm the fibers were nicely layered with interconnected pores ranging from a few microns to a few tens of microns the pores are large enough to allow passage of water with minimum resistance after filtering the raw water images 1 d to 1 f a few particles foulants were attached to the fibers the sems confirmed that the large pores of pan enm were not capable of removing pollutants by size exclusion or through adsorption coating the pan membrane with a layer of haop both reduced the pore size and introduced adsorption sites the pore size reduction was not enough to support size exclusion filtration but increased the applied pressure required for the water to pass through the membrane the adsorption sites on the other hand significantly enhanced the removal efficiency these effects are shown in images 1 g to 1 l as shown in the figures the haop coat layer was dense and amorphous the fouling material and the microorganisms are considered to be the initial colonizers followed by diatoms and algae 35 eds spectra revealed the presence of the atomic elements in the evaluated membranes figs 2 to 5 fig 2 shows the sem image and the corresponding eds spectrum of the aforementioned membranes obtained pictures show that carbon predominates in all samples which was anticipated since membrane samples weren t coated before sem analysis the composition of the virgin membrane is typical of carbon and nitrogen fig 2 whereas in pan membrane after filtration oxygen appears along with carbon and nitrogen fig 3 in contrast to the previously discussed samples in the case of samples with haops there is no nitrogen peak in haop coated pan samples before filtration elements such as carbon oxygen aluminum sulphur and sodium were found fig 4 most of these elements are part of haops and eds spectra revealed uniform distribution of all constituents in haop coated pan samples after filtration carbon oxygen aluminum and sulphur were identified fig 5 additionally eds analysis detected calcium and silicon fig 5 d h and d f in the fouling layers indicating that nom silicon and calcium were involved in the fouling process table 2 presents summary of the atomic composition of the evaluated membranes 3 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 6 shows the spectra of pan and haop coated pan before and after filtration the chemical composition and oxidation states of major elements present on the surfaces of the membrane samples are also reported in table 3 the most noticeable peaks on the spectra correspond to carbon oxygen and nitrogen which in the case of a virgin pan appear at 297 98 ev for c1s 545 08 ev for o1s and 410 08 ev for n1s the xps results for pan membranes after filtration fig 6b indicate that the measured carbon oxygen and nitrogen contents were similar to those in virgin pan membranes which signals inefficient nom retention by pan alone haops coated membrane before filtration fig 6c was characterized by the presence of oxygen o1s carbon c1s nitrogen n1s and alum al2p as well as traces of sulphur s and sodium na presence of these elements as the main building blocks of haops suggest that haops effectively covered membrane surface after filtration increases in carbon nitrogen and aluminum were observed which is probably related to the retention of certain constituents of nom probably carboxylic and amides compounds on the haops surface this finding was in good agreement with the sem results spectrum of the sample before filtration was characterized by one peak only at 285 0 ev for carbon while after filtration two peaks appeared at 285 0 ev and 288 68 ev that dominated the c1s spectrum the peak at 285 0 ev is usually associated with the binding energy of the c atoms in aromatic group while the peak at 288 68 ev can be attributed to binding energy of c atoms in the carboxylate group of nom 36 the spectra in the o1s region also showed differences before and after filtration before filtration two peaks were recorded at 532 48 ev and 537 28 ev after filtration only one peak at 532 48 was present however interpretation of the o1s spectra can be challenging because organic contamination makes it difficult to discern carbonates in the o1s region 37 additionally the appearance of n1s with binding energy of about 410 ev is most probably due to the presence of chemical n o bonds which can be caused by nitrogen atoms adsorbed on the oxide surface shankar chellam et al 2014 correlated the increase of n c ratio with the application of efficient organic removal 38 the amount of nitrogen in relation to carbon n c increased from 0 06 to 0 1 therefore the increase of nitrogen can indicate that haops effectively reduced organic fouling finally the analysis also revealed the presence of al2p table 3 in sample before filtration the peak was approximately at 70 ev and after filtration it increased to approximately 74 ev which suggests that aluminum exists as aluminum oxides or aluminum chloride trace signatures of ca s si and f were also present at or below 0 5 relative atomic percentage the variation in the chemical composition of the membrane surface after coating was as expected the increase of the binding energy of the n1s can be correlated with the process that resulted in oxidation of the carbon atoms connected to amine groups which led to the formation of amide groups and probably some imides on the other hand another study investigated the thermal cross linking of pan membrane surface reported that dehydrogenation and chain scission reaction results in removal of oxygen from the pan chain allowing it to participate in the reaction to form a cross linking structure 39 40 nom is composed of large fractions of aliphatic and aromatic substances and other functional groups usually attachment of nom to hydrophobic surfaces takes place through hydrophobic attraction additionally sorption of compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen atom are influenced by hydrogen bonding between haops and foulants 3 3 wettability contact angle measurements provided information on wettability hydrophilicity of the membranes while a contact angle greater than 90 indicates hydrophobicity pan nanofibers showed a contact angle of approximately 127 the average contact angle values are presented in table 4 in general a hydrophobic surface is thought to prevent fouling as shown in table 4 the contact angles decreased after fouling but remained above 90 this observation indicated that hydrophilic foulants were not strong enough to change the hydrophobic nature of the membranes 41 the haop coated pan exhibited higher contact angle indicating a more hydrophobic surface and therefore less susceptible to fouling and the reduction in hydrophobicity was more significant in haop coated membrane which indicates accumulation of hydrophilic material on the surface of the membrane nom consist of mainly proteins and carbohydrates with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties the majority of the noms are hydrophobic yet it has been reported that nom exhibit strong adhesive potential with hydrophobic membranes 35 also the contact angle has been reported to be time dependent 42 which explains why the contact angle of haop coated membrane dropped sharply after filtration 4 removal efficiency concentrations of nom in the feed and the permeate were determined by elemental analysis and removal efficiency of the membranes were calculated using eq 2 4 1 uv254nm toc the nom removal efficiency was measured by uv254nm and toc the uv235nm is used to determine nom s aromatic compounds dissolved and double bonded carbon in the sample and that the latter is used for quantitative measurement of total organic carbon constituent of nom the removal efficiency measured by uv254 absorbance was up to 13 for pan and up to 56 for haop coated pan corresponding values calculated using toc measurements were 43 5 for pan and 91 for haop coated pan as explained in the introduction section the discrepancy between the two methods comes from the target measurements of the two techniques when uv254 targets dissolved carbon and double bond carbons toc measurement returns the total organic carbon despite the differences both techniques were indicative of improved removal efficiency of haop coated versus virgin pan other studies report a higher removal efficiency when uv254 is used compared to toc 26 27 28 this difference may be due to the differences in properties of the water samples used in the two studies 4 2 ft ir ft ir enables identification of the chemical composition of noms and their specific spectral features e g bands much of the nom s chemical activities has been attributed to high concentration of oxygen containing group particularly carboxyl groups additionally during filtration nom s carboxylic and phenolic groups form more complex group with hydroxyl group 43 presented ft ir spectrum revealed that the bands for amide were weaker than those carbohydrate ft ir spectra of the samples are shown in fig 7 the main signals were associated with oh stretching in carbohydrates co stretching in aromatic and n c o in amides compounds of nom the signal at 3300 3400 cm 1 in this figure is likely due to carbohydrates the stretching and bending modes of adsorbed water molecules which may correspond to oh bending vibration and the signal at 1635 cm 1 is attributed to amide 1 peak the results indicated that major portion of nom can be associated with high quantity of carbohydrates and fewer aromatic groups the presence of carbohydrates indicates that nom comprised of terrestrial plants dominated by cellulose and hemicelluloses the a e uv vis ir spectral software was used to perform uv vis absorption spectral analysis first normalization of total intensity area normalization was applied and then calculation of the overlap of the spectra was made the relative peak heights in the three normalized spectra suggest that of 5 of nom s constitutes in the lake ontario were removed by haops treatment whereas aromatic compounds of nom were removed much less efficiently 4 3 mass spectrometry the mass spectrometry provides the molecular formulas of complex nom structure fig 8 outlines a general scheme of mass distribution in feed and in treated water the total of 58 compounds were identified the elution time of extracted ion chromatograms was between 0 57 and 13 63 min the feed s molecular weight varied between 150 and 886 6 da pan was efficient in removing compounds with an average mass of 388 8 da and molecular formula of c20h21cln2o4 while pan coated with haops was better at removing compounds with an average mass of 364 1 da and molecular formula of c21h16o6 the van krevelen diagrams as illustrated in fig 9 incorporates chemical information depicted by various h c and o c ratios and allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related nom compounds 44 the diagram helps discern the types of molecules present in the sample the results as shown in fig 9 were created with the application of kew et all 2017 method to visualize complex ms datasets of dom 45 the diagram classified components in 7 main categories lipids peptides amino sugars carbohydrates lignin tannins and hydrocarbons of all the components of nom significant amounts of condensed hydrocarbons carbohydrates and polyphenols were detected amino acids possibly with some amino sugars were also observed the chlorinated species in the evaluated samples can be explained by the presence of nacl salt and chloride adduct during ms analysis 4 4 filtration tests the electrospun pan membranes can be characterized by a low pressure build up during the filtration before the application of feed water di water was passed through the unit for 30 min and the difference in tmp was monitored the recorded pressure during di filtration was 40 66 kpa during the filtration tests using lake ontario water as feed the pressure did not increase above 41 kpa the pressure build up on virgin pan membrane increased negligibly from 40 66 to 40 71 kpa indicating insignificant fouling the additional haops layer didn t increase the pressure significantly that is during 10 h of filtration no pressure build up was recorded coating pan surface with haops however resulted in formation of a gel like structure that covered the membrane surface the surface of pan membrane is hydrophobic this is probably because haops created a gel like structure that attracted nom to its surface with no significant pressure increase the pressure build up observed in this study was in good agreement with previously published 25 27 29 31 in subsequent filtration experiments where ha was used as feed three different fluxes 300 150 and 100 lmh were applied to the haops coated membrane the duration of each experiment was adjusted so that the total permeate volume was one liter in all tests regardless of the applied flux no or negligible pressure build up was observed the only noticeable pressure build up was observed in case of 300 lmh flux and concentration of 10 mgc l at 0 06 kpa the rejection rate of ha was maintained above 97 of aromatic compounds of nom and above 43 of total organic carbon toc in general higher removal efficiency was observed at higher carbon content of the feed as well as at higher flux the results are shown in table 5 the results are consistent with previous reports indicating higher flux stimulates rapid foulant deposition and more compressed foulant layer resulting in higher pressure increase 32 4 5 adsorption studies the removal of nom by the haops measured using uv254 is shown in fig 10 as in earlier reports 28 nom removal increased sharply with increasing haops concentration up to 50 mg l modelling and interpretation of haops absorption kinetics is problematic due to nom complex nature moreover nom is not 100 adsorbable by the oxide adsorbents even at high adsorbent dosage 28 therefore single component isotherms may not be appropriate for adsorption behavior of multi component systems like nom in water for this reason in this study ha was selected as a substitute for nom haops effectiveness in ha removal was also confirmed earlier 27 31 the values of corresponding isotherm parameters are listed in table 6 fig 11 shows langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms of the ha on haops high correlation coefficients r 2 0 90 indicated that both langmuir and freundlich models matched the experimental data in this study the langmuir isotherms describes the adsorption kinetics better than freundlich isotherm with a correlation value of r2 0 9926 however both models showed high degree of fit and can adequately be used to interpret the adsorption data at tested concentration ranges the complex nature of nom could contribute to the fact that some of its components can exhibit disparate adsorption behaviors i e certain components follow langmuir while others follow freundlich model however lee and lee 2021 describing the adsorption mechanism by haops when uranium from groundwater was used also pointed out that adsorption onto haops was a single layer through the chemical adsorption rather than multi layer and hole diffusion 46 on the other hand siamak and benjamin 2018 investigated the removal of nom from water by mixtures of haops and pac 33 they recommended to evaluate this competitive adsorption by treating the nom as comprising two fictive components one component that is adsorbable on haops and a second one that cannot adsorb on haops with that assumption they recommended to use modification of the classical langmuir isotherm for nom removal evaluation however they also pointed out that nom is a mixture of different chemical components what implicate different affinities to the surface for the initial ha concentration of 19 9 mg l the pseudo first order equation fitted the experimental data better with correlation coefficient of r2 0 8336 compared to the pseudo second model with r2 0 7612 the appropriate model to describe the adsorption kinetics was determined based on the comparison of r2 and standard deviation since pseudo first order model fits the data better it suggests the adsorption between functional groups and ha is closer to physical model of adsorption the parameters for the first and second order kinetics are reported in table 7 during nom absorption onto haops the conceal of small and medium molecular weight nom constituent by nom s macromolecular was found 31 the higher affinity of haops to aromatic nom structures might be correlated with hydrophobic interaction pre depositing a layer of haops directly onto the membrane surface combines adsorption granular media filtration and membrane filtration the major removal mechanism can be assigned to the adsorption that occurs at particular homogeneous sites on the surface of the adsorbent the langmuir isotherm gives the best fit to ha adsorption on haops additionally ha adsorption on haops follows the pseudo second order kinetic model yet clark and lucas 1997 reported that in case of the adsorption of macromolecules such as ha a number of phenomena could be responsible for multiple time scale adsorption 47 additionally the distribution of ha near the interface and the electrostatic humic humic and humic oxide interactions might affect the adsorption process 5 summary this study shows that the use of haops coated pan enms is a promising technique for efficient removal of nom the plain pan membrane did not remove nom satisfactorily which may be due to the applied manufacturing procedure however the electrospinning technique offers many possibilities for modification of created membranes in the post or pre spinning processes in order to develop a membrane that will be targeted to remove a specific contaminant pan membranes can also perform as a support structure due to their low pressure build up during filtration the filtration properties of the pan enms suggest that they can be successfully applied instead of conventional membranes and serve as an effective barrier in the pretreatment process at the same time it is suggested to carry out more research on natural waters due to differences in the quantity and quality of nom in different locations the pressure increase recorded during the tests was negligible 0 05 kpa this suggests that this type of membrane can be used as a support structure for haops the main conclusions of the study can be summarized as follows nom removal efficiency of electrospun pan was up to 13 while the efficiency of haops was 56 measured by uv254 absorbance however when ha was used as a feed the efficiency for that nom fraction increased above 97 and remained there practically regardless of the applied flux without the modification of pan functional group it can be used as a pretreatment or support layer for another membrane the coating of pan membrane is efficient way to remove nom form natural water and can be used as a pre filtration step the adsorption isotherm data of nom s high molecular weight component such as ha adsorption by haops were fitted to isotherm models the results showed that the langmuir model could fit the data better than the freundlich declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13194,the removal of natural organic matter nom from water was studied using polyacrylonitrile pan electrospun nanofibrous membrane enm coated with haops heated aluminum oxide particles the removal efficiencies of virgin pan and haop coated pan were examined and the suitability of pan as a support material for haops was studied the membranes were characterized with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds as well as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps several analytical techniques were applied to both the feed and the permeate to assess the effectiveness of nom removal in filtration of lake water haops efficiency in nom removal was 56 measured by uv254 absorbance but when it comes to virgin pan membrane the removal efficiency was only 13 in case of filtration of nom s high molecular weight component such as humic acid ha the rejection rate of ha was maintained above 97 of aromatic compounds of nom and above 43 of total organic carbon toc additionally ha adsorption by haops were fitted to isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich models the results showed that langmuir model could fit the data better than freundlich model the kinetics of ha adsorption by haops were also fitted to the pseudo first order and pseudo second order and for the initial ha concentration of 19 9 mg l the pseudo first order equation fitted the experimental data better with correlation coefficient of r2 0 8336 the results demonstrate that pan enm filtration has the potential to be employed as a pretreatment in water treatment and haop coated pan enm can significantly enhance the removal of nom keywords membrane fouling natural organic matter pan membrane electrospun nanofiber membranes haops precoated filtration 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a type of water contaminant that needs to be removed in the process of water treatment noms form a heterogeneous mixture of naturally occurring organic compounds such as biopolymers proteins and organic acids they are derived from degradation of biological materials that vary greatly in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics 1 given their complex nature there is no definitive way yet of quantitatively assessing noms presence in water the most commonly used surrogates include measurement of concentrations of toc total organic carbon doc dissolved organic carbon cod chemical oxygen demand in water as well as uv absorbance 2 humic substances hs are widely considered to be the main component of nom the hs can be divided into three groups depending on the method of isolation fulvic acid fa humic acid ha and humin 3 the presence of hs deteriorates organoleptic properties of water including color taste and odor and increases the amount of disinfectant needed in addition nom may also affect formation of biological growth in drinking water s distribution system because carbon is the main constituent of nom measuring concentrations of doc and toc have been considered reliable methods in quantitative determination of nom total concentration uv absorbance on the other hand provide an approximation of color based organics mostly ha brandstetter et al 1996 reported close correlation between doc concentration and uv absorbance at 254 nm 4 suva specific ultraviolet absorption is the fraction of the uv absorbance divided by doc concentration another surrogate used to assess the amount of nom is cod that is a measurement of the oxygen required to oxidize soluble and particulate organic matter in water other measures of presence of noms in water are hydrophobicity molecular weight aromaticity and presence of specific functional groups using different analytical methods spectroscopic chromatographic mass spectrometric etc as the requirements for quality of drinking water are becoming more and more stringent nowadays more complex treatment systems are in demand the most common methods for nom removal are enhanced coagulation and adsorption other methods include ion exchange membrane filtration and ozonation in the past few decades membrane processes have been used widely for removal of nom and a number of other contaminants from water in more complex situations where more stringent water quality is at hand coupling membranes with other processes such as coagulation adsorption on activated carbon oxidation biofiltration or ion exchange has been practiced of these an integrated process combining low pressure membrane filtration with adsorption has recently received more attention the downside of direct membrane application for nom removal is membrane flux decline due to accumulation of the substances on the surface of the membrane rejection of nom by low pressure filtration membranes is highly dependent on the individual characteristics of the membrane itself chemistry and pore size distribution and the specific characteristics of nom 1 many studies reported that pre treatment prior to a membrane process plays a critical role in the performance life expectancy and the overall operating costs of these systems 1 5 6 adsorptive membranes am combine the functions of adsorption and filtration in this process the adsorbents are embedded in the surface and pore wall of polymer membranes instead of being added to the feed water during water filtration through the membrane the active binding sites of the membrane adsorb the target pollutants and efficiently remove them from water 7 the removal mechanism of am has been attributed to several factors including electro viscous effect ion exchange and complexation electrostatic attraction and exclusion electrostatic attraction and complexation and size and charge exclusion 5 7 for example many synthesized polymers with special functional groups e g amine carboxyl and sulfonic acid have been reported to exhibit highly efficient adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions 6 7 different approaches have been implemented in order to fabricate am for instance using membrane precursors with an affinity to target compounds modification of the membrane surface with functional groups or embedding adsorbents into membrane matrices 8 recently more attention has been given to the membranes prepared via electrospinning technique electrospun nanofibrous membranes enms have found applications in direct filtration or as a support layer for thin film composites tfcs 9 13 enms enhance adsorption and have good filtration properties among various polymers that have been used for fabricating enms the most common is polyacrylonitrile pan pan membranes have been reported to have good thermal and mechanical stability and good performance in aqueous filtration 6 12 most of the work to date on the modification of these membranes has been dedicated to enhancing the anti fouling performance and functionalization of pan groups the most common approach to enhance pan efficiency in aqueous filtration is modification of the enm surface with a thin selective coating layer through crosslinking or interfacial polymerization the most widely used techniques for this purpose are oxidation plasma treatment surface nanoparticles coating grafting and solvent vapor treatment there are also approaches to surface modification by interfacial polymerization or treatment with chemicals or heat 10 13 14 electrospun pan nanofibrous membranes were tested for their ability to filter biofouling 15 many recent studies reported modified pan enm as adsorptive membrane to remove heavy metals 16 24 in most of these studies the surface of the membrane was functionalized with diethylenetriamine for adsorption of cu2 ag fe2 and pb2 ions 16 other researchers modified the adsorptive pan membrane surface by implementation of hydroxylamine hydrochloride 22 or application of chelating group 17 chauque et al 2016 reported that modification of pan surface with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid increased the efficiency of cr3 and cd2 removal from water 19 while yang et al 2014 created pan thiol modified nanofibrous cellulose in order to increase removal of cr3 and pb2 6 chemical precipitation or coagulation and flocculation with various aluminum or iron salts have been widely used in water treatment for removal of organic matter from water haops heated aluminum oxide particles are based on aluminum sulphate particles and were recommended to use in a hybrid adsorption system followed by membrane filtration originally they were used as a layer pre deposited onto the ultrafiltration membrane surface as opposed to the support structure to remove major components of organic matter responsible for fouling the biggest advantage of immobilizing haops on the membrane surface is its effectiveness in removing high molecular weight nom with high specific uv absorbance at 254 nm and relatively easy removal of an already depleted haops layer various studies are currently underway to develop the most favorable structure to support haops molecules and implement them in a fully automated pilot system 25 33 in this paper the new application of pan membrane was investigated this study utilized pan active membrane layer and pan layer coated with haops the removal efficiency of electrospun pan nanofibrous membranes was tested for adsorption of nom from aqueous solution the main objective was to improve the physical properties of the membrane to remove nom the physical modification consisted of depositing haops onto pan membrane surface the benefits of passing water through a pre deposited layer of haops has been reported before 28 30 the main advantage of this solution is that the haops were deposited on the membrane instead of being added to feed water haops were shown to preferentially adsorb foulant over non foulant nom molecules 26 28 however until now the adsorption properties of pan membrane itself have not been verified on natural water so far most of the research on pan membrane efficiency have been focused on adsorption of organic dyes as a substitute of organic impurities in order to simulate the composition of freshwater commonly found in lakes and rivers 2 materials and methods raw water was collected from lake ontario lo toronto on the water contained from 2 to 6 8 mg l of toc and exhibited uv254 absorbance between 0 024 and 0 038 1 cm haops were synthesized according to kim et al 2010 briefly hydrated aluminum sulfate was neutralized to ph 7 and then was heated at 110 c in closed containers for 24 h then cooled down to room temperature before use 31 humic acid ha and polyacrylonitrile pan polymer with an average molecular weight of 150 kda were purchased from sigma aldrich canada the solvent for polymer solution was reagent grade dimethylformamide dmf from caledon laboratory chemicals canada 2 1 fabrication of pan the electrospinning apparatus used to prepare the enms was a kh 1 1

h of electrospinning a detailed description of the process can be found in 34 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of carbon in the feed and permeate water samples were measured using hach toc analyzer uv spectra were recorded with lambda 25 uv vis spectrometer at wavelengths from 200 to 700nm a particular attention was paid to 254 nm which is known as an indicator of nom s aromatic substance content the uv254 nm was monitored during the filtration process in both feed and permeate to allow determining the removal efficiency mass spectrometry was used for qualitative and quantitative detection of compounds the non targeted analysis was implemented to elucidate the structures of unknown ions by full scan mass spectra mass detection was performed using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface esi the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter ftir technique with the perkin elmer uatr single bounce with znse diamond crystal was utilized to study the different chemical bonds present in the feed and the permeate morphologies of surface and cross sections of membranes were examined by the field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi su5000 equipped with a bruker xflash 6160 energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the eds measurements were performed by using an using accelerating voltage of 15 kv x ray spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a thermo scientific k alpha instrument to evaluate chemical composition of the membrane s surface the main purpose was to investigate changes in both topography and chemical functionality of pan surface the wettability of enms fibers was determined by contact angle measurements the measurements were carried out using video based optical contact angle measuring system oca 15ec the sessile drop method was applied to the tests pan membranes were cut into 47mm diameter discs fit into the filter cartridge pall co new york ny the unit was running in a dead end mode at operating conditions of 100 l m2 h lmh the ambient temperature was 25 2 c before starting the experiments membranes were soaked in deionized di water for about 3h water flux was calculated as follows 1 j w v a m t where j w is water flux l m2 h v is the volume of water passed through the membrane l t is the duration of the filtration h and a m is the effective membrane area m2 the rejection rate can be expressed by the following formula 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where r is rejection rate c p is the permeate concentration mg l and cf is the feed concentration mg l the same equation was used to calculate the removal efficiency 2 3 adsorption isotherm and kinetics for adsorption isotherms the mass of 5 mg of haops was added to 100 ml of water containing different concentrations of ha 1 77 4 67 6 37 12 mgc l first the solution was stirred for 24 h and water samples were collected every 30 min for the initial 3 h then followed by collection every hour and analyzed to determine the equilibrium concentration c e the equilibrium was determined when the difference between 3 consecutive measurements was smaller than 5 data analysis indicated

respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface characterization sem was used to obtain images of pan enms with and without haop coating before and after filtration fig 1 shows images of these membranes images 1 a to 1 c depict virgin pan before filtration at three resolutions images 1 d to 1 f show virgin pan after filtering raw water from lake ontario images 1 g to 1 i illustrate haop coated pan before filtration and images 1 j to 1 k show the haop coated pan after raw water is filtered through it the virgin pan images 1 a to 1 c contained fibers with an average diameter of 255 nm the fibers were nicely layered with interconnected pores ranging from a few microns to a few tens of microns the pores are large enough to allow passage of water with minimum resistance after filtering the raw water images 1 d to 1 f a few particles foulants were attached to the fibers the sems confirmed that the large pores of pan enm were not capable of removing pollutants by size exclusion or through adsorption coating the pan membrane with a layer of haop both reduced the pore size and introduced adsorption sites the pore size reduction was not enough to support size exclusion filtration but increased the applied pressure required for the water to pass through the membrane the adsorption sites on the other hand significantly enhanced the removal efficiency these effects are shown in images 1 g to 1 l as shown in the figures the haop coat layer was dense and amorphous the fouling material and the microorganisms are considered to be the initial colonizers followed by diatoms and algae 35 eds spectra revealed the presence of the atomic elements in the evaluated membranes figs 2 to 5 fig 2 shows the sem image and the corresponding eds spectrum of the aforementioned membranes obtained pictures show that carbon predominates in all samples which was anticipated since membrane samples weren t coated before sem analysis the composition of the virgin membrane is typical of carbon and nitrogen fig 2 whereas in pan membrane after filtration oxygen appears along with carbon and nitrogen fig 3 in contrast to the previously discussed samples in the case of samples with haops there is no nitrogen peak in haop coated pan samples before filtration elements such as carbon oxygen aluminum sulphur and sodium were found fig 4 most of these elements are part of haops and eds spectra revealed uniform distribution of all constituents in haop coated pan samples after filtration carbon oxygen aluminum and sulphur were identified fig 5 additionally eds analysis detected calcium and silicon fig 5 d h and d f in the fouling layers indicating that nom silicon and calcium were involved in the fouling process table 2 presents summary of the atomic composition of the evaluated membranes 3 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 6 shows the spectra of pan and haop coated pan before and after filtration the chemical composition and oxidation states of major elements present on the surfaces of the membrane samples are also reported in table 3 the most noticeable peaks on the spectra correspond to carbon oxygen and nitrogen which in the case of a virgin pan appear at 297 98 ev for c1s 545 08 ev for o1s and 410 08 ev for n1s the xps results for pan membranes after filtration fig 6b indicate that the measured carbon oxygen and nitrogen contents were similar to those in virgin pan membranes which signals inefficient nom retention by pan alone haops coated membrane before filtration fig 6c was characterized by the presence of oxygen o1s carbon c1s nitrogen n1s and alum al2p as well as traces of sulphur s and sodium na presence of these elements as the main building blocks of haops suggest that haops effectively covered membrane surface after filtration increases in carbon nitrogen and aluminum were observed which is probably related to the retention of certain constituents of nom probably carboxylic and amides compounds on the haops surface this finding was in good agreement with the sem results spectrum of the sample before filtration was characterized by one peak only at 285 0 ev for carbon while after filtration two peaks appeared at 285 0 ev and 288 68 ev that dominated the c1s spectrum the peak at 285 0 ev is usually associated with the binding energy of the c atoms in aromatic group while the peak at 288 68 ev can be attributed to binding energy of c atoms in the carboxylate group of nom 36 the spectra in the o1s region also showed differences before and after filtration before filtration two peaks were recorded at 532 48 ev and 537 28 ev after filtration only one peak at 532 48 was present however interpretation of the o1s spectra can be challenging because organic contamination makes it difficult to discern carbonates in the o1s region 37 additionally the appearance of n1s with binding energy of about 410 ev is most probably due to the presence of chemical n o bonds which can be caused by nitrogen atoms adsorbed on the oxide surface shankar chellam et al 2014 correlated the increase of n c ratio with the application of efficient organic removal 38 the amount of nitrogen in relation to carbon n c increased from 0 06 to 0 1 therefore the increase of nitrogen can indicate that haops effectively reduced organic fouling finally the analysis also revealed the presence of al2p table 3 in sample before filtration the peak was approximately at 70 ev and after filtration it increased to approximately 74 ev which suggests that aluminum exists as aluminum oxides or aluminum chloride trace signatures of ca s si and f were also present at or below 0 5 relative atomic percentage the variation in the chemical composition of the membrane surface after coating was as expected the increase of the binding energy of the n1s can be correlated with the process that resulted in oxidation of the carbon atoms connected to amine groups which led to the formation of amide groups and probably some imides on the other hand another study investigated the thermal cross linking of pan membrane surface reported that dehydrogenation and chain scission reaction results in removal of oxygen from the pan chain allowing it to participate in the reaction to form a cross linking structure 39 40 nom is composed of large fractions of aliphatic and aromatic substances and other functional groups usually attachment of nom to hydrophobic surfaces takes place through hydrophobic attraction additionally sorption of compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen atom are influenced by hydrogen bonding between haops and foulants 3 3 wettability contact angle measurements provided information on wettability hydrophilicity of the membranes while a contact angle greater than 90 indicates hydrophobicity pan nanofibers showed a contact angle of approximately 127 the average contact angle values are presented in table 4 in general a hydrophobic surface is thought to prevent fouling as shown in table 4 the contact angles decreased after fouling but remained above 90 this observation indicated that hydrophilic foulants were not strong enough to change the hydrophobic nature of the membranes 41 the haop coated pan exhibited higher contact angle indicating a more hydrophobic surface and therefore less susceptible to fouling and the reduction in hydrophobicity was more significant in haop coated membrane which indicates accumulation of hydrophilic material on the surface of the membrane nom consist of mainly proteins and carbohydrates with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties the majority of the noms are hydrophobic yet it has been reported that nom exhibit strong adhesive potential with hydrophobic membranes 35 also the contact angle has been reported to be time dependent 42 which explains why the contact angle of haop coated membrane dropped sharply after filtration 4 removal efficiency concentrations of nom in the feed and the permeate were determined by elemental analysis and removal efficiency of the membranes were calculated using eq 2 4 1 uv254nm toc the nom removal efficiency was measured by uv254nm and toc the uv235nm is used to determine nom s aromatic compounds dissolved and double bonded carbon in the sample and that the latter is used for quantitative measurement of total organic carbon constituent of nom the removal efficiency measured by uv254 absorbance was up to 13 for pan and up to 56 for haop coated pan corresponding values calculated using toc measurements were 43 5 for pan and 91 for haop coated pan as explained in the introduction section the discrepancy between the two methods comes from the target measurements of the two techniques when uv254 targets dissolved carbon and double bond carbons toc measurement returns the total organic carbon despite the differences both techniques were indicative of improved removal efficiency of haop coated versus virgin pan other studies report a higher removal efficiency when uv254 is used compared to toc 26 27 28 this difference may be due to the differences in properties of the water samples used in the two studies 4 2 ft ir ft ir enables identification of the chemical composition of noms and their specific spectral features e g bands much of the nom s chemical activities has been attributed to high concentration of oxygen containing group particularly carboxyl groups additionally during filtration nom s carboxylic and phenolic groups form more complex group with hydroxyl group 43 presented ft ir spectrum revealed that the bands for amide were weaker than those carbohydrate ft ir spectra of the samples are shown in fig 7 the main signals were associated with oh stretching in carbohydrates co stretching in aromatic and n c o in amides compounds of nom the signal at 3300 3400 cm 1 in this figure is likely due to carbohydrates the stretching and bending modes of adsorbed water molecules which may correspond to oh bending vibration and the signal at 1635 cm 1 is attributed to amide 1 peak the results indicated that major portion of nom can be associated with high quantity of carbohydrates and fewer aromatic groups the presence of carbohydrates indicates that nom comprised of terrestrial plants dominated by cellulose and hemicelluloses the a e uv vis ir spectral software was used to perform uv vis absorption spectral analysis first normalization of total intensity area normalization was applied and then calculation of the overlap of the spectra was made the relative peak heights in the three normalized spectra suggest that of 5 of nom s constitutes in the lake ontario were removed by haops treatment whereas aromatic compounds of nom were removed much less efficiently 4 3 mass spectrometry the mass spectrometry provides the molecular formulas of complex nom structure fig 8 outlines a general scheme of mass distribution in feed and in treated water the total of 58 compounds were identified the elution time of extracted ion chromatograms was between 0 57 and 13 63 min the feed s molecular weight varied between 150 and 886 6 da pan was efficient in removing compounds with an average mass of 388 8 da and molecular formula of c20h21cln2o4 while pan coated with haops was better at removing compounds with an average mass of 364 1 da and molecular formula of c21h16o6 the van krevelen diagrams as illustrated in fig 9 incorporates chemical information depicted by various h c and o c ratios and allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related nom compounds 44 the diagram helps discern the types of molecules present in the sample the results as shown in fig 9 were created with the application of kew et all 2017 method to visualize complex ms datasets of dom 45 the diagram classified components in 7 main categories lipids peptides amino sugars carbohydrates lignin tannins and hydrocarbons of all the components of nom significant amounts of condensed hydrocarbons carbohydrates and polyphenols were detected amino acids possibly with some amino sugars were also observed the chlorinated species in the evaluated samples can be explained by the presence of nacl salt and chloride adduct during ms analysis 4 4 filtration tests the electrospun pan membranes can be characterized by a low pressure build up during the filtration before the application of feed water di water was passed through the unit for 30 min and the difference in tmp was monitored the recorded pressure during di filtration was 40 66 kpa during the filtration tests using lake ontario water as feed the pressure did not increase above 41 kpa the pressure build up on virgin pan membrane increased negligibly from 40 66 to 40 71 kpa indicating insignificant fouling the additional haops layer didn t increase the pressure significantly that is during 10 h of filtration no pressure build up was recorded coating pan surface with haops however resulted in formation of a gel like structure that covered the membrane surface the surface of pan membrane is hydrophobic this is probably because haops created a gel like structure that attracted nom to its surface with no significant pressure increase the pressure build up observed in this study was in good agreement with previously published 25 27 29 31 in subsequent filtration experiments where ha was used as feed three different fluxes 300 150 and 100 lmh were applied to the haops coated membrane the duration of each experiment was adjusted so that the total permeate volume was one liter in all tests regardless of the applied flux no or negligible pressure build up was observed the only noticeable pressure build up was observed in case of 300 lmh flux and concentration of 10 mgc l at 0 06 kpa the rejection rate of ha was maintained above 97 of aromatic compounds of nom and above 43 of total organic carbon toc in general higher removal efficiency was observed at higher carbon content of the feed as well as at higher flux the results are shown in table 5 the results are consistent with previous reports indicating higher flux stimulates rapid foulant deposition and more compressed foulant layer resulting in higher pressure increase 32 4 5 adsorption studies the removal of nom by the haops measured using uv254 is shown in fig 10 as in earlier reports 28 nom removal increased sharply with increasing haops concentration up to 50 mg l modelling and interpretation of haops absorption kinetics is problematic due to nom complex nature moreover nom is not 100 adsorbable by the oxide adsorbents even at high adsorbent dosage 28 therefore single component isotherms may not be appropriate for adsorption behavior of multi component systems like nom in water for this reason in this study ha was selected as a substitute for nom haops effectiveness in ha removal was also confirmed earlier 27 31 the values of corresponding isotherm parameters are listed in table 6 fig 11 shows langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms of the ha on haops high correlation coefficients r 2 0 90 indicated that both langmuir and freundlich models matched the experimental data in this study the langmuir isotherms describes the adsorption kinetics better than freundlich isotherm with a correlation value of r2 0 9926 however both models showed high degree of fit and can adequately be used to interpret the adsorption data at tested concentration ranges the complex nature of nom could contribute to the fact that some of its components can exhibit disparate adsorption behaviors i e certain components follow langmuir while others follow freundlich model however lee and lee 2021 describing the adsorption mechanism by haops when uranium from groundwater was used also pointed out that adsorption onto haops was a single layer through the chemical adsorption rather than multi layer and hole diffusion 46 on the other hand siamak and benjamin 2018 investigated the removal of nom from water by mixtures of haops and pac 33 they recommended to evaluate this competitive adsorption by treating the nom as comprising two fictive components one component that is adsorbable on haops and a second one that cannot adsorb on haops with that assumption they recommended to use modification of the classical langmuir isotherm for nom removal evaluation however they also pointed out that nom is a mixture of different chemical components what implicate different affinities to the surface for the initial ha concentration of 19 9 mg l the pseudo first order equation fitted the experimental data better with correlation coefficient of r2 0 8336 compared to the pseudo second model with r2 0 7612 the appropriate model to describe the adsorption kinetics was determined based on the comparison of r2 and standard deviation since pseudo first order model fits the data better it suggests the adsorption between functional groups and ha is closer to physical model of adsorption the parameters for the first and second order kinetics are reported in table 7 during nom absorption onto haops the conceal of small and medium molecular weight nom constituent by nom s macromolecular was found 31 the higher affinity of haops to aromatic nom structures might be correlated with hydrophobic interaction pre depositing a layer of haops directly onto the membrane surface combines adsorption granular media filtration and membrane filtration the major removal mechanism can be assigned to the adsorption that occurs at particular homogeneous sites on the surface of the adsorbent the langmuir isotherm gives the best fit to ha adsorption on haops additionally ha adsorption on haops follows the pseudo second order kinetic model yet clark and lucas 1997 reported that in case of the adsorption of macromolecules such as ha a number of phenomena could be responsible for multiple time scale adsorption 47 additionally the distribution of ha near the interface and the electrostatic humic humic and humic oxide interactions might affect the adsorption process 5 summary this study shows that the use of haops coated pan enms is a promising technique for efficient removal of nom the plain pan membrane did not remove nom satisfactorily which may be due to the applied manufacturing procedure however the electrospinning technique offers many possibilities for modification of created membranes in the post or pre spinning processes in order to develop a membrane that will be targeted to remove a specific contaminant pan membranes can also perform as a support structure due to their low pressure build up during filtration the filtration properties of the pan enms suggest that they can be successfully applied instead of conventional membranes and serve as an effective barrier in the pretreatment process at the same time it is suggested to carry out more research on natural waters due to differences in the quantity and quality of nom in different locations the pressure increase recorded during the tests was negligible 0 05 kpa this suggests that this type of membrane can be used as a support structure for haops the main conclusions of the study can be summarized as follows nom removal efficiency of electrospun pan was up to 13 while the efficiency of haops was 56 measured by uv254 absorbance however when ha was used as a feed the efficiency for that nom fraction increased above 97 and remained there practically regardless of the applied flux without the modification of pan functional group it can be used as a pretreatment or support layer for another membrane the coating of pan membrane is efficient way to remove nom form natural water and can be used as a pre filtration step the adsorption isotherm data of nom s high molecular weight component such as ha adsorption by haops were fitted to isotherm models the results showed that the langmuir model could fit the data better than the freundlich declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
