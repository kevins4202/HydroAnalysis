14585,the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of the geometric configuration aspect ratio in unplanted horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands systems hssf cws in the adjustment of reaction coefficients from different equations for estimation of organic matter decay to that end prototypes of unplanted hssf cw of equal volumes and length width ratios l w of 1 0 4 0 and 7 3 were utilized the absence of plants is due to eliminate another factors of influence in reactor hydrodynamics all hssf cws were filled with gravel 0 d10 4 5 mm and received pre settled sewage during a period of 90 days in which bod5 and cod were monitored in the influent and effluent from the systems to the experimental cod and bod5 total and soluble forms data the first order kinetics model fokm and its modification mfokm first order kinetic residual concentration rcm and retardation rm models were fitted higher coefficients of determination were obtained with the mfokm and rm equations with the poorer fitting being associated with the fokm the different geometric configurations of the hssf cws did not lead to noticeable alterations in the removal of organic matter however the decay coefficient that was obtained as a function of the hydraulic retention time in the systems 2 8 days has indicated a tendency for increase with an increase of the l w ratio with the exception of soluble cod decay key words mathematical modelling biological treatment pollutant removal treatment systems 1 introduction constructed wetlands systems cws are treatment units filled with support medium commonly finer grained rocks and planted with different plant species however it is found in the literature variations without substrate that could be denominated macrophytes ponds and without plants that would approach lagoons of stone 1 2 among the units the horizontal subsurface flow wetlands systems hssf cw are the most widespread in the usa and europe 3 and the most studied in brazil 4 however there is still not a consensus about the sizing of these systems which leads to a diversity of designs that according to langergraber et al 5 are still based upon empiricism some designs are based on compliance with established discharge standards for effluents coming from regional environmental legislations others on per capita area or loading ratios there are also those which utilize a more theoretical procedure based upon the pollutants decay equations many of which applicable to systems with completely different characteristics from those of the cws 2 6 for kincanon and mcanally 7 marsili libelli and checchi 8 and małoszewski et al 9 these systems performance which are a funtion of their physical chemical and biological characteristics may be predicted through mathematical models according to pedescoll et al 10 in hssf cws water tends to flow along the pathway of least hydraulic resistance which is influenced by different design parameters and operational aspects including the length to width ratio 11 and the inlet and outlet position 12 among so many variables and design possibilities kadlec and wallace 2 consider the best cws sizing strategy those that shows greater technical scientific basis simplicity and good results according to kadlec 13 rousseau et al 14 and sezerino et al 6 the most widely applied and recommended mathematical models for describing organic matter decay are based on first order kinetics fokm the first publications about this theme have suggested that the biological removal model should assume a first order decay kinetics coupled with a plug flow hydraulic model 15 as presented on the traditional eq 1 1 ce c0 e k0 hrt where ce is the effluent concentration mg l 1 c0 the influent concentration mg l 1 k0 the fokm decay coefficient d 1 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time d however in practice this model has not presented good fitting to experimental data as the reactors do not have an ideal hydraulic behaviour owing to the occurrence of anomalies in the flow as dispersion short circuits and dead zone presence 16 also because of that and the recalcitrance of some fractions of the compounds it is not possible to obtain a complete removal of organic matter another fact that influences the performance is the hydraulic retention time hrt since the biodegradability of the organic matter varies along the travelling time within the longitudinal axis for these reasons some adaptations to the fokm have been proposed 17 21 these adaptations consist basically in the inclusion of a term referring to the residual organic matter concentration in the system or mathematical modifications to make the decay coefficient k0 variable with the hrt one possibility when recognizing that the treatment unit does not behave as an ideal plug flow reactor is to use the dispersed flow model 22 which requires the utilization of another coefficient dispersion number d another widely used possibility is to use the n tanks in series model n tis 2 which in this case aims to reproduce the hydraulic behaviour of each wetland unit as a series of n reactors kadlec and wallace 2 further advanced this reasoning by incorporating the effect of the reduction of the biodegradability of the organic matter by assuming that the number of tanks in series is lower than n in this case they propose the concept of apparent number of tanks in series p in which p n these approaches will not be discussed here because the essence of the work is to propose adjustments in the traditional first order model and plug flow equations the adaptations proposed can be also incorporated in the dispersed flow and the n tis models and do not require that n is modified to a lower value p it is known that some variables can influence on the hydraulic behaviour of a reactor the presence of plants influences other factors and therefore some authors have analysed hydrodynamic aspects in these systems without their presence matos et al 23 for example observed different values of dispersion number in unplanted and planted before and after the cut the aerial part however the geometric configuration aspect ratio was the aspect most study and associated with the hydraulic behaviour of a reactor influencing and by that reason with the adjustment of kinetic models developed to describe the removal of organic matter when reactors were utilized in the wastewater treatment 16 24 it is expected that the longer the reactor with greater length width l w more the hydrodynamic conditions of the reactor approach the plug flow in this work the objective was to evaluate the adjustment of the first order kinetics residual concentration retardation and modified first order kinetics models to the experimental data obtained in unplanted hssf cws with different geometric configurations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted in the interior of a greenhouse installed in the agricultural engineering department of federal university of viçosa ufv viçosa minas gerais brazil with geographic coordinates of latitude 20 45 12 s and longitude 42 52 53 w and average altitude of 650 m the influent used in the research was raw sewage rs drawn from the sewerage network of the bosque acamari condominium and its surroundings whose main characteristics are shown in table 1 the rs was pumped to a storage reservoir from where every 5 days it was repumped into a 1000 l reservoir installed in the interior of the greenhouse from this reservoir it was distributed to the hssf cws through three prominet concept peristaltic pumps with a maximum flow of 5 3 l h 1 during the whole experimental period the peristaltic pumps operated with a mean flow of 0 030 m3 d 1 which provided a hrt in the wetland units close to 2 8 days a period that is considered enough to evaluate the organic matter removal process in the evaluated systems this hrt was defined considering that the theoretical specifications of the reactor and does not considering shortcuts or evapotranspiration in the system the hssf cws used in the evaluations were built in a pilot scale being made of fiberglass boxes all with a total volume of 0 40 m3 the width and length dimensions varied between the cws being 1 00 m 1 00 m in cw1 2 00 0 50 m on cw2 and 2 70 0 37 m on cw3 which provided length width ratios l w of 1 0 4 0 and 7 3 respectively as shown on table 2 the cws were filled up with medium to a height of 0 25 m in relation to the bottom and the water level was kept at 0 20 m leaving therefore a freeboard of 0 05 m and were not planted the support medium used in the filling of all cws was constituted by gravel 0 diameters d10 4 47 mm d60 9 25 mm uniformity coefficient 2 07 and initial void or pore volume of 0 420 m3 m 3 reused from experiments conducted previously 25 26 before introducing in the fiberglass boxes the gravel was passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove the fine fraction the cws operated in parallel with the influent distribution made by a pvc tube 25 mm with the exit placed at the half depth of the liquid column 0 10 m from the bottom as shown on fig 1 at this point a t connection was installed on which a perforated tube was adjusted that performed the distribution of the rs through all the width at the inlet of the cws the effluent collection was made by the bottom of the opposite end also by a perforated tube positioned in such a way as to cover all the width on the external part a vertical tube was coupled to act in the control of the rs height in the interior of the hssf cws a grid of collection points was installed along each hssf cw being made of 32 mm diameter pvc tubes which had the base perforated to allow the free entry of rs in the sample collecting tube these tubes were placed 2 by 2 in four equidistant positions along the draining direction on the hssf cws fig 1 2 2 monitoring campaigns the experiment had a duration of 90 days between the months of june and august of 2015 mild winter in brazil sample collection started only after 30 days when the biological system was already stabilized it is important to highlight that the support medium had already been used in other cw treatment experiments and therefore already had an attached biofilm which accelerated the biomass stabilization process monitoring was comprised of six sampling campaigns always in the mornings at a frequency of one campaign every 10 days during these campaigns samples from the influent single sample effluent and intermediate positions of the hssf cw were collected since there were two parallel tubes at each intermediate point the sample from each point was composed of 300 ml from each of them the effluent samples were collected on the exit of each hssf cw the collected samples were accommodated in a thermic box with ice and carried to the water quality lab of the agricultural engineering department ufv for analysis characteristics such as temperature and flow were measured in loco with the temperature measured by a mercury thermometer and the sewage flow by the direct volumetric method in the water quality lab in accordance to the standard methods for water and wastewater examination 27 28 recommendations total and soluble cod analysis by the open reflux chemical oxidation method and total and soluble bod 5 by the winkler method were made the total and soluble cod and bod5 variables were analysed considering the evaporation water losses assuming that those happened homogeneously in all hrt with the concentration corrections made proportionally to the distance of each sampled position as shown on eq 2 2 c c 1 q 0 q e q 0 c l c m where q0 is the influent flow to the system m3 d 1 qe the effluent flow from the system m3 d 1 c the distance from inlet to any longitudinal position inside the unit m l the total length of the unit m cc the corrected concentration for water losses mg l 1 and cm is the measured concentration mg l 1 2 3 evaluated decay models of organic matter as first order kinetic model fokm eq 1 does not provided good fitting to organic matter decay of real reactors others models were developed kadlec and knight 17 proposed the residual concentration model rcm or k c the modify in the fokwm was an inclusion of a residual recalcitrant concentration c approaches reality since the equation avoids the organic matter concentration in the effluent to reach the value of zero such as presented on eq 3 3 c e c c0 c e kcr hrt in which c is the residual concentration mg l 1 and kcr is the rcm decay coefficient d 1 shepherd et al 20 proposed the retardation model rm as shown in eq 4 which takes into consideration the correction of the organic matter decay coefficient through an adjustment equation eq 5 4 c e c 0 b h r t 1 k r e t b where kret is the rm decay coefficient and b is the time delay coefficient d 1 brasil et al 21 with the same intent but in a different way proposed the insertion of a coefficient n as a power parameter of the variable hrt on eq 1 obtaining eq 5 which expresses the modified first order kinectic model mfokm 5 c e c 0 e k b h r t n the coefficient n according to the authors has the goal of correcting the inadequacies from dispersive effects provided by flow by means of an adjustment in the hrt the mfokm showed to provide substantial improvements in the fitting to experimental data as can be verified in the works of the author himself 21 and those of chagas et al 29 and fia et al 30 von sperling analysed the mfokm equation eq 5 developed by brasil et al 21 and proposed developments of the exponential term in a similar way to what was undertaken by shepherd et al 20 i e the insertion of an adjustment for the organic matter decay coefficient with the hrt so that it would be possible to show the cited model in the fokm format as shown in eq 6 31 6 kb hrtn kb hrtn 1 hrt kf hrt hrt where kb is the mfokm decay coefficient d 1 and kf hrt is the variable decay coefficient in function of hrt to be utilized in the corrected fokm d 1 in this way kf hrt is the decay coefficient varying with the hrt on the system that incorporates the decrease in the biodegradability of the remaining organic material in the wastewater in treatment with the use of kf h it is possible to keep the hrt s exponent equal to 1 eliminating thus the variable n and keeping the fokm s original formulation the raw and soluble cod and bod5 data were adjusted to fokm eq 1 rcm eq 3 rm eq 4 and mfokm eq 5 model fittings were made by a simultaneous parameter estimation minimizing the sum of squared errors using originpro 9 0 software 3 results and discussion the hssf cws influent and effluent temperatures were on the range of 19 26 c during the experiment period and it was verified that the geometric configuration of the reactors did not produce a perceptible effect on this variable the effluent flow was measured six times in each hssf cw on the samples collection days having the following means standard deviations 0 0281 0 0018 m3 d 1 on cw1 0 0288 0 0024 m3 d 1 on cw2 and 0 0297 0 0032 m3 d 1 on cw3 water losses by evaporation measured by the difference between the influent and effluent flows were of 7 1 on cw1 4 8 on cw2 and 1 8 on cw3 the lower water losses were with the more elongated reactor greater l w ratio despite the exposed surface area being the same although they are relatively small these water losses by evaporation were used as shown on eq 2 to correct the total and soluble cod and bod5 concentrations along the reactors the decay on the relative corrected cod and bod5 concentrations along the length of the hssf cws is shown on fig 2 in all cases it is observed that the greater percentage reduction of the organic matter concentration occurred always on the first half of the hssf cws length a fact already reported by other authors 21 22 29 32 in a more detailed evaluation it is noted a tendency of faster decay of bod5 compared to cod which is possibly associated to the greater recalcitrance of the organic matter expressed by the latter variable it is verified that all cws showed a similar behaviour in terms of the organic matter decay along the reactor s length and it is visually not possible to identify any influence of the unplanted hssf cw geometric configuration this contradicts in a way what is established in terms of wetlands constructed systems performance according to their geometric configuration and associated flow regime 16 based in the known theories on the subject reactors with greater l w ratios should approach a plug flow regime thus leading to a greater decay of the organic matter represented by a first order reaction in this conditions the expectation is that the lower the l w ratios the closer the hydraulic regime approaches complete mixing leading to a lower decay of the pollutants which was not observed in this work corroborating what was found in the three cws garcia et al 11 stated that because of organic matter removal in hssf cws occurring mainly by physical mechanisms sedimentation and filtration the removal efficiency of this pollutant is much similar between systems with different l w when maintaining the same water depth another factor that can explain the similar behaviour of the units is fact that the flow in hssf cws porous mediums is already typically dispersed 2 being even more turbulent in presence of plants 22 23 then in planted cws the effects of the aspect ratio are expected to be even smaller for which reason the units were kept non vegetated the fokm rcm rm and mfokm models where fitted to the data shown in fig 2 and the derived model parameters and the associated coefficients of determination r2 are shown in table 3 by comparing the fitting of the models to the experimental data through the coefficients of determination r2 a good fitting for all models was verified with mfokm and rm giving the best results r2 greater than 0 98 the poorest fitting was for the conventional fokm with r2 in the range of 0 81 0 99 a behaviour also verified by fia et al 30 except for the values obtained for the rm the organic matter decay coefficients of the other mathematical models adjusted to the data obtained from the cws varied little indicating a small influence of the l w ratio in this parameter alcocer et al 33 on the other hand verified a great influence of the l w ratio on the hydraulic behaviour of hssf cws prototypes stating that the increase in this ratio provided a behaviour close to plug flow differently garcia et al 11 and zhang et al 34 concluded that the hrt and the depth of the sacs are factors of greater influence than l w in the efficiency of removal of pollutants in these systems as the conventional fokm still the most utilized model according to literature there are some values of fokm decay coefficient k0 cited in the literature that can be used to compare with the obtained ones for example in the review made by conley et al 15 for different systems operating under different conditions k0 values ranged between 0 21 and 2 92 d 1 von sperling and paoli 22 obtained k0 values of 0 92 d 1 with cod concentrations also corrected for water losses this value is higher than those found in this work 0 48 0 55 d 1 possibly due to factors such as greater system stability although as mentioned the gravel used in this experiment had been used for four years on other hssf cws the greater hrt 3 0 d 1 2 d and the period of analysis that comprises only the winter villaseñor et al 35 evaluating the treatment of synthetic sewage on hssf cws on southern spain found k0 values of 0 25 d 1 on the model fitted to data obtained from an unplanted system and values of 0 22 0 55 d 1 in planted systems brasil et al 21 obtained values of 0 50 1 44 d 1 applying increasing organic loads on planted systems after treatment in a septic tank while fia et al 30 observed k0 between 1 25 and 1 94 d 1 for bod5 and 0 79 and 1 28 d 1 for cod applying increasing organic loads of pig wastewater on unplanted hssf cws with regards to the influence of the geometric configurations on the k0 values it is verified a weak tendency of increasing this parameter value and only when adjusted to both bod5 fractions with an increase of the l w ratio the kcr values obtained with the rcm model were found to be between 0 70 and 0 93 d 1 for cod and between 0 71 0 85 d 1 for bod5 these values are higher than the 0 51 d 1 obtained at an unplanted system by villaseñor et al 35 working with synthetic sewage however they are lower than the 3 06 and 4 20 d 1 for bod5 and the 1 93 and 2 77 d 1 for cod obtained by fia et al 30 while treating piggery wastes in unplanted units they are also lower than the 1 12 d 1 obtained by von sperling and paoli 22 when treating uasb reactor effluent in an unplanted system and the 2 09 d 1 for bod5 and 1 89 for cod obtained by zurita et al 36 on sewage treatment in hssf cws cultivated with different ornamental species they are however inside the 0 16 2 07 d 1 range obtained by stein et al 37 for cod on unplanted systems utilized in the treatment of synthetic secondary sewage in general it is not verified an influence of the geometric configuration in the kcr values an increase of this parameter with l w being observed only when adjusted to soluble bod5 despite the availability of few works on the literature with the use of rm to experimental data obtained in hssf cws this model showing a removal coefficient variable with the hrt approaches what can be considered ideal on terms of modelling the decay of organic matter concentration from wastewater treated on hssf cws in this work these relations can be seen examples of the rm decay coefficient values kret obtained on the fitting of this model were made available in works as the one by villaseñor et al 35 that evaluating the treatment of synthetic sewage in hssf cws on southern spain obtained a kret of 0 75 d 1 for cod on an unplanted system by grismer et al 38 that treating winery wastewater obtained a kret of 0 31 d 1 for cod in a planted system the values obtained by shepherd et al 20 which are between 2 4 and 12 0 d 1 for cod on planted systems treating winery wastewater are greater than the ones obtained in this work which were from 0 62 to 2 30 d 1 for cod data and 0 92 2 40 d 1 for bod5 data with the higher values for bod5 due to their higher biodegradability as compared with cod in what concerns the influence of the geometric configuration on the kret values a tendency of decreasing this parameter value with the increase of l w is verified this is due to the fact that in this model the coefficient varies with hrt and b eq 4 and therefore the mutual influence of both parameters on the decay of organic matter is what should be evaluated regarding the kb and n parameters adjusted to mfokm the values between 0 52 and 0 74 d 1 are close to the ones obtained by chagas et al 29 which were of 0 45 and 0 69 d 1 on the treatment of septic tank effluent in hssf cws submitted to surface organic loading rates olr of 44 and 98 kg ha 1 d 1 cod however they are below the values of 1 23 and 1 72 d 1 obtained by the same authors by applying respectively olrs of 230 and 395 kg ha 1 d 1 of cod the values of 1 67 and 1 62 d 1 obtained by brasil et al 21 when treating sewage after septic tanks the range of 0 78 1 52 d 1 obtained by matos et al 32 when treating piggery wastes in hssf cws cultivated with different plant species and the 0 80 1 27 d 1 obtained by fia et al 30 by treating piggery wastes under various olrs it is supposed that the small dimensions of the system s prototypes used in this work have not enabled the reproduction of the same conditions such as those in larger scale systems with differences in the ecosystem complexity and removal efficiencies with respect to the influence of the geometric configuration in the kb values like it was observed in relation to kret it is verified a tendency of decreasing this parameter value with the increase of l w similarly it is due to the fact that in this model the coefficient varies with hrt and n eq 5 and therefore the mutual influence of both parameters on the decay of organic matter is what should be evaluated in relation to the parameter n adjusted to mfokm on the cod and bod5 data the values were in the rage of 0 42 0 83 brasil et al 21 when studying cattail cultivated hssf cws with l w equal to 24 in the treatment of septic tank effluents found values for n between 0 20 and 0 25 chagas et al 29 evaluating the treatment of septic tank effluent in hssf cws with l w equal to 24 cultivated with lily subjected to different olrs found values of 0 45 0 11 0 33 and 0 46 matos et al 32 found values for n between 0 07 and 0 52 on the summer and 0 32 and 0 63 on autumn and winter in brazil in the treatment of piggery wastes in hssf cws with l w equal to 21 8 cultivated with different species fia et al 30 on the treatment of piggery wastes in hssf cws on lab scale with l w equal to 4 0 uncultivated found values of n of 0 07 and 0 05 for cod and 0 44 and 0 24 for bod5 brasil et al 21 suggested that the value of n would be associated to the system dispersion and the variation in the biodegradability of the organic matter along the length of the hssf cws analysing the data of the adjusted values for the parameter n there was a relatively small variability values in the range of 0 43 0 70 for bod5 decay total and soluble in the cod curve the values of n did not allow for the verification of any tendency related to the geometry of the hssf cws the results indicated that the cw geometry did not alter significantly or did not show any identifiable association with the parameter n calculating as an example the term hrtn 1 considering hrt as 3 d used on the studies of hssf cws it is verified that the decrease of the organic matter decay coefficient adjusted to the mfokm so that it can be used on the corrected fokm varied from 17 3 to 46 2 for cod and 28 2 46 4 for bod5 on table 4 are shown the corrected decay coefficient obtained for a hrt of 3 days kf 3d evaluating the k f 3d values obtained for the different hssf cws and comparing them with the k0 obtained on the fokm adjustment it can be seen that with the exception of what has been observed in relation to soluble cod there is in relation to the first an identifiable tendency of its increase with the increase of l w suggesting a possible influence of the geometric configuration of the reactors on the organic matter decay coefficient of the wastewater under treatment it is considered that the incorporation of the parameter n on the decay coefficient variable with the hrt has made this behaviour clearer as a comparison the curves of total bod5 decay in cw 1 2 and 3 obtained for each evaluated mathematical models are presented in fig 3 as can be observed the fokm curve is the one with the lowest concavity and the least able to follow the variation in the observed data this unadjusted concavity should provide an underestimation of the ce values for lower values of hrt and overestimate for larger values being mfokm and rm the ones with the best fitting to the experimental data and based on the greater mathematical simplicity of the former it is considered that mfokm should be preferred to describe the decay of organic matter on unplanted hssf cws due to the greater simplicity in this case it is recommended to use a value of 0 657 for kb and n between 0 52 and 0 61 for n regardless of whether the equation is for estimation of total or soluble bod5 based on the results it is not recommended to change the kinetic parameters of sizing in the design of unplanted horizontal subsurface flow wetlands systems of different aspect ratio especially because more elongated reactors are more prone to clogging 4 conclusions the different geometric configurations of the hssf cws did not produce observable alterations on the organic matter removal curves although these evidences have become clearer when evaluating the parameters obtained by fitting the mathematical models for organic matter decay all evaluated mathematical models showed a good fitting to the decay of cod and bod5 total and soluble with the greater coefficients of determination r2 obtained for mfokm modified first order kinetic model rm retardation model and rcm residual concentration model on that order fokm conventional first order kinetic model provided the poorer fittings which are associated to considering the organic matter decay coefficient as a fixed value along the longitudinal path in hssf cws due to the mathematical simplicity improvements on the representation of the actual behaviour and the good fittings obtained it is considered that mfokm modified first order kinetic model should be preferred for describing organic matter decay of wastewaters treated on unplanted hssf cws the model structure is c e c 0 e k b h r t n see eq 5 based on the results it is not recommended to change the kinetic parameters of sizing in the design of

14585,the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of the geometric configuration aspect ratio in unplanted horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands systems hssf cws in the adjustment of reaction coefficients from different equations for estimation of organic matter decay to that end prototypes of unplanted hssf cw of equal volumes and length width ratios l w of 1 0 4 0 and 7 3 were utilized the absence of plants is due to eliminate another factors of influence in reactor hydrodynamics all hssf cws were filled with gravel 0 d10 4 5 mm and received pre settled sewage during a period of 90 days in which bod5 and cod were monitored in the influent and effluent from the systems to the experimental cod and bod5 total and soluble forms data the first order kinetics model fokm and its modification mfokm first order kinetic residual concentration rcm and retardation rm models were fitted higher coefficients of determination were obtained with the mfokm and rm equations with the poorer fitting being associated with the fokm the different geometric configurations of the hssf cws did not lead to noticeable alterations in the removal of organic matter however the decay coefficient that was obtained as a function of the hydraulic retention time in the systems 2 8 days has indicated a tendency for increase with an increase of the l w ratio with the exception of soluble cod decay key words mathematical modelling biological treatment pollutant removal treatment systems 1 introduction constructed wetlands systems cws are treatment units filled with support medium commonly finer grained rocks and planted with different plant species however it is found in the literature variations without substrate that could be denominated macrophytes ponds and without plants that would approach lagoons of stone 1 2 among the units the horizontal subsurface flow wetlands systems hssf cw are the most widespread in the usa and europe 3 and the most studied in brazil 4 however there is still not a consensus about the sizing of these systems which leads to a diversity of designs that according to langergraber et al 5 are still based upon empiricism some designs are based on compliance with established discharge standards for effluents coming from regional environmental legislations others on per capita area or loading ratios there are also those which utilize a more theoretical procedure based upon the pollutants decay equations many of which applicable to systems with completely different characteristics from those of the cws 2 6 for kincanon and mcanally 7 marsili libelli and checchi 8 and małoszewski et al 9 these systems performance which are a funtion of their physical chemical and biological characteristics may be predicted through mathematical models according to pedescoll et al 10 in hssf cws water tends to flow along the pathway of least hydraulic resistance which is influenced by different design parameters and operational aspects including the length to width ratio 11 and the inlet and outlet position 12 among so many variables and design possibilities kadlec and wallace 2 consider the best cws sizing strategy those that shows greater technical scientific basis simplicity and good results according to kadlec 13 rousseau et al 14 and sezerino et al 6 the most widely applied and recommended mathematical models for describing organic matter decay are based on first order kinetics fokm the first publications about this theme have suggested that the biological removal model should assume a first order decay kinetics coupled with a plug flow hydraulic model 15 as presented on the traditional eq 1 1 ce c0 e k0 hrt where ce is the effluent concentration mg l 1 c0 the influent concentration mg l 1 k0 the fokm decay coefficient d 1 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time d however in practice this model has not presented good fitting to experimental data as the reactors do not have an ideal hydraulic behaviour owing to the occurrence of anomalies in the flow as dispersion short circuits and dead zone presence 16 also because of that and the recalcitrance of some fractions of the compounds it is not possible to obtain a complete removal of organic matter another fact that influences the performance is the hydraulic retention time hrt since the biodegradability of the organic matter varies along the travelling time within the longitudinal axis for these reasons some adaptations to the fokm have been proposed 17 21 these adaptations consist basically in the inclusion of a term referring to the residual organic matter concentration in the system or mathematical modifications to make the decay coefficient k0 variable with the hrt one possibility when recognizing that the treatment unit does not behave as an ideal plug flow reactor is to use the dispersed flow model 22 which requires the utilization of another coefficient dispersion number d another widely used possibility is to use the n tanks in series model n tis 2 which in this case aims to reproduce the hydraulic behaviour of each wetland unit as a series of n reactors kadlec and wallace 2 further advanced this reasoning by incorporating the effect of the reduction of the biodegradability of the organic matter by assuming that the number of tanks in series is lower than n in this case they propose the concept of apparent number of tanks in series p in which p n these approaches will not be discussed here because the essence of the work is to propose adjustments in the traditional first order model and plug flow equations the adaptations proposed can be also incorporated in the dispersed flow and the n tis models and do not require that n is modified to a lower value p it is known that some variables can influence on the hydraulic behaviour of a reactor the presence of plants influences other factors and therefore some authors have analysed hydrodynamic aspects in these systems without their presence matos et al 23 for example observed different values of dispersion number in unplanted and planted before and after the cut the aerial part however the geometric configuration aspect ratio was the aspect most study and associated with the hydraulic behaviour of a reactor influencing and by that reason with the adjustment of kinetic models developed to describe the removal of organic matter when reactors were utilized in the wastewater treatment 16 24 it is expected that the longer the reactor with greater length width l w more the hydrodynamic conditions of the reactor approach the plug flow in this work the objective was to evaluate the adjustment of the first order kinetics residual concentration retardation and modified first order kinetics models to the experimental data obtained in unplanted hssf cws with different geometric configurations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted in the interior of a greenhouse installed in the agricultural engineering department of federal university of viçosa ufv viçosa minas gerais brazil with geographic coordinates of latitude 20 45 12 s and longitude 42 52 53 w and average altitude of 650 m the influent used in the research was raw sewage rs drawn from the sewerage network of the bosque acamari condominium and its surroundings whose main characteristics are shown in table 1 the rs was pumped to a storage reservoir from where every 5 days it was repumped into a 1000 l reservoir installed in the interior of the greenhouse from this reservoir it was distributed to the hssf cws through three prominet concept peristaltic pumps with a maximum flow of 5 3 l h 1 during the whole experimental period the peristaltic pumps operated with a mean flow of 0 030 m3 d 1 which provided a hrt in the wetland units close to 2 8 days a period that is considered enough to evaluate the organic matter removal process in the evaluated systems this hrt was defined considering that the theoretical specifications of the reactor and does not considering shortcuts or evapotranspiration in the system the hssf cws used in the evaluations were built in a pilot scale being made of fiberglass boxes all with a total volume of 0 40 m3 the width and length dimensions varied between the cws being 1 00 m 1 00 m in cw1 2 00 0 50 m on cw2 and 2 70 0 37 m on cw3 which provided length width ratios l w of 1 0 4 0 and 7 3 respectively as shown on table 2 the cws were filled up with medium to a height of 0 25 m in relation to the bottom and the water level was kept at 0 20 m leaving therefore a freeboard of 0 05 m and were not planted the support medium used in the filling of all cws was constituted by gravel 0 diameters d10 4 47 mm d60 9 25 mm uniformity coefficient 2 07 and initial void or pore volume of 0 420 m3 m 3 reused from experiments conducted previously 25 26 before introducing in the fiberglass boxes the gravel was passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove the fine fraction the cws operated in parallel with the influent distribution made by a pvc tube 25 mm with the exit placed at the half depth of the liquid column 0 10 m from the bottom as shown on fig 1 at this point a t connection was installed on which a perforated tube was adjusted that performed the distribution of the rs through all the width at the inlet of the cws the effluent collection was made by the bottom of the opposite end also by a perforated tube positioned in such a way as to cover all the width on the external part a vertical tube was coupled to act in the control of the rs height in the interior of the hssf cws a grid of collection points was installed along each hssf cw being made of 32 mm diameter pvc tubes which had the base perforated to allow the free entry of rs in the sample collecting tube these tubes were placed 2 by 2 in four equidistant positions along the draining direction on the hssf cws fig 1 2 2 monitoring campaigns the experiment had a duration of 90 days between the months of june and august of 2015 mild winter in brazil sample collection started only after 30 days when the biological system was already stabilized it is important to highlight that the support medium had already been used in other cw treatment experiments and therefore already had an attached biofilm which accelerated the biomass stabilization process monitoring was comprised of six sampling campaigns always in the mornings at a frequency of one campaign every 10 days during these campaigns samples from the influent single sample effluent and intermediate positions of the hssf cw were collected since there were two parallel tubes at each intermediate point the sample from each point was composed of 300 ml from each of them the effluent samples were collected on the exit of each hssf cw the collected samples were accommodated in a thermic box with ice and carried to the water quality lab of the agricultural engineering department ufv for analysis characteristics such as temperature and flow were measured in loco with the temperature measured by a mercury thermometer and the sewage flow by the direct volumetric method in the water quality lab in accordance to the standard methods for water and wastewater examination 27 28 recommendations total and soluble cod analysis by the open reflux chemical oxidation method and total and soluble bod 5 by the winkler method were made the total and soluble cod and bod5 variables were analysed considering the evaporation water losses assuming that those happened homogeneously in all hrt with the concentration corrections made proportionally to the distance of each sampled position as shown on eq 2 2 c c 1 q 0 q e q 0 c l c m where q0 is the influent flow to the system m3 d 1 qe the effluent flow from the system m3 d 1 c the distance from inlet to any longitudinal position inside the unit m l the total length of the unit m cc the corrected concentration for water losses mg l 1 and cm is the measured concentration mg l 1 2 3 evaluated decay models of organic matter as first order kinetic model fokm eq 1 does not provided good fitting to organic matter decay of real reactors others models were developed kadlec and knight 17 proposed the residual concentration model rcm or k c the modify in the fokwm was an inclusion of a residual recalcitrant concentration c approaches reality since the equation avoids the organic matter concentration in the effluent to reach the value of zero such as presented on eq 3 3 c e c c0 c e kcr hrt in which c is the residual concentration mg l 1 and kcr is the rcm decay coefficient d 1 shepherd et al 20 proposed the retardation model rm as shown in eq 4 which takes into consideration the correction of the organic matter decay coefficient through an adjustment equation eq 5 4 c e c 0 b h r t 1 k r e t b where kret is the rm decay coefficient and b is the time delay coefficient d 1 brasil et al 21 with the same intent but in a different way proposed the insertion of a coefficient n as a power parameter of the variable hrt on eq 1 obtaining eq 5 which expresses the modified first order kinectic model mfokm 5 c e c 0 e k b h r t n the coefficient n according to the authors has the goal of correcting the inadequacies from dispersive effects provided by flow by means of an adjustment in the hrt the mfokm showed to provide substantial improvements in the fitting to experimental data as can be verified in the works of the author himself 21 and those of chagas et al 29 and fia et al 30 von sperling analysed the mfokm equation eq 5 developed by brasil et al 21 and proposed developments of the exponential term in a similar way to what was undertaken by shepherd et al 20 i e the insertion of an adjustment for the organic matter decay coefficient with the hrt so that it would be possible to show the cited model in the fokm format as shown in eq 6 31 6 kb hrtn kb hrtn 1 hrt kf hrt hrt where kb is the mfokm decay coefficient d 1 and kf hrt is the variable decay coefficient in function of hrt to be utilized in the corrected fokm d 1 in this way kf hrt is the decay coefficient varying with the hrt on the system that incorporates the decrease in the biodegradability of the remaining organic material in the wastewater in treatment with the use of kf h it is possible to keep the hrt s exponent equal to 1 eliminating thus the variable n and keeping the fokm s original formulation the raw and soluble cod and bod5 data were adjusted to fokm eq 1 rcm eq 3 rm eq 4 and mfokm eq 5 model fittings were made by a simultaneous parameter estimation minimizing the sum of squared errors using originpro 9 0 software 3 results and discussion the hssf cws influent and effluent temperatures were on the range of 19 26 c during the experiment period and it was verified that the geometric configuration of the reactors did not produce a perceptible effect on this variable the effluent flow was measured six times in each hssf cw on the samples collection days having the following means standard deviations 0 0281 0 0018 m3 d 1 on cw1 0 0288 0 0024 m3 d 1 on cw2 and 0 0297 0 0032 m3 d 1 on cw3 water losses by evaporation measured by the difference between the influent and effluent flows were of 7 1 on cw1 4 8 on cw2 and 1 8 on cw3 the lower water losses were with the more elongated reactor greater l w ratio despite the exposed surface area being the same although they are relatively small these water losses by evaporation were used as shown on eq 2 to correct the total and soluble cod and bod5 concentrations along the reactors the decay on the relative corrected cod and bod5 concentrations along the length of the hssf cws is shown on fig 2 in all cases it is observed that the greater percentage reduction of the organic matter concentration occurred always on the first half of the hssf cws length a fact already reported by other authors 21 22 29 32 in a more detailed evaluation it is noted a tendency of faster decay of bod5 compared to cod which is possibly associated to the greater recalcitrance of the organic matter expressed by the latter variable it is verified that all cws showed a similar behaviour in terms of the organic matter decay along the reactor s length and it is visually not possible to identify any influence of the unplanted hssf cw geometric configuration this contradicts in a way what is established in terms of wetlands constructed systems performance according to their geometric configuration and associated flow regime 16 based in the known theories on the subject reactors with greater l w ratios should approach a plug flow regime thus leading to a greater decay of the organic matter represented by a first order reaction in this conditions the expectation is that the lower the l w ratios the closer the hydraulic regime approaches complete mixing leading to a lower decay of the pollutants which was not observed in this work corroborating what was found in the three cws garcia et al 11 stated that because of organic matter removal in hssf cws occurring mainly by physical mechanisms sedimentation and filtration the removal efficiency of this pollutant is much similar between systems with different l w when maintaining the same water depth another factor that can explain the similar behaviour of the units is fact that the flow in hssf cws porous mediums is already typically dispersed 2 being even more turbulent in presence of plants 22 23 then in planted cws the effects of the aspect ratio are expected to be even smaller for which reason the units were kept non vegetated the fokm rcm rm and mfokm models where fitted to the data shown in fig 2 and the derived model parameters and the associated coefficients of determination r2 are shown in table 3 by comparing the fitting of the models to the experimental data through the coefficients of determination r2 a good fitting for all models was verified with mfokm and rm giving the best results r2 greater than 0 98 the poorest fitting was for the conventional fokm with r2 in the range of 0 81 0 99 a behaviour also verified by fia et al 30 except for the values obtained for the rm the organic matter decay coefficients of the other mathematical models adjusted to the data obtained from the cws varied little indicating a small influence of the l w ratio in this parameter alcocer et al 33 on the other hand verified a great influence of the l w ratio on the hydraulic behaviour of hssf cws prototypes stating that the increase in this ratio provided a behaviour close to plug flow differently garcia et al 11 and zhang et al 34 concluded that the hrt and the depth of the sacs are factors of greater influence than l w in the efficiency of removal of pollutants in these systems as the conventional fokm still the most utilized model according to literature there are some values of fokm decay coefficient k0 cited in the literature that can be used to compare with the obtained ones for example in the review made by conley et al 15 for different systems operating under different conditions k0 values ranged between 0 21 and 2 92 d 1 von sperling and paoli 22 obtained k0 values of 0 92 d 1 with cod concentrations also corrected for water losses this value is higher than those found in this work 0 48 0 55 d 1 possibly due to factors such as greater system stability although as mentioned the gravel used in this experiment had been used for four years on other hssf cws the greater hrt 3 0 d 1 2 d and the period of analysis that comprises only the winter villaseñor et al 35 evaluating the treatment of synthetic sewage on hssf cws on southern spain found k0 values of 0 25 d 1 on the model fitted to data obtained from an unplanted system and values of 0 22 0 55 d 1 in planted systems brasil et al 21 obtained values of 0 50 1 44 d 1 applying increasing organic loads on planted systems after treatment in a septic tank while fia et al 30 observed k0 between 1 25 and 1 94 d 1 for bod5 and 0 79 and 1 28 d 1 for cod applying increasing organic loads of pig wastewater on unplanted hssf cws with regards to the influence of the geometric configurations on the k0 values it is verified a weak tendency of increasing this parameter value and only when adjusted to both bod5 fractions with an increase of the l w ratio the kcr values obtained with the rcm model were found to be between 0 70 and 0 93 d 1 for cod and between 0 71 0 85 d 1 for bod5 these values are higher than the 0 51 d 1 obtained at an unplanted system by villaseñor et al 35 working with synthetic sewage however they are lower than the 3 06 and 4 20 d 1 for bod5 and the 1 93 and 2 77 d 1 for cod obtained by fia et al 30 while treating piggery wastes in unplanted units they are also lower than the 1 12 d 1 obtained by von sperling and paoli 22 when treating uasb reactor effluent in an unplanted system and the 2 09 d 1 for bod5 and 1 89 for cod obtained by zurita et al 36 on sewage treatment in hssf cws cultivated with different ornamental species they are however inside the 0 16 2 07 d 1 range obtained by stein et al 37 for cod on unplanted systems utilized in the treatment of synthetic secondary sewage in general it is not verified an influence of the geometric configuration in the kcr values an increase of this parameter with l w being observed only when adjusted to soluble bod5 despite the availability of few works on the literature with the use of rm to experimental data obtained in hssf cws this model showing a removal coefficient variable with the hrt approaches what can be considered ideal on terms of modelling the decay of organic matter concentration from wastewater treated on hssf cws in this work these relations can be seen examples of the rm decay coefficient values kret obtained on the fitting of this model were made available in works as the one by villaseñor et al 35 that evaluating the treatment of synthetic sewage in hssf cws on southern spain obtained a kret of 0 75 d 1 for cod on an unplanted system by grismer et al 38 that treating winery wastewater obtained a kret of 0 31 d 1 for cod in a planted system the values obtained by shepherd et al 20 which are between 2 4 and 12 0 d 1 for cod on planted systems treating winery wastewater are greater than the ones obtained in this work which were from 0 62 to 2 30 d 1 for cod data and 0 92 2 40 d 1 for bod5 data with the higher values for bod5 due to their higher biodegradability as compared with cod in what concerns the influence of the geometric configuration on the kret values a tendency of decreasing this parameter value with the increase of l w is verified this is due to the fact that in this model the coefficient varies with hrt and b eq 4 and therefore the mutual influence of both parameters on the decay of organic matter is what should be evaluated regarding the kb and n parameters adjusted to mfokm the values between 0 52 and 0 74 d 1 are close to the ones obtained by chagas et al 29 which were of 0 45 and 0 69 d 1 on the treatment of septic tank effluent in hssf cws submitted to surface organic loading rates olr of 44 and 98 kg ha 1 d 1 cod however they are below the values of 1 23 and 1 72 d 1 obtained by the same authors by applying respectively olrs of 230 and 395 kg ha 1 d 1 of cod the values of 1 67 and 1 62 d 1 obtained by brasil et al 21 when treating sewage after septic tanks the range of 0 78 1 52 d 1 obtained by matos et al 32 when treating piggery wastes in hssf cws cultivated with different plant species and the 0 80 1 27 d 1 obtained by fia et al 30 by treating piggery wastes under various olrs it is supposed that the small dimensions of the system s prototypes used in this work have not enabled the reproduction of the same conditions such as those in larger scale systems with differences in the ecosystem complexity and removal efficiencies with respect to the influence of the geometric configuration in the kb values like it was observed in relation to kret it is verified a tendency of decreasing this parameter value with the increase of l w similarly it is due to the fact that in this model the coefficient varies with hrt and n eq 5 and therefore the mutual influence of both parameters on the decay of organic matter is what should be evaluated in relation to the parameter n adjusted to mfokm on the cod and bod5 data the values were in the rage of 0 42 0 83 brasil et al 21 when studying cattail cultivated hssf cws with l w equal to 24 in the treatment of septic tank effluents found values for n between 0 20 and 0 25 chagas et al 29 evaluating the treatment of septic tank effluent in hssf cws with l w equal to 24 cultivated with lily subjected to different olrs found values of 0 45 0 11 0 33 and 0 46 matos et al 32 found values for n between 0 07 and 0 52 on the summer and 0 32 and 0 63 on autumn and winter in brazil in the treatment of piggery wastes in hssf cws with l w equal to 21 8 cultivated with different species fia et al 30 on the treatment of piggery wastes in hssf cws on lab scale with l w equal to 4 0 uncultivated found values of n of 0 07 and 0 05 for cod and 0 44 and 0 24 for bod5 brasil et al 21 suggested that the value of n would be associated to the system dispersion and the variation in the biodegradability of the organic matter along the length of the hssf cws analysing the data of the adjusted values for the parameter n there was a relatively small variability values in the range of 0 43 0 70 for bod5 decay total and soluble in the cod curve the values of n did not allow for the verification of any tendency related to the geometry of the hssf cws the results indicated that the cw geometry did not alter significantly or did not show any identifiable association with the parameter n calculating as an example the term hrtn 1 considering hrt as 3 d used on the studies of hssf cws it is verified that the decrease of the organic matter decay coefficient adjusted to the mfokm so that it can be used on the corrected fokm varied from 17 3 to 46 2 for cod and 28 2 46 4 for bod5 on table 4 are shown the corrected decay coefficient obtained for a hrt of 3 days kf 3d evaluating the k f 3d values obtained for the different hssf cws and comparing them with the k0 obtained on the fokm adjustment it can be seen that with the exception of what has been observed in relation to soluble cod there is in relation to the first an identifiable tendency of its increase with the increase of l w suggesting a possible influence of the geometric configuration of the reactors on the organic matter decay coefficient of the wastewater under treatment it is considered that the incorporation of the parameter n on the decay coefficient variable with the hrt has made this behaviour clearer as a comparison the curves of total bod5 decay in cw 1 2 and 3 obtained for each evaluated mathematical models are presented in fig 3 as can be observed the fokm curve is the one with the lowest concavity and the least able to follow the variation in the observed data this unadjusted concavity should provide an underestimation of the ce values for lower values of hrt and overestimate for larger values being mfokm and rm the ones with the best fitting to the experimental data and based on the greater mathematical simplicity of the former it is considered that mfokm should be preferred to describe the decay of organic matter on unplanted hssf cws due to the greater simplicity in this case it is recommended to use a value of 0 657 for kb and n between 0 52 and 0 61 for n regardless of whether the equation is for estimation of total or soluble bod5 based on the results it is not recommended to change the kinetic parameters of sizing in the design of unplanted horizontal subsurface flow wetlands systems of different aspect ratio especially because more elongated reactors are more prone to clogging 4 conclusions the different geometric configurations of the hssf cws did not produce observable alterations on the organic matter removal curves although these evidences have become clearer when evaluating the parameters obtained by fitting the mathematical models for organic matter decay all evaluated mathematical models showed a good fitting to the decay of cod and bod5 total and soluble with the greater coefficients of determination r2 obtained for mfokm modified first order kinetic model rm retardation model and rcm residual concentration model on that order fokm conventional first order kinetic model provided the poorer fittings which are associated to considering the organic matter decay coefficient as a fixed value along the longitudinal path in hssf cws due to the mathematical simplicity improvements on the representation of the actual behaviour and the good fittings obtained it is considered that mfokm modified first order kinetic model should be preferred for describing organic matter decay of wastewaters treated on unplanted hssf cws the model structure is c e c 0 e k b h r t n see eq 5 based on the results it is not recommended to change the kinetic parameters of sizing in the design of unplanted horizontal subsurface flow wetlands systems of different aspect ratio acknowledgements the authors thank the cnpq for the financial support 
14586,the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets a plunging jet is used for the treatment of water and wastewater in activated sludge process in this study two sets of plunging jets series a and series b were used to study the flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets series a and b have flow area cross sectional area of 615 752 mm2 and 452 389 mm2 respectively each series has four nomenclatures of 2801 1404 1008 and 0716 four discharge rates were selected 0 72 ls 1 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 the desired disc was placed in the socket jet and the alteration in flow characteristics was observed our results showed that the total surface area per unit length of multiple plunging jets increased n times in comparison to a single jet for a given flow area the penetration depth and bubble swarm width were found to be directly proportional to the rate of flow also it was noticed that the composite froude number is directly proportional to kinetic jet power kinetic energy of the plunging jet aeration system the penetration depth was found to decrease with individual froude number at a given flow rate when the number of multiple jets is increased under similar flow conditions the present study showed that multiple plunging jets at optimum configuration under a given flow condition have a better

discharge ρ density kg m 3 1 introduction water is an essential part of all living organisms and therefore it is essential to treat wastewater before disposal untreated wastewater contains a higher amount of organic materials pathogens micro organism nutrients and toxic compounds moreover untreated wastewater is associated with environmental issues and health hazards thus making it all the more important to appropriately treat wastewater before final disposal the main purpose of wastewater management is to protect the environment in accordance with public health and socioeconomic concerns 1 however it should be noted that the treatment and disposal of wastewater is a serious problem in india the treatment of wastewater involves physical chemical and biological processes among all the existing technology plunging jet has garnered much interest due to its inherent advantages in wastewater treatment the efficiency of activated sludge process basically depends upon the aeration system by which oxygen is supplied to oxidize the organic content of wastewater it utilizes both diffusions and hydraulic shear to achieve oxygenation as well as mixing efficiently the plunging jet aerator passes through the surrounding atmosphere plunges into a water pool and then entrains a considerable amount of air which further forms a submerged two phase region with an air water interfacial area the jet may generate a bubble swarm beneath the surface depending on the flow of reynolds number and the height of falling jets 2 the plunging jet process involves both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces that interact between water jet and ambient air 3 some of its major applications include aeration and floatation in the treatment of water and wastewater biological aerated filter fermentation oxygenation of mammalian cell bioreactors bubble floatation of minerals the cooling system in power plants plunging columns stirring of chemicals increasing gas liquid transfer and plunging breakers and waterfalls 4 7 compared to the existing conventional system plunging water jet has several advantages such as non requirement of an air compressor forming of a closed loop that boosts utilization of oxygen and volatile reactants simple design easy construction and operation and non requirement of any external stirring device since water can achieve aeration and mixing 8 9 it is attractive and directs contacting mechanism in fouling or hazardous environments as well as it is free from operational difficulties such as clogging in air diffusers limitations on installation of mechanical aerators by tank width etc many researchers including van de sande and smith 1975 9 tojo and miyanami 1989 10 and bin and smith 1982 11 have studied the air water oxygen transfer by plunging jets leung et al 2006 12 investigated air water oxygen transfer in a biological aerated filter yamagiwa et al 2001 13 investigated the effects of properties of liquid on air entrainment and oxygen transfer rates of plunging jet reactors ahmed 1974 14 examined air water oxygen transfer by single plunging jets while deswal et al 2007 15 reported oxygen transfer by multiple plunging jets the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and efficiency of oxygen transfer were found to be higher in multiple plunging jets than in a single jet at standard conditions and a given jet power bagatur et al 2002 16 studied the effect of nozzle types circular ellipse and rectangle duct with rounded ends and reported that higher air entrainment rate and oxygen transfer efficiency was observed in the rectangle duct with rounded ends nozzle due to water jet expansion bagatur onen 2014 17 studied modeling of volumetric air entrainment rate by artificial neural network ann and gene expression programming gep model and reported that nozzle diameter is the most effective parameter on the volumetric air entrainment rate among water jet velocity jet length and jet impact angle bagatur 2014 18 studied flow characteristics volumetric air entrainment rate bubble penetration depth and oxygen transfer efficiency using truncated and non truncated circular nozzles and reported that truncated circular nozzles are more effective than non truncated circular nozzles deswal verma 2007 15 further reported that the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient gradually increased as the number of jets was increased from 1 to 16 they also suggested that multiple plunging jets device is more effective for aeration oxygenation at higher jet powers chipongo khiadani 2016 19 studied oxygen transfer by multiple plunging jets and reported that water depth in the receiving channel number of jets fall height and jet velocity directly influences oxygen transfer in the pool bagatur sekerdag 2003 20 studied the air entrainment characteristics volumetric airflow rate air entrainment rate and bubble penetration depth in a plunging jet system using inclined rectangular nozzles with rounded ends and reported that air entrainment rate as a function of effective jet expansion ratio by predicting an empirical correlation deswal 2008 21 reported that volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and oxygen transfer efficiency of multiple inclined plunging jets for the air water system were significantly higher than those of a single vertical as well as an inclined plunging jet for the same flow area and other similar conditions they also confirmed that this system is energy efficient in practical situations involving the treatment of large volumes of wastewaters since the oxygen transfer rate increases with the increase in a number of multiple jets under similar flow conditions various researchers have reported their data in the form of empirical relationships but the simplest relationships for conventional plunging water jets are suggested by bin and smith 1982 11 eq 1 and tojo and miyanami 1982 22 eq 2 1 k l a 20 9 10 5 p 2 k l a 20 0 029 p v 0 65 where kla 20 volumetric oxygen transfer

on single plunging water jets there are very limited studies on multiple plunging jets for mass transfer application moreover there has never been an attempt to study the flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets hence this study aimed to ascertain the effect of surface area swarm width and penetration depth on the total surface area with respect to single and multiple plunging jets 2 experimental methods 2 1 experimental methods and setup the present study was carried out in a closed system that involved a complete re circulation of water with a constant water hold up experimental set up consists of a water tank fitted with a scale for measuring the height of water in the tank a centrifugal water pump 750 w crompton greaves a regulating valve and an orifice meter along with differential mercury manometer a flat bottomed square tank 1 mm 1 mm 1 mm made of acrylic walls for visualization purpose was used for the experiment the water level was maintained at 50 cm for all the experiments for capturing the images of impacts of the jets on water a high speed camera was used for each experimental condition for a 10 s long sequence a long transparent sheet was fixed on one side of the square tank which was divided into a 2 0 cm square mesh size the minimum count is 2 0 cm the jet length or the vertical distance between the exit end of aerating device and water surface in the tank was kept as 0 1 m 10 cm water was re circulated by a centrifugal pump and the flow rate was measured by using an orifice meter a control valve was provided in the recirculating pipe line to regulate the flow of water through aerating device aerating devices were fabricated such that they can be fitted and tightened to the vertical inflow which flows centrally in the pool the schematic representation of experimental setup is shown in fig 1 all experiments were carried out with tap water at ambient temperature two sets of plunging jets series a and series b were used to study the flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets series a and b have flow area cross sectional area of 615 752 mm2 and 452 389 mm2 respectively the disc used for generation of plunging jets of the desired configuration and their arrangements are shown in fig 2 a each series has four nomenclatures 2801 1404 1008 and 0716 for a single jet the hole of the desired diameter was drilled at the center of discs but in the case of multiple jets the hole of the desired configuration was spaced along the diameter of discs table 1 shows the different sizes of the discs the aeration device consists of a socket that can be fitted and tightened on external threads of inflow pipe fig 2 b a at the time of the experiments the perspex discs of the desired configuration were placed in aeration device two ring shaped rubber seals one placed below and other placed above disc were used to make a fitting watertight fig 2 b b the aerating device was then fitted and tightened to the vertical inflow pipe multiple plunging jets discs mpjd were fabricated with cast iron with threads and then fitted to the inflow pipe to produce multiple jets of different configurations in terms of diameter and number of jets n a circular nozzle with rounded ends was used in this study the details information of multiple plunging jets device was reported by deswal verma 2007 15 before beginning the experiments the plunging jet device with the desired disc configuration was fitted to inflow pipe the aeration tank was filled with tap water via a pipe and the orifice meter was set at the desired flow rate with the help of a regulating value the desired configuration disc was placed in the plunging jet socket from series a and b at a constant flow rate the penetration depth length in cm type of cone shape made and the area covered was observed each multiple jet configuration was tested at four flow rates discharge in fig 2 c a the separation distance between pipe outlet and air water interface is denoted by h axial coordinate z is pointing downward away from the free surface while radial one r is measured along the horizontal free surface the first experiment was performed with series a i e total flow area 615 785 mm2 corresponding to the diameter of a single jet of 28 mm on multiple plunging jets at a discharge of 0 72 ls 1 the experiments were performed with jets and nomenclatures 2801 1404 1008 and 0716 respectively moreover other jet configurations were repeated with 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 flow rates similarly experiments were carried out for series b the total flow area 452 389 mm2 for different jet configurations at four different discharges the entire scheme of experimentation is presented in table 2 2 2 digital image and analysis for capturing high quality digital images a digital single lens reflex dslr camera was used that was mounted on a sturdy tripod to minimize camera vibration the captured images produced high quality sharp results to extract bubbly flow penetration depth for continuous entrainment regime the camera was used to capture the instantaneous image a sequence of images of the region below water surface was taken images were recorded at a regulation of pixels throughout the experiments a custom made array of high power light emitting was used to provide suitable and uniform backlighting the recorded images were transferred to a computer for further analysis the arrangement of images is detailed in fig 2 c b to measure flow penetration depth the images were captured for each case on the configuration of the jet at all four flow rates the individual images were analyzed and the average penetration depth and width are obtained for each case it is pertinent to mention here that the four image photographs were taken for each case 2 3 flow measurements tap water was filed in the oxygenation tank up to a specified level through a pipe the centrifugal pump was then switched on for recirculating water in the tank the actual discharge through inflow pipe into aeration tank was then measured by collecting water in a floating container bucket placed in the tank for a known interval of time simultaneously the corresponding value of the difference in limbs of u tube differential mercury manometer h across orifice meter was also noted manometer readings corresponding to various discharges were obtained a calibration curve for orifice meter was plotted between discharges versus height and presented in fig 3 a this calibration curve was used during the experiment for selecting desired flows all the experiments were carried out at four discharges 0 72 ls 1 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 at a higher discharge the water penetrated at the bottom of the tank therefore a lower value of discharge was selected in this study 3 result and discussion the experimental observations and calculations are systematically presented in table 3 3 1 variation in surface area for a given cross sectional area of flow the interfacial area outside the liquid phase of a jet configuration varied with the number of jets n as tabulated in table 4 the total surface area per unit length a s was found to increase n times for multiple jets for a given flow area in other words in the case of multiple jets n times more air entrained per unit length in the pool of water for a given flow area at a constant discharge the graph is plotted between total surface area per unit length a s and the number of jets n for series a and series b respectively fig 3 b it was confirmed that the total surface area of multiple plunging jets expressed to the atmosphere per unit length increased significantly n times as the number of jets n increased for a constant total cross sectional area of flow it implies that for a given flow area more air can be entrained in the liquid phase by increasing number of multiple jets 3 2 variation in penetration depth penetration depth is defined as the vertical distance between free surfaces of the tank filled with water to lower end of the submerged two phase region in the water body variation in the penetration depth hp of multiple jets with increasing discharge was studied by plotting a graph between penetration depth and discharge as shown in fig 4 a and b the penetration depth was found to decrease with the increase in the number of multiple jets at a given discharge fig 4 c and d this is due to the decrease in the momentum of individual plunging jets in comparison to an individual jet under similar flow conditions another cause may be the increase in fractional resistance with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under similar conditions in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and b the behavior observed was not as expected because the configuration of the jet was too closed leading to alteration in results it was revealed in fig 4 a and c that the penetration depth increases with the increase in discharge velocity for every configuration of single and multiple jets also it was observed that at a constant discharge thinner jets have a higher penetration depth than thicker jets 3 3 variation in bubble swarm width variations in bubble swarm width bs were studied by plotting it at various discharges fig 5 it was observed that bubble swarm width decreases with an increase in the number of multiple jets at a given discharge fig 5 b and d and increases with the increase in discharge fig 5 a and c this can happen due to the decrease in the momentum of individual plunging jets in comparison to an individual jet under similar flow conditions the increase in fractional resistance with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under similar conditions is another possible region in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and b the behavior observed was not as expected because the configuration of the jet was too close leading to alterations in the results 3 4 total surface area a s and penetration depth h p to study its effect on interfacial surface penetration depth a graph was plotted between total surface area as and penetration depth figs fig 6 a it was observed that the penetration depth is inversely proportional to the total surface area of the jet s per unit length in other words the penetration depth decreases with the increase in the number of jets n under similar flow conditions this occurred due to frictional resistance and the buoyancy of bubble swarm increased with the increase in the number of multiple jets under similar flow conditions in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and series they showed different behavior because the multiple jets were too closed with each other which may lead to alteration in results 3 5 effect of froude number on flow characteristics many researchers reported that the gas liquid mass transfer in plunging jet aerators is controlled mainly by kinetic jet power or kinetic energy of plunging jet aeration system 4 13 15 22 23 they correlated overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient in term of kinetic jet power and observed that the performance of plunging jet aerators is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of jet s as they are ejected from the aerating device therefore plunging jet aeration system should be designed in such a way as to utilize inception kinetic energy of jet s for effective aerating process and liquid mixing in the aeration tank the most efficient utilization of incipient kinetic energy was demonstrated by deswal verma 2007 15 while experimenting with multiple plunging jets in the present study kinetic energy k e and froude number was calculated by eqs 3 and 4 3 k e 1 2 ρ q v 2 4 f r o u d e n u m b e r f r v g d where fr froude number v jet velocity m s 1 d jet diameter m g gravity force q discharge ls 1 and ρ density kg m 3 the kinetic energy and froude number for all experimental rates were determined and presented in table 5 this is in good agreement for the plunging jet aeration system compared to the single jet only in case of plunging jet aeration system comparing with multiple plunging jets n 1 froude number representing flow characteristics of an individual jet as well as froude number for entire aerating system respectively the multiple plunging jets as one unit of the aeration system in this study a new term composite froude number f r c was used to represent flow characteristics of entire aeration system of multiple plunging jets for better understanding and analysis the composite froude number is written as 5 c o m p o s i t e f r o u d e n u m b e r f r c v g d n the froude number and composite froude number were calculated with the help of eq 4 and 5 and presented in table 5 a graph was plotted between kinetic energy and composite froude number as presented in fig 6 b it was observed that the composite froude number is directly proportional to the kinetic energy or kinetic jet power of plunging jet aeration system the plots between penetration depth versus froude number fig 6 c pointed that penetration depth varies with froude number at a given flow rate discharge when the number of jets n varied under similar flow conditions i e constant flow area of the aeration system the composite froude number is constant under similar flow conditions but the penetration depth varied due to varying individual froude number this critical analysis of the above two observations from fig 6 b and c revealed that like the incipient kinetic energy plunging jet aeration system should be designed in such a way so that the composite froude number of multiple plunging jet aeration systems can be utilized most optionally by adopting a suitable number of multiple jets for given flow conditions based on the results it can be concluded that gas liquid mass transfer in multiple plunging jets aerators can be controlled mainly by optimal utilization of composite froude number of the aeration system 4 conclusions in this study a series of laboratory experiments were carried out with various configurations of multiple plunging jets aeration systems to study their flow characteristics by image analysis technique the following findings were obtained total surface area per unit length of multiple plunging jets increases n times in comparison to a single jet for a given flow area penetration depth is directly proportional to the rate of flow however at a given rate of flow penetration depth decreases with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under similar flow conditions bubble swarm width is directly proportional to the rate of flow however at a given rate of flow the bubble swarm width decreases with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under given flow condition thicker jets have higher penetration depth than thinner jets under given flow conditions composite froude number is directly proportional to the kinetic jet power kinetic energy of the plunging jet aeration system penetration depth varies decreases with individual froude number at a given flow rate when the number of multiple jets is varied increased under similar flow conditions gas liquid mass transfer in multiple plunging jets aerators is controlled mainly by optimal utilization of composite froude number this relationship will be helpful in predicting and or computing penetration depth of various configurations of multiple plunging jets under similar or varying flow conditions acknowledgement the author would like to thank the fluid mechanism laboratory department

14586,the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets a plunging jet is used for the treatment of water and wastewater in activated sludge process in this study two sets of plunging jets series a and series b were used to study the flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets series a and b have flow area cross sectional area of 615 752 mm2 and 452 389 mm2 respectively each series has four nomenclatures of 2801 1404 1008 and 0716 four discharge rates were selected 0 72 ls 1 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 the desired disc was

amount of organic materials pathogens micro organism nutrients and toxic compounds moreover untreated wastewater is associated with environmental issues and health hazards thus making it all the more important to appropriately treat wastewater before final disposal the main purpose of wastewater management is to protect the environment in accordance with public health and socioeconomic concerns 1 however it should be noted that the treatment and disposal of wastewater is a serious problem in india the treatment of wastewater involves physical chemical and biological processes among all the existing technology plunging jet has garnered much interest due to its inherent advantages in wastewater treatment the efficiency of activated sludge process basically depends upon the aeration system by which oxygen is supplied to oxidize the organic content of wastewater it utilizes both diffusions and hydraulic shear to achieve oxygenation as well as mixing efficiently the plunging jet aerator passes through the surrounding atmosphere plunges into a water pool and then entrains a considerable amount of air which further forms a submerged two phase region with an air water interfacial area the jet may generate a bubble swarm beneath the surface depending on the flow of reynolds number and the height of falling jets 2 the plunging jet process involves both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces that interact between water jet and ambient air 3 some of its major applications include aeration and floatation in the treatment of water and wastewater biological aerated filter fermentation oxygenation of mammalian cell bioreactors bubble floatation of minerals the cooling system in power plants plunging columns stirring of chemicals increasing gas liquid transfer and plunging breakers and waterfalls 4 7 compared to the existing conventional system plunging water jet has several advantages such as non requirement of an air compressor forming of a closed loop that boosts utilization of oxygen and volatile reactants simple design easy construction and operation and non requirement of any external stirring device since water can achieve aeration and mixing 8 9 it is attractive and directs contacting mechanism in fouling or hazardous environments as well as it is free from operational difficulties such as clogging in air diffusers limitations on installation of mechanical aerators by tank width etc many researchers including van de sande and smith 1975 9 tojo and miyanami 1989 10 and bin and smith 1982 11 have studied the air water oxygen transfer by plunging jets leung et al 2006 12 investigated air water oxygen transfer in a biological aerated filter yamagiwa et al 2001 13 investigated the effects of properties of liquid on air entrainment and oxygen transfer rates of plunging jet reactors ahmed 1974 14 examined air water oxygen transfer by single plunging jets while deswal et al 2007 15 reported oxygen transfer by multiple plunging jets the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and efficiency of oxygen transfer were found to be higher in multiple plunging jets than in a single jet at standard conditions and a given jet power bagatur et al 2002 16 studied the effect of nozzle types circular ellipse and rectangle duct with rounded ends and reported that higher air entrainment rate and oxygen transfer efficiency was observed in the rectangle duct with rounded ends nozzle due to water jet expansion bagatur onen 2014 17 studied modeling of volumetric air entrainment rate by artificial neural network ann and gene expression programming gep model

are more effective than non truncated circular nozzles deswal verma 2007 15 further reported that the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient gradually increased as the number of jets was increased from 1 to 16 they also suggested that multiple plunging jets device is more effective for aeration oxygenation at higher jet powers chipongo khiadani 2016 19 studied oxygen transfer by multiple plunging jets and reported that water depth in the receiving channel number of jets fall height and jet velocity directly influences oxygen transfer in the pool bagatur sekerdag 2003 20 studied the air entrainment characteristics volumetric airflow rate air entrainment rate and bubble penetration depth in a plunging jet system using inclined rectangular nozzles with rounded ends and reported that air entrainment rate as a function of effective jet expansion ratio by predicting an empirical correlation deswal 2008 21 reported that volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and oxygen transfer efficiency of multiple inclined plunging jets for the air water system were significantly higher than those of a single vertical as well as an inclined plunging jet for the same flow area and other similar conditions they also confirmed that this system is energy efficient in practical situations involving the treatment of large volumes of wastewaters since the oxygen transfer rate increases with the increase in a number of multiple jets under similar flow conditions various researchers have reported their data in the form of empirical relationships but the simplest relationships for conventional plunging water jets are suggested by bin and smith 1982 11 eq 1 and tojo and miyanami 1982 22 eq 2 1 k l a 20 9 10 5 p 2 k l a 20 0 029 p v 0 65 where kla 20 volumetric oxygen transfer

on single plunging water jets there are very limited studies on multiple plunging jets for mass transfer application moreover there has never been an attempt to study the flow characteristics of multiple plunging jets hence this study aimed to ascertain the effect of surface area swarm width and penetration depth on the total surface area with respect to single and multiple plunging jets 2 experimental methods 2 1 experimental methods and setup the present study was carried out in a closed system that involved a complete re circulation of water with a constant water hold up experimental

the experiments for capturing the images of impacts of the jets on water a high speed camera was used for each experimental condition for a 10 s long sequence a long transparent sheet was fixed on one side of the square tank which was divided into a 2 0 cm square mesh size the minimum count is 2 0 cm the jet length or the vertical distance between the exit end of aerating device and water surface in the tank was kept as 0 1 m 10 cm water was re circulated by a centrifugal pump and the flow rate was measured by using an orifice meter a control valve was provided in the recirculating pipe line to regulate the flow of water through aerating device aerating devices were fabricated such that they can be fitted and tightened to the vertical inflow which flows centrally in the pool the schematic

area 615 785 mm2 corresponding to the diameter of a single jet of 28 mm on multiple plunging jets at a discharge of 0 72 ls 1 the experiments were performed with jets and nomenclatures 2801 1404 1008 and 0716 respectively moreover other jet configurations were repeated with 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 flow rates similarly experiments were carried out for series b the total flow area 452 389 mm2 for different jet configurations at four different discharges the entire scheme of experimentation is presented in table 2 2 2 digital image and analysis for capturing high quality digital images a digital single lens reflex dslr camera was used that was mounted on a sturdy tripod to minimize camera vibration the captured images produced high quality sharp results to extract bubbly flow penetration depth for continuous entrainment regime the camera was used to capture the instantaneous image a sequence of images of the region below water surface was taken images were recorded at a regulation of pixels throughout the experiments a custom made array of high power light emitting was used to provide suitable and uniform backlighting the recorded images were transferred to a computer for further analysis the arrangement of images is detailed in fig 2 c b to measure flow penetration depth the images were captured for each case on the configuration of the jet at all four flow rates the individual images were analyzed and the average penetration depth and width are obtained for each case it is pertinent to mention here that the four image photographs were taken for each case 2 3 flow measurements tap water was filed in the oxygenation tank up to a specified level through a pipe the centrifugal pump was then switched on for recirculating water in the tank the actual discharge through inflow pipe into aeration tank was then measured by collecting water in a floating container bucket placed in the tank for a known interval of time simultaneously the corresponding value of the difference in limbs of u tube differential mercury manometer h across orifice meter was also noted manometer readings corresponding to various discharges were obtained a calibration curve for orifice meter was plotted between discharges versus height and presented in fig 3 a this calibration curve was used during the experiment for selecting desired flows all the experiments were carried out at four discharges 0 72 ls 1 0 85 ls 1 1 28 ls 1 and 1 62 ls 1 at a higher discharge the water penetrated at the bottom of the tank therefore a lower value of discharge was selected in this study 3 result and discussion the experimental observations and calculations are systematically presented in table 3 3 1 variation in surface area for a given cross sectional area of flow the interfacial area outside the liquid phase of a jet configuration varied with the number of jets n as tabulated in table 4 the total surface area per unit length a s was found to increase n times for multiple jets for a given flow area in other words in the case of multiple jets n times more air entrained per unit length in the pool of water for a given flow area at a constant discharge the graph is plotted between total surface area per unit length a s and the number of jets n for series a and series b respectively fig 3 b it was confirmed that the total surface area of multiple plunging jets expressed to the atmosphere per unit length increased significantly n times as the number of jets n increased for a constant total cross sectional area of flow it implies that for a given flow area more air can be entrained in the liquid phase by increasing number of multiple jets 3 2 variation in penetration depth penetration depth is defined as the vertical distance between free surfaces of the tank filled with water to lower end of the submerged two phase region in the water body variation in the penetration depth hp of multiple jets with increasing discharge was studied by plotting a graph between penetration depth and discharge as shown in fig 4 a and b the penetration depth was found to decrease with the increase in the number of multiple jets at a given discharge fig 4 c and d this is due to the decrease in the momentum of individual plunging jets in comparison to an individual jet under similar flow conditions another cause may be the increase in fractional resistance with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under similar conditions in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and b the behavior observed was not as expected because the configuration of the jet was too closed leading to alteration in results it was revealed in fig 4 a and c that the penetration depth increases with the increase in discharge velocity for every configuration of single and multiple jets also it was observed that at a constant discharge thinner jets have a higher penetration depth than thicker jets 3 3 variation in bubble swarm width variations in bubble swarm width bs were studied by plotting it at various discharges fig 5 it was observed that bubble swarm width decreases with an increase in the number of multiple jets at a given discharge fig 5 b and d and increases with the increase in discharge fig 5 a and c this can happen due to the decrease in the momentum of individual plunging jets in comparison to an individual jet under similar flow conditions the increase in fractional resistance with the increase in the number of multiple plunging jets under similar conditions is another possible region in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and b the behavior observed was not as expected because the configuration of the jet was too close leading to alterations in the results 3 4 total surface area a s and penetration depth h p to study its effect on interfacial surface penetration depth a graph was plotted between total surface area as and penetration depth figs fig 6 a it was observed that the penetration depth is inversely proportional to the total surface area of the jet s per unit length in other words the penetration depth decreases with the increase in the number of jets n under similar flow conditions this occurred due to frictional resistance and the buoyancy of bubble swarm increased with the increase in the number of multiple jets under similar flow conditions in the case of 16 multiple jets n 16 for series a and series they showed different behavior because the multiple jets were too closed with each other which may lead to alteration in results 3 5 effect of

m p o s i t e f r o u d e n u m b e r f r c v g d n the froude number and composite froude number were calculated with the help of eq 4 and 5 and presented in table 5 a graph was plotted between kinetic energy and composite froude number as presented in fig 6 b it was observed that the composite froude number is directly proportional to the kinetic energy or kinetic jet power of plunging jet aeration system the plots between penetration depth versus froude number fig 6 c pointed that penetration depth varies with froude number at a given flow rate discharge when the number of jets n varied under similar flow conditions i e constant flow area of the aeration system the composite froude number is constant under similar flow conditions but the penetration depth varied due to varying individual froude number this critical analysis of the above two observations from fig 6 b and c revealed that like the incipient kinetic energy plunging jet aeration system should be designed in such a way so that the composite froude number of multiple plunging jet aeration systems can be utilized most optionally by adopting a suitable number of multiple jets for given flow conditions based on

14587,sacrificial stainless steel and nickel electrodes were used as anodes in electro fenton ef process for degradation of phenol in controlled operating conditions the influence of different operating parameters such as initial concentration of phenol current intensity fe2 dose ph and anode material were studied at optimal operating conditions the degradation of phenol was 95 2 using sacrificial stainless steel anode in 90 min and 72 using nickel anode in 120 min the favored current intensity was 900 ma the optimal fe2 doses using stainless steel and nickel anodes were 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively the production and consumption of iron during the ef process was monitored to interpret the favorability of sacrificial stainless steel anode regression analysis was employed to develop a prediction model for phenol removal the model is dependent on operational conditions and initial phenol concentration with coefficient of determination r2 0 9525 in addition artificial neural network ann model was developed based on input layer of operating conditions and output layer of phenol degradation efficiency the ann model yielded a coefficient of determination r2 0 9742 and se sy 0 16 keywords anns electro fenton phenol wastewater 1 introduction phenol is one of the major bio recalcitrant contaminants that exist in many chemical and biochemical industries it is produced in the operation of pharmaceutical plants oil refineries coke plants resins industry olive mill and other food processing industries 1 2 it is preferred to perform degradation processes for phenol and other bio recalcitrant pollutants from its source before the discharge of industrial wastewater to sewer network or nearby drains because the ability of degradation of bio recalcitrant organics by conventional biological treatment is limited 3 without source treatment these contaminant might exist in low concentrations in the aquatic environment which threaten the aquatic organisms and may develop the bacteria resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants 4 advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a lot of attention as promising technologies for the degradation of various hazardous organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and phenolic compounds 5 aops include the generation of very strong reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals which have the ability to break down the stable and resistant chains of organic molecules and degrade them to simpler compounds and benign end products 6 among aops fenton reaction is one of the favored methods for degradation of phenolic compounds because of simplicity and low toxic residuals 7 8 in fenton reaction powerful reactive hydroxyl radicals are generated from h2o2 in presence fe2 ions fenton reaction could be carried out by different modified processes other than classical fenton reaction to obtain better degradation efficiency minimize residuals or save chemicals and energy modified processes include photo fenton electro fenton sono fenton and fenton like process 9 12 large production of ferric hydroxide sludge is considered to be one of the main disadvantages of most of fenton to overcome this problem the electro fenton ef process was developed by many researchers to minimize the generation of ferric hydroxide during the reaction 13 14 in addition it enhances the degradation efficiency of target compounds 15 16 in ef the reduction of ferric hydrogen sludge to form ferrous ions on the cathode is induced by applied current intensity 17 the negative potential near the cathode in the ef cell reduce the dissolved oxygen to form h2o2 in aqueous solutions the addition of fe2 salts leads to start a fenton reaction with the electrically produced h2o2 and ferric ions are continually formed during the process ferric ions are reduced back to ferrous ions near the cathode which enhance the oxidation of contaminants and reduce the amount of sludge 18 the major advantages of this method is the in situ production of h2o2 which minimize the transport and storage besides it utilizes a clean energy source to improve the performance of contamination removal 19 several parameters could influence the of ef process such as initial contaminant concentration ph current intensity and reagent dosage the obtained experimental results could be analyzed by linear and nonlinear regression to describe the correlation of these parameters to the process efficiency 20 artificial neural network ann is another method to describe the relation between the operating parameters and the process performance 21 the advantage of ann is linking the effect of all inputs to each other and to the outputs in three steps including training validation and test 22 the aim of this study is to investigate the performance of ef process for the degradation of phenol as a recalcitrant organic pollutant operational conditions such as initial phenol concentration current intensity fe2 dose ph and anode material were studied moreover simple predictive models are developed to describe phenol removal at different conditions using statistical regression analysis and the artificial annual networks anns 2 materials and method 2 1 materials methanol phenol c6h5oh 99 5 pure ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o 99 75 pure hydrochloric acid hcl 98 9 pure and sodium hydroxide 98 pure were

used to provide a continuous vigorous stirring of the solution the solution was aerated for 10 min prior to the reaction and continued to the end of experiment time to increase the dissolved o2 hcl acid with specific quantities was added to obtain the required ph before starting the electro oxidation reaction a certain quantity of feso4 7h2o was added to the solution with the desired concentration na2so4 was added to the solution with concentration of 1000 mg l to maintain the ionic strength constant and improve the conductivity of the medium a dc power supply was connected to the electrodes and worked with a constant current an ammeter phywe 07036 00 was used to measure the current intensity the voltage difference was measured by a voltmeter digital voltmeter g 1002 500 an initial sample 5 ml of phenol was taken before the ph adjustment periodic samples 5 ml of phenol solution were taken every 10 min and filtered using 0 2 μm filters to remove any suspended materials before analysis 2 3 analytical methods the hplc system agilent 1200 series was used to measure the phenol concentrations the system includes a photodiode array detector and a multi mobile phase pump an auto sampler was used to inject samples 25 μl into a 150 4 6 mm apollo c18 column peaks were monitored at wavelength λ 270 nm under these conditions column temperature 40 c mobile phase flow rate 0

was quantified by atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa2280fs 2 4 modeling of experimental results the experimental work has been extended to cover different operational conditions for the phenol degradation efficiency by electro fenton for the experiments done by nickel anode the results were combined in one database the database was used to develop a model for the prediction of the degradation efficiency regression analysis by the least square method was used for model development the developed model for phenol degradation was used to test the sensitivity of predicated values to each input parameter in addition an artificial neural network model was developed based on tanch axon function to describe the experimental results 3 results and discussion the electrochemical degradation of phenol was assessed at different conditions of initial concentration ph current intensity fe2 dosage and anode material these factors were chosen due to their significant influence on the performance of electro fenton process in order to introduce the performance of electro fenton process curves for different operating conditions were plotted portraying the remaining phenol amount c co versus the reaction time 3 1 effect of initial phenol concentration the degradation of phenol at different initial concentrations is shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b the obtained results indicated that the removal efficiency decreases with the increase in the initial concentration of phenol and more reaction time is required for complete degradation fig 1a states that the removal efficiencies of phenol by nickel anode were 72 69 2 65 64 7 and 51 42 at initial concentration of 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively in 120 min of electro fenton reaction fig 1b demonstrates that the removal efficiencies of phenol by stainless steel electrode were 95 2 92 5 90 6 and 72 4 at initial concentration of 50 75 100 and 200 mg l respectively in 90 min of reaction time the degradation efficiency of phenol at higher initial concentration decreased because the amount of hydroxyl radicals remained constant regardless of the initial phenol concentration additional time and fenton reagent may be needed to attain more efficient degradation at higher initial concentration 23 mineralization of phenol was observed by measuring the toc removal during electro fenton reaction as shown in fig 1c the removal of toc was about 41 in 120 min while phenol degradation was 65 at the beginning of the electro fenton reaction the mineralization rate was effective then became slower but faster than phenol decay it may be due to the fact that phenol forms aromatic and aliphatic intermediates which need prolonged time and more hydroxyl radicals for complete mineralization benzoquinone catechol and hydroquinone are the most prevalent intermediates that generated by oxidation of phenol 24 these intermediates are observed in water as toc during the reaction and they are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to more benign organics 25 at the beginning of reaction maleic fumaric succinic and glyoxylic are predominantly formed while oxalic and formic acids are produced later the end products after the complete degradation of intermediates are mainly co2 and h2o 26 adding supporting electrolyte such as sodium sulfate with dose of 1 g l improved degradation of phenol from 23 to 88 3 in 60 min of reaction as shown in fig 1d adding na2so4 improves the conductivity of the solution which led to higher current density that resulted in improved production of h2o2 higher concentration of h2o2 enhanced the fenton reaction which improves the phenol degradation rates 27 ghoneim et al 28 reported that so4 2 salts are the most efficient supporting electrolyte in electro fenton process compared to cl salts like nacl and kcl thus na2so4 was only considered in this work 3 2 effect of current intensity current intensity is a major parameter which has a remarkable influence on the degradation of organics by electro fenton process 23 fig 2 shows the degradation of phenol under different current intensity the obtained results indicated that increasing the applied current intensity significantly improves the degradation efficiency after a reaction time of 120 min the degradation efficiencies of phenol were 65 41 28 35 and 27 2 at 900 ma 700 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively thus 900 ma is considered to be the optimum current intensity current intensity of 900 ma was provided by applying voltage difference of 35 v this finding can be explained as the applied current intensity is an important factor for producing of h2o2 near the cathode 27 improving the production of h2o2 increases the rate of fenton reaction and hence more reactive species are formed which are effective to the phenol degradation 29 higher applied current intensity increases the applied potential and offers higher electro regeneration of fe2 from fe3 so improved the efficiency of fenton chain reaction 30 in addition the sacrificing of fe2 from the stainless steel electrode will be enhanced at higher current intensity 31 higher electro generated fe2 beside the active production of h2o2 yields to more efficient fenton reaction which improves the degradation rate of phenol 3 3 effect of ph generally the ph has a great influence on fenton reaction activity many studies reported that reducing of ph enhances the fenton process rate and the oxidation ability of hydroxyl radical and hence the degradation of organics is favored in acidic conditions 8 32 accordingly the phenol degradation was tested under different ph in the acidic range the obtained results are shown in fig 3 after 120 min of reaction time the degradation of phenol was 44 3 65 and 43 8 at ph values of 2 3 and 4 respectively at ph 4 fe 3 started to be precipitated in the form of amorphous fe oh 3 moreover the regeneration of fe2 was inhibited and the dissolved fe3 was reduced by the formation of fe oh 3 eqs 1 2 which partially coated the electrode surface 33 hence a considerable part of fe2 did not involve in fenton reaction which resulted in lower degradation of phenol on the other hand at ph 2 hydrogen ions act as hydroxyl radical scavengers 34 furthermore it is reported that at extreme lower ph high concentration of h ions enhance the formation of stable oxonium ion h3o2 by getting the peroxide solvated eq 3 23 an oxonium ion improves the peroxide s stability resulting in reducing the reactivity with fe2 ion in fenton reaction 8 9 similar trends were reported in the literature for degradation of organic contaminants by different forms of fenton reaction 23 27 accordingly the favored ph in these experiments was considered to be 3 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh ho 2 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 s 3h 3 h2o2 h h3o2 3 4 effect of fe2 dose fig 4 a depicts the degradation of phenol under different doses of fe2 using nickel anode loading higher doses of fe2 positively enhanced the degradation of phenol after 120 min of electrochemical operation the removal efficiencies of phenol were 65 33 3 and 34 44 using fe2 dose of 20 5 and 0 mg l respectively further increase of fe2 dose did not add significant improvement to the degradation efficiency and more precipitated fe oh 2 was noticed accordingly the optimum fe2 dose was considered 20 mg l the improvement of phenol degradation is due to abundance of hydroxyl radicals which are actively produced during fenton reaction at higher doses of fe2 36 the degradation of phenol at zero dosage of fe2 may be due to the oxidation by h2o2 which is generated near the cathode or by ho 2 which is produced by the decomposition of h2o2 near the anode elaborated explanation for degradation of organic by electrochemical processes in absence of fe2 is reported by ghoneim et al 37 38 3 5 effect of anode material the performance of stainless steel anode was compared to the performance of nickel anode under the same conditions as shown in fig 5 a after 90 min of electro fenton reaction the degradation of phenol was 90 6 using stainless steel anode while the degradation was 65 using nickel anode stainless steel grade 304 does not contain molybdenum so it is not ideal corrosion resistant material accordingly a considerable amount of iron is sacrificed from the anode during the electrochemical process eq 4 the sacrificed amount of iron during the electrochemical process was detected by measuring the iron as shown in fig 5b the observed results stated that the concentration of dissolved iron is increased along the time till 20 min then the concentration decreased till 100 min and then is increased again this is due to the consumption of iron during the electro fenton reaction as given in eqs 1 and 2 while the formation of fe oh 3 was low therefore the concentration of iron increased then the concentration decreased because the regeneration of fe2 was diminished and the dissolved fe3 was reduced by the formation of fe oh 3 eq 2 after 100 min of the reaction iron concentration increased again because the consumption by fenton reaction became less 33 the favorability of stainless steel may also be attributed to the fact that stainless steel has better conductivity at high current intensity and in corrosive mediums 39 4 fe fe2 2e 3 6 regression model development in order to assess the accuracy of the developed model the correlation between the obtained experimental results and the predicted values was evaluated using goodness of fit statistics se sy was used as an indication for the relative advancement in accuracy which means a smaller value leads to higher accuracy where se sy is the standard error divided by the standard deviation of measured values about the mean the r2 is known as the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the experimental results non linear regression analysis was performed by a solver function in excel software program for the model development many trials were carried out in order to develop a simple accurate prediction model for phenol degradation based on the measured experimental data the optimal model was performed by taking into consideration the four parameters initial concentration co time t current intensity i fe2 dose fe2 to get higher accuracy the final form of this model is shown in eq 5 5 r 0 0015189 co 0 141965 t 0 003897 i 0 00152 fe2

relationship between the predicated and measured phenol removal using the method of electro fenton along with the goodness of fit statistics a validation for the regression model was executed on random experiments as shown in table 1 the validation revealed that the developed model is appropriate for the prediction of the phenol degradation with an acceptable accuracy it is clear that the model has been deduced based on the experimental data so the model will be used in the range at which the data were taken the recommended conditions for applying the model are initial concentration 50 200 mg l time 0 120 min current intensity 400 900 ma fe2 dose 0 20 mg l 3 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing one input variable at a time while keeping all other inputs constant the values for the variable of inputs were changed between its minimum and maximum values based on the measured data for the other inputs they were kept constant at their averaged value the results of the sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 6b e this analysis can be used to rank the parameters in terms of its significance fig 6b states that the degradation efficiency of phenol is decreased at higher initial concentrations if all operating parameters are fixed the same finding was interpreted in experimental part by the consumption of hydroxyl radicals before the degradation of all phenol molecules the sensitivity results in fig 6 c shows that the predicated phenol removal gradually increases with time furthermore the increase in current intensity results in a significant increase in the predicated phenol removal as shown in fig 6d increasing the fe2 dose significantly increases predicated phenol removal as shown in fig 6e these findings are in accordance with the results obtained from the experimental work the most significant input parameters in descending order are time current intensity fe2 and initial concentration 3 8 model development by using artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is defined as a computational tool stimulated by biological neural systems it is a massively parallel distributed processor with the ability to learn and generalize ability for modeling complicated relationships between outputs and inputs or obtain similar patterns in data it consists of an interrelated group of artificial neurons nodes organized into various layers one or more input one or more hidden layer and one output layer 22 these nodes are joined to each other through synapses called the connections or links 40 41 the construction of neural network is shown in fig 7 a ann model of three layers as shown in fig 7a was developed for the prediction of phenol removal efficiency under different operational conditions the experimental parameters time current intensity fe2 dose and initial concentration were used as inputs to the ann model table 2 shows the range of variables studied the phenol removal efficiency was chosen as the required output from the network 112 experimental sets were selected out of several data points generated to feed the ann structure the samples were divided into three sets training 60 samples validation 20 samples and test 32 samples r2 for training and validation sets were 0 995 and 0 999 respectively the validation and test sets were randomly selected from the experimental results to assess the validation and accuracy of the model the maximum number of epochs was 3000 in order to investigate the performance of the network according to the following equation the mean square error mse was used as the error function according to eq 6 6 m s e 1 q i 1 i q y i p r e d y i e x p 2 where q is the number of data point yi pred network prediction yi exp experimental response and i is an index of data trail 4 20 1 four inputs one hidden layer consisting of one 20 neurons and one output yielded the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 9742 and lowest percent of se sy 0 16 fig 7b shows the relationship between the predicted and measured phenol removal and the goodness of fit statistics is included in the figure the usage of neural net weight matrix is to evaluate the relative significance of the different inputs to the output values eq 7 was used based for the partitioning of connection weights 42 7 i j m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h x w m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w k m i h k 1 n i w k m i h x w m n h o where ij is the relative significance of the jth input variable on the output variable ni and nh are the numbers of input and hidden neurons respectively ws are connection weights the superscripts i h and o are the input hidden and output layers respectively the subscripts k m and n are the input hidden and output neurons respectively the relative significance of input variables on the value of phenol removal efficiency was calculated by eq 7 it reveals that time is the most significant parameter affecting the phenol removal the sensitivity of predicted phenol removal to each parameter are estimated by the anns and the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 7c the sensitivity results from the anns in fig 7c were in accordance with results from the regression analysis that the time is the most significant parameter affects the predicated phenol removal then current intensity fe2 dose and initial concentration respectively 4 conclusions the present work was conducted to investigate performance of electro fenton process in degradation of phenol using feasible electrodes and operating conditions according to the obtained results the degradation of phenol is highly dependent on initial phenol concentration current intensity solution ph fe2 dose and anode material the optimum condition was at initial concentration of 50 mg l where the electro fenton reaction was able to degrade 95 2 of phenol using stainless steel anode in 90 min on the other hand the degradation was 72 using nickel anode in 120 min the optimal current intensity was 900 ma the optimal fe2 dose using stainless steel and nickel anodes were 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively based on the experimental results a predictive model for the phenol removal was developed using regression analysis the model showed good prediction accuracy r2 0 9525 in addition a developed artificial neural network model provided a strong tool for prediction of phenol removal efficiency with the same inputs as in the regression analysis yielded higher r2 value r2 0 9742 time current intensity fe2 and initial concentration of phenol are in descending order according to their significant effect on the phenol removal as concluded from the sensitivity study acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

14587,sacrificial stainless steel and nickel electrodes were used as anodes in electro fenton ef process for degradation of phenol in controlled operating conditions the influence of different operating parameters such as initial concentration of phenol current intensity fe2 dose ph and anode material were studied at optimal operating conditions the degradation of phenol was 95 2 using sacrificial stainless steel anode in 90 min and 72 using nickel anode in 120 min the favored current intensity was 900 ma the optimal fe2 doses using stainless steel and nickel anodes were 5 mg l and

neural network ann model was developed based on input layer of operating conditions and output layer of phenol degradation efficiency the ann model yielded a coefficient of determination r2 0 9742 and se sy 0 16 keywords anns electro fenton phenol wastewater 1 introduction phenol is one of the major bio recalcitrant contaminants that exist in many chemical and biochemical industries it is produced in the operation of pharmaceutical plants oil refineries coke plants resins industry olive mill and other food processing industries 1 2 it is preferred to perform degradation processes for phenol and other bio recalcitrant pollutants from its source before the discharge of industrial wastewater to sewer network or nearby drains because the ability of degradation of bio recalcitrant organics by conventional biological treatment is limited 3 without source treatment these contaminant might exist in low concentrations in the aquatic environment which threaten the aquatic organisms and may develop the bacteria resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants 4 advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a lot of attention as promising technologies for the degradation of various hazardous organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and phenolic compounds 5 aops include the generation of very strong reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals which have the ability to break down the stable and resistant chains of organic molecules and degrade them to simpler compounds and benign end products 6 among aops fenton reaction is one of the favored methods for degradation of phenolic compounds because of simplicity and low toxic residuals 7 8 in fenton reaction powerful reactive hydroxyl radicals are generated from h2o2 in presence fe2 ions fenton reaction could be carried out by different modified processes other than classical fenton reaction to obtain better degradation efficiency minimize residuals or save chemicals and energy modified processes include photo fenton electro fenton sono fenton and fenton like process 9 12 large production of ferric hydroxide sludge is considered to be one of the main disadvantages of most of fenton to overcome this problem the electro fenton ef process was developed by many researchers to minimize the generation of ferric hydroxide during the reaction 13 14 in addition it enhances the degradation efficiency of target compounds 15 16 in ef the reduction of ferric hydrogen sludge to form ferrous ions on the cathode is induced by applied current intensity 17 the negative potential near the cathode in the ef cell reduce the dissolved oxygen to form h2o2 in aqueous solutions the addition of fe2 salts leads to start a fenton reaction with the electrically produced h2o2 and ferric ions are continually formed during the process ferric ions are reduced back to ferrous ions near the cathode which enhance the oxidation of contaminants and reduce the amount of sludge 18 the major advantages of this method is the in situ production of h2o2 which minimize the transport and storage besides it utilizes a clean energy source to improve the performance of contamination removal 19 several parameters could influence the of ef process such as initial contaminant concentration ph current intensity and reagent dosage the obtained experimental results could be analyzed by linear and nonlinear regression to describe the correlation of these parameters to the process efficiency 20 artificial neural network ann is another method to describe the relation between the operating parameters and the process performance 21 the advantage of ann is linking the effect of all inputs to each other and to the outputs in three steps including training validation and test 22 the aim of this study is to investigate the performance of ef process for the degradation of phenol as a recalcitrant organic pollutant operational conditions such as initial phenol concentration current intensity fe2 dose ph and anode material were studied moreover simple predictive models are developed to describe phenol removal at different conditions using statistical regression analysis and the artificial annual

with 600 ml phenol solution of certain concentration a piece of carbon felt was used as a cathode 30cm 13 5cm 0 5 cm and fixed on the inner wall of the cylindrical glass two materials were tested as an anode including sacrificial stainless steel grade 304 plate 5cm 5cm 0 5 cm and nickel plate 4 2cm 4 2cm 0 5 cm the anode was placed in the center of the cylindrical glass a magnetic stirrer was used to provide a continuous vigorous stirring of the solution the solution was aerated for 10 min prior to the reaction and continued to the end of experiment time to increase the dissolved o2 hcl acid with specific quantities was added to obtain the required ph before starting the electro oxidation reaction a certain quantity of feso4 7h2o was added to the solution with the desired concentration na2so4 was added to the solution with concentration of 1000 mg l to maintain the ionic strength constant and improve the conductivity of the medium a dc power supply was connected to the

degradation of phenol was assessed at different conditions of initial concentration ph current intensity fe2 dosage and anode material these factors were chosen due to their significant influence on the performance of electro fenton process in order to introduce the performance of electro fenton process curves for different operating conditions were plotted portraying the remaining phenol amount c co versus the reaction time 3 1 effect of initial phenol concentration the degradation of phenol at different initial concentrations is shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b the obtained results indicated that the removal efficiency decreases with the increase in the initial concentration of phenol and more reaction time is required for complete degradation fig 1a states that the removal efficiencies of phenol by nickel anode were 72 69 2 65 64 7 and 51 42 at initial concentration of 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively in 120 min of electro fenton reaction fig 1b demonstrates that the removal efficiencies of phenol by stainless steel electrode were 95 2 92 5 90 6 and 72 4 at initial concentration of 50 75 100 and 200 mg l respectively in 90 min of reaction time the degradation efficiency of phenol at higher initial concentration decreased because the amount of hydroxyl radicals remained constant regardless of the initial phenol concentration additional time and fenton reagent may be needed to attain more efficient degradation at higher initial concentration 23 mineralization of phenol was observed by measuring the toc removal during electro fenton reaction as shown in fig 1c the removal of toc was about 41 in 120 min while phenol degradation was 65 at the beginning of the electro fenton reaction the mineralization rate was effective then became slower but faster than phenol decay it may be due to the fact that phenol forms aromatic and aliphatic intermediates which need prolonged time and more hydroxyl radicals for complete mineralization benzoquinone catechol and hydroquinone are the most prevalent intermediates that generated by oxidation of phenol 24 these intermediates are observed in water as toc during the reaction and they are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to more benign organics 25 at the beginning of reaction maleic fumaric succinic and glyoxylic are predominantly formed while oxalic and formic acids are produced later the end products after the complete degradation of intermediates are mainly co2 and h2o 26 adding supporting electrolyte such as sodium sulfate with dose of 1 g l improved degradation of phenol from 23 to 88 3 in 60 min of reaction as shown in fig 1d adding na2so4 improves the conductivity of the solution which led to higher current density that resulted in improved production of h2o2 higher concentration of h2o2 enhanced the fenton reaction which improves the phenol degradation rates 27 ghoneim et al 28 reported that so4 2 salts are the most efficient supporting electrolyte in electro fenton process compared to cl salts like nacl and kcl thus na2so4 was only considered in this work 3 2 effect of current intensity current intensity is a major parameter which has a remarkable influence on the degradation of organics by electro fenton process 23 fig 2 shows the degradation of phenol under different current intensity the obtained results indicated that increasing the applied current intensity significantly improves the degradation efficiency after a reaction time of 120 min the degradation efficiencies of phenol were 65 41 28 35 and 27 2 at 900 ma 700 ma 600 ma and 400 ma respectively thus 900 ma is considered to be the optimum current intensity current intensity of 900 ma was provided by applying voltage difference of 35 v this finding can be explained as the applied current intensity is an important factor for producing of h2o2 near the cathode 27 improving the production of h2o2 increases the rate of fenton reaction and hence more reactive species are formed which are effective to the phenol degradation 29 higher applied current intensity increases the applied potential and offers higher electro regeneration of fe2 from fe3 so improved the efficiency of fenton chain reaction 30 in addition the sacrificing of fe2 from the stainless steel electrode will be enhanced at higher current intensity 31 higher electro generated fe2 beside the active production of h2o2 yields to more efficient fenton reaction which improves the degradation rate of phenol 3 3 effect of ph generally the ph has a great influence on fenton reaction activity many studies reported that reducing of ph enhances the fenton process rate and the oxidation ability of hydroxyl radical and hence the degradation of organics is favored in acidic conditions 8 32 accordingly the phenol degradation was tested under different ph in the acidic range the obtained results are shown in fig 3 after 120 min of reaction time the degradation of phenol was 44 3 65 and 43 8 at ph values of 2 3 and 4 respectively at ph 4 fe 3 started to be precipitated in the form of amorphous fe oh 3 moreover the regeneration of fe2 was inhibited and the dissolved fe3 was reduced by the formation of fe oh 3 eqs 1 2 which partially coated the electrode surface 33 hence a considerable part of fe2 did not involve in fenton reaction which resulted in lower degradation of phenol on the other hand at ph 2 hydrogen ions act as hydroxyl radical scavengers 34 furthermore it is reported that at extreme lower ph high concentration of h ions enhance the formation of stable oxonium ion h3o2 by getting the peroxide solvated eq 3 23 an oxonium ion improves the peroxide s stability resulting in reducing the reactivity with fe2 ion in fenton reaction 8 9 similar trends were reported in the literature for degradation of organic contaminants by different forms of fenton reaction 23 27 accordingly the favored ph in these experiments was considered to be 3 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh ho 2 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 s 3h 3 h2o2 h h3o2 3 4 effect of fe2 dose fig 4 a depicts the degradation of phenol under different doses of fe2 using nickel anode loading higher doses of fe2 positively enhanced the degradation of phenol after 120 min of electrochemical operation the removal efficiencies of phenol were 65 33 3 and 34 44 using fe2 dose of 20 5 and 0 mg l respectively further increase of fe2 dose did not add significant improvement to the degradation efficiency and more precipitated fe oh 2 was noticed accordingly the optimum fe2 dose was considered 20 mg l the improvement of phenol degradation is due to abundance of hydroxyl radicals which are actively produced during fenton reaction at higher doses of fe2 36 the degradation of phenol at zero dosage of fe2 may be due to the oxidation by h2o2 which is generated near the cathode or by ho 2 which is produced by the decomposition of h2o2 near the anode elaborated explanation for degradation of organic by electrochemical processes in absence of fe2 is reported by ghoneim et al 37 38 3 5 effect of anode material the performance of stainless steel anode was compared to the performance of nickel anode under the same conditions as shown in fig 5 a after 90 min of electro fenton reaction the degradation of phenol was 90 6 using stainless steel anode while the degradation was 65 using nickel anode stainless steel grade 304 does not contain molybdenum so it is not ideal corrosion resistant material accordingly a considerable amount of iron is sacrificed from the anode during the electrochemical process eq 4 the sacrificed amount of iron during the electrochemical process was detected by measuring the iron as shown in fig 5b the observed results stated that the concentration of dissolved iron is increased along the time till 20 min then the concentration decreased till 100 min and then is increased again this is due to the consumption of iron during the electro fenton reaction as given in eqs 1 and 2 while the formation of fe oh 3 was low therefore the concentration of iron increased then the concentration decreased because the regeneration of fe2 was diminished and the dissolved fe3 was reduced by the formation of fe oh 3 eq 2 after 100 min of the reaction iron concentration increased again because the consumption by fenton reaction became less 33 the favorability of stainless steel may also be attributed to the fact that stainless steel has better conductivity at high current intensity and in corrosive mediums 39 4 fe fe2 2e 3 6 regression model development in order to assess the accuracy of the developed model the correlation

relationship between the predicated and measured phenol removal using the method of electro fenton along with the goodness of fit statistics a validation for the regression model was executed on random experiments as shown in table 1 the validation revealed that the developed model is appropriate for the prediction of the phenol degradation with an acceptable accuracy it is clear that the model has been deduced based on the experimental data so the model will be used in the range at which the data were taken the recommended conditions for applying the model are initial concentration 50 200 mg l time 0 120 min current intensity 400 900 ma fe2 dose 0 20 mg l 3 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing one input variable at a time while keeping all other inputs constant the values for the variable of inputs were changed between its minimum and maximum values based on the measured data for the other inputs they were kept constant at their averaged value the results of the sensitivity analysis are illustrated in fig 6b e this analysis can be used to rank the parameters in terms of its significance fig 6b states that the degradation efficiency of phenol is decreased at higher initial concentrations if all operating parameters are fixed the same finding was interpreted in experimental part by the consumption of hydroxyl radicals before the degradation of all phenol molecules the sensitivity results in fig 6 c shows that the predicated phenol removal gradually increases with time furthermore the increase in current intensity results in a significant increase in the predicated phenol removal as shown in fig 6d increasing the fe2 dose significantly increases predicated phenol removal as shown in fig 6e these findings are in accordance with the results obtained from the experimental work the most significant input parameters in descending order are time current intensity fe2 and initial concentration 3 8 model development by using artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is defined as a computational tool stimulated by biological neural systems it is a massively parallel distributed processor with the ability to learn and generalize ability for modeling complicated relationships between outputs and inputs or obtain similar patterns in data it consists of an interrelated group of artificial neurons nodes organized into various layers one or more input one or more hidden layer and one output layer 22 these nodes are joined to each other through synapses called the connections or links 40 41 the construction of neural network is shown in fig 7 a ann model of three layers as shown in fig 7a was developed for the prediction of phenol removal efficiency under different operational conditions the experimental parameters time current intensity fe2 dose and initial concentration were used as inputs to the ann model table 2 shows the range of variables studied the phenol removal efficiency was chosen as the required output from the network 112 experimental sets were selected out of several data points generated to feed the ann structure the samples were divided into three sets training 60 samples validation 20 samples and test 32 samples r2 for training and validation sets were 0 995 and 0 999 respectively the validation and test sets were randomly selected from the experimental results to assess the validation and accuracy of the model the maximum number of epochs was 3000 in order to investigate the performance of the network according to the following equation the mean square error mse was used as the error function according to eq 6 6 m s e 1 q i 1 i q y i p r e d y i e x p 2 where q is the number of data point yi pred network prediction yi exp experimental response and i is an index of data trail 4 20 1 four inputs one hidden layer consisting of one 20 neurons and one output yielded the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 9742 and lowest percent of se sy 0 16 fig 7b shows the relationship between the predicted and measured phenol removal and the goodness of fit statistics is included in the figure the usage of neural net weight matrix is to evaluate the relative significance of the different inputs to the output values eq 7 was used based for the partitioning of connection weights 42 7 i j m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h x w m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w k m i h k 1 n i w k m i h x w m n h o where ij is the relative significance of the jth input variable on the output variable ni and nh are the numbers of input and hidden neurons respectively ws are connection weights the superscripts i h and o are the input hidden and output layers respectively the subscripts k m and n are the input hidden and output neurons respectively the relative significance of input variables on the value of phenol removal efficiency was calculated by eq 7 it reveals that time is the most significant parameter affecting the phenol removal the sensitivity of predicted phenol removal to each parameter are estimated by the anns and the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 7c the sensitivity results from the anns in fig 7c were in accordance with results from the regression analysis that the time is the most significant parameter affects the predicated phenol removal then current intensity fe2 dose and initial concentration respectively 4 conclusions the present work was conducted to investigate performance of electro fenton process in degradation of phenol using feasible electrodes and operating conditions according to the obtained results the degradation of phenol is highly dependent on initial phenol concentration current intensity solution ph fe2 dose and anode material the optimum condition was at initial concentration of 50 mg l where the electro fenton reaction was able to degrade 95 2 of phenol using stainless steel anode in 90 min on the other hand the degradation was 72 using nickel anode in 120 min the optimal current intensity was 900 ma the optimal fe2 dose using stainless steel and nickel anodes were 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively based on the experimental results a predictive model for the phenol removal was developed using regression analysis the model showed good prediction accuracy r2 0 9525 in addition a developed artificial neural network model provided a strong tool for prediction of phenol removal efficiency with the same inputs as in the regression analysis yielded higher r2 value r2 0 9742 time current intensity fe2 and initial concentration of phenol are in descending order according to their significant effect on the phenol removal as concluded from the sensitivity study acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

method x ray diffraction and photo acoustic spectroscopy techniques were applied for the catalysts characterization the parameters studied in the reaction were presence of additives ph amount of catalyst effect of inorganic compounds adsorption photolysis type of catalyst additives and the time of contact of the additive catalyst no significant reduction in the ba ii concentration was observed in absence of additive however a reduction higher than 50 was observed in the presence of addictive after 120 min of reaction time moreover the effect of cl ions generally present in natural waters indicated an increase in the ba ii reduction time the adsorption and photolysis tests were not efficient in the ba ii removal however the contact time between the additive formic acid and the catalyst before the photocatalytic process showed an improvement in the catalytic activity for all catalysts studied therefore the photocatalysis tests indicated that the catalysts that showed the highest efficiency in the ba ii removal were anatase p25 and zno respectively the maximum percentage of ba ii removal was obtained using anatase as catalyst and at optimized conditions ba ii removal was higher than 99 were obtained a reaction time of 90 min keywords barium ions titanium dioxide photocatalysis water treatment 1 introduction barium ba is an element that presents high solubility in water characteristic that results in a great mobility in the environment 1 2 this element is potentially toxic and human exposure to ba may cause various health problems such as heart and or kidney failure pulmonary edema respiratory paralysis and gastric and intestinal excessive bleeding 3 barium is also present in industrial waste from chemical petrochemical automotive metallurgical and industrial processes among others however there are few studies in the literature concerning the pollutant potential of ba but due to new and increasing applications of ba in industrial processes and therefore an increase in the potential of human exposure to this element there is a need to develop effective processes for ba removal from the environment 3 4 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has set the maximum limit concentration for 2 0 mg l 1 ppm in water samples 5 and in brazil the brazilian ministry of health portaria n 2 914l 12 2011 has established a limit of 0 7 mg l 1 of ba in drinking water 6 in this context the heterogeneous photocatalysis has aroused great interest due to its potential application in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in different matrices 7 11 titanium dioxide tio2 is one of the most widely semiconductors used as catalysts in photocatalytic processes due to its non corrosive nontoxic high photo activity high photo stability and economical nature titanium dioxide occurs in three distinct polymorphs rutile anatase and brookite however anatase and rutile crystal structures are commonly used as photocatalyst although for most reactions anatase form showing greater photocatalytic activity 12 15 in anatase form tio2 has band gap energy of 3 2 ev and thus needs light below 388 nm to be capable of producing electron hole pairs however other semiconductors such as zinc oxide zno and niobium pentoxide nb2o5 have been used as catalysts in photocatalytic processes for the removal of several compounds 16 18 zinc dioxide crystallizes in three forms hexagonal wurtzite cubic zincblende and the rock salt rarely observed 19 the wurtzite structure is more stable at ambient conditions 20 and therefore the most common form of zno this oxide is a suitable semiconductor due to its high photocatalytic activity approximate band gap energy 3 4 ev 19 and similar photocatalytic mechanism of reaction as compared to tio2 zinc oxide and tio2 possessed different redox energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valance bands zinc oxide is also one of the most extensively investigated photocatalysts and has relatively high catalyst efficiency low cost non toxic and chemical stability 7 some studies demonstrate the use of zno as a photocatalyst for dye photodegradation 21 22 niobium pentoxide as an n type transition metal oxide semiconductor has been largely studied in sensors electrochromics and bioelectrochemistry this catalyst has been applied for dye photodegradation in the textile industry 7 thus this work proposes the use of photocatalytic processes for reduction and subsequent removal of ba ii in aqueous solutions the experimental conditions of ph type effect and concentration of additives concentration of catalyst tio2 anatase and presence of interfering ions will be optimized in addition the influence of different catalysts and the effect of the catalyst additive interaction on the ba

cbmm brazil 2 2 pore properties b e t method pore volumes were established using a quantachrome analyzer model nova 1200 with n2 adsorption at 77 k both calcined at 623 15 k during 4 h under static air atmosphere and non calcined samples were submitted to these analyses the samples had been previously submitted to a thermal treatment at 573 k under 2 h vacuum to eliminate any existing water within the pores of the solids 2 3 characterization of photocatalyst the techniques used to characterize the catalysts were photo acoustic spectroscopy pas x ray diffraction xrd 2 3 1 photo acoustic spectroscopy band gaps of the catalysts were determined by photoacoustic spectroscopy all the measurements in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions were performed using a lab made experimental setup we obtained the monochromatic light through a 1000 w xenon arc lamp oriel corporation 68820 and a monochromator model 77250 oriel the light beam was modulated by a mechanical chopper stanford research systems sr540 a lab made photoacoustic cell was made of aluminum block machined to hold samples with dimensions up to 5 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness which allows light to enter through a high transparent quartz window of 6 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness the distance of the microphone chamber was 15 mm it was connected to the sample holder room through a 1 mm diameter duct the capacitive microphone used was the 12 mm diameter bruel kjaer model 2639 very sensitive presenting a gain of 50 mv pa and a frequency response between 1 hz and 10 khz we used a lock in amplifier by eg g instruments model 5110 all the photoacoustic spectra were obtained at a 20 hz modulation frequency and recorded between 220 and 720 nm data were acquired using a personal computer and the pas spectra were normalized with respect to the carbon black signal the band gap energies were established through eq 1 1 λ h c e g a p 1240 e g a p where e gap is the band gap energy in ev units h is planck constant and c speed of light the direct method was applied to obtain the values ie m 2 23 2 3 2 x ray diffraction the samples were measured in a rigaku denki diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at a voltage of 140 v and current of 40 ma the patterns obtained were then compared with the diffraction dataset from the joint committee of powder diffraction standards 2 4 photocatalytic experiments all the photocatalytic experiments were performed in a closed system in absence of natural light in the system the photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a 1000 ml borosilicate reactor under magnetic agitation using a speed of agitation sufficiently high to guarantee the homogeneous catalyst dispersion on the analytical solution and an air flow of 13 l h 1 the temperature of the system was kept constant at 293 k by an ultra thermostatic bath model sp 152 10 ultraviolet radiation was provided by a 250 w mercury vapor lamp without the external glass bulb the samples were collected in regular intervals centrifuged and the remaining concentration of ba ii in solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry perkin elmer aanalyst 700 adsorption tests were performed applying the same procedure but without presence of light photolysis tests were also performed without catalyst 3 results and discussion the results of the specific surface area mean pore diameter and pore volume are presented in table 1 as observed the different forms of tio2 analyzed p 25 anatase commercial and commercial calcined at 623 15 k showed significant differences in the surface areas the highest surface area was obtained for tio2 p 25 33 95 m2 g approaching the literature data in which the surface area varies around 40 50 m2 g 24 25 however when comparing the specific surface area of non calcined commercial tio2 19 78 m2 g and the calcined at 623 15 k 12 74 m2 g it is possible to observe that there is a decrease in the specific surface area which is possibly due to particles agglomeration during the calcinations 26 in addition teh et al also found that high calcination temperature of 600 c reduced the specific surface area up to eight times as compared to the catalyst which was calcined at 200 c 27 titanium dioxide in anatase form showed a specific surface area of 6 12 m2 g which was the smallest in comparison with the other forms of tio2 and other oxides nb2o5 and zno the specific surface area obtained for the zno and nb2o5 oxides were 7 89 and 11 50 m2 g respectively the zno has a smaller specific surface area 3 23 m2 g reported in the literature 28 3 1 characterization of the catalysts data collected from uv vis indicated values of energy gap and photocatalyst absorption bands fig 1 comparing the band gaps obtained from the commercial tio2 calcined and non calcined no change was observed in the band gap value obtained 2 98 ev the difference in the band gap value could confirm the coexistence of different phases 29 however this was not possible due to the use of the low calcination temperature of 623 15 k on the other hand the tio2 in anatase form and p25 obtained band gap values of 3 10 and 3 12 ev respectively these values are close to those found in the literature 30 7 for the zno catalysts the band gap obtained 3 12 ev which is the same value obtained for the tio2 in anatase form indicated in the literature as the most active form in photocatalysis 31 niobium pentoxide band gap was 3 84 ev being within the range indicated in the literature 3 1 4 0 ev 29 the xrd patterns of the photocatalyst tio2 p 25 anatase commercial non calcined and calcined 623 15 k are shown in fig 2 crystalline structures were observed for tio2 but the nb2o5 was predominantly amorphous which influenced the band gap result as expected the diffractograms indicated anatase and rutile tio2 forms for the commercial non calcined and calcined and p 25 catalysts according to literature data the p 25 form presents a percentage of anatase and rutile of 80 and 20 respectively 30 however the thermal treatment calcination did not modify the structure of the tio2 commercial 3 2 photocatalytic activity titanium dioxide is the most widely used catalyst in photocatalytic processes thus it was used in anatase form to optimize the ba ii removal process by photocatalysis additionally the influence of the effect of different additives ph catalyst mass initial ba ii concentration and matrix influence on ba ii removal were evaluated 3 2 1 effect of the presence of additives considering a photocatalytic reduction the presence of additives usually organic compounds becomes necessary this is because the presence of these can alter the rate of the photocatalytic reaction 32 33 the effect of the presence of formic acid isopropanol and methanol all in the concentration of 0 5 g l 1 and ph 7 0 on the removal of ba ii in solution is showed in fig 3 however only the formic acid showed a positive effect on the removal of ba ii from the solution all the other additives did not provide a significant improvement in the percentage of ba ii removal in solution and the results obtained were comparable to those obtained without additives no significant effect of presence of alcohol was also reported at literature for degradation of organic compound in aqueous solution according to hazime et al the presence of isopropanol and methanol as potential hydroxyl scavengers results in a negative effect in the imazalil degradation by photocatalytic process using tio2 as catalyst 34 formic acid is an additive widely used in photocatalytic processes aiming at the photo reduction of metals 23 35 this fact is due to the characteristics of the formic acid molecule which due to its reduced size facilitates the contact on the surface of the catalyst promoting its direct oxidation in addition the oxidation products of this additive are co2 and h2o which do not cause damage to the environment in this case the contact of the formic acid on the surface of the tio2 in anatase form possibly made it active facilitating the oxidation and consequently the removal of ba ii from the solution thus in the evaluated system the photocatalytic process with the addition of 0 5 g l 1 of formic acid allowed the removal of up to 81 ba ii in solution in 240 min of photocatalytic reaction the influence of the formic acid concentration on the ba ii removal was evaluated concentrations of 0 01 and 0 11 mol l 1 were tested in ph 7 0 and the results obtained are presented in fig 4 as noted previously the removal of ba ii by photocatalysis was not effective in the absence of catalyst however the presence of additive in the concentration of 0 01 mol l 1 promoted a reduction of ba ii concentration in solution higher than 50 the results indicated that the presence of additive at concentrations higher than 0 01 mol l 1 did not provide significant improvement in ba ii removal as observed for the experiments with 0 11 mol l 1 formic acid similar behavior was observed for nitrate reduction using different catalysts in the mentioned work the photocatalytic activity was not improved by increasing the formic acid concentration the authors suggest that a competition between formic acid and nitrate ion maybe occurring during the adsorption of these ions onto catalyst surface 36 37 thus the subsequent studies were carried out with the addition of 0 01 mol l 1 of formic acid as additive 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the environment has a major influence on the photocatalytic reactions depending on the ph of the solution the generated electrons can reduce protons water oxygen and metal ions photocatalytic reduction of metals is generally favored at high ph values 38 the effect of ph on the removal of ba ii in solution via photocatalysis is presented in fig 5 a range of ph from 2 5 to 9 0 was evaluated maintaining the concentration of additive 0 01 mol l 1 the initial concentration of ba ii 50 mg l 1 and a reaction time of 120 min under these conditions it is possible to observe that at ph values lower than 5 5 the reduction of ba ii concentration in solution was not significant however at ph values higher than 7 0 the ba ii removal was considerably higher zohreh majidnia et al evaluated the efficiency of ba ii removal from radioactive waste water using the combination of maghemite and titania nanoparticles in pva and alginate beads the authors reported a progressively improvement in the ba ii sorption capability until ph 8 this behavior can be attributed a competition between ba ii and h3o ions toward the catalyst surface since high concentration of h3o ions can have a negative effect on the ba ii adsorption 39 thus considering that during the photocatalytic process there is a prior absorption of the analyte on the catalyst surface for ph values lower than 5 5 the competition of h3o ions could be one responsible by the no significative ba ii removal 3 2 3 effect of catalyst concentration and initial concentration of ba ii the optimization of the amount of catalyst in the photocatalysis process is indicated to avoid the unnecessary use of catalyst and because high amounts can hinder the photocatalysis process increase the turbidity of the solution and consequently reduce the passage of the radiation 38 to evaluate the influence of the catalyst concentration on the reaction experiments were performed using catalyst concentrations in the range of 0 05 1 5 g l 1 fig 6 an increase in photocatalytic activity is observed when the catalyst concentration increases from 0 05 to 0 1 g l 1 however at catalyst concentrations greater than 0 5 g l 1 there is no significant improvement in photocatalytic activity thus further studies were carried out using 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst the reduction potential of metal ions is dependent on the concentration of the ions in solution generally the photocatalytic reduction potential decreases with the reduction of the metal ions concentration in solution leading to slower removal processes 38 the effect of the initial ba ii concentration on the photocatalytic process was evaluated the removal of ba ii in solutions with concentrations of 10 30 and 45 mg l 1 were evaluated and the results showed that for 10 mg l 1 concentration the process was delayed by about 80 min fig 6b 3 2 4 effect of chloride ions both natural and residual waters naturally contain dissolved organic and inorganic species these species can exert great influence on the catalytic activity being able to lead to processes that are spontaneous photochemical thus the effect of the presence of ions is an important parameter to be evaluated in photocatalytic processes according to the literature the presence of cl provides a retarding effect on the oxidation rate of organic compounds competing for radicals or blocking the active sites of the catalyst 38 to verify these effects experiments using aqueous solution containing different concentrations of cl ions were performed fig 7 it was observed that the ions exerted great influence on the ba ii removal kinetics making the reaction significantly slower at higher concentrations of cl the presence of 46 and 91 mg l 1 of cl in the solution delayed the reaction in 12 and 69 respectively in relation to the solution without presence of ions after 360 min a negative effect of chloride presence was also observed by zheng et al during the cyanide and cooper removal in aqueous solution according to the authors the negative effect of chloride ions in the evaluated photocatalytic reaction can be described by the scavenging of hydrogen radicals and competitive adsorption promoted by chloride ions 35 3 2 5 catalyst type in addition to the tio2 in the anatase form the mixture of rutile and anatase phases p 25 composed of 80 anatase and 20 rutile is also widely used because of an increase in photocatalytic performance besides these other catalysts are being studied in the removal of pollutants by photocatalysis such as the zno and recently the nb2o5 16 17 to evaluate the influence of the type of catalyst on ba removal the experiments were carried out using tio2 in the anatase form commercial tio2 p 25 zno and nb2o5 as catalyst using the optimum conditions previously defined 0 1 g l 1 catalyst 0 5 g l 1 formic acid ph 7 3 2 6 adsorption test adsorption tests on the surface of the catalysts were performed to prove the efficiency of the photocatalysis and absence of adsorption effects of the analyte on the surface of the catalyst thus experiments were carried out in the absence of light using 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst 0 01 mol l 1 of formic acid ph 7 the results fig 8 a demonstrate that there was no significant adsorption of ba ii using the catalysts p25 zno and tio2 in anatase form on the other hand the use of nb2o5 ba ii presented a 21 adsorption in 360 min of reaction considering that nb2o5 can occur in the amorphous state or in one of many different crystalline polymorphs 40 the high ba ii ions adsorption values may be attributed to the specific structural characteristics of this catalyst in fig 8b it is also possible to observe that the photolysis performed without the presence of catalyst the ba ii removal was not significant at the showed reaction time 360 min 3 2 7 effect of additive catalyst interaction time the results of the adsorption tests indicated that this process is not significant in ba ii removal however in the photocatalysis tests it was observed that previous agitation of the catalyst with the formic acid led to a reduction of the reaction time from this the tests were directed to verify the effect of the additive catalyst interaction tests were carried out keeping the system agitated with the immediate activation of the lamp after the addition of the catalyst solution containing ba ii and additive and tests keeping the system agitated for 2 h prior to the activation of the lamp evidencing the interaction of the additive catalyst fig 9 with the conditions optimized according to item 3 4 the results of the tests without prior shaking indicated a larger reduction using the p25 catalyst with 99 ba removal in 240 min the tio2 in anatase form also showed 99 removal with slower kinetics reaction 300 min and zno with 98 in 360 min of reaction anatase and zno presented similar surface areas as well as the band gap and crystalline structures the anatase obtained the largest surface area 33 95 m2 g and a band gap of 3 10 ev with a structure composed of crystalline forms of anatase and rutile which directly influences the photocatalytic performance the nb2o5 showed a different behavior with the process being initially faster but gradually decreasing until reaching 51 reduction of ba ii in 300 min of reaction this behavior can be attributed to its predominantly amorphous form with a high band gap 3 84 ev and these characteristics are not suitable for photocatalytic processes on the other hand the adsorption tests carried out in the absence of radiation fig 8 show that the niobium pentoxide had a significant adsorption of ba ii 21 in 360 min in the commercial catalyst non calcined and calcined no significant removal was observed despite a specific surface area of 19 78 and 12 74 m2 g respectively and a band gap 2 98 ev this result is possibly because it is a catalyst containing impurities and because of the predominant presence of the rutile form however using prior stirring 2 h to trigger the lamp a large change in the kinetics reaction was observed the ba ii removal results with all catalysts studied were faster when compared to the same test without prior agitation but with a similar behavior it is observed that there was no change in the initial concentration of ba ii after the previous shaking period in the absence of light showing that the change in the kinetic behavior is not due to the adsorption effects of ba ii on the catalyst but rather resulting from the likely additive catalyst interaction with similar agitation the same reduction percentage was found for tio2 in anatase form and p25 99 but with a reaction time 90 min much lower than the time found without previous agitation p25 240 min and tio2 in anatase form 300 min for the zno with the previous interaction period a reduction in the reaction time required for the removal of ba ii of approximately 2 h occurred with removal of 98 the obtained results for ba ii removal were comparable with those obtained by majidnia et al for barium removal from radioactive waste water using the combination of maghemite and titania nanoparticles in pva and alginate beads according to the authors 99 of the ba ii was eliminated in 150 min at ph 8 39 in a similar paper zohreh majidnia and ani idris evaluated removal of barium from radioactive aqueous solution by pva alginate encapsulated titanium oxide using sunlight and other light types at the optimized conditions ba ii removal of 98 was achieved in130 min of reaction time under sunlight 41 using nb2o5 as catalyst a reduction of ba ii concentration can be observed at the first minutes of photocatalytic reaction however this effect can be also attributed to the adsorption of ba ii on the catalyst surface as observed in fig 8 for tio2 calcined and not calcined the previous agitation provided a slight improvement in the photocatalytic activity on the other hand the ba ii removal was not significant only 6 removal 4 conclusions the ba ii removal process by photocatalysis was performed and the effect of different additives and catalysts was evaluated it can be verified that the surface area is not a determining factor for the process and the other fundamental characteristics are for example the structural form and crystallinity of the sample the photocatalytic process was optimized with tio2 in anatase form and indicated that the formic acid was the best additive compared to methanol isopropanol and without additive in a ph range of 2 5 9 0 the results indicated that the reduction was not significant for acidic phs below 5 5 the effect of chloride ions present indicated an increase in the time of removal of ba ii adsorption and photolysis tests showed that these processes were not efficient in ba ii removal the contact time between the additive formic acid and the catalyst before the photocatalytic process proved to be important significantly improving the catalytic activity the photocatalysis tests with and without additive catalyst contact time indicated that the best catalysts under these conditions were anatase p25 and zno respectively at 90 min of reaction time the maximum ba ii removal higher than 99 was obtained using anatase as catalyst

although for most reactions anatase form showing greater photocatalytic activity 12 15 in anatase form tio2 has band gap energy of 3 2 ev and thus needs light below 388 nm to be capable of producing electron hole pairs however other semiconductors such as zinc oxide zno and niobium pentoxide nb2o5 have been used as catalysts in photocatalytic processes for the removal of several compounds 16 18 zinc dioxide crystallizes in three forms hexagonal wurtzite cubic zincblende and the rock salt rarely observed 19 the wurtzite structure is more stable at ambient conditions 20 and therefore the most common form of zno this oxide is a suitable semiconductor due to its high photocatalytic activity approximate band gap energy 3 4 ev 19 and similar photocatalytic mechanism of reaction as compared to tio2 zinc oxide and tio2 possessed different redox energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valance bands zinc oxide is also one of the most extensively investigated photocatalysts and has relatively high catalyst efficiency low cost non toxic and chemical stability 7 some studies demonstrate the use of zno as a photocatalyst for dye photodegradation 21 22 niobium pentoxide as an n type transition metal oxide semiconductor has been largely studied in sensors electrochromics and bioelectrochemistry this catalyst has been applied for dye photodegradation in the textile industry 7 thus this work proposes the use of photocatalytic processes for reduction and subsequent removal of ba ii in aqueous solutions the experimental conditions of ph type effect and concentration of additives concentration of catalyst tio2 anatase and presence of interfering ions will be optimized in addition the influence of different catalysts and the effect of the catalyst additive interaction on the ba

air atmosphere and non calcined samples were submitted to these analyses the samples had been previously submitted to a thermal treatment at 573 k under 2 h vacuum to eliminate any existing water within the pores of the solids 2 3 characterization of photocatalyst the techniques used to characterize the catalysts were photo acoustic spectroscopy pas x ray diffraction xrd 2 3 1 photo acoustic spectroscopy band gaps of the catalysts were determined by photoacoustic spectroscopy all the measurements in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions were performed using a lab made experimental setup we obtained the monochromatic light through a 1000 w xenon arc lamp oriel corporation 68820 and a monochromator model 77250 oriel the light beam was modulated by a mechanical chopper stanford research systems sr540 a lab made photoacoustic cell was made of aluminum block machined to hold samples with dimensions up to 5 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness which allows light to enter through a high transparent quartz window of 6 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness the distance of the microphone chamber was 15 mm it was connected to the sample holder room through a 1 mm diameter duct the capacitive microphone used was the 12 mm diameter bruel kjaer model 2639 very sensitive presenting a gain of 50 mv pa and a frequency response between 1 hz and 10 khz we used a lock in amplifier by eg g instruments model 5110 all the photoacoustic spectra were obtained at a 20 hz modulation frequency and recorded between 220 and 720 nm data were acquired using a personal computer and the pas spectra were normalized with respect to the carbon black signal the band gap energies were established through eq 1 1 λ h c e g a p 1240 e g a p where e gap is the band gap energy in ev units h is planck constant and c speed of light the direct method was applied to obtain the values ie m 2 23 2 3 2 x ray diffraction the samples were measured in a rigaku denki diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at a voltage of 140 v and current of 40 ma the patterns obtained were then compared with the diffraction dataset from the joint committee of powder diffraction standards 2 4 photocatalytic experiments all the photocatalytic experiments were performed in a closed system in absence of natural light in the system the photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a 1000 ml borosilicate reactor under magnetic agitation using a speed of agitation sufficiently high to guarantee the homogeneous catalyst dispersion on the analytical solution and an air flow of 13 l h 1 the temperature of the system was kept constant at 293 k by an ultra thermostatic bath model sp 152 10 ultraviolet radiation was provided by a 250 w mercury vapor lamp without the external glass bulb the samples were collected in regular intervals centrifuged and the remaining concentration of ba ii in solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry perkin elmer aanalyst 700 adsorption tests were performed applying the same procedure but without presence of light photolysis tests were also performed without catalyst 3 results and discussion the results of the specific surface area mean pore diameter and pore volume are presented in table 1 as observed the different forms of tio2 analyzed p 25 anatase commercial and commercial calcined at 623 15 k showed significant differences in the surface areas the highest surface area was obtained for tio2 p 25 33 95 m2 g approaching the literature data in which the surface area varies around 40 50 m2 g 24 25 however when comparing the specific surface area of non calcined commercial tio2 19 78 m2 g and the calcined at 623 15 k 12 74 m2 g it is possible to observe that there is a decrease in the specific surface area which is possibly due to particles agglomeration during the calcinations 26 in addition teh et al also found that high calcination temperature of 600 c reduced the specific surface area up to eight times as compared to the catalyst which was calcined at 200 c 27 titanium dioxide in anatase form showed a specific surface area of 6 12 m2 g which was the smallest in comparison with the other forms of tio2 and other oxides nb2o5 and zno the specific surface area obtained for the zno and nb2o5 oxides were 7 89 and 11 50 m2 g respectively the zno has a smaller specific surface area 3 23 m2 g reported in the literature 28 3 1 characterization of the catalysts data collected from uv vis indicated values of energy gap and photocatalyst absorption bands fig 1 comparing the band gaps obtained from the commercial tio2 calcined and non calcined no change was observed in the band gap value obtained 2 98 ev the difference in the band gap value could confirm the coexistence of different phases 29 however this was not possible due to the use of the low calcination temperature of 623 15 k on the other hand the tio2 in anatase form and p25 obtained band gap values of 3 10 and 3 12 ev respectively these values are close to those found in the literature 30 7 for the zno catalysts the band gap obtained 3 12 ev which is the same value obtained for the tio2 in anatase form indicated in the literature as the most active form in photocatalysis 31 niobium pentoxide band gap was 3 84 ev being within the range indicated in the literature 3 1 4 0 ev 29 the xrd patterns of the photocatalyst tio2 p 25 anatase commercial non calcined and calcined 623 15 k are shown in fig 2 crystalline structures were observed for tio2 but the nb2o5 was predominantly amorphous which influenced the band gap result as expected the diffractograms indicated anatase and rutile tio2 forms for the commercial non calcined and calcined and p 25 catalysts according to literature data the p 25 form presents a percentage of anatase and rutile of 80 and 20 respectively 30 however the thermal treatment calcination did not modify the structure of the tio2 commercial 3 2 photocatalytic activity titanium dioxide is the most widely used catalyst in photocatalytic processes thus it was used in anatase form to optimize the ba ii removal process by photocatalysis additionally the influence of the effect of different additives ph catalyst mass initial ba ii concentration and matrix influence on ba ii removal were evaluated 3 2 1 effect of the presence of additives considering a photocatalytic reduction the presence of additives usually organic compounds becomes necessary this is because the presence of these can alter the rate of the photocatalytic reaction 32 33 the effect of the presence of formic acid isopropanol and methanol all in the concentration of 0 5 g l 1 and ph 7 0 on the removal of ba ii in solution is showed in fig 3 however only the formic acid showed a positive effect on the removal of ba ii from the solution all the other additives did not provide a significant improvement in the percentage of ba ii removal in solution and the results obtained were comparable to those obtained without additives no significant effect of presence of alcohol was also reported at literature for degradation of organic compound in aqueous solution according to hazime et al the presence of isopropanol and methanol as potential hydroxyl scavengers results in a negative effect in the imazalil degradation by photocatalytic process using tio2 as catalyst 34 formic acid is an additive widely used in photocatalytic processes aiming at the photo reduction of metals 23 35 this fact is due to the characteristics of the formic acid molecule which due to its reduced size facilitates the contact on the surface of the catalyst promoting its direct oxidation in addition the oxidation products of this additive are co2 and h2o which do not cause damage to the environment in this case the contact of the formic acid on the surface of the tio2 in anatase form possibly made it active facilitating the oxidation and consequently the removal of ba ii from the solution thus in the evaluated system the photocatalytic process with the addition of 0 5 g l 1 of formic acid allowed the removal of up to 81 ba ii in solution in 240 min of photocatalytic reaction the influence of the formic acid concentration on the ba ii removal was evaluated concentrations of 0 01 and 0 11 mol l 1 were tested in ph 7 0 and the results obtained are presented in fig 4 as noted previously the removal of ba ii by photocatalysis was not effective in the absence of catalyst however the presence of additive in the concentration of 0 01 mol l 1 promoted a reduction of ba ii concentration in solution higher than 50 the results indicated that the presence of additive at concentrations higher than 0 01 mol l 1 did not provide significant improvement in ba ii removal as observed for the experiments with 0 11 mol l 1 formic acid similar behavior was observed for nitrate reduction using different catalysts in the mentioned work the photocatalytic activity was not improved by increasing the formic acid concentration the authors suggest that a competition between formic acid and nitrate ion maybe occurring during the adsorption of these ions onto catalyst surface 36 37 thus the subsequent studies were carried out with the addition of 0 01 mol l 1 of formic acid as additive 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the environment has a major influence on the photocatalytic reactions depending on the ph of the solution the generated electrons can reduce protons water oxygen and metal ions photocatalytic reduction of metals is generally favored at high ph values 38 the effect of ph on the removal of ba ii in solution via photocatalysis is presented in fig 5 a range of ph from 2 5 to 9 0 was evaluated maintaining the concentration of additive 0 01 mol l 1 the initial concentration of ba ii 50 mg l 1 and a reaction time of 120 min under these conditions it is possible to observe that at ph values lower than 5 5 the reduction of ba ii concentration in solution was not significant however at ph values higher than 7 0 the ba ii removal was considerably higher zohreh majidnia et al evaluated the efficiency of ba ii removal from radioactive waste water using the combination of maghemite and titania nanoparticles in pva and alginate beads the authors reported a progressively improvement in the ba ii sorption capability until ph 8 this behavior can be attributed a competition between ba ii and h3o ions toward the catalyst surface since high concentration of h3o ions can have a negative effect on the ba ii adsorption 39 thus considering that during the photocatalytic process there is a prior absorption of the analyte on the catalyst surface for ph values lower than 5 5 the competition of h3o ions could be one responsible by the no significative ba ii removal 3 2 3 effect of catalyst concentration and initial concentration of ba ii the optimization of the amount of catalyst in the photocatalysis process is indicated to avoid the unnecessary use of catalyst and because high amounts can hinder the photocatalysis process increase the turbidity of the solution and consequently reduce the passage of the radiation 38 to evaluate the influence of the catalyst concentration on the reaction experiments were performed using catalyst concentrations in the range of 0 05 1 5 g l 1 fig 6 an increase in photocatalytic activity is observed when the catalyst concentration increases from 0 05 to 0 1 g l 1 however at catalyst concentrations greater than 0 5 g l 1 there is no significant improvement in photocatalytic activity thus further studies were carried out using 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst the reduction potential of metal ions is dependent on the concentration of the ions in solution generally the photocatalytic reduction potential decreases with the reduction of the metal ions concentration in solution leading to slower removal processes 38 the effect of the initial ba ii concentration on the photocatalytic process was evaluated the removal of ba ii in solutions with concentrations of 10 30 and 45 mg l 1 were evaluated and the results showed that for 10 mg l 1 concentration the process was delayed by about 80 min fig 6b 3 2 4 effect of chloride ions both natural and residual waters naturally contain dissolved organic and inorganic species these species can exert great influence on the catalytic activity being able to lead to processes that are spontaneous photochemical thus the effect of the presence of ions is an important parameter to be evaluated in photocatalytic processes according to the literature the presence of cl provides a retarding effect on the oxidation rate of organic compounds competing for radicals or blocking the active sites of the catalyst 38 to verify these effects experiments using aqueous solution containing different concentrations of cl ions were performed fig 7 it was observed that the ions exerted great influence on the ba ii removal kinetics making the reaction significantly slower at higher concentrations of cl the presence of 46 and 91 mg l 1 of cl in the solution delayed the reaction in 12 and 69 respectively in relation to the solution without presence of ions after 360 min a negative effect of chloride presence was also observed by zheng et al during the cyanide and cooper removal in aqueous solution according to the authors the negative effect of chloride ions in the evaluated photocatalytic reaction can be described by the scavenging of hydrogen radicals and competitive adsorption promoted by chloride ions 35 3 2 5 catalyst type in addition to the tio2 in the anatase form the mixture of rutile and anatase phases p 25 composed of 80 anatase and 20 rutile is also widely used because of an increase in photocatalytic performance besides these other catalysts are being studied in the removal of pollutants by photocatalysis such as the zno and recently the nb2o5 16 17 to evaluate the influence of the type of catalyst on ba removal the experiments were carried out using tio2 in the anatase form commercial tio2 p 25 zno and nb2o5 as catalyst using the optimum conditions previously defined 0 1 g l 1 catalyst 0 5 g l 1 formic acid ph 7 3 2 6 adsorption test adsorption tests on the surface of the catalysts were performed to prove the efficiency of the photocatalysis and absence of adsorption effects of the analyte on the surface of the catalyst thus experiments were carried out in the absence of light using 0 1 g l 1 of catalyst 0 01 mol l 1 of formic acid ph 7 the results fig 8 a demonstrate that there was no significant adsorption of ba ii using the catalysts p25 zno and tio2 in anatase form on the other hand the use of nb2o5 ba ii presented a 21 adsorption in 360 min of reaction considering that nb2o5 can occur in the amorphous state or in one of many different crystalline polymorphs 40 the high ba ii ions adsorption values may be attributed to the specific structural characteristics of this catalyst in fig 8b it is also possible to observe that the photolysis performed without the presence of catalyst the ba ii removal was not significant at the showed reaction time 360 min 3 2 7 effect of additive catalyst interaction time the results of the adsorption tests indicated that this process is not significant in ba ii removal however in the photocatalysis tests it was observed that previous agitation of the catalyst with the formic acid led to a reduction of the reaction time from this the tests were directed to verify the effect of the additive catalyst interaction tests were carried out keeping the system agitated with the immediate activation of the lamp after the addition of the catalyst solution containing ba ii and additive and tests keeping the system agitated for 2 h prior to the activation of the lamp evidencing the interaction of the additive catalyst fig 9 with the conditions optimized according to item 3 4 the results of the tests without prior shaking indicated a larger reduction using the p25 catalyst with 99 ba removal in 240 min the tio2 in anatase form also showed 99 removal with slower kinetics reaction 300 min and zno with 98 in 360 min of reaction anatase and zno presented similar surface areas as well as the band gap and crystalline structures the anatase obtained the largest surface area 33 95 m2 g and a band gap of 3 10 ev with a structure composed of crystalline forms of anatase and rutile which directly influences the photocatalytic performance the nb2o5 showed a different behavior with the process being initially faster but gradually decreasing until reaching 51 reduction of ba ii in 300 min of reaction this behavior can be attributed to its predominantly amorphous form with a high band gap 3 84 ev and these characteristics are not suitable for photocatalytic processes on the other hand the adsorption tests carried out in the absence of radiation fig 8 show that the niobium pentoxide had a significant adsorption of ba ii 21 in 360 min in the commercial catalyst non calcined and calcined no significant removal was observed despite a specific surface area of 19 78 and 12 74 m2 g respectively and a band gap 2 98 ev this result is possibly because it is a catalyst containing impurities and because of the predominant presence of the rutile form however using prior stirring 2 h to trigger the lamp a large change in the kinetics reaction was observed the ba ii removal results with all catalysts studied were faster when compared to the same test without prior agitation but with a similar behavior it is observed that there was no change in the initial concentration of ba ii after the previous shaking period in the absence of light showing that the change in the kinetic behavior is not due to the adsorption effects of ba ii on the catalyst but rather resulting from the likely additive catalyst interaction with similar agitation the same reduction percentage was found for tio2 in anatase form and p25 99 but with a reaction time 90 min much lower than the time found without previous agitation p25 240 min and tio2 in anatase form 300 min for the zno with the previous interaction period a reduction in the reaction time required for the removal of ba ii of approximately 2 h occurred with removal of 98 the obtained results for ba ii removal were comparable with those obtained by majidnia et al for barium removal from radioactive waste water using the combination of maghemite and titania nanoparticles in pva and alginate beads according to the authors 99 of the ba ii was eliminated in 150 min at ph 8 39 in a similar paper zohreh majidnia and ani idris evaluated removal of barium from radioactive aqueous solution by pva alginate encapsulated titanium oxide using sunlight and other light types at the optimized conditions ba ii removal of 98 was achieved in130 min of reaction time under sunlight 41 using nb2o5 as catalyst a reduction of ba ii concentration can be observed at the first minutes of photocatalytic reaction however this effect can be also attributed to the adsorption of ba ii on the catalyst surface as observed in fig 8 for tio2 calcined and not calcined the previous agitation provided a slight improvement in the photocatalytic activity on the other hand the ba ii removal was not significant only 6 removal 4 conclusions the ba ii removal process by photocatalysis was performed and the effect of different additives and catalysts was evaluated it can be verified that the surface area is not a determining factor for the process and the other fundamental characteristics are for example the structural form and crystallinity of the sample the photocatalytic process was optimized with tio2 in anatase form and indicated that the formic acid was the best additive compared to methanol isopropanol and without additive in a ph range of 2 5 9 0 the results indicated that the reduction was not significant for acidic phs below 5 5 the effect of chloride ions present indicated an increase in the time of removal of ba ii adsorption and photolysis tests showed that these processes were not efficient in ba ii removal the contact time between the additive formic acid and the catalyst before the photocatalytic process proved to be important significantly improving the catalytic activity the photocatalysis tests with and without additive catalyst contact time indicated that the best catalysts under these conditions were anatase p25 and zno respectively at 90 min of reaction time the maximum ba ii removal higher than 99 was obtained using anatase as catalyst 
14589,this study investigates settling and drainage properties of biological trickling filter btf sludge for dewatering and mineralisation potentially using natural sludge treatment wetlands stws sludge settling experiments were conducted to determine solid removal efficiency using 1 l imhoff cones after 1 hour and its effect on the removal of particulate components such as bod5 tn and tp was investigated drainage experiments were also conducted in the laboratory to measure the specific resistance to drainage srd describing sludge dewaterability and sludge settling velocity to determine gravitational drainage of the btf sludge excellent solid removals 68 95 were achieved after 1 hour settling of btf samples reducing bod5 tn and tp concentrations by 72 48 and 55 respectively dewatering experiments showed that while the settling velocity of the sludge 6 2 10 4 m s was 15 50 times faster than that of typical activated sludge in the order of 10 5 m s the srd of the sludge 6 1010 m kg was 2 15 times higher than that of activated sludge anaerobic conditions in the sludge and vigorous mixing greatly increased the srd up to 3 4 1011 m kg increasing the time for dewatering this result suggests that while the sludge can be easily removed from btf effluent by simple gravity sedimentation dewatering of the sludge may be much slower than for typical activated sludge sludge treatment wetlands stws combining sludge drying beds with vertical flow constructed wetlands could be applicable for dewatering and mineralisation of the btf sludge however the stws may require a larger land area than one treating activated sludge due to the lower dewaterability keywords biological trickling filter btf sludge treatment sludge dewatering sludge mineralisation sludge settling velocity 1 introduction since wastewater treatment processes typically produce large amounts of sludge as a waste or by product the processing and disposal of the waste sludge can be one of the most complex and expensive problems for wastewater treatment plants 1 5 therefore sludge treatment and disposal are one of the key issues to achieve efficient and effective wastewater management the solid content of waste sludge may vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the sludge the sludge removal pump type and the method of operation thus sludge thickening increasing the solids content is beneficial to reduce the cost for handling transportation and final disposal 1 6 sludge thickening is generally achieved by physical processes such as gravity settling flotation and centrifugation but natural processes such as evaporation evapotranspiration and percolation may be also used for sludge thickening and drying 1 7 8 sludge treatment wetlands stws or sludge treatment reed beds strbs combining traditional sand sludge drying beds with vertical flow planted constructed wetlands can be an effective and economically viable option for sludge thickening and drying 9 4 3 10 11 sand drying beds have been traditionally used for sludge dewatering in small to medium size wastewater treatment plants while the use of constructed wetlands cws for sludge dewatering has increased over the last 20 years 7 4 5 the stws have been widely applied in european countries 12 4 10 particularly in denmark where 100 full scale systems are currently being operated 7 however they remain to be applied in new zealand climatic conditions and particularly for the treatment of biological trickling filter btf sludge since stws mainly rely on natural processes for sludge dewatering and mineralization 13 7 5 14 they are less expensive and easier to operate compared to the mechanical and chemical sludge treatment systems 15 2 however the most common issue of the stws is filter clogging of the wetland beds due to accumulation and compaction of sludge solids on the surface of the beds resulting in poor sludge dewatering 16 17 8 18 therefore to understand the characteristics of activated sludges in terms of sludge settling velocity time of drainage and compressibility during gravity dewatering dominiak et al 3 developed a laboratory analytical method called the specific resistance to drainage srd describing the dewaterability of sludge biological trickling filter btf processes have been successfully used for domestic wastewater treatment over the last few decades 19 the systems typically consist of fixed bed of rocks gravel or plastic media over which wastewater flows downward and grow a layer of microbial biofilm on the media 1 the removal of pollutants from the wastewater stream involves both absorption and adsorption of organic compounds and some inorganic species such as nitrite and nitrate ions by the layer of microbial biofilm in aerobic conditions 1 20 as the biofilm layer thickens it eventually sloughs off into the effluent and subsequently forms part of the secondary sludge typically a clarifier or sedimentation tank is required for the separation and removal of the secondary sludge in the btf effluents however little information about the characteristics handling and appropriate disposal options of the btf sludge is currently available in the literature thus this paper investigates the characteristics of the secondary sludge produced from a biological trickling filter btf system currently treating domestic wastewater in gisborne new zealand in terms of sludge settling and drainage properties to assess the efficacy of stw treatment of the waste sludge in new zealand climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of

0 29 tonnes of tn per day the btf system consists of a fixed bed of plastic media having a high surface area to volume over which wastewater flows downward and grow a biofilm layer aerobic conditions

nitrification and the removal of organic compounds bod5 19 21 as the biofilm layer thickens it eventually sloughs off into the liquid flow and subsequently produce the secondary sludge daily flow of the btf effluent and concentrations of key wastewater contaminants such as tss bod5 cod and nitrogen and phosphorus species are summarized in the supplementary information supplementary table s1 2 2 measurement of solid settling efficiency btf effluent solids settling experiments were conducted three times in three seasons experiment 1 summer december 2014 experiment 2 autumn march 2015 experiment 3 winter june 2015 for each laboratory experiment composites of three 10 l samples of btf effluent were taken from the effluent sump weir during both normal operation and flushing cycle periods the normal btf operation period sample was a composite of three samples taken 1 h before the flushing cycle commenced and 1 and 2 h after the flushing cycle ceased the flushing cycle period sample was a composite of three samples taken 5 30 and 55 min initial middle and final after the flushing cycle started 1 h solid settling efficiencies were measured for the btf effluent samples using 1 l imhoff cones in triplicate under laboratory conditions water samples 50 ml were taken using a syringe from the mid depth of the imhoff cone 450 ml depth after 1 h settling and used for the measurement of total volatile suspended solids tss vss according to apha 22 which were then compared with the initial tss vss to determine the solid settling efficiency the settled sludge at the bottom of the imhoff cones was also collected using a tap at the bottom of the cone and the percentage solids as total solids of the settled sludge were also determined according to apha 22 when the settled sludge was removed the supernatants remaining in the three imhoff cones were combined into a 5 l container and then a 1 l homogenized sample was taken for the measurement of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total n tn and total p tp according to apha 22 to investigate the effect of solid settling on the removal of bod5 tn and tp during the experiments conducted in june 2015 experiment 3 dissolved nutrients including ammoniacal n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and e coli were also measured the concentrations of the water quality parameters in the supernatants were compared with those in the initial btf effluent to determine the effect of sludge settling 2 3 measurement of specific resistance to drainage srd 2 3 1 btf sludge sampling and pre treatment about 120 l of btf effluent was collected using six 20 l containers from the btf effluent sump during the flushing cycle period and settled for about 30 min to increase the solid concentration up to 2 20 g ts l approximately 20 l of the concentrated btf effluent sludge was collected after decanting off the supernatants for the use in the laboratory srd experiments in experiment 1 to investigate the influence of pre treatments on btf sludge srd and solid settling velocity a batch of the untreated fresh btf sludge was divided into three sub samples 7 l each one sample untreated sludge was used directly for the measurement of srd the second was stored anaerobically overnight at a room temperature and the third was intensively mixed at 800 rpm using an overhead stirrer mimicking sludge pumping through a long pipeline overnight until use in experiment 2 the pre treatment conditions were unchanged untreated anaerobically stored and vigorously mixed but air was added to one sub sample 7 l of the btf sludge with gentle mixing 200 rpm to investigate the effect of aeration on the sludge quality supplementary fig s2 an aquarium pump was used for the aeration and maintained the sludge dissolved oxygen do concentration at 5 mg l until use 2 3 2 srd experiment set up srd experiments that were previously developed by dominiak et al 3 were conducted on the btf effluent settled sludge in march and june 2015 experiments 1 and 2 the experimental set up consisted of a transparent glass cylinder inner diameter 80 mm area 0 005 m2 a mesh funnel and a metal clamp holding the transparent glass cylinder and funnel a filter and a laptop computer connected to a video camera fig 1 the filter was mounted on the funnel inside the transparent glass cylinder which was then placed on a 1 l measuring cylinder to collect the drainage whatman 41 paper whatman uk porosity 20 22 μm was used as the filter as recommended by dominiak et al 3 a sludge sample of a given volume 400 500 or 600 ml was loaded into the transparent cylinder and left to drain by gravity into the measuring cylinder the volume of drainage was measured at one minute intervals until the draining ceased the video camera was used to film the sludge dewatering until the experiment was complete 2 3 3 determination of settling velocity and specific cake resistance calculations of the settling velocity and srd were based upon the changes of clear water phase height δh over the sludge drainage process which initially increases linearly until time t1 period 1 and then decreases until time t2 period 2 the settling velocity was determined as the slope of the line fitted to the data from period 1 according to eq 1 1 v s δ h t where δh the height of the clear water phase i e the difference between liquid level and sludge blanket level t a given time sludge compression was irreversible so no cake swelling was observed during the drainage experiment even through the pressure declines during period 2 as described by dominiak et al 3 during period 2 ln h t h was plotted as a function of t t1 giving a straight line as shown in the supplementary fig s1 and the slope e g a 7 10 4 in supplementary fig s1 was fitted into eq 2 to determine the srd 2 s r d ρ g c h 0 μ 7 10 4 where ρ density of the filtrate kg m3 g gravitational acceleration m sec2 c initial solid concentration of the given sludge g m3 h0 initial level of the suspension m μ filtrate viscosity kg m sec the difference between liquid level and sludge blanket level δh as a function of time was determined by image analysis and used to calculate srd and sludge settling velocity supplementary fig s1 evaluation of the replicability of the test was also carried out by measuring the srd of a sample of untreated fresh activated sludge from the hamilton wwtp 5 g ts l three times the mean srd was 3 5 1010 m kg with a standard deviation 5 of the mean value showing that the experimental technique was reliable 2 3 4 btf srd experimental conditions in experiment 1 a series of mass loadings 0 24 1 2 kg m2 and volumetric loadings 0 05 up to 0 15 m3 m2 were tested to investigate the influence of sludge mass and volumetric loading on srd

a repeat of experiment 1 but with four treatments untreated aerated anaerobically stored and sheared compared at each of the mass and volumetric loadings sludge solids and volumetric loadings and pre treatment conditions for srd experiments 1 and 2 are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 btf solid setting efficiencies the results of btf solid settling efficiencies during both normal operation and flushing cycle periods are summarized in table 2 excellent solid removal was achieved with both the normal operation and flushing cycle btf effluent in all three experiments fig 2 a with the majority of settleable solids removed within 10 min of the experiment percent removal of solids were 48 63 69 and 77 for the normal operation btf effluent and 77 84 87 and 92 for the flushing cycle period btf effluent after 5 10 30 and 60 min of settling respectively fig 2b c in experiment 1 95 solid removal efficiency was achieved with the flushing cycle btf effluent initial tss concentration of 885 g m3 and settled tss concentration 38 g m3 the settled tss concentration was almost comparable to that achieved in the normal operation btf effluent 30 mg l even though the initial tss concentration of the flushing cycle btf effluent was 4 fold higher than that of the normal operation btf effluent these results suggest that short hydraulic retention time hrt solids settling basins could be effectively used to remove the sludge from the btf effluent btf effluent tss concentrations declined to 72 g m3 during the winter experiment 3 table 2 and solid settling efficiencies were also reduced 68 and 85 for the normal operation and flushing cycle periods respectively the lower btf effluent tss concentration in winter was due to reduced microbial activity and growth at lower temperatures moreover as water temperature decreases experiment 1 21 c experiment 3 14 9 c the solid settling velocity declines 1 23 which may have contributed to the lower solid settling efficiencies in experiment 3 3 2 removal of tbod5 tn tp and e coli by gravity sedimentation gravity settling effectively removed tbod5 tn and tp from the btf effluents table 3 for example excellent removal of tbod5 93 tn 61 and tp 68 was achieved for the flushing cycle period btf effluent in experiment 1 like the tss removal described above the tbod5 tn and tp concentrations in the supernatants of the settled flushing cycle period btf effluent were only 24 25 and 4 9 g m3 respectively even though the initial concentrations of these water quality parameters were 2 5 fold higher than those of the normal operation period btf effluent in experiment 1 this result implies that the particulate forms of tbod5 tn and tp associated with the sludge were effectively removed by the simple gravity sedimentation while soluble bod5 dissolved inorganic nitrogen such as ammoniacal n nitrate and nitrate n and phosphate po4 p concentrations did not change between the flushing cycle and normal operation btf effluent the relatively poor removal of tbod5 tn and tp achieved in experiment 3 table 3 was mainly due to the decrease in the solid removal efficiency for example during the normal operation period in experiment 3 only 25 15 and 9 removal of tbod5 tn and tp were achieved by the settling compared to 88 39 and 40 removal respectively in experiment 1 the lower microbial activity in winter experiment 3 reduced the performance of the btf system 24 1 20 resulting in higher tbod5 concentrations 45 and 55 g m3 in the supernatants of the normal operation and flushing cycle period btf effluents respectively than in the previous experiments 1 h solids settling did not change or slightly increased the btf effluent supernatant concentrations of dissolved nutrients including ammoniacal n nitrate n and drp in experiment 3 for example nitrate n and drp concentrations remained at 3 3 and 4 6 mg l before and after the settling while ammoniacal n concentration increased slightly from 12 9 to 13 5 mg n l after the 1 h settling for the normal operation period the e coli level in the btf effluent 2 106 mpn 100 ml was similar to that of typical raw domestic wastewater in new zealand 25 27 and little e coli removal only 17 33 reduction was achieved by the solid settling in experiment 3 table 3 3 3 btf sludge characteristics characteristics of the btf sludge in experiments 1 3 including settled sludge volume l sludge m3 solids content ts and organic content vss in tss are summarized in table 4 the amount of settled sludge and solids content varied depending on the tss concentration in the btf effluent solid settling efficiency and the operation of the btf system either normal operation or flushing cycle approximately 11 18 and 4 l of sludge 1 2 solids were collected per 1 m3 of btf effluent settled during the summer autumn and winter experiments respectively the settled sludge was about 2 solids for both the normal operation and flushing cycle periods in experiment 1 but was lower 1 1 and 1 7 for the normal operation and flushing cycle periods respectively in experiment 3 table 4 the decrease in the solids content of the settled sludge was probably due to the lower solid settling efficiency in experiment 3 as previously discussed in section 3 1 however the solids content of the btf sludge 1 1 2 3 solids is higher than that of typical waste activated sludge 0 8 1 2 solids reported in the literature 28 1 29 20 the higher solids content of the settled btf sludge implies less volume of btf sludge to be treated possibly using relatively simple sludge treatment processes such as sludge drying beds or constructed wetlands dominiak et al 3 8 and christensen et al 30 reported that increases in solid concentration load of sludge at a constant volumetric load increased the height of the sludge cake resulting in an increase in dewatering time moreover time of drainage increases exponentially with volumetric load of sludge m3 m2 compared linearly with solid load since the hydrostatic pressure on the sludge cake increased 30 therefore the previous studies suggest that the solid content of the btf sludge may need to be diluted to reduce the solid load of sludge to achieve sufficient sludge dewatering in the stws the organic content of the settled sludge was relatively high 73 86 in all three experiments table 4 indicating that btf sludge is readily biodegradable and should be easily stabilized and mineralized when discharged to stws 3 4 btf sludge quality the specific resistance to drainage srd for the untreated fresh btf sludge was 6 1010 m kg which is about 2 15 times higher than that of typical activated sludges from danish 8 and hamilton wwtps 4 109 4 2 1010 m kg fig 3 however as shown in fig 4 the settling velocity of the btf sludge 6 2 10 4 m s was 15 50 times higher than those of activated sludge in the order of 10 5 m s these results suggest that while the sludge biosolids can be easily removed from the btf effluent by simple gravity sedimentation since the majority of settleable solids were removed within only 10 min fig 2 drainage of the sludge would take longer than for typical activated sludge anaerobic storage or intensive shearing i e pumping of the btf effluent sludge both greatly increased srd to 2 4 1011 and 3 4 1011 m kg respectively fig 3 resulting in an increase in the time of drainage fig 5 b the effect of pre treatments such as anaerobic storage and shearing on the srds was previously investigated by dominiak et al 3 8 in the laboratory they found that 24 h anaerobic storage and vigorous shearing at 800 rpm both significantly increased the srd of activated sludge from danish wwtps shearing and anaerobic conditions cause deflocculation of activated sludge resulting in floc fragmentation and liberation of small aggregates 31 3 8 32 therefore the higher srds observed with deflocculated sludge may be attributed to small particles clogging or blinding the filter causing slower water flow and more significant cake compression due to higher liquid pressure the drainage properties srds and the time of drainage of three different volumes 400 500 and 600 ml or volumetric loads 0 08 0 10 and 0 12 m3 m2 of btf sludge from the same sample were tested srd increased linearly with increasing volumetric load fig 5a however the time of drainage correlated with the volumetric load squared fig 5b moreover the increasing the tss concentration solid load of the btf sludge from 3 to 11 5 g m3 linearly increased both the srd and time of drainage fig 5c d as the sludge height cake compressibility increased moreover anaerobic storage and shearing also increased srd and time of drainage significantly fig 5a b christensen et al 30 reported that as the volumetric load increased the hydrostatic pressure on the settled sludge cake increases therefore the increase in srd is a result of cake compression this suggests that both volumetric and solid loads of the sludge may need to be determined carefully to achieve sufficient sludge dewatering in the stws 30 3 33 34 3 5 improving sludge quality aeration of btf sludge d o concentration 5 mg l improved sludge drainability fig 6 the srd of aerated btf sludge was only 1 3 1010 m kg at a volumetric load of 0 08 m3 m2 experiment 2 which is about 3 18 times lower than that of the untreated 4 5 1010 m kg anaerobically stored 1 7 1011 m kg and anaerobically sheared sludge 2 5 1011 m kg moreover increasing the volumetric load of aerated btf sludge from 0 08 to 0 12 m3 m2 did not significantly increase srd 1 3 1010 to 3 1010 m kg or time of drainage although it more than doubled from 0 3 to 0 8 h compared to the untreated anaerobically stored and sheared sludges fig 6 dominiak et al 3 also found that extended aeration 6 h of activated sludge improved drainability by promoting flocculation some practical methods for overcoming the difficulties with sludge dewatering have been proposed previously such as addition of calcium carbonate or nitrate 8 for example addition of nitrate n 15 mg n l into a pumped stream of waste activated sludge to maintain the nitrate concentration at 5 7 mg n l resulted in an improvement of the sludge drainage in the stws 8 suggesting that shear and anoxic conditions may cause less damage to sludge quality than shear and anaerobic conditions 4 conclusions this study showed that excellent solid removals 68 95 were achieved after 1 h settling of the biological trickling filter btf sludge samples reducing total bod5 tn and tp concentrations by 72 48 and 55 respectively moreover the settling velocity of the btf sludge 6 2 10 4 m s was 15 50 times faster than that of typical activated sludge in the order of 10 5 m s the results suggest that the btf sludge can be easily removed from the effluent by gravity sedimentation and a simple sedimentation tank or clarifier can be used for the efficient separation and subsequent removal of the secondary sludge laboratory dewatering experiments showed that the specific resistance to drainage srd describing sludge dewaterability of the btf sludge 6 1010 m kg was 2 15 times higher than that of activated sludge 4 109 4 2 1010 m kg indicating that btf sludge dewatering was much slower than for typical activated sludge pre treatments such as storage under anaerobic conditions and intensive shearing mixing greatly increased the srd up to 3 4 1011 m kg resulting in an increase in the time for dewatering however oxygen addition 5 0 mg o2 l to the sludge was found to improve sludge dewatering this study suggests that sludge treatment wetlands stws combining sludge drying beds with vertical flow constructed wetlands could be applicable for dewatering and mineralisation of the btf sludge however the stws may require a larger land area than one treating activated sludge due to the lower dewaterability acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the valuable inputs of gisborne

14589,this study investigates settling and drainage properties of biological trickling filter btf sludge for dewatering and mineralisation potentially using natural sludge treatment wetlands stws sludge settling experiments were conducted to determine solid removal efficiency using 1 l imhoff cones after 1 hour and its effect on the removal of particulate components such as bod5 tn and tp was investigated drainage experiments were also conducted in the laboratory to measure the specific resistance to drainage srd describing sludge dewaterability and sludge settling velocity to determine gravitational drainage of the btf sludge excellent solid removals 68 95 were achieved after 1 hour settling of btf samples reducing bod5 tn and tp concentrations by 72 48 and 55 respectively dewatering experiments showed that while the settling velocity of the sludge 6 2 10 4 m s was 15 50 times faster than that of typical activated sludge in the order of 10 5 m s the srd of the sludge 6 1010 m kg was 2 15 times higher than that of activated sludge anaerobic conditions in the sludge and vigorous mixing greatly increased the srd up to 3 4 1011 m kg increasing the time for dewatering this result suggests that while the sludge can be easily removed from btf effluent by simple gravity sedimentation dewatering of the sludge may be much slower than for typical activated sludge sludge

velocity 1 introduction since wastewater treatment processes typically produce large amounts of sludge as a waste or by product the processing and disposal of the waste sludge can be one of the most complex and expensive problems for wastewater treatment plants 1 5 therefore sludge treatment and disposal are one of the key issues to achieve efficient and effective wastewater management the solid content of waste sludge may vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the sludge the sludge removal pump type and the method of operation thus sludge thickening increasing the solids content is beneficial to reduce the cost for handling transportation and final disposal 1 6 sludge thickening is generally achieved by physical processes such as gravity settling flotation and centrifugation but natural processes such as evaporation evapotranspiration and percolation may be also used for sludge thickening and drying 1 7 8 sludge treatment wetlands stws or sludge treatment reed beds strbs combining traditional sand sludge drying beds with vertical flow planted constructed wetlands can be an effective and economically viable option for sludge thickening and drying 9 4 3 10 11 sand drying beds have been traditionally used for sludge dewatering in small to medium size wastewater treatment plants while the use of constructed wetlands cws for sludge dewatering has increased over the last 20 years 7 4 5 the stws have been widely applied in european countries 12 4 10 particularly in denmark where 100 full scale systems are currently being operated 7 however they remain to be applied in new zealand climatic conditions and particularly for the treatment of biological trickling filter btf sludge since stws mainly rely on natural processes for sludge dewatering and mineralization 13 7 5 14 they are less expensive and easier to operate compared to the mechanical and chemical sludge treatment systems 15 2 however the most common issue of the stws is filter clogging of the wetland beds due to accumulation and compaction of sludge solids on the surface of the beds resulting in poor sludge dewatering 16 17 8 18 therefore to understand the characteristics of activated sludges in terms of sludge settling velocity time of drainage and compressibility during gravity dewatering dominiak et al 3 developed a laboratory analytical method called the specific resistance to drainage srd describing the dewaterability of sludge biological trickling filter btf processes have been successfully used for domestic wastewater treatment over the last few decades 19 the systems typically consist of fixed bed of rocks gravel or plastic media over which wastewater flows downward and grow a layer of microbial biofilm on the media 1 the removal of pollutants from the wastewater stream involves both absorption and adsorption of organic compounds and some inorganic species such as nitrite and nitrate ions by the layer of microbial biofilm in aerobic conditions 1 20 as the biofilm layer thickens it eventually sloughs off into the effluent and subsequently forms part of the secondary sludge typically a clarifier or sedimentation tank is required for the separation and removal of the secondary sludge in the btf effluents however little information about the characteristics handling and appropriate disposal options of the btf sludge is currently available in the literature thus this paper investigates the characteristics of the secondary sludge produced from a biological trickling filter btf system currently treating domestic wastewater in gisborne new zealand in terms of sludge settling and drainage properties to assess the efficacy of stw treatment of the waste sludge in new zealand climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the gisborne district council gdc new zealand has operated a biological trickling filter btf system 38 39 56 7 s 178 00 13 4 e for the treatment of domestic wastewater since 2011 during the 3 5 year monitoring period from january 2011 to june 2014 the btf system has produced approximately 12 000 m3 of btf effluent 2 2 tonnes total suspended solids tss of sludge 1 2 tonnes of bod5 and 0 29 tonnes of tn per day the btf system consists of a fixed bed of plastic media having a high surface area to volume over which wastewater flows downward and grow a biofilm layer aerobic conditions are maintained by forced air flowing through the bed passage of the wastewater over the media also provides dissolved oxygen which the biofilm layer requires for nitrifying ammoniacal n to nitrate n nitrification and the removal of organic compounds bod5 19 21 as the biofilm layer thickens it eventually sloughs off into the liquid flow and subsequently produce the secondary sludge daily flow of the btf effluent and concentrations of key wastewater contaminants such as tss bod5 cod and nitrogen and phosphorus species are summarized in the supplementary information supplementary table s1 2 2 measurement of solid settling efficiency btf effluent solids settling experiments were conducted three times in three seasons experiment 1 summer december 2014 experiment 2 autumn march 2015 experiment 3 winter june 2015 for each laboratory experiment composites of three 10 l samples of btf effluent were taken from the effluent sump weir during both normal operation and flushing cycle periods the normal btf operation period sample was a composite of three samples taken 1 h before the flushing cycle commenced and 1 and 2 h after the flushing cycle ceased the flushing cycle period sample was a composite of three samples taken 5 30 and 55 min initial middle and final after the flushing cycle started 1 h solid settling efficiencies were measured for the btf effluent samples using 1 l imhoff cones in triplicate under laboratory conditions water samples 50 ml were taken using a syringe from the mid depth of the imhoff cone 450 ml depth after 1 h settling and used for the measurement of total volatile suspended solids tss vss according to apha 22 which were then compared with the initial tss vss to determine the solid settling efficiency the settled sludge at the bottom of the imhoff cones was also collected using a tap at the bottom of the cone and the percentage solids as total solids of the settled sludge were also determined according to apha 22 when the settled sludge was removed the supernatants remaining in the three imhoff cones were combined into a 5 l container and then a 1 l homogenized sample was taken for the measurement of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total n tn and total p tp according to apha 22 to investigate the effect of solid settling on the removal of bod5 tn and tp during the experiments conducted in june 2015 experiment 3 dissolved nutrients including ammoniacal n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and e coli were also measured the concentrations of the water quality parameters in the supernatants were compared with those in the initial btf effluent to determine the effect of sludge settling 2 3 measurement of specific resistance to drainage srd 2 3 1 btf sludge sampling and pre treatment about 120 l of btf effluent was collected using six 20 l containers from the btf effluent sump during the flushing cycle period and settled for about 30 min to increase the solid concentration up to 2 20 g ts l approximately 20 l of the concentrated btf effluent sludge was collected after decanting off the supernatants for the use in the laboratory srd experiments in experiment 1 to investigate the influence of pre treatments on btf sludge srd and solid settling velocity a batch of the untreated fresh btf sludge was divided into three sub samples 7 l each one sample untreated sludge was used directly for the measurement of srd the second was stored anaerobically overnight at a room temperature and the third was intensively mixed at 800 rpm using an overhead stirrer mimicking sludge pumping through a long pipeline overnight until use in experiment 2 the pre treatment conditions were unchanged untreated anaerobically stored and vigorously mixed but air was added to one sub sample 7 l of the btf sludge with gentle mixing 200 rpm to investigate the effect of aeration on the sludge quality supplementary fig s2 an aquarium pump was used for the aeration and maintained the sludge dissolved oxygen do concentration at 5 mg l until use 2 3 2 srd experiment set up srd experiments that were previously developed by dominiak et al 3 were conducted on the btf effluent settled sludge in march and june 2015 experiments 1 and 2 the experimental set up consisted of a transparent glass cylinder inner diameter 80 mm area 0 005 m2 a mesh funnel and a metal clamp holding the transparent glass cylinder and funnel a filter and a laptop computer connected to a video camera fig 1 the filter was mounted on the funnel inside the transparent glass cylinder which was then placed on a 1 l measuring cylinder to collect the drainage whatman 41 paper whatman uk porosity 20 22 μm was used as the filter as recommended by dominiak et al 3 a sludge sample of a given volume 400 500 or 600 ml was loaded into the transparent cylinder and left to drain by gravity into the measuring cylinder the volume of drainage was measured at one minute intervals until the draining ceased the video camera was used to film the sludge dewatering until the experiment was complete 2 3 3 determination of settling velocity and specific cake resistance calculations of the settling velocity and srd were based upon the changes of clear water phase height δh over the sludge drainage process which initially increases linearly until time t1 period 1 and then decreases until time t2 period 2 the settling velocity was determined as the slope of the line fitted to the data from period 1 according to eq 1 1 v s δ h t where δh the height of the clear water phase i e the difference between liquid level and sludge blanket level t a given time sludge compression was irreversible so no cake swelling was observed during the drainage experiment even through the pressure declines during period 2 as described by dominiak et al 3 during period 2 ln h t h was plotted as a function of t t1 giving a straight line as shown in the supplementary fig s1 and the slope e g a 7 10 4 in supplementary fig s1 was fitted

level of the suspension m μ filtrate viscosity kg m sec the difference between liquid level and sludge blanket level δh as a function of time was determined by image analysis and used to calculate srd

hamilton wwtp 5 g ts l three times the mean srd was 3 5 1010 m kg with a standard deviation 5 of the mean value showing that the experimental technique was reliable 2 3 4 btf srd experimental conditions in experiment 1 a series of mass loadings 0 24 1 2 kg m2 and volumetric loadings 0 05 up to 0 15 m3 m2 were tested to investigate the influence of sludge mass and volumetric loading on srd

efficiencies were also reduced 68 and 85 for the normal operation and flushing cycle periods respectively the lower btf effluent tss concentration in winter was due to reduced microbial activity and growth at lower temperatures moreover as water temperature decreases experiment 1 21 c experiment 3 14 9 c the solid settling velocity declines 1 23 which may have contributed to the lower solid settling efficiencies in experiment 3 3 2 removal of tbod5 tn tp and e coli by gravity sedimentation gravity settling effectively removed tbod5 tn and tp from the btf effluents table 3 for example excellent removal of tbod5 93 tn 61 and tp 68 was achieved for the flushing cycle period btf effluent in experiment 1 like the tss removal described above the tbod5 tn and tp concentrations in the supernatants of the settled flushing cycle period btf effluent were only 24 25 and 4 9 g m3 respectively even though the initial concentrations of these water quality parameters were 2 5 fold higher than those of the normal operation period btf effluent in experiment 1 this result implies that the particulate forms of tbod5 tn and tp associated with the sludge were effectively removed by the simple gravity sedimentation while soluble bod5 dissolved inorganic nitrogen such as ammoniacal n nitrate and nitrate n and phosphate po4 p concentrations did not change between the flushing cycle and normal operation btf effluent the relatively poor removal of tbod5 tn and tp achieved in experiment 3 table 3 was mainly due to the decrease in the solid removal efficiency for example during the normal operation period in experiment 3 only 25 15 and 9 removal of tbod5 tn and tp were achieved by the settling compared to 88 39 and 40 removal respectively in experiment 1 the lower microbial activity in winter experiment 3 reduced the performance of the btf system 24 1 20 resulting in higher tbod5 concentrations 45 and 55 g m3 in the supernatants of the normal operation and flushing cycle

ammoniacal n nitrate n and drp in experiment 3 for example nitrate n and drp concentrations remained at 3 3 and 4 6 mg l before and after the settling while ammoniacal n concentration increased slightly from 12 9 to 13 5 mg n l after the 1 h settling for the normal operation period the e coli level in the btf effluent 2 106 mpn 100 ml was similar to that of typical raw domestic wastewater in

conclusions this study showed that excellent solid removals 68 95 were achieved after 1 h settling of the biological trickling filter btf sludge samples reducing total bod5 tn and tp concentrations by 72 48 and 55 respectively moreover the settling velocity of the btf sludge 6 2 10 4 m s was 15 50 times faster than that of typical activated sludge in the order of 10 5 m s the results suggest that the btf sludge can be easily removed from the effluent by gravity sedimentation and a simple sedimentation tank or clarifier can be used for the efficient separation and subsequent removal of the secondary sludge laboratory dewatering experiments showed that the specific resistance to drainage srd describing sludge dewaterability of the btf sludge 6 1010 m kg was 2 15 times higher than that of activated sludge 4 109 4 2 1010 m kg indicating that btf sludge dewatering was much slower than for typical activated sludge pre treatments such as storage under anaerobic conditions and intensive shearing mixing greatly increased the srd up to 3 4 1011 m kg resulting in an increase in the time for dewatering however oxygen addition 5 0 mg o2 l to the sludge was found to improve sludge dewatering this study suggests that sludge treatment wetlands stws combining sludge drying beds with vertical flow constructed wetlands could be applicable for dewatering and mineralisation of the btf sludge however the stws may require a larger land area than one treating activated sludge due to the lower dewaterability acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the valuable inputs of gisborne
