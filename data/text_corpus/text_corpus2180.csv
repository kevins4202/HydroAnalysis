10900,unsustainable groundwater mining threatens the economic stability of several regions around the world developing sustainable water use policies and integrated water management plans requires reliably predicting water demand under variable weather and land use conditions here a water budget model capable of estimating spatial and temporal variations in daily irrigation demand under variable weather and land use scenarios is modified to consider irrigation management and groundwater pumping limitations this model uses a combination of geospatial and in situ measured data including land use and land cover maps crop specific evapotranspiration data and weather data a coupled sub model limits pumping rates based on pump capacity and spatial and temporal variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer the ability of this water budget model to accurately estimate irrigation demand is demonstrated using the high plains aquifer region of kansas usa an aquifer that has undergone and continues to undergo significant depletion due to decades of irrigation the model was calibrated with reported and measured water use for more than 1200 fields with ratios of simulated annual irrigation demand to actual reported water use of 1 10 0 78 0 75 0 93 and 1 40 for corn sorghum soybean winter wheat and alfalfa respectively further simulations at a variety of scales from field to multi county levels demonstrate that the developed water budget model is capable of simulating the spatial and temporal variability of irrigation demand keywords high plains aquifer land use land cover saturated thickness soil water balance water budget 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is considered one of the main crises of the 21 st century jury and vaux 2005 by 2050 the global population is projected to rise to 9 billion gleick and palaniappan 2010 which will further strain limited accessible freshwater resources postel et al 1996 in addition to population growth the effects of climate change may further stress water resources according to the united nations undp 2007 water scarcity will be the major limitation for food production over the next few years the recent reduction in australia s agricultural and food production has been attributed to drought goesch et al 2007 and in california usa research has shown that anthropogenic activities contributed to the 2013 2014 drought wang et al 2014 which reduced food production in the region water availability in western usa is already limited so meeting current and future water demands will be more difficult than in the past projections of water demand under climate change land use transformation and socio economic development is necessary to make effective water management decisions that reduce and avoid further over exploitation of water resources brooks 2006 irrigation demand can be estimated directly using lysimeters or indirectly using an agronomic water balance model for estimating crop evapotranspiration etc allen et al 1998 many methods have been developed for estimating evapotranspiration et using mass transfer temperature radiation or a combination of these as the basis for the method jensen et al 1990 rao et al 2011 most methods are developed for a specific climate region and or objective and cannot accurately estimate the potential et in other regions tukimat et al 2012 however a few methods have comprehensive theoretical bases and are more broadly applicable such as the penman monteith and hargreaves samani methods yin et al 2008 the penman monteith method is data intensive requiring inputs such as air temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiations whereas the hargreaves samani method uses a simpler approach and relies on fewer input data samani 2000 previous work has shown that the hargreaves samani method provides the best estimate of et when weather data are limited compared to other methods such as penman monteith and thornthwaite gonzalez et al 2009 samani 2000 jensen et al 1990 irrigation demand also depends on many factors beyond et including climate crop type irrigation technology market and policy incentives and water availability dridi and khanna 2005 fraser and stringer 2009 peterson 2014 white and selfa 2013 these factors are interconnected through environmental technological institutional economic and social mechanisms poussin et al 2010 although some of these factors are beyond the control of irrigators they can maximize their yields or profits using management options including irrigation system type irrigation timing and the quantity of water used understanding the interactions between climate land use water availability and water demand is important in making efficient water management decisions one practical method for evaluating the effects of these interactions on crop demand is using a soil water balance model kendy et al 2003 first developed by thornthwaite 1948 and thornthwaite et al 1957 soil water balance models are a relatively quick and easy way to estimate groundwater recharge at daily time steps westenbroek et al 2012 these models use mass balance equations to calculate soil water components including et runoff soil moisture dynamics and precipitation stanton et al 2011 soil water balance models have many applications in agronomics and are integrated into weather and climate models feddema et al 2013 gassmann et al 2011 however farming systems and irrigation management are often excluded despite their importance in managing water resources lambin et al 2000 in this work a water budget model capable of estimating irrigation demand under variable weather conditions is modified to include irrigation management options and groundwater pumping limitations this model is developed to include these management options and groundwater restrictions in a more computationally and data frugal approach than variably saturated groundwater models or integrated hydrologic models irrigation demand is estimated for five major crops using seven irrigation methods and minimum allowable deficiency mad irrigation management see model development the model includes limitations on groundwater pumping rates due to pump capacity and spatial and temporal variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer this water budget model is demonstrated and evaluated using data from the high plains aquifer hpa in kansas overall the model provides a methodology to predict trends in irrigation demand under changing climate and land use decisions with minimal data and computational demands ultimately it could serve as a useful planning tool for farmers and groundwater resource managers to predict changes in current irrigation demands under other land use and water management scenarios 2 model description the feddema water budget model fwbm is a daily water budget model feddema et al 2013 in addition to other modifications to incorporate irrigation management strategy and pumping limitations as described in the following section fwbm was converted to a user defined matlab function for this work the water budget is given by 1 δ s δ t p i e t r 2 r r u n g r where δ s δ t is the change in soil storage with time p is precipitation i is irrigation water et is evapotranspiration and r represents overland runoff run estimated using the soil conservation service scs method and groundwater recharge gr the units of all terms are millimeters of water per time step the model output is the quantity of irrigation water required from each well the output can be converted from mm of water to total volume m3 using field acreage fwbm uses nine parameters to estimate irrigation demand and irrigation deficit latitude min and max daily temperature daily precipitation soil hydrological group equivalent number scs curve number soil water holding capacity whc of the root zone crop type irrigation system type and pumping rate fig 1 the weather and land use data are model based gridded geospatial datasets and the soil and water use data are based on in situ data fig 1 each component of the model is calculated using these inputs as described below the model outputs are daily irrigation demand actual evapotranspiration surface soil moisture content irrigation deficit irrigation surplus and groundwater recharge model details can be found in feddema et al 2013 2 1 model development fwbm was further developed to include two factors important to estimating irrigation demands irrigation management strategy and pumping limitations 2 1 1 irrigation management irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture conditions is incorporated into fwbm in practice only a fraction of an irrigated field s whc is depleted this fraction can be described as an allowable range which is determined using minimum and maximum soil moisture the minimum value is when irrigation is triggered whereas the maximum value is when irrigation stops this management method is called minimum allowed deficiency mad and it allows for a specified soil water deficit typically with a minimum soil moisture level between 100 and 60 percent upendram and peterson 2007 the allowable range can be changed by an irrigator during the season to respond to changing environmental and crop conditions 2 1 2 pumping limitations while irrigation demand is dependent upon climate soil and crop conditions irrigation delivery is dependent upon many other conditions such as energy costs in this work we focus on the influence of pump capacities and when using a groundwater source aquifer properties on irrigation delivery there are limitations on the rate at which groundwater can be pumped from a well one of these limitations is the well yield defined as the amount of water that can flow into a well from surrounding rock or soil in a given amount of time hecox et al 2002 brookfield 2016 in an unconfined aquifer this limitation is calculated using the cooper jacob approximation 3 s a q u i f e r q 4 π t 0 5772 l n r 2 s 4 t t where saquifer is the calculated drawdown in the target well l q is pumping rate l3 t 1 t is aquifer transmissivity l2 t 1 r is the effective radius of the well l s is specific yield and t is duration of pumping t l and t are generic length and time units respectively transmissivity is defined as the saturated thickness multiplied by the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer well losses are also considered in the drawdown calculation by imposing a prescribed well efficiency driscoll 1986 the well yield is determined by imposing limits on the well drawdown related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer using methodology consistent with hecox et al 2002 and brookfield 2016 please see brookfield 2016 for method details another limitation is the pump capacity which is the maximum water discharge rate of the pump in this model the pumping rate is chosen as the minimum of well yield and pump capacity 3 model demonstration this model is demonstrated in kansas usa at a variety of spatial and temporal scales at the field level the model is demonstrated for 2005 2007 and at the county and state scale for 2000 2010 kansas is located in the center of the conterminous united states and has a total area of 213 096 km2 divided into 105 counties and 9 agricultural statistics districts wardlow et al 2007 fig 2 irrigation makes up approximately 75 of the state s annual water use and the hpa is the primary source of freshwater in the west and south central part of kansas kda 2019a widespread large scale irrigation throughout the region has caused water levels in the hpa to rapidly decline konikow 2013 in kansas the most substantial water loss has been in the southwest where water levels have declined by more than 30 m since predevelopment buchanan et al 2015 representing upwards of 60 of the saturated thickness of the aquifer recharge to the hpa in this region is estimated to be 2 5 cm yr which is less than in other parts of the state due to relatively lower annual precipitation volumes in southwestern kansas buchanan et al 2015 gutentag et al 1984 hansen 1991 current groundwater use in most of the hpa in kansas is considered unsustainable e g whittemore et al 2016 butler et al 2013 sophocleous 2000 many studies have attempted to assess and predict the usable life and the current and future groundwater resources in the hpa region of kansas brookfield et al 2018 butler et al 2013 katz et al 2016 longuevergne et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2006 stanton et al 2011 steward et al 2013 whittemore et al 2016 these efforts are hampered by the complexity of the system including the thick vadose zone and spatially variable aquifer characteristics buchanan et al 2015 the hpa underlies an area where forecasts indicate that the viability of water resources is at risk due to climate change crosbie et al 2013 liu et al 2012 yet success in predicting future resource availability is limited due to difficulty in quantifying key components including irrigation demand though direct measurement of annual groundwater withdrawals for irrigation is now available in kansas intra annual variability is not this makes it necessary to estimate groundwater withdrawals to effectively manage groundwater in the hpa stanton et al 2011 previous work has simulated irrigation demand in the hpa using the soil water balance sowat model kahle et al 2011 and the soil water balance swb model dripps and bradbury 2007 westenbroek et al 2012 however neither model considers hydrologic conditions such as groundwater levels which can affect pumping values stanton et al 2011 the application of fwbm to this region will provide simulations of water use for irrigation in kansas considering aquifer saturated thickness as a constraint on water availability in addition to the mad irrigation management strategy 3 1 simulating future weather conditions under ipcc climate change a1b scenario to demonstrate how the model can be used to investigate the potential impacts of climate change weather data were generated from the a1b scenario from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report ar4 brunsell et al 2010 according to the ipcc ab1 scenario economic growth likely will be very rapid with the introduction of new and more efficient technologies in this scenario the total worldwide energy consumption will not rely primarily on fossil energy but on a mix of energy sources in brunsell et al 2010 the decadal averaged monthly output of 21 global climate change models was examined for six grid cells representing kansas the result of multi model ensemble projections for the region for period 2010 2100 indicates that temperatures will probably warm in all seasons in this scenario the largest seasonal trend in air temperature is likely to be 0 04 c year in summer and fall rainfall is predicted to decrease in summer and fall but increase slightly in winter 3 2 data sources and methods a variety of site specific data are needed to simulate irrigation demand using fwbm fortunately kansas has extensive datasets available to adequately simulate the irrigated regions in the state and evaluate if the results are representative of reported and measured irrigation demands brief descriptions of the datasets and methods used in these fwbm simulations are provided below with additional detail provided in supplemental information 3 2 1 weather data kansas has a strong west east precipitation gradient with annual precipitation varying from less than 508 mm in the west to 1 016 mm in the east wardlow et al 2006 for this study the monthly parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate group climate 2018 dataset provides precipitation data in addition to minimum and maximum air temperatures as input for the fwbm of kansas schlenker 2014 schlenker and roberts 2009 3 2 2 crop information for the county level analysis irrigated crop acreage was obtained from the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2016 using survey based data from 2000 to 2010 these data were not available for alfalfa so values from the 2002 and 2007 usda agricultural censuses were used for those individual years with remaining years filled in with the average of those two years for the field level analysis simulated for 2005 to 2007 annual land use land cover lulc maps for kansas were developed for 2005 cropland pixels were extracted from the 2005 kansas land cover patterns level 1 dataset kars 2009 peterson et al 2008 and subjected to crop type classification using boosted decision tree models applied to 231 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index time series data brown et al 2013 mapped classes included irrigated i and non irrigated ni alfalfa corn sorghum soybeans and winter wheat double crop assumed to be irrigated and fallow assumed to be non irrigated crop specific lulc from usda nass cropland data layers usda nass cdl 2016 enhanced to include field level spatial generalization which was also utilized for the 2005 map and irrigation status gao et al 2017 was used for the 2006 2007 maps details about the ground reference dataset and classification models developed are available in the supplemental information and in gao et al 2017 final map accuracies were estimated to be 80 90 for level 1 classes cropland grassland woodland urban water 75 85 for level 2 classes crop types without irrigation status and 65 75 for level 3 classes crop type with irrigation status crop coefficients are used to incorporate crop conditions including maturation into the estimates of evapotranspiration colaizzi et al 2009 a polynomial equation of scaled crop coefficients is used to estimate the crop coefficient kc based on values from the texas high plains evaporation network in bushland tx and the high plains regional climate center colaizzi et al 2009 table s1 these values were scaled to the shorter growing season of kansas as necessary dermyer 2011 to estimate evaporation from bare ground in the pre post growing seasons the reference et was multiplied by 0 18 allen 2000 growing degree days are used in the polynomial equations for crop coefficients and in the estimate of a crop s growth stage dermyer 2011 tables s1 and s2 3 2 3 soil and aquifer characteristics runoff is calculated using hydrologic soil group or equivalently for this work scs curve numbers curve number two was used for soil classes with adjustments made based on the moisture conditions of the soil usda nrcs 1986 soil information including whc was obtained from the usda natural resource conservation service soil survey geographic ssurgo dataset usda nrcs ssurgo 2014 physical properties of the hpa including aquifer base aquifer boundary hydraulic conductivity ground surface elevation and specific yield were obtained from a usgs database wrd nsdi 2013 water table elevation data used to estimate aquifer saturated thickness are archived in the kansas geological survey s wizard database wizard 2013 3 2 4 water rights and use fwbm simulations of a subset of irrigated regions in kansas were calibrated using water use records for 2007 wimas 2014 this year was chosen because irrigation status models used for the development of the lulc maps depended most heavily on ground reference data and field boundaries from 2007 therefore it was the most appropriate year to use for model calibration the kansas water right database wimas 2014 includes detailed information about both the points of diversion where water is removed and places of use where the water is applied water rights served by only one well were selected resulting in a calibration dataset of more than 29 000 records and 1253 water right groups when two or more water rights either remove water from the same location or apply the water to the same location they are grouped together given the way water rights are registered monitored and reported in kansas it is necessary to calibrate and evaluate model results through comparison of simulated water demand and reported water use of water right groups most of the hpa region in kansas is closed to new water rights so no consideration is given to new or increased water rights kda 2019b the model was manually calibrated using minimum and maximum allowable soil moisture and irrigation efficiency model uncertainty due to calibration and parameterization is discussed in the supplemental information once calibrated the model was used to simulate irrigation demand from 2000 to 2010 the ratio of simulated annual irrigation demand to actual reported water use was calculated to assess model performance referred to as the performance ratio for the remainder of this manuscript the annual irrigation demand was calculated by aggregating daily irrigation demand 3 2 5 ipcc climate change a1b scenario simulated weather data scenarios of climate change have been described by global circulation models gcm but the temporal and spatial resolution is too coarse typically 200 km for application in the fwbm described in this study instead we use a weather generator developed in the national center for atmospheric research furrer and katz 2007 the model is a generalized linear model glm allowing for direct assimilation of annual cycles and other covariates including the el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation in the model precipitation is generated using a first order markov chain gamma model while daily maximum and minimum temperatures are modeled using separate first order autoregressive processes this method of constructing a climate change scenario has been named the delta change or perturbation factor hay et al 2000 to test the ability of the weather generator at producing weather data with similar distributions as actual observations one data set was obtained from the lakin hprcc station in kansas hprcc accessed 2015 from 1900 to 2010 and then the weather generation code was used to generate 10 realizations at the same location fig 3 the water budget results of the 10 realizations delta wg were averaged based on the julian day of the year the delta lakin dataset represents the lakin station weather data with the linear trend of climate change effect applied under the a1b scenario brunsell et al 2010 the delta wg dataset represents the mean of 10 generated weather datatsets with the climate change effect applied under the a1b scenario results are shown using these datasets 4 results 4 1 model performance the model was calibrated with maximum and minimum soil moisture values of 95 and 60 respectively and an irrigation efficiency of 90 this high irrigation efficiency is consistent with the dominance of efficient irrigation methods such as center pivot rogers and lamm 2012 fig 4 shows the performance ratios for each crop type for the calibrated year 2007 with median of performance ratios for corn sorghum soybean winter wheat and alfalfa of 1 10 0 78 0 75 0 93 and 1 40 respectively 4 1 1 field level simulations after calibration irrigation demand was simulated from 2005 to 2007 for 290 000 fields within 4544 water right groups for each water right group irrigation demands were calculated and compared with the actual reported water use wimas 2014 the correlation of predicted irrigation demands versus actual water use indicate that the variability of water use is moderately captured by the simulations with an r2 of 0 51 with simulated water use generally underestimated compared to reported water use information about the irrigation systems is available allowing for an evaluation of the effects of different systems on performance ratios table 1 the mean performance ratio differs between irrigation systems and crop types the mean performance ratio for center pivot systems is consistent for all crop types because center pivot systems are the most common irrigation system in kansas estimated to be used to irrigate approximately 92 of irrigated acres in 2012 rogers and lamm 2012 and thus the calibrated model more closely reflects center pivot irrigation systems without exception the mean performance ratios for all crops irrigated by flood irrigation are less than other systems table 1 this reflects the inefficiency of flood irrigation compared to other irrigation methods which are better represented by the calibrated irrigation efficiency value 4 1 2 county level simulations annual irrigation demands were also simulated for each county and performance ratios of simulations are presented in fig 5 the water budget was calculated for two groundwater pumping scenarios a fixed pumping rate 600 gpm or 136 27 m3 hr and a mean ten year allowable pumping rate to calculate the mean ten year allowable pumping rate the mean of allowable pumping rates of all wells within the county restricted by saturated thickness between 2000 and 2010 was calculated more detail is provided in supplemental information fig 5 presents results using the mean 10 year allowable pumping rate for each county 4 1 3 groundwater management district analysis the hpa in kansas is divided into five groundwater management districts gmds for local water resource management dennehy 2000 gutentag et al 1984 fig 2 a mean performance ratio for each gmd was calculated using both the mean ten year allowable pumping rate and the fixed pumping rate counties in gmd1 and gmd4 have the best performance ratios ranging from 0 85 to 1 03 and mean performance ratios for gmd 2 gmd 3 and gmd 5 range from 0 68 to 0 74 4 1 4 climate change simulations this model provides a data and computationally frugal method for simulating irrigation demand under a variety of scenarios including land use climate change and irrigation management the model can provide information about trends in irrigation demand under these scenarios helping to guide management options as an example of these applications a temperature and precipitation dataset was generated for 2090 2100 using the ipcc a1b climate scenario for the lakin weather station in kansas and 10 realizations were constructed using the delta approach with a linear decadal trend the simulated data are presented in fig 6 along with the historical data e g hay et al 2000 under the a1b ipcc climate change scenario increases in temperature increased the potential evapotranspiration and shifted the growing season to earlier in the year the average daily increase in the grass reference evapotranspiration from the baseline scenario 1980 1989 to the period of 2090 2100 was 0 2 mm per day in january and intensified through june reaching a maximum increase of 0 55 mm per day in this scenario the growing season was 20 days shorter for sorghum and 30 days shorter for winter wheat compared to current climate and farming practices this reduction in growing season is reflected in the fwbm irrigation demand which is shown in fig 7 for sorghum and winter wheat ideally the fwbm can be coupled to a crop yield model to provide a holistic understanding of how irrigation demand and shorter growing seasons can affect crop yield in this study the irrigation demands associated with these potential evapotranspiration rates are not being reported as the results in the fwbm will be highly limited by the groundwater levels and pumping capacity for a field the results are meant to demonstrate how the fwbm can be used for planning future water management decisions 5 discussion the water budget model developed for this work was demonstrated using the hpa in kansas while the model is not site specific and can be applied elsewhere the hpa in kansas is ideal for model demonstration since kansas has adequate water use records to compare model results against in addition the hpa in kansas has undergone and continues to undergo significant water level depletion due predominantly to irrigation e g wilson 2007 whittemore et al 2016 and is often considered a bellwether for other heavily used aquifers these conditions make the hpa in kansas an excellent site for demonstrating the capability and utility of this model the water budget model provides a reasonable representation of the quantity and variability of irrigation demand although it tends to under predict irrigation demand compared to reported water use table 1 this may occur for many reasons aside from model uncertainty first the water budget predicts the minimum water requirement when in reality many factors affect the amount of water used causing the actual water use to be higher than the minimum water requirement for example until 2013 kansas law implemented a use it or lose it provision of the prior appropriation doctrine whereby portions of water rights could be taken away from irrigators who used less than their full allocation peck 2015 this may have caused some irrigators to use more water than the minimum water requirement second other sources of water not represented in water use reports such as water delivered from reservoirs through irrigation districts may be used for irrigation in these areas typically in central and eastern kansas the mean performance ratios are higher than one and can be partially attributed to unaccounted surface water use finally the spatial variability of the training dataset used for calibration can negatively affect the results in areas with less coverage as shown in fig 5 the mean performance ratio in eastern kansas is frequently higher than one spatially the mean performance ratios in the west are closer to the performance ratio of field level validation the distribution of the lulc training dataset and the distribution of irrigated acreage in kansas is not homogenous in the study area fig 5 more fields from the western part of kansas are irrigated producing better performance ratios in the west than east the match between predicted and reported irrigation demand varied with crop and irrigation system type table 1 corn and winter wheat had the best matches among the crop types however there was less variability in the match with corn fig 4 table 1 these results are likely a reflection of the high proportion of irrigated fields with corn and winter wheat table s4 for irrigation systems center pivot with low energy precision application lepa had the best match excluding the other category table 1 all of the center pivot groups perform similarly overestimating water use slightly the differences between predicted and reported irrigation demand for the various crop and irrigation systems likely represents how well the calibrated parameters reflect actual management practices as previously indicated water efficient systems such as center pivot are the predominant irrigation systems used in kansas and thus calibration to an irrigation efficiency of 90 reflects these systems in addition corn is by far the most dominant crop represented among the ground reference data table s4 thus the calibrated mad strategy for soil moisture likely best reflects the practices used for that crop this indicates that calibrating to different mad strategies for each crop type and to irrigation efficiencies for irrigation systems would likely improve model performance the high variability of the performance ratios within the irrigation strategy groups may be reflective of the temporal variability in irrigation efficiency newer and well maintained irrigation systems typically operate at higher efficiencies compared to older systems and those that need maintenance this is particularly true of irrigation systems that require significantly more infrastructure such as center pivot and sprinkler where there are more opportunities for inefficiencies to develop evans 2001 the difference between restricting irrigation by pump capacity or well yield mattered little in the amount of water used for irrigation when assessed by gmd this is consistent with field observations and calculations for the period of 2000 2010 where despite the rapid declines in groundwater levels in portions of the hpa groundwater availability was not restricting water use in most of the region kgs 2017 gmds 1 and 4 have the largest change in performance ratio between the two simulations predicting much lower water use when pumping is restricted by well yield this is also consistent with estimates of saturated thickness and useable aquifer lifetime which predict that these two gmds are the most water restricted wilson 2007 6 conclusions fwbm can accurately represent water demand and variability in some regions of kansas demonstrating that it is capable of providing guidance for future water management considerations the variability in performance ratios indicates the importance of crop type and irrigation systems to estimating irrigation demand in addition model improvements to vary calibration parameters to better represent different crop specific water management strategies and irrigation system efficiencies are necessary applying groundwater pumping constraints based upon both pump capacity and well yield also improved estimates of irrigation demands differences between model results with irrigation limited by pump capacity or well yield highlighted the regions most at risk for aquifer depletion neglecting restrictions on irrigation due to aquifer properties and saturated thickness can overestimate demand and impact the effectiveness of water management strategies evaluating the effects of both agricultural policies and water management practices such as the mad strategy along with land use changes and climate variability remains a challenge in water resources planning and management and this model represents an approach for considering the effects simultaneously by adjusting input parameters average weather soil properties crop choice the model can be used as a decision making tool for farmers and agencies the advantage of the fwbm is that it can be applied at multiple spatial scales from field level to regional multi county estimates providing an understanding of irrigation requirements with large geographic coverage across a wide

10900,unsustainable groundwater mining threatens the economic stability of several regions around the world developing sustainable water use policies and integrated water management plans requires reliably predicting water demand under variable weather and land use conditions here a water budget model capable of estimating spatial and temporal variations in daily irrigation demand under variable weather and land use scenarios is modified to consider irrigation management and groundwater pumping limitations this model uses a combination of geospatial and in situ measured data including land use and land cover maps crop specific evapotranspiration data and weather data a coupled sub model limits pumping rates based on pump capacity and spatial and temporal variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer the ability of this water budget model to accurately estimate irrigation demand is demonstrated using the high plains aquifer region of kansas usa an aquifer that has undergone and continues to undergo significant depletion due to decades of irrigation the model was calibrated with reported and measured water use for more than 1200 fields with ratios of simulated annual irrigation demand to actual reported water use of 1 10 0 78 0 75 0 93 and 1 40 for corn sorghum soybean winter wheat and alfalfa respectively further simulations at a variety of

one practical method for evaluating the effects of these interactions on crop demand is using a soil water balance model kendy et al 2003 first developed by thornthwaite 1948 and thornthwaite et al 1957 soil water balance models are a relatively quick and easy way to estimate groundwater recharge at daily time steps westenbroek et al 2012 these models use mass balance equations to calculate soil water components including et runoff soil moisture dynamics and precipitation stanton et al 2011 soil water balance models have many applications in agronomics and are integrated into weather and climate models feddema et al 2013 gassmann et al 2011 however farming systems and irrigation management are often excluded despite their importance in managing water resources lambin et al 2000 in this work a water budget model capable of estimating irrigation demand under variable weather conditions is modified to include irrigation management options and groundwater pumping limitations this model is developed to include these management options and groundwater restrictions in a more computationally and data frugal approach than variably saturated groundwater models or integrated hydrologic models irrigation demand is estimated for five major crops using seven irrigation methods and minimum allowable deficiency mad irrigation management see model development the model includes limitations on groundwater pumping rates due to pump capacity and spatial and temporal variations in the saturated thickness of the aquifer this water budget model is demonstrated and evaluated using data from the high plains aquifer hpa in kansas overall the model provides a methodology to predict trends in irrigation demand under changing climate and land use decisions with minimal data and computational demands ultimately it could serve as a useful planning tool for farmers and groundwater resource managers to predict changes in current irrigation demands under other land use and water management scenarios 2 model description the feddema water budget model fwbm is a daily water budget model feddema et al 2013 in addition to other modifications to incorporate irrigation management strategy and pumping limitations as described in the following section fwbm was converted to a user defined matlab function for this work the water budget is given by 1 δ s δ t p i e t r 2 r r u n g r where δ s δ t is the change in soil storage with time p is precipitation i is irrigation water et is evapotranspiration and r represents overland runoff run estimated using the soil conservation service scs method and groundwater recharge gr the units of all terms are millimeters of water per time step the model output is the quantity of irrigation water required from each well the output can be converted from mm of water to total volume m3 using field acreage fwbm uses nine parameters to estimate irrigation demand and irrigation deficit latitude min and max daily temperature daily precipitation soil hydrological group equivalent number scs curve number soil water holding capacity whc of the root zone crop type irrigation system type and pumping rate fig 1 the weather and land use data are model based gridded geospatial datasets and the soil and water use data are based on in situ data fig 1 each component of the model is calculated using these inputs as described below the model outputs are daily irrigation demand actual evapotranspiration surface soil moisture content irrigation deficit irrigation surplus and groundwater recharge model details can be found in feddema et al 2013 2 1 model development fwbm was further developed to include two factors important to estimating irrigation demands irrigation management strategy and pumping limitations 2 1 1 irrigation management irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture conditions is incorporated into fwbm in practice only a fraction of an irrigated field s whc is depleted this fraction can be described as an allowable range which is determined using minimum and maximum soil moisture the minimum value is when irrigation is triggered whereas the maximum value is when irrigation stops this management method is called minimum allowed deficiency mad and it allows for a specified soil water deficit typically with a minimum soil moisture level between 100 and 60 percent upendram and peterson 2007 the allowable range can be changed by an irrigator during the season to respond to changing environmental and crop conditions 2 1 2 pumping limitations while irrigation demand is dependent upon climate soil and crop conditions irrigation delivery is dependent upon many other conditions such as energy costs in this work we focus on the influence of pump capacities and when using a groundwater source aquifer properties on irrigation delivery there are limitations on the rate at which groundwater can be pumped from a well one of these limitations is the well yield defined as the amount of water that can flow into a well from surrounding rock or soil in a given amount of time hecox et al 2002 brookfield 2016 in an unconfined aquifer this limitation is calculated using the cooper jacob approximation 3 s a q u i f e r q 4 π t 0 5772 l n r 2 s 4 t t where saquifer is the calculated drawdown in the target well l q is pumping rate l3 t 1 t is aquifer transmissivity l2 t 1 r is the effective radius of the well l s is specific yield and t is duration of pumping t l and t are generic length and time units respectively transmissivity is defined as the saturated thickness multiplied by the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer well losses are also considered in the drawdown calculation by imposing a prescribed well efficiency driscoll 1986 the well yield is determined by imposing limits on the well drawdown related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer using methodology consistent with hecox et al 2002 and brookfield 2016 please see brookfield 2016 for method details another limitation is the pump capacity which is the maximum water discharge rate of the pump in this model the pumping rate is chosen as the minimum of well yield and pump capacity 3 model demonstration this model is demonstrated in kansas usa at a variety of spatial and temporal scales at the field level the model is demonstrated for 2005 2007 and at the county and state scale for 2000 2010 kansas is located in the center of the conterminous united states and has a total area of 213 096 km2 divided into 105 counties and 9 agricultural statistics districts wardlow et al 2007 fig 2 irrigation makes up approximately 75 of the state s annual water use and the hpa is the primary source of freshwater in the west and south central part of kansas kda 2019a widespread large scale irrigation throughout the region has caused water levels in the hpa to rapidly decline konikow 2013 in kansas the most substantial water loss has been in the southwest where water levels have declined by more than 30 m since predevelopment buchanan et al 2015 representing upwards of 60 of the saturated thickness of the aquifer recharge to the hpa in this region is estimated to be 2 5 cm yr which is less than in other parts of the state due to relatively lower annual precipitation volumes in southwestern kansas buchanan et al 2015 gutentag et al 1984 hansen 1991 current groundwater use in most of the hpa in kansas is considered unsustainable e g whittemore et al 2016 butler et al 2013 sophocleous 2000 many studies have attempted to assess and predict the usable life and the current and future groundwater resources in the hpa region of kansas brookfield et al 2018 butler et al 2013 katz et al 2016 longuevergne et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2006 stanton et al 2011 steward et al 2013 whittemore et al 2016 these efforts are hampered by the complexity of the system including the thick vadose zone and spatially variable aquifer characteristics buchanan et al 2015 the hpa underlies an area where forecasts indicate that the viability of water resources is at risk due to climate change crosbie et al 2013 liu et al 2012 yet success in predicting future resource availability is limited due to difficulty in quantifying key components including irrigation demand though direct measurement of annual groundwater withdrawals for irrigation is now available in kansas intra annual variability is not this makes it necessary to estimate groundwater withdrawals to effectively manage groundwater in the hpa stanton et al 2011 previous work has simulated irrigation demand in the hpa using the soil water balance sowat model kahle et al 2011 and the soil water balance swb model dripps and bradbury 2007 westenbroek et al 2012 however neither model considers hydrologic conditions such as groundwater levels which can affect pumping values stanton et al 2011 the application of fwbm to this region will provide simulations of water use for irrigation in kansas considering aquifer saturated thickness as a constraint on water availability in addition to the mad irrigation management strategy 3 1 simulating future weather conditions under ipcc climate change a1b scenario to demonstrate how the model can be used to investigate the potential impacts of climate change weather data were generated from the a1b scenario from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report ar4 brunsell et al 2010 according to the ipcc ab1 scenario economic growth likely will be very rapid with the introduction of new and more efficient technologies in this scenario the total worldwide energy consumption will not rely primarily on fossil energy but on a mix of energy sources in brunsell et al 2010 the decadal averaged monthly output of 21 global climate change models was examined for six grid cells representing kansas the result of multi model ensemble projections for the region for period 2010 2100 indicates that temperatures will probably warm in all seasons in this scenario the largest seasonal trend in air temperature is likely to be 0 04 c year in summer and fall rainfall is predicted to decrease in summer and fall but increase slightly in winter 3 2 data sources and methods a variety of site specific data are needed to simulate irrigation demand using fwbm fortunately kansas has extensive datasets available to adequately simulate the irrigated regions in the state and evaluate if the results are representative of reported and measured irrigation demands brief descriptions of the datasets and methods used in these fwbm simulations are provided below with additional detail provided in supplemental information 3 2 1 weather data kansas has a strong west east precipitation gradient with annual precipitation varying from less than 508 mm in the west to 1 016 mm in the east wardlow et al 2006 for this study the monthly parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate group climate 2018 dataset provides precipitation data in addition to minimum and maximum air temperatures as input for the fwbm of kansas schlenker 2014 schlenker and roberts 2009 3 2 2 crop information for the county level analysis irrigated crop acreage was obtained from the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2016 using survey based data from 2000 to 2010 these data were not available for alfalfa so values from the 2002 and 2007 usda agricultural censuses were used for those individual years with remaining years filled in with the average of those two years for the field level analysis simulated for 2005 to 2007 annual land use land cover lulc maps for kansas were developed for 2005 cropland pixels were extracted from the 2005 kansas land cover patterns level 1 dataset kars 2009 peterson et al 2008 and subjected to crop type classification using boosted decision tree models applied to 231 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index time series data brown et al 2013 mapped classes included irrigated i and non irrigated ni alfalfa corn sorghum soybeans and winter wheat double crop assumed to be irrigated and fallow assumed to be non irrigated crop specific lulc from usda nass cropland data layers usda nass cdl 2016 enhanced to include field level spatial generalization which was also utilized for the 2005 map and irrigation status gao et al 2017 was used for the 2006 2007 maps details about the ground reference dataset and classification models developed are available in the supplemental information and in gao et al 2017 final map accuracies were estimated to be 80 90 for level 1 classes cropland grassland woodland urban water 75 85 for level 2 classes crop types without irrigation status and 65 75 for level 3 classes crop type with irrigation status crop coefficients are used to incorporate crop conditions including maturation into the estimates of evapotranspiration colaizzi et al 2009 a polynomial equation of scaled crop coefficients is used to estimate the crop coefficient kc based on values from the texas high plains evaporation network in bushland tx and the high plains regional climate center colaizzi et al 2009 table s1 these values were scaled to the shorter growing season of kansas as necessary dermyer 2011 to estimate evaporation from bare ground in the pre post growing seasons the reference et was multiplied by 0 18 allen 2000 growing degree days are used in the polynomial equations for crop coefficients and in the estimate of a crop s growth stage dermyer 2011 tables s1 and s2 3 2 3 soil and aquifer characteristics runoff is calculated using hydrologic soil group or equivalently for this work scs curve numbers curve number two was used for soil classes with adjustments made based on the moisture conditions of the soil usda nrcs 1986 soil information including whc was obtained from the usda natural resource conservation service soil survey geographic ssurgo dataset usda nrcs ssurgo 2014 physical properties of the hpa including aquifer base aquifer boundary hydraulic conductivity ground surface elevation and specific yield were obtained from a usgs database wrd nsdi 2013 water table elevation data used to estimate aquifer saturated thickness are archived in the kansas geological survey s wizard database wizard 2013 3 2 4 water rights and use fwbm simulations of a subset of irrigated regions in kansas were calibrated using water use records for 2007 wimas 2014 this year was chosen because irrigation status models used for the development of the lulc maps depended most heavily on ground reference data and field boundaries from 2007 therefore it was the most appropriate year to use for model calibration the kansas water right database wimas 2014 includes detailed information about both the points of diversion where water is removed and places of use where the water is applied water rights served by only one well were selected resulting in a calibration dataset of more than 29 000 records and 1253 water right groups when two or more water rights either remove water from the same location or apply the water to the same location they are grouped together given the way water rights are registered monitored and reported in kansas it is necessary to calibrate and evaluate model results through comparison of simulated water demand and reported water use of water right groups most of the hpa region in kansas is closed to new water rights so no consideration is given to new or increased water rights kda 2019b the model was manually calibrated using minimum and maximum allowable soil moisture and irrigation efficiency model uncertainty due to calibration and parameterization is discussed in the supplemental information once calibrated the model was used to simulate irrigation demand from 2000 to 2010 the ratio of simulated annual irrigation demand to actual reported water use was calculated to assess model performance referred to as the performance ratio for the remainder of this manuscript the annual irrigation demand was calculated by aggregating daily irrigation demand 3 2 5 ipcc climate change a1b scenario simulated weather data scenarios of climate change have been described by global circulation models gcm but the temporal and spatial resolution is too coarse typically 200 km for application in the fwbm described in this study instead we use a weather generator developed in the national center for atmospheric research furrer and katz 2007 the model is a generalized linear model glm allowing for direct assimilation of annual cycles and other covariates including the el niño southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation in the model precipitation is generated using a first order markov chain gamma model while daily maximum and minimum temperatures are modeled using separate first order autoregressive processes this method of constructing a climate change scenario has been named the delta change or perturbation factor hay et al 2000 to test the ability of the weather generator at producing weather data with similar distributions as actual observations one data set was obtained from the lakin hprcc station in kansas hprcc accessed 2015 from 1900 to 2010 and then the weather generation code was used to generate 10 realizations at the same location fig 3 the water budget results of the 10 realizations delta wg were averaged based on the julian day of the year the delta lakin dataset represents the lakin station weather data with the linear trend of climate change effect applied under the a1b scenario brunsell et al 2010 the delta wg dataset represents the mean of 10 generated weather datatsets with the climate change effect applied under the a1b scenario results are shown using these datasets 4 results 4 1 model performance the model was calibrated with maximum and minimum soil moisture values of 95 and 60 respectively and an irrigation efficiency of 90 this high irrigation efficiency is consistent with the dominance of efficient irrigation methods such as center pivot rogers and lamm 2012 fig 4 shows the performance ratios for each crop type for the calibrated year 2007 with median of performance ratios for corn sorghum soybean winter wheat and alfalfa of 1 10 0 78 0 75 0 93 and 1 40 respectively 4 1 1 field level simulations after calibration irrigation demand was simulated from 2005 to 2007 for 290 000 fields within 4544 water right groups for each water right group irrigation demands were calculated and compared with the actual reported water use wimas 2014 the correlation of predicted irrigation demands versus actual water use indicate that the variability of water use is moderately captured by the simulations with an r2 of 0 51 with simulated water use generally underestimated compared to reported water use information about the irrigation systems is available allowing for an evaluation of the effects of different systems on performance ratios table 1 the mean performance ratio differs between irrigation systems and crop types the mean performance ratio for center pivot systems is consistent for all crop types because center pivot systems are the most common irrigation system in kansas estimated to be used to irrigate approximately 92 of irrigated acres in 2012 rogers and lamm 2012 and thus the calibrated model more closely reflects center pivot irrigation systems without exception the mean performance ratios for all crops irrigated by flood irrigation are less than other systems table 1 this reflects the inefficiency of flood irrigation compared to other irrigation methods which are better represented by the calibrated irrigation efficiency value 4 1 2 county level simulations annual irrigation demands were also simulated for each county and performance ratios of simulations are presented in fig 5 the water budget was calculated for two groundwater pumping scenarios a fixed pumping rate 600 gpm or 136 27 m3 hr and a mean ten year allowable pumping rate to calculate the mean ten year allowable pumping rate the mean of allowable pumping rates of all wells within the county restricted by saturated thickness between 2000 and 2010 was calculated more detail is provided in supplemental information fig 5 presents results using the mean 10 year allowable pumping rate for each county 4 1 3 groundwater management district analysis the hpa in kansas is divided into five groundwater management districts gmds for local water resource management dennehy 2000 gutentag et al 1984 fig 2 a mean performance ratio for each gmd was calculated using both the mean ten year allowable pumping rate and the fixed pumping rate counties in gmd1 and gmd4 have the best performance ratios ranging from 0 85 to 1 03 and mean performance ratios for gmd 2 gmd 3 and gmd 5 range from 0 68 to 0 74 4 1 4 climate change simulations this model provides a data and computationally frugal method for simulating irrigation demand under a variety of scenarios including land use climate change and irrigation management the model can provide information about trends in irrigation demand under these scenarios helping to guide management options as an example of these applications a temperature and precipitation dataset was generated for 2090 2100 using the ipcc a1b climate scenario for the lakin weather station in kansas and 10 realizations were constructed using the delta approach with a linear decadal trend the simulated data are presented in fig 6 along with the historical data e g hay et al 2000 under the a1b ipcc climate change scenario increases in temperature increased the potential evapotranspiration and shifted the growing season to earlier in the year the average daily increase in the grass reference evapotranspiration from the baseline scenario 1980 1989 to the period of 2090 2100 was 0 2 mm per day in january and intensified through june reaching a maximum increase of 0 55 mm per day in this scenario the growing season was 20 days shorter for sorghum and 30 days shorter for winter wheat compared to current climate and farming practices this reduction in growing season is reflected in the fwbm irrigation demand which is shown in fig 7 for sorghum and winter wheat ideally the fwbm can be coupled to a crop yield model to provide a holistic understanding of how irrigation demand and shorter growing seasons can affect crop yield in this study the irrigation demands associated with these potential evapotranspiration rates are not being reported as the results in the fwbm will be highly limited by the groundwater levels and pumping capacity for a field the results are meant to demonstrate how the fwbm can be used for planning future water management decisions 5 discussion the water budget model developed for this work was demonstrated using the hpa in kansas while the model is not site specific and can be applied elsewhere the hpa in kansas is ideal for model demonstration since kansas has adequate water use records to compare model results against in addition the hpa in kansas has undergone and continues to undergo significant water level depletion due predominantly to irrigation e g wilson 2007 whittemore et al 2016 and is often considered a bellwether for other heavily used aquifers these conditions make the hpa in kansas an excellent site for demonstrating the capability and utility of this model the water budget model provides a reasonable representation of the quantity and variability of irrigation demand although it tends to under predict irrigation demand compared to reported water use table 1 this may occur for many reasons aside from model uncertainty first the water budget predicts the minimum water requirement when in reality many factors affect the amount of water used causing the actual water use to be higher than the minimum water requirement for example until 2013 kansas law implemented a use it or lose it provision of the prior appropriation doctrine whereby portions of water rights could be taken away from irrigators who used less than their full allocation peck 2015 this may have caused some irrigators to use more water than the minimum water requirement second other sources of water not represented in water use reports such as water delivered from reservoirs through irrigation districts may be used for irrigation in these areas typically in central and eastern kansas the mean performance ratios are higher than one and can be partially attributed to unaccounted surface water use finally the spatial variability of the training dataset used for calibration can negatively affect the results in areas with less coverage as shown in fig 5 the mean performance ratio in eastern kansas is frequently higher than one spatially the mean performance ratios in the west are closer to the performance ratio of field level validation the distribution of the lulc training dataset and the distribution of irrigated acreage in kansas is not homogenous in the study area fig 5 more fields from the western part of kansas are irrigated producing better performance ratios in the west than east the match between predicted and reported irrigation demand varied with crop and irrigation system type table 1 corn and winter wheat had the best matches among the crop types however there was less variability in the match with corn fig 4 table 1 these results are likely a reflection of the high proportion of irrigated fields with corn and winter wheat table s4 for irrigation systems center pivot with low energy precision application lepa had the best match excluding the other category table 1 all of the center pivot groups perform similarly overestimating water use slightly the differences between predicted and reported irrigation demand for the various crop and irrigation systems likely represents how well the calibrated parameters reflect actual management practices as previously indicated water efficient systems such as center pivot are the predominant irrigation systems used in kansas and thus calibration to an irrigation efficiency of 90 reflects these systems in addition corn is by far the most dominant crop represented among the ground reference data table s4 thus the calibrated mad strategy for soil moisture likely best reflects the practices used for that crop this indicates that calibrating to different mad strategies for each crop type and to irrigation efficiencies for irrigation systems would likely improve model performance the high variability of the performance ratios within the irrigation strategy groups may be reflective of the temporal variability in irrigation efficiency newer and well maintained irrigation systems typically operate at higher efficiencies compared to older systems and those that need maintenance this is particularly true of irrigation systems that require significantly more infrastructure such as center pivot and sprinkler where there are more opportunities for inefficiencies to develop evans 2001 the difference between restricting irrigation by pump capacity or well yield mattered little in the amount of water used for irrigation when assessed by gmd this is consistent with field observations and calculations for the period of 2000 2010 where despite the rapid declines in groundwater levels in portions of the hpa groundwater availability was not restricting water use in most of the region kgs 2017 gmds 1 and 4 have the largest change in performance ratio between the two simulations predicting much lower water use when pumping is restricted by well yield this is also consistent with estimates of saturated thickness and useable aquifer lifetime which predict that these two gmds are the most water restricted wilson 2007 6 conclusions fwbm can accurately represent water demand and variability in some regions of kansas demonstrating that it is capable of providing guidance for future water management considerations the variability in performance ratios indicates the importance of crop type and irrigation systems to estimating irrigation demand in addition model improvements to vary calibration parameters to better represent different crop specific water management strategies and irrigation system efficiencies are necessary applying groundwater pumping constraints based upon both pump capacity and well yield also improved estimates of irrigation demands differences between model results with irrigation limited by pump capacity or well yield highlighted the regions most at risk for aquifer depletion neglecting restrictions on irrigation due to aquifer properties and saturated thickness can overestimate demand and impact the effectiveness of water management strategies evaluating the effects of both agricultural policies and water management practices such as the mad strategy along with land use changes and climate variability remains a challenge in water resources planning and management and this model represents an approach for considering the effects simultaneously by adjusting input parameters average weather soil properties crop choice the model can be used as a decision making tool for farmers and agencies the advantage of the fwbm is that it can be applied at multiple spatial scales from field level to regional multi county estimates providing an understanding of irrigation requirements with large geographic coverage across a wide

10901,dryland farmers tend to increase maize plant density with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids to achieve higher grain yield in recent years however could this strategy improve yield or water use efficiency wue and be sustainable without decreasing deep soil water in drought prone environments is not clear a 4 year of successive field study was carried out with three different drought and density stress tolerance maize hybrids and four plant density arrange from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 to quantify the responses of grain yield formation and wue to increasing plant density under various rainfall condition and evaluate the effect on deep soil water balance results showed that using of drought and density stress tolerance hybrids could achieve higher grain yield and wue with higher plant density in normal years which was associated with an increase in kernels number per square meter but in dry year as fewer water was available during reproductive growth stage in higher plant density grain yield and wue was gradually decreased with increasing plant density especially in density stress sensitive hybrid soil water balance at 0 to 200 cm depth was not broken by high plant density from the perspective of same water availability at sowing in each year despite of the lower soil water content during maize growth stage however high plant density tended to consume more deep soil water which was hardly been replenished by precipitation especially in high density tolerance hybrids hence higher density that exceed 60000 plants ha 1 couple with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids is a potential way to improve maize production in dryland but it increases the risk of deep soil desiccation keywords dryland maize plant density soil water balance source sink ratio 1 introduction the increase in plant density has been one of the main managements contributed to maize grain yield improvements over the decades which remarkably increase resources use efficiency when combination with high density tolerance hybrids tollenaar and wu 1999 tokatlidis and koutroubas 2004 jia et al 2018 density stress tolerance is an important trait that breeders intend to improve fasoula and fasoula 2000 seed companies are also promoting high density maize cultivation for the purpose of commercial profit even on the loess plateau of china where soil fertility has improved but water is still a major limiting factor for dryland maize production farmers tend to increase maize plant density with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids to achieve higher grain yield considering the insufficient and fluctuating precipitation in semiarid area higher maize plant density probably increases the risk of grain yield loss and soil water over consumption previous studies have indicated that rainfed maize density should be lower than that in irrigated maize due to water deficiency liu et al 2014 drought coupled with high density stress would cause more serious barrenness and grain yield loss karlen and camp 1985 currently the recommended maize plant density is about 60000 plants ha 1 in dryland ren et al 2016 however the optimum density for rainfed maize is variable and highly depend on soil water availability during growth stage ning et al 2019 indicated maize grain yield is highly correlation with precipitation from fallow to tasseling on the semiarid loess plateau solomon et al 2017 suggested that choice of maize plant densities should be based on seasonal weather forecasts to maximize opportunities for higher yields however the forecast of precipitation is not accurate enough so far density neutral maize hybrids has been considered as another way to reduce the risk of grain yield loss cause by various rainfed condition in dryland farming system tokatlidis et al 2011 but its development is slow and most commercial hybrids are highly density dependent it seems that the trend of increasing maize plant density is dominant in no mater irrigated or rainfed condition it is reported that improper vegetation utilization such as using of wrong vegetation types excessive community density and productivity leads to soil desiccation in semiarid and semi humid regions wang et al 2004 although excessive depletion of deep soil water was usually observed in artificial forest and alfalfa land and maize production was evaluated without causing soil desiccation by model simulation in the last decade the continuous increase of hybrid drought tolerance plant density and the climate change are increasing the risk of soil desiccation in maize production system therefor we need to reassess its impact on deep soil water balance especially in water scarce arid regions thus we carried out a 4 year of successive field study with three different drought and density stress tolerance maize hybrids and four plant density arrange from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 on the loess plateau and the plant growth yield formation and soil water consumption were assessed the primary objectives of the present study were to 1 quantify the responses of grain yield formation and wue to increasing plant density under various rainfall condition 2 and evaluate the effect on deep soil water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted on the heyang dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university which was in ganjing town 35 19 n 110 4 e and 877 m altitude heyang county shaanxi province china over four growing seasons from 2015 to 2018 the site was in the southeast of the loess plateau which is represented by a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c a potential evaporation of 1832 8 mm and an annual mean precipitation of 498 4 mm over the last 15 years the total yearly frost free period was 190 days before the experiment continuous spring maize was planted the field experiment was carried out in a flat field on level terrain with dark loessial soil that was a typical soil type on the loess plateau with a mean soil bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 and classified as middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 the dynamic of temperature and precipitation during the experimental periods are shown in fig 1 the climate data were obtained from the weather station at the experimental station 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment initiated in 2015 was a split plots design with three replications and planting density as the main plot treatment and variety as the sub plot treatment each plot was 3 5 m wide and 13 0 m long four planting densities were evaluated in the experiment d1 52 500 plant ha 1 d2 67 500 plant ha 1 d3 82 500 plant ha 1 and d4 97 500 plant ha 1 with row spacing of 50 cm and plants spacing controlled by the planting population which was 38 1 29 6 24 3 and 20 5 cm respectively the three varieties that with similar growth period applied in the experiment were yy22 zd958 and xy335 high density tolerance of the three varieties is increased in turn and drought tolerance of zd958 and xy335 was great than that in yy22 xue et al 2010 maize was sown in late april and plots were hand planted at two seeds per hole at a depth of 4 5 cm only one seedling remained at the three leaf stage the one time application of the full amount of fertilizer was conducted by broadcast before sowing with rates of 225 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 the fertilizer types for n p2o5 and k2o were urea n 46 4 ammonium phosphate p2o5 45 n 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 respectively the harvest of maize was performed in mid september after the harvest the field was kept fallow until the sowing of the next maize season the next april and with no tillage management for all treatments weeds were controlled by spraying chemical herbicides before crop emergence as well as by hand once or twice in the growing season based on visual estimates of weed populations irrigation and plastic film mulch were not applied throughout the entire year in all experimental years 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil water content of all treatments was determined by the gravimetric method at seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity stage table 1 development progress of the three hybrids was similar and sampling time are the same soil samples were taken in 20 cm increments from 0 to 200 cm layer at each growth stage and 0 to 500 cm layer only at maturity stage in 2018 the soil samples were obtained randomly using a hand soil drill at two locations in the middle of a row for each treatment after obtaining the wet weight the soil samples were then dried for 8 h in an oven at 105 to constant weight and reweighed the soil moisture was then calculated soil water storage was calculated by summing the soil water storage in different layers and both of the index parameters were calculated by the following equations

the difference in the soil water storage between two growth stages d is the amount of water discharged outside the root and r is the surface runoff in the experiment the groundwater level was below 40 m in depth so the groundwater flow to the roots could be ignored runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat and the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over a 200 cm depth 2 3 2 aboveground dry matter five plants were randomly sampled from each plot at the seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity stages in each experimental year and the leaf area of these plants was measured the plants from each treatment were used to measure aboveground dry matter after measuring leaf area at the aforementioned growth stages aboveground dry matter was determined after plants were fixated at 105 c for 0 5 h and then oven dried at 85 c for a minimum of 48 h to constant weight in this study the aboveground dry matter refers to the biomass 2 3 3 grain yield and harvest index in each treatment excluding edge effects three random quadrats covering 9 0 m2 were selected to measure maize grain yield including yield components kernel number per ear ear number per square and 100 kernel weight maize grain yield was measured by adjusting grain moisture content to 14 in this study the crop yield refers to the grain yield harvest index was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass 2 4 statistical analysis the significance of main effects sub plot effects and interaction effects and the differences between treatments were assessed by split plot analysis with two way anova all of the data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the least significant difference test lsd treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 and the figures were generated using origin 2015 the optimum plant density was estimated according to tollenaar 1992 ln yp a bd where yp is the yield per plant in grams and d is the density in plants m2 with optimal density being equal to 1 b the source to sink ratio ssr was estimated according to chen et al 2016 and defined as the ratio of post silking dry matter accumulation to kernel number per square meter 3 results 3 1 overview of maize growth conditions and yield performance temperature was higher in 2017 than other years especially around tasseling there were 12 days whose maximum temperature exceeded 38oc in 2017 while not observed in other years fig 1a 2016 and 2017 received more precipitation during maize growth period than that in 2015 and 2018 but soil water storage was dramatically lower in 2017 thus we defined 2017 as a dry year in the present study soil water content decreased with increasing plant density at most of plant growing stage fig 1a grain yield showed a parabolic relationship with plant density expect in 2017 whose yield were lowest and decreased linearly with increasing density fig 1b 3 2 yield components maize grain yield components were notably altered by plant density fig 2 kernel number per meter showed an upward trend with increasing plant density except in the dry 2017 it fluctuated dramatically between treatments and growth seasons and ranged from 1210 to 4290 kernels per meter on the contrary kernel weight was relatively stable and decreased progressively with increasing density ranged from 31 7 to 21 3 g grain yield showed a parabolic relationship with plant density expect in 2017 which primarily associated with the fluctuation in kernel number coefficient of variance cv of grain yield through the four grown seasons were increased with the increasing plant density ranged from 32 0 to 41 2 average grain yield across the three varieties of d2 and d3 were 9 7 and 5 1 great than that in d1 through the four years whereas yield of d4 was lowest table 2 the differences in yield components were also significant between varieties and years table 2 average grain yield of xy335 and zd958 was greater than yy22 as well as kernel number per meter but the highest kernel weight was observed in yy22 average grain yield in 2017 was dramatic lower than other years which primarily associated with reduction of the kernel number there were significant interactions between density and variety density and year variety and year on yield components which indicated that density determination was variety and year specific fig 3 shows the optimal plant density that estimated on the basis of the four densities in 2015 2018 xy335 has the highest optimal plant density then zd958 and lowest in yy22 for high xy335 and zd958 optimal plant densities excessed 70 000 plant ha 1 in normal years but less than 70000 plant hm 2 for xy335 yy22 the optimal plant densities in the dry year 2017 varied from 48 000 to 51000 plant hm 1 whereas that in other years varied from 58 000 to 103 000 plant ha 1 3 3 source to sink relationship plant biomass was increased with increasing plant density whereas harvest index with a downward tendency fig 4 plant biomass and harvest index both were lower in the dry year 2017 than other years harvest index usually was less than 0 5 expect under lower density in 2016 who received most precipitation during the growth period the ration of pre tasseling plant biomass pb to total plant biomass tb tended to decrease with increasing plant density range from 0 68 to 0 44 and observed dramatic higher value in 2017 than other year ssr tended to decrease with increasing plant density in 2015 and 2016 whereas increased in the dry 2017 and in 2018 ssr showed a parabolic relationship with plant density fig 5 the value of ssr was high in 2017 than other years these results indicated high plant density weaken source to sink strength and limited yield increase in normal years but source to sink strength was enhanced by high plant density in dry year which probably due to the dramatically decreased kernel number 3 4 water consumption and water use efficiency high plant density enhanced the total water consumption or evapotranspiration during maize growth period fig 6 at the first three growth periods s v3 v3 v9 v9 vt water consumption was increased with increasing plant density whereas tended to decrease at the later growth periods most water was consumed at v9 vt period in 2015 and 2016 whereas at vt r3 and v3 v9 in 2017 and 2018 wue of yy22 showed a downward trend with increasing plant density in the four experience years fig 7 but wue of zd958 and xy335 only linearly decreased with increasing plant density in the dry 2017 but increased first and then decreased in other years fig 7 soil water storage at sowing was similar under different density and variety while at maturity soil water storage was lower under higher density and in xy335 than other varieties on the contrary et was higher under higher density and in xy335 the highest average wue was observed at d2 treatment and the lowest at d4 zd958 had a higher wue than yy22 and xy335 wue was sharply decreased in 2017 which was less than the half of that in the other years table 3 3 5 dynamic of soil water content as shown in fig 8 soil water profile dynamic at 0 to 200 cm layer was similar among the three varieties while soil water content was decreased with increasing plant density especially post tasseling stage soil water content usually was less than 12 at filling and maturity period soil water at depth from 0 to 200 cm all could be utilized by maize production precipitation was hardly to replenish soil moisture that in 200 cm depth as shown in fig 9 the cv of soil water content was decreased with soil depth high plant density increased cv of soil water content especially at 0 100 depth cv of soil water content in xy335 was slightly higher than that in zd958 and yy22 plant density affected cv of soil water content at deeper soil depth exceed 100 cm in xy335 and zd958 while no difference for that was found in yy22 variation in deep soil water 0 500 cm during the maturity generally ranged from 8 7 to 21 2 for all treatments in 2018 fig 10 the vertical change tendencies in soil water content were similar for all cultivars across all plant density soil water content at depth exceed 200 cm was higher and more stable than that in 0 200 cm depth however similarly to 0 200 cm depth soil layer soil water content at depth excess 200 cm was also slightly declined by high plant density especially in xy335 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield formation previous studies recommended maize plant density be about 60000 plants ha 1 and should not exceed 70000 plants ha 1 in dryland considering the limited water availability liu et al 2014 ren et al 2016 however in the present study we found the optimal density usually exceed 70000 plants per hectare for modern high density and drought tolerance hybrids fig 3 this indicates that increasing plant density couple with high density and drought tolerance hybrid is a potential way to increasing grain yield in dryland maize production system kernel number and weight are the two interinhibitive factors that determine grain yield under different plant density high density usually increased kernel number per unit area but decreased kernel weight echarte et al 2000 but the evaluation of which factor dominant yield dynamic was difficult and different in various studies echarte et al 2000 hashemi et al 2005 chen et al 2016 in the present study the fluctuation of yield among years mainly attributed to the dynamic of kernel number as it was dramatically decreased in the dry year kernel weight declined with the increasing plant density which suggested source supply was limited for grain filling the analysis of ssr conforms that the insufficient source was usually the main factor that limited yield improved with increasing plant density but source to sink strength was enhanced by high plant density in dry year which probably due to the dramatically decreased kernel number fig 2 just like kernel number and weight plant biomass and harvest index were interinhibitive the even increased plant biomass but sharply decreased harvest index could not achieve continuous increase in grain yield with increasing plant density thus optimizing canopy photosynthetic capacity and improving photosynthate distribution efficiency meanwhile increasing kernel number would be the key to improve maize yield by increasing plant density what s more attention needs to be paid to occasionally kernel number decreasing caused by high plant density and drought stress around tussling in dryland maize 4 2 water use and water use efficiency water is the major limiting for primary production in most dryland farming system deng et al 2006 improving crops yield by increasing water use and water use efficiency wue had been the main goal for crop managements angus and van herwaarden 2001 but water use and wue usually cannot be obtained simultaneously under water stress condition wue defined as the ratio of grain yield to crop water use is often considered an important determinant of yield under stress blum 2009 argued that effective use of water which implies maximal soil moisture capture for transpiration but not wue is a major target for yield improvement in water limited environment as high wue often coupled with reduced yield and reduced drought resistance in the present study water use or evapotranspiration were progressively increased with increasing plant density while wue showed a parabolic relation with plant density the density of 97500 kg hm 2 decreased grain yield and wue compared with density of 52500 kg hm 2 meanwhile increased the risk of excessive water use the evaluation of water consumption at different maize grown stage showed higher plant density consumed more water at vegetable growth stage while consumed less water at reproductive stage this suggest that the limited water could not afford maize grain filling under excessive plant density in the dryland and resulted in a low wue in terms of the three variety although zd958 and xy335 both achieved higher grain yield than yy22 the water use strategy differed zd958 increased wue while xy335 use more water considering the scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems varieties like zd958 were recommended in the semiarid area as it is complicated to evaluate the efficiency of water use which involves stomatal and non stomatal transpiration and soil evaporation blum 2009 we consider high wue coupled with improve yield as a main target for crop management and breeding 4 3 soil water balance soil moisture has declined due to orchard production and afforestation across the loess plateau jia et al 2017 peng et al 2017 but previous studies on maize showed no soil desiccation occurs in dryland maize production system li et al 2007 wang et al 2008 in our study soil water storage at 0 200 cm depth declined with the increasing plant density during maize grown period while recovered after the fallow which suggests soil water balance was not disturbed however soil water content at depth excess 200 cm which was hardly resupplied by rainfall was also consumed by excessive density especially in xy335 who consumed more and deeper water than other varieties therefore the risk of deep soil desiccation was increased by high plant density which would cause adverse effects on the resistance of the dryland maize production system crop rotation and fallow should performed occasionally depend on water availability to improve system resistance it is agreed that the period of the present study was limited additional work is required to investigate the effect of high plant density coupled with drought tolerance hybrids on soil water balance in a long run 5 conclusions in this work we have evaluated the effects of high plant density on maize grain yield formation and soil water balance in dryland grain yield and wue both showed parabolic relations with plant density the optimal plant density usually exceeded 70000 plant hm 2 for drought and density stress tolerance hybrids expect in extreme drought in this specific site high plant density did not disturb the soil water balance at 0 200 cm layer but increased the risk of deep soil desiccation in conclusion higher density couple with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids is a potential way to improve maize yield in dryland simultaneously attention need pay to deep soil desiccation and dryland farming system resistance acknowledgement we are grateful to the supports

10901,dryland farmers tend to increase maize plant density with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids to achieve higher grain yield in recent years however could this strategy improve yield or water use efficiency wue and be sustainable without decreasing deep soil water in drought prone environments is not clear a 4 year of successive field study was carried out with three different drought and density stress tolerance maize hybrids and four plant density arrange from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 to quantify the responses of grain yield formation and wue to increasing plant density under various rainfall condition and evaluate the effect on deep soil water balance results showed that using of drought and density stress tolerance hybrids could achieve higher grain yield and wue with higher plant density in normal years which was associated with an increase in kernels number per square meter but in dry year as fewer water was available during reproductive growth stage in higher plant density grain yield and wue was gradually decreased with increasing plant density especially in density stress sensitive hybrid soil water balance at 0 to 200 cm depth was not broken by high plant density from the perspective of same water availability at sowing in each year despite of the lower soil water content during maize growth stage however high plant density tended to consume more deep soil water which was hardly been replenished by precipitation especially in high density tolerance hybrids hence higher density that exceed 60000 plants ha 1 couple with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids is a potential way to improve maize production in dryland but it increases the risk of deep soil desiccation keywords dryland maize plant density soil water balance source sink ratio 1 introduction the increase in plant density has been one of the main managements contributed to maize grain yield improvements over the decades which remarkably increase resources use efficiency when combination with high density tolerance hybrids tollenaar and wu 1999 tokatlidis and koutroubas 2004 jia et al 2018 density stress tolerance is an important trait that breeders intend to improve fasoula and fasoula 2000 seed companies are also promoting high density maize cultivation for the purpose of commercial profit even on the loess plateau of china where soil fertility has improved but water is still a major limiting factor for dryland maize production farmers tend to increase maize plant density with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids to achieve higher grain yield considering the insufficient and fluctuating precipitation in semiarid area higher maize plant density probably increases the risk of grain yield loss and soil water over consumption previous studies have indicated that rainfed maize density should be lower than that in irrigated maize due to water deficiency liu et al 2014 drought coupled with high density stress would cause more serious barrenness and grain yield loss karlen and camp 1985 currently the recommended maize plant density is about 60000 plants ha 1 in dryland ren et al 2016 however the optimum density for rainfed maize is variable and highly depend on soil water availability during growth stage ning et al 2019 indicated maize grain yield is highly correlation with precipitation from fallow to tasseling on the semiarid loess plateau solomon et al 2017 suggested that choice of maize plant densities should be based on seasonal weather forecasts to maximize opportunities for higher yields however the forecast of precipitation is not accurate enough so far density neutral maize hybrids has been considered as another way to reduce the risk of grain yield loss cause by various rainfed condition in dryland farming system tokatlidis et al 2011 but its development is slow and most commercial hybrids are highly density dependent it seems that the trend of increasing maize plant density is dominant in no mater irrigated or rainfed condition it is reported that improper vegetation utilization such as using of wrong vegetation types excessive community density and productivity leads to soil desiccation in semiarid and semi humid regions wang et al 2004 although excessive depletion of deep soil water was usually observed in artificial forest and alfalfa land and maize production was evaluated without causing soil desiccation by model simulation in the last decade the continuous increase of hybrid drought tolerance plant density and the climate change are increasing the risk of soil desiccation in maize production system therefor we need to reassess its impact on deep soil water balance especially in water scarce arid regions thus we carried out a 4 year of successive field study with three different drought and density stress tolerance maize hybrids and four plant density arrange from 52 500 to 97 500 plants ha 1 on the loess plateau and the plant growth yield formation and soil water consumption were assessed the primary objectives of the present study were to 1 quantify the responses of grain yield formation and wue to increasing plant density under various rainfall condition 2 and evaluate the effect on deep soil water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field experiment was conducted on the heyang dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university which was in ganjing town 35 19 n 110 4 e and 877 m altitude heyang county shaanxi province china over four growing seasons from 2015 to 2018 the site was in the southeast of the loess plateau which is represented by a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c a potential evaporation of 1832 8 mm and an annual mean precipitation of 498 4 mm over the last 15 years the total yearly frost free period was 190 days before the experiment continuous spring maize was planted the field experiment was carried out in a flat field on level terrain with dark loessial soil that was a typical soil type on the loess plateau with a mean soil bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 and classified as middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 the dynamic of temperature and precipitation during the experimental periods are shown in fig 1 the climate data were obtained from the weather station at the experimental station 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment initiated in 2015 was a split plots design with three replications and planting density as the main plot treatment and variety as the sub plot treatment each plot was 3 5 m wide and 13 0 m long four planting densities were evaluated in the experiment d1 52 500 plant ha 1 d2 67 500 plant ha 1 d3 82 500 plant ha 1 and d4 97 500 plant ha 1 with row spacing of 50 cm and plants spacing controlled by the planting population which was 38 1 29 6 24 3 and 20 5 cm respectively the three varieties that with similar growth period applied in the experiment were yy22 zd958 and xy335 high density tolerance of the three varieties is increased in turn and drought tolerance of zd958 and xy335 was great than that in yy22 xue et al 2010 maize was sown in late april and plots were hand planted at two seeds per hole at a depth of 4 5 cm only one seedling remained at the three leaf stage the one time application of the full amount of fertilizer was conducted by broadcast before sowing with rates of 225 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 the fertilizer types for n p2o5 and k2o were urea n 46 4 ammonium phosphate p2o5 45 n 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 respectively the harvest of maize was performed in mid september after the harvest the field was kept fallow until the sowing of the next maize season the next april and with no tillage management for all treatments weeds were controlled by spraying chemical herbicides before crop emergence as well as by hand once or twice in the growing season based on visual estimates of weed populations irrigation and plastic film mulch were not applied throughout the entire year in all experimental years 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil water content of all treatments was determined by the gravimetric method at seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity stage table 1 development progress of the three hybrids was similar and sampling time are the same soil samples were taken in 20 cm increments from 0 to 200 cm layer at each growth stage and 0 to 500 cm layer only at maturity stage in 2018 the soil samples were obtained randomly using a hand soil drill at two locations in the middle of a row for each treatment after obtaining the wet weight the soil samples were then dried for 8 h in an oven at 105 to constant weight and reweighed the soil moisture was then calculated soil water storage was calculated by summing the soil water storage in different layers and both of the index parameters were calculated by the following equations

aboveground dry matter five plants were randomly sampled from each plot at the seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity stages in each experimental year and the leaf area of these plants was measured the plants from each treatment were used to measure aboveground dry matter after measuring leaf area at the aforementioned growth stages aboveground dry matter was determined after plants were fixated at 105 c for 0 5 h and then oven dried at 85 c for a minimum of 48 h to constant weight in this study the aboveground dry matter refers to the biomass 2 3 3 grain yield and harvest index

to aboveground biomass 2 4 statistical analysis the significance of main effects sub plot effects and interaction effects and the differences between treatments were assessed by split plot analysis with two way anova all of the data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the least significant difference test lsd treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 and the figures were generated using origin 2015 the optimum plant density was estimated according to tollenaar 1992 ln yp a bd where yp

ratio of post silking dry matter accumulation to kernel number per square meter 3 results 3 1 overview of maize growth conditions and yield performance temperature was higher in 2017 than other years especially around tasseling there were 12 days whose maximum temperature exceeded 38oc in 2017 while not observed in other years fig 1a 2016 and 2017 received more precipitation during maize growth period than that in 2015 and 2018 but soil water storage was dramatically lower in 2017 thus we defined 2017 as a dry year in the present study soil water content decreased with increasing plant density at most of plant growing stage fig 1a grain yield showed a parabolic relationship with plant density expect in 2017 whose yield were lowest and decreased linearly with increasing density fig 1b 3 2 yield components maize grain yield components were notably altered by plant density fig 2 kernel number per meter showed an upward trend with increasing plant density except in the dry 2017 it fluctuated dramatically between treatments and growth seasons and ranged from 1210 to 4290 kernels per meter on the contrary kernel weight was relatively stable and decreased progressively with increasing density ranged from 31 7 to 21 3 g grain yield showed a parabolic relationship with plant density expect in 2017 which primarily associated with the fluctuation in kernel number coefficient of variance cv of grain yield through the four grown seasons were increased with the increasing plant density ranged from 32 0 to 41 2 average grain yield across the three varieties of d2 and d3 were 9 7 and 5 1 great than that in d1 through the four years whereas yield of d4 was lowest table 2 the differences in yield components were also significant between varieties and years table 2 average grain yield of xy335 and zd958 was greater than yy22 as well as kernel number per meter but the highest kernel weight was observed in yy22 average grain yield in 2017 was dramatic lower than other years which primarily associated with reduction of the kernel number there were significant interactions between density and variety density and year variety and year on yield components which indicated that density determination was variety and year specific fig 3 shows the optimal plant density that estimated on the basis of the four densities in 2015 2018 xy335 has the highest optimal plant density then zd958 and lowest in yy22 for high xy335 and zd958 optimal plant densities excessed 70 000 plant ha 1 in normal years but less than 70000 plant hm 2 for xy335 yy22 the optimal plant densities in the dry year 2017 varied from 48 000 to 51000 plant hm 1 whereas that in other years varied from 58 000 to 103 000 plant ha 1 3 3 source to sink relationship plant biomass was increased with increasing plant density whereas harvest index with a downward tendency fig 4 plant biomass and harvest index both were lower in the dry year 2017 than other years harvest index usually was less

increasing plant density range from 0 68 to 0 44 and observed dramatic higher value in 2017 than other year ssr tended to decrease with increasing plant density in 2015 and 2016 whereas increased in the dry 2017 and in 2018 ssr showed a parabolic relationship with plant density fig 5 the value of ssr was high in 2017 than other years these results indicated high plant density weaken source to sink strength and limited yield increase in normal years but source to sink strength was enhanced by high plant density in dry year which probably due to the dramatically decreased kernel number 3 4 water consumption and water use efficiency high plant density enhanced the total water consumption or evapotranspiration during maize growth period fig 6 at the first three growth periods s v3 v3 v9 v9 vt water consumption was increased with increasing plant density whereas tended to decrease at the later growth periods most water was consumed at v9 vt period in 2015 and 2016 whereas at vt r3 and v3 v9 in 2017 and 2018 wue of yy22 showed a downward trend with increasing plant density in the four experience years fig 7 but wue of zd958 and xy335 only linearly decreased with increasing plant density in the dry 2017 but increased first and then decreased in other years fig 7 soil water storage at sowing was similar under different density and variety while at maturity soil water storage was lower under higher density and in xy335 than other varieties on the contrary et was higher under higher density and in xy335 the highest average wue was observed at d2 treatment and the lowest at d4 zd958 had a higher wue than yy22 and xy335 wue was sharply decreased in 2017 which was less than the half of that in the other years table 3 3 5 dynamic of soil water content as shown in fig 8 soil water profile dynamic at 0 to 200 cm layer was similar among the three varieties while soil water content was decreased with increasing plant density especially post tasseling stage soil water content usually was less than 12 at filling and maturity period soil water at depth from 0 to 200 cm all could be utilized by maize production precipitation was hardly to replenish soil moisture that in 200 cm depth as shown in fig 9 the cv of soil water content was decreased with soil depth high plant density increased cv of soil water content especially at 0 100 depth cv of soil water content in xy335 was slightly higher than that in zd958 and yy22 plant density affected cv of soil water content at deeper soil depth exceed 100 cm in xy335 and zd958 while no difference for that was found in yy22 variation in deep soil water 0 500 cm during the maturity generally ranged from 8 7 to 21 2 for all treatments in 2018 fig 10 the vertical change tendencies in soil water content were similar for all cultivars across all plant density soil water content at depth exceed 200 cm was higher and more stable than that in 0 200 cm depth however similarly to 0 200 cm depth soil layer soil water content at depth excess 200 cm was also slightly declined by high plant density especially in xy335 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield formation previous studies recommended maize plant density be about 60000 plants ha 1 and should not exceed 70000 plants ha 1 in dryland considering the limited water availability liu et al 2014 ren et al 2016 however in the present study we found the optimal density usually exceed 70000 plants per hectare for modern high density and drought tolerance hybrids fig 3 this indicates that increasing plant density couple with high density and drought tolerance hybrid is a

decreased kernel number fig 2 just like kernel number and weight plant biomass and harvest index were interinhibitive the even increased plant biomass but sharply decreased harvest index could not achieve continuous increase in grain yield with increasing plant density thus optimizing canopy photosynthetic capacity and improving photosynthate distribution efficiency meanwhile increasing kernel number would be the key to improve maize yield by increasing plant density what s more attention needs to be paid to occasionally kernel number decreasing caused by high plant density and drought stress around tussling in dryland maize 4 2 water use and water use efficiency water is the major limiting for primary production in most dryland farming system deng et al 2006 improving crops yield by increasing water use and water use efficiency wue had been the main goal for crop managements angus and van herwaarden 2001 but water use and wue usually cannot be obtained simultaneously under water stress condition wue defined as the ratio of grain yield to crop water use is often considered an important determinant of yield under stress blum 2009 argued that effective use of water which implies maximal soil moisture capture for transpiration but not wue is a major target for yield improvement in water limited environment as high wue often coupled with reduced yield and reduced drought resistance in the present study water use or evapotranspiration were progressively increased with increasing plant density while wue showed a parabolic relation with plant density the density of 97500 kg hm 2 decreased grain yield and wue compared with density of 52500 kg hm 2 meanwhile increased the risk of excessive water use the evaluation of water consumption at different maize grown stage showed higher plant density consumed more water at vegetable growth stage while consumed less water at reproductive stage this suggest that the limited water could not afford maize grain filling under excessive plant density in the dryland and resulted in a low wue in terms of the three variety although zd958 and xy335 both achieved higher grain yield than yy22 the water use strategy differed zd958 increased wue while xy335 use more water considering the scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems varieties like zd958 were recommended in the semiarid area as it is complicated to evaluate the efficiency of water use which involves stomatal and non stomatal transpiration and soil evaporation blum 2009 we consider high wue coupled with improve yield as a main target for crop management and breeding 4 3 soil water balance soil moisture has declined due to orchard production and afforestation across the loess plateau jia et al 2017 peng et al 2017 but previous studies on maize showed no soil desiccation occurs in dryland maize production system li et al 2007 wang et al 2008 in our study soil water storage at 0 200 cm depth declined with the increasing plant density during maize grown period while recovered after the fallow which suggests soil water balance was not disturbed however soil water content at depth excess 200 cm which was hardly resupplied by rainfall was also consumed by excessive density especially in xy335 who consumed more and deeper water than other varieties therefore the risk of deep soil desiccation was increased by high plant density which would cause adverse effects on the resistance of the dryland maize production system crop rotation and fallow should performed occasionally depend on water availability to improve system resistance it is agreed that the period of the present study was limited additional work is required to investigate the effect of high plant density coupled with drought tolerance hybrids on soil water balance in a long run 5 conclusions in this work we have evaluated the effects of high plant density on maize grain yield formation and soil water balance in dryland grain yield and wue both showed parabolic relations with plant density the optimal plant density usually exceeded 70000 plant hm 2 for drought and density stress tolerance hybrids expect in extreme drought in this specific site high plant density did not disturb the soil water balance at 0 200 cm layer but increased the risk of deep soil desiccation in conclusion higher density couple with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids is a potential way to improve maize yield in dryland simultaneously attention need pay to deep soil desiccation and dryland farming system resistance acknowledgement we are grateful to the supports

application of 30 g m 2 6 3 g n m² in april with a mineral fertilizer that includes 21 ammonium sulphate soil samples were taken at 0 5 m depth before the start of the study and revealed the existence of an artificial soil profile of 0 2 m above the native soil the rooting layer 0 1 m thick was formed by 90 95 of sand 5 83 of silt and 3 22 of clay with a content of organic matter of 1 46 total

with a double ring infiltrometer astm standard d3385 09 from january to the beginning of the drought period the plots were monthly mowed at a height of 16 mm during the recovery period the plots were mowed only once on september 15th 2016 whereas no mowing was performed during this period in 2017 at the end of the recovery period a plant height of 45 50 mm was observed in both years 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments two experimental plots 6 9 m wide and 8 9 m long were used to conduct the study one for each experimental year 2016 2017 the area was isolated enough from the rest of the nursery to avoid any irrigation interference it was divided into sixteen 1 5 m2 1 m 1 5 m plots 0 3 m apart from each other and surrounded by a perimeter border 1 m wide the drought period began on may 29th and june 5th in 2016 and 2017 respectively four treatments were defined which differed in the durations of the drought periods these being three t1 five t2 eight t3 and eleven 2016 ten 2017 t4 weeks of irrigation withholding in t4 the drought period was reduced by one week in the second year of experimentation 2017 due to poor turf recovery results observed in 2016 a statistical design of completely randomized blocks with four blocks and one repetition per block was performed fig 1 in all the treatments irrigation was completely withheld at the beginning of june after the drought period a recovery irrigation period was applied in which 100 of standard turfgrass water requirements etc were supplied during this period irrigation was manually applied every other day until one week after irrigation began in the t4 treatment when sprinkler irrigation was daily applied to all the treatments the turfgrass water requirements etc for the recovery period were calculated using the crop coefficient kc method allen et al 1998 a kc of 0 6 was considered in this study a value that has been frequently recommended for warm season turf species meyer and gibeault 1987 including tifway bermudagrass garrot and mancino 1994 hejl et al 2016 fig 2 shows the accumulated water depths irrigation plus rain applied to all the irrigation treatments during the two experimental periods in both these periods the accumulated etc from the beginning of the drought period to the end of the study period was close to 500 mm the volumes of water received by the irrigation treatments during the same period of time were notably higher in 2016 due to the higher precipitations that took place in 2016 in any case rain did not play a significant role in the turf s response to drought and subsequent recovery because rain mainly occurred at the end of the recovery period in both years of study 2 3 soil water measurements soil water content was monitored by time domain reflectometry topp and davis 1985 using a tdr300 probe fieldscout spectrum technologies inc aurora illinois usa equipped with two 12 cm long rods the measurements were performed weekly in all experimental plots n 16 three soil moisture readings were taken at each plot on each measurement day which were averaged to obtain a representative soil moisture measurement of the entire plot 2 4 turfgrass quality assessment the turfgrass quality was weekly evaluated in all the experimental plots during the drought and recovery periods in both experimental years all the measurements were performed during the same day in each week the overall turfgrass quality otq was determined by the evaluation system developed by the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep this is a visual evaluation system morris and shearman 1998 based on a rating scale of 1 poor to 9 ideal turf quality that accounts for both the turfgrass aesthetics i e color density uniformity texture and functional use turgeon 1991 since the visual assessment of the turf is somewhat subjective bell et al 2002 the turfgrass quality was also evaluated with an optical handheld sensor greenseekertm trimble sunnyvale california that measures the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndvi can be considered as a means for an indirect assessment of otq bell et al 2009 in this experiment ndvi measurements were taken at noon from 11 00 to 12 00 h for the estimation of the green coverage i e the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation attained in each of the plots two different methods were used in one of them a 1 m by 1 m frame divided with strings into a 10 cm 10 cm grid was employed on each measurement day the frame was placed in a fixed position in the plot set to a reference point for each square of the grid a value between 0 no cover and 1 the whole area green was given according to the area of dry coverage green coverage or bare soil perceived in it the percentage of soil covered by green vegetation was then calculated as the sum of all the values obtained in the grid as described by baseggio et al 2015 and elzinga et al 1998 green coverage was also measured with a digital image analysis dia method goldsby et al 2015 in this case jpeg images 3648 2736 resolution taken under no flash conditions with a sony dsc tx5 digital camera 35 mm focal length shutter speed 1 400 were used to derive the percentage of soil covered by green vegetation the photographs were taken at a height of 1 m above the ground with the camera pointing downward and placed at the end of a horizontal 1 m long metallic arm mounted on a tripod with this layout a ground area of 1 4 m by 1 05 m was captured by the camera the pictures were taken weekly on sunny days from 10 00 to 12 00 h always maintaining the same camera orientation on all the plots karcher and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2001 the digital analysis of the images was carried out by means of the imagej software rueden et al 2017 the software was used to segment the image into two pixel classes green vegetation and the rest of the situations bare ground or dry vegetation the resulting black and white binary image was used to derive the percentage of green coverage existing in each plot 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses of the data were performed with the statistical package statgraphics statgraphics centurion xv the treatment effects on turfgrass quality traits were analyzed through analysis of variance anova duncan s multiple range test was used for means separation 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content due to the poor water holding capacity of the sandy soil one week after irrigation withholding volumetric soil moisture content dropped to wilting point values 0 03 0 04 m3 m 3 in all the treatments over both experimental years fig 3 when recovery irrigation was initiated progressively in the four irrigation treatments soil moisture content increased up to values that normally ranged within the interval 0 10 0 15 m3 m 3 in all the treatments over both years of study no significant differences in soil moisture content were observed between treatments once irrigation was resumed in all of them fig 3 3 2 turfgrass quality overall turfgrass quality otq and ndvi figs 4 and 5 show the evolution of otq and ndvi values from the beginning of the deliberately imposed drought period early june until early mid october two weeks after irrigation withholding otq did not exceed 1 in any of the treatments and ndvi averaged 0 18 0 19 in both experimental years once recovery irrigation began all treatments showed an increase in otq values although this did not occur at the same rate in all the treatments in 2016 t1 and t2 showed otq values close to 5 at the end of the recovery period with no significant differences being observed between them on the other hand t3 and t4 reached otq values close to 3 and 2 respectively without significant differences being observed between them the corresponding ndvi values observed at the end of the 2016 experimental period were 0 44 0 46 0 40 and 0 30 for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively with significant differences being observed only between t4 and the rest of treatments in 2017 the treatments showed a similar pattern to that observed in 2016 however the otq values observed at the end of the period of study in 2017 were lower than those found in 2016 t1 and t2 showed mean values between 3 and4 while t4 showed values close to 1 75 that differed significantly from the rest of the treatments the ndvi response did not match that observed in otq since the ndvi values obtained at the end of the study period in 2017 were slightly higher than in 2016 with mean values of 0 52 0 48 0 43 and 0 38 in t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively significant differences were only observed between t4 and the rest of the treatments 3 3 fraction of green vegetation cover the evolution of the fraction of ground covered by green turfgrass i e green coverage gc is shown in fig 6 only the gc data determined by digital image analysis dia are shown due to the great similarity observed in the results obtained between the dia and grid determination methods all the treatments showed 0 of gc two weeks after the onset of the drought period during the recovery irrigation period gc increased in all treatments in the two years of study although at different rates in none of the experimental years did t4 attain the gc values observed in t1 t2 and t3 at the end of the recovery irrigation period although these treatments presented some differences in their mean values at the end of the recovery period they were not statistically significant one month after resuming irrigation in each of the treatments the fraction of ground covered by green turfgrass was in 2016 similar in t1 and t3 21 24 slightly higher in t2 32 and much lower in t4 6 table 2 in 2017 no significant differences were observed between the treatments the maximum gc values reached during the recovery period were around 63 69 in t1 and t2 in both years of study 48 56 in t3 and 28 33 in t4 table 2 an important indicator of turf recovery capacity after a severe drought period is the number of days after resuming irrigation needed to reach 50 of gc steinke et al 2011 in our study t1 and t2 were able to attain this threshold value in both years of study although t2 reached it 25 and 12 days earlier than t1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 2 on the contrary t3 was able to attain this threshold value only in 2016 74 days after resuming irrigation whereas t4 never reached it in either of the experimental years 3 4 comparison between visual and sensor based methods several methodologies have been employed in order to compare different ways to assess turf quality gc and otq were determined by both visual methods and by using digital image analysis dia and proximal sensing greenseeker sensor respectively fig 7 shows the relation between the gc values obtained by the grid and dia methods the gc values were very similar in both of them during all the study a bigger difference was observed between otq visual values and ndvi obtained with the proximal sensor fig 8 in this case there was dissimilar behavior between both years of the study as a better correlation was obtained in 2016 compared to 2017 r2 values of 0 85 and 0 79 respectively 4 discussion turfgrass drought resistance is markedly influenced by the species and cultivar grown as shown by sun kim and beard 2018 who compared eleven warm season species subjected to a continued water stress for 48 and 57 days in two consecutive summers in their case study tifway bermudagrass showed the poorest recovery capacity although its performance slightly improved over the second summer drought due to some rainfall which occurred during the mid stress period in addition to plant material there are several other variables that also have an influence on the recovery capacity of turfgrass such as climate conditions soil characteristics or the duration of the drought periods carrow 1996 since tifway bermudagrass is a traditional standard for golf and other sports and residential grasses in warm regions we intended to evaluate its recovery capacity to four periods of summer drought deliberately imposed by withholding irrigation under shallow sandy soil the results showed that for summer droughts lasting less than five weeks tifway bermudagrass had an acceptable recovery in terms of the required time to reach at least 50 of gc longer drought periods resulted in poor turfgrass development either not reaching 50 of gc in autumn or doing so with low quality standards the treatment subjected to 5 weeks t2 of summer drought exhibited faster recovery 55 and 75 days after resuming irrigation in order to reach 50 of gc in 2016 and 2017 respectively than t1 3 weeks of drought which required about 80 and 87 days in 2016 and 2017 respectively to reach 50 of gc the difference was significant in the first year but no sound explanation was found for that for the same cultivar steinke et al 2011 reported a much faster recovery 50 of gc was reached in 10 and 13 2 days in two consecutive years after a 60 d drought period although it is important to point out that their soil was an unrestricted native soil the turfgrass otq values observed during the recovery periods did not exceed the value of 6 in any of the experimental years which is the minimum generally considered to be acceptable for the practice of golf schiavon et al 2014 steinke et al 2011 the reason for the low visual quality may be due to the poor soil conditions shallow sandy soil with low organic matter content and sub optimal fertilization these results meet however the objectives of the golf course nursery managers who are not so much focused on the visual quality of the turf as its recovery capacity after drought to be replanted in the areas of the golf course that require it once placed in a deeper soil with more favorable conditions its quality will reach higher quality standards other researchers also found the soil depth to be a main determinant of the recovery capacity of turfgrass to drought for instance steinke et al 2011 reported that all bermudagrass cultivars tested planted in a soil with unrestricted depth survived a 60 d drought while none of them did when they were grown on a shallow soil 0 01 m of depth in addition to soil depth soil texture is also a determining factor of the recovery capacity after drought severmutlu et al 2011 compared the recovery of several bermudagrass cultivars tifway was not included in their study subjected to a 90 d drought period when grown in a different type of soil silty clay loam vs sandy soil for a silty clay loam soil bermudagrass cultivars reached 50 of gc on average 12 d after resuming irrigation while it took 60 d for those grown in a sandy soil also the turfgrass cultivated in silty clay loam soil showed 45 d after resuming irrigation otq values between 5 9 and 8 while for the same cultivars in a sandy soil the values ranged between 3 3 and 5 hejl et al 2016 characterized tifway bermudagrass fairway response to a period with different irrigation strategies including no irrigation in their work the unirrigated treatment also showed substantial recovery after resuming full irrigation in the first year of the study attaining a visual turf quality of 5 5 and 85 of gc by late fall yet in the second year only 30 of gc was observed without acceptable quality levels so they suggested a possible carryover effect of water stress in our study different plots were selected for each year of study so we cannot draw conclusions about the cumulative effects of water stress nevertheless in a recent study carried out in the same area monje jiménez et al 2019 it has been observed that the application of summer drought periods for successive years did not result in losses of bermuda recovery capacity to drought once irrigation was resumed it is important to note that the methodology used to assess the turfgrass quality can also influence the results obtained in the evaluation of the recovery from drought in our study linear correlations between the ndvi index obtained by proximal sensing and visual ratings otq have been observed r2 value of 0 76 bell et al 2009 also found a positive correlation between these values especially in bermudagrass average value of r2 0 64 when using the otq indicator there is a certain degree of subjectivity given that it relies on the expertise of the person making the evaluation of the turf quality hence if there are different evaluators or the conditions change e g light intensity the consistency of the resulting grading can be affected the use of active optical sensors such as the greenseeker that actively generates light and measures the reflected light in the red and near infrared wavebands to give a measure of ndvi can provide a solution to these drawbacks and offer advantages such as reducing the time for data collection notwithstanding a global assessment including all variables defining turf quality i e texture density and color routinely characterized by human evaluations cannot be exclusively provided by means of a sensor bell et al 2009 which means that both methods can be treated as complimentary in a similar approach when comparing the gc values obtained with the grid much more complex subjective and requiring more effort in terms of personnel and dia the correlation was even higher r2 0 99 in this case using dia over the data obtained by the personnel with a grid has only advantages if the images are taken under the same prevailing conditions i e from the same position and angle similar lighting and camera 5 conclusions the duration of drought was found to be determinant for the recovery of the tifway bermudagrass periods longer than 5 weeks resulted in failure to recover at least 50 of gc in autumn under the conditions of this study i e shallow sandy soil and low maintenance conditions the results obtained in this work demonstrate the great resistance to drought of tifway bermudagrass which in 10 cm of sandy soil and a single application of fertilizer in spring is able to recover acceptable quality levels after 5 weeks of severe summer drought acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the spanish association

1997 steinke et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 part of the evaluation of the response of bermudagrass to drought conditions involves the capacity of recovering an adequate green coverage and turf quality after a period with no water inputs a hybrid between cynodon dactylon l pers with an aggressive growth and cynodon transvaalensis burtt davy of fine texture was created in order to obtain a not so fast growing turf with an appreciated texture for golf courses hanna et al 2013 in south spain it is now one of those preferred for fairways and tees priego de montiano et al 2006 the purpose of this work was to evaluate the behavior of the tifway cynodon dactylon l pers cynodon transvaalensis burtt davy bermudagrass during the recovery from four periods of induced summer drought of different durations 3 5 8 and 10 weeks since other limiting factors besides water are often found for turf growing in arid and semiarid regions such as the depth of the rooting layer the type of soil or the amount of fertilizer applied the study has been carried out under other limiting conditions such as a 10 cm layer of sandy soil and low maintenance i e sub optimal fertilization as a secondary objective different methodologies to assess turfgrass quality visual assessment digital image analysis and proximal sensing were employed and compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site and climatic data the experiment was carried out during the period from the end of may to early november of 2016 and 2017 in an area dedicated to a turf nursery for the fairways of the golf course of the royal golf club of seville 37 20 54 1 n 5 55 23 9 w about 6 km outside the city of seville andalusia sw spain the climate of the study area is included in the phytoclimatic subregion iv2 subtropical genuine mediterranean allué andrade 1990 characterized by warm and dry summers and moderate temperature fluctuations during the year rainfall events normally occur from late september to may table 1 shows the climatic data recorded during both years of the experiment at a nearby weather station 37º27 24 n 05º 55 29 w elevation 37 m daily mean temperature t av varied within the range 11 3 c december to 28 2 c august and 8 3 c january to 26 8 c august in 2016 and 2017 respectively the corresponding relative humidity values rh av showed an annual average of 69 5 and 63 6 in 2016 and 2017 respectively monthly mean values of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 were within the range 1 2 6 5 mm d 1 in 2016 and 1 4 6 9 mm d 1 in 2017 annual rainfall was 678 8 mm in 2016 and 265 5 mm in 2017 the turf was established at the end of may 2011 using tifway bermudagrass sod collected from the golf course s fairways the nursery was irrigated by means of sprinklers arranged in a triangular pattern and separated 16 18 m from each other the water was supplied from a nearby wastewater treatment plant showing a ph of 7 9 and an ec of 0 6 ds m 1 the average application rate was 10 mm h 1 with a uniformity coefficient measured before the beginning of the experiment over 80 the irrigation system was controlled by means of a computerized control system nimbus ii rain bird azusa california ten rain gauges tfa 47 1013 tfa dostmann gmbh co kg zum ottersberg 12 97877 wertheim reicholzheim germany were placed across the experimental plots to determine the inflows of water by both sprinkler irrigation and rain fertilization was carried out in the golf course nursery following the usual sub optimal management practices through a single annual application of 30 g m 2 6 3 g n m² in april with a mineral fertilizer that includes 21 ammonium sulphate soil samples were taken at 0 5 m depth before the start of the study and revealed the existence of an artificial soil profile of 0 2 m above the native soil the rooting layer 0 1 m thick was formed by 90 95 of sand 5 83 of silt and 3 22 of clay with a content of organic matter of 1 46 total contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 0 0206 0 359 and 0 0126 respectively under the rooting layer there was another one of highly compacted coarse sand 0 1 m thick with 77 13 of coarse sand 18 13 of silt and 4 74 of clay with a ph of 9 43 the lowest layer corresponded to the native soil consisting of 68 04 of sand 22 55 of silt and 9 41 of clay the root depth reached an average of 0 1 m in the samples taken at the beginning of the experiment in each experimental plot no roots were observed in the compacted 0 1 m thick soil layer a soil permeability value of 25 mm h 1 was measured with a double ring infiltrometer astm standard d3385 09 from january to the beginning of the drought period the plots were monthly mowed at a height of 16 mm during the recovery period the plots were mowed only once on september 15th 2016 whereas no mowing was performed during this period in 2017 at the end of the recovery period a plant height of 45 50 mm was observed in both years 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments two experimental plots 6 9 m wide and 8 9 m long were used to conduct the study one for each experimental year 2016 2017 the area was isolated enough from the rest of the nursery to avoid any irrigation interference it was divided into sixteen 1 5 m2 1 m 1 5 m plots 0 3 m apart from each other and surrounded by a perimeter border 1 m wide the drought period began on may 29th and june 5th in 2016 and 2017 respectively four treatments were defined which differed in the durations of the drought periods these being three t1 five t2 eight t3 and eleven 2016 ten 2017 t4 weeks of irrigation withholding in t4 the drought period was reduced by one week in the second year of experimentation 2017 due to poor turf recovery results observed in 2016 a statistical design of completely randomized blocks with four blocks and one repetition per block was performed fig 1 in all the treatments irrigation was completely withheld at the beginning of june after the drought period a recovery irrigation period was applied in which 100 of standard turfgrass water requirements etc were supplied during this period irrigation was manually applied every other day until one week after irrigation began in the t4 treatment when sprinkler irrigation was daily applied to all the treatments the turfgrass water requirements etc for the recovery period were calculated using the crop coefficient kc method allen et al 1998 a kc of 0 6 was considered in this study a value that has been frequently recommended for warm season turf species meyer and gibeault 1987 including tifway bermudagrass garrot and mancino 1994 hejl et al 2016 fig 2 shows the accumulated water depths irrigation plus rain applied to all the irrigation treatments during the two experimental periods in both these periods the accumulated etc from the beginning of the drought period to the end of the study period was close to 500 mm the volumes of water received by the irrigation treatments during the same period of time were notably higher in 2016 due to the higher precipitations that took place in 2016 in any case rain did not play a significant role in the turf s response to drought and subsequent recovery because rain mainly occurred at the end of the recovery period in both years of study 2 3 soil water measurements soil water content was monitored by time domain reflectometry topp and davis 1985 using a tdr300 probe fieldscout spectrum technologies inc aurora illinois usa equipped with two 12 cm long rods the measurements were performed weekly in all experimental plots n 16 three soil moisture readings were taken at each plot on each measurement day which were averaged to obtain a representative soil moisture measurement of the entire plot 2 4 turfgrass quality assessment the turfgrass quality was weekly evaluated in all the experimental plots during the drought and recovery periods in both experimental years all the measurements were performed during the same day in each week the overall turfgrass quality otq was determined by the evaluation system developed by the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep this is a visual evaluation system morris and shearman 1998 based on a rating scale of 1 poor to 9 ideal turf quality that accounts for both the turfgrass aesthetics i e color density uniformity texture and functional use turgeon 1991 since the visual assessment of the turf is somewhat subjective bell et al 2002 the turfgrass quality was also evaluated with an optical handheld sensor greenseekertm trimble sunnyvale california that measures the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndvi can be considered as a means for an indirect assessment of otq bell et al 2009 in this experiment ndvi measurements were taken at noon from 11 00 to 12 00 h for the estimation of the green coverage i e the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation attained in each of the plots two different methods were used in one of them a 1 m by 1 m frame divided with strings into a 10 cm 10 cm grid was employed on each measurement day the frame was placed in a fixed position in the plot set to a reference point for each square of the grid a value between 0 no cover and 1 the whole area green was given according to the area of dry coverage green coverage or bare soil perceived in it the percentage of soil covered by green vegetation was then calculated as the sum of all the values obtained in the grid as described by baseggio et al 2015 and elzinga et al 1998 green coverage was also measured with a digital image analysis dia method goldsby et al 2015 in this case jpeg images 3648 2736 resolution taken under no flash conditions with a sony dsc tx5 digital camera 35 mm focal length shutter speed 1 400 were used to derive the percentage of soil covered by green vegetation the photographs were taken at a height of 1 m above the ground with the camera pointing downward and placed at the end of a horizontal 1 m long metallic arm mounted on a tripod with this layout a ground area of 1 4 m by 1 05 m was captured by the camera the pictures were taken weekly on sunny days from 10 00 to 12 00 h always maintaining the same camera orientation on all the plots karcher and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2001 the digital analysis of the images was carried out by means of the imagej software rueden et al 2017 the software was used to segment the image into two pixel classes green vegetation and the rest of the situations bare ground or dry vegetation the resulting black and white binary image was used to derive the percentage of green coverage existing in each plot 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses of the data were performed with the statistical package statgraphics statgraphics centurion xv the treatment effects on turfgrass quality traits were analyzed through analysis of variance anova duncan s multiple range test was used for means separation 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content due to the poor water holding capacity of the sandy soil one week after irrigation withholding volumetric soil moisture content dropped to wilting point values 0 03 0 04 m3 m 3 in all the treatments over both experimental years fig 3 when recovery irrigation was initiated progressively in the four irrigation treatments soil moisture content increased up to values that normally ranged within the interval 0 10 0 15 m3 m 3 in all the treatments over both years of study no significant differences in soil moisture content were observed between treatments once irrigation was resumed in all of them fig 3 3 2 turfgrass quality overall turfgrass quality otq and ndvi figs 4 and 5 show the evolution of otq and ndvi values from the beginning of the deliberately imposed drought period early june until early mid october two weeks after irrigation withholding otq did not exceed 1 in any of the treatments and ndvi averaged 0 18 0 19 in both experimental years once recovery irrigation began all treatments showed an increase in otq values although this did not occur at the same rate in all the treatments in 2016 t1 and t2 showed otq values close to 5 at the end of the recovery period with no significant differences being observed between them on the other hand t3 and t4 reached otq values close to 3 and 2 respectively without significant differences being observed between them the corresponding ndvi values observed at the end of the 2016 experimental period were 0 44 0 46 0 40 and 0 30 for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively with significant differences being observed only between t4 and the rest of treatments in 2017 the treatments showed a similar pattern to that observed in 2016 however the otq values observed at the end of the period of study in 2017 were lower than those found in 2016 t1 and t2 showed mean values between 3 and4 while t4 showed values close to 1 75 that differed significantly from the rest of the treatments the ndvi response did not match that observed in otq since the ndvi values obtained at the end of the study period in 2017 were slightly higher than in 2016 with mean values of 0 52 0 48 0 43 and 0 38 in t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively significant differences were only observed between t4 and the rest of the treatments 3 3 fraction of green vegetation cover the evolution of the fraction of ground covered by green turfgrass i e green coverage gc is shown in fig 6 only the gc data determined by digital image analysis dia are shown due to the great similarity observed in the results obtained between the dia and grid determination methods all the treatments showed 0 of gc two weeks after the onset of the drought period during the recovery irrigation period gc increased in all treatments in the two years of study although at different rates in none of the experimental years did t4 attain the gc values observed in t1 t2 and t3 at the end of the recovery irrigation period although these treatments presented some differences in their mean values at the end of the recovery period they were not statistically significant one month after resuming irrigation in each of the treatments the fraction of ground covered by green turfgrass was in 2016 similar in t1 and t3 21 24 slightly higher in t2 32 and much lower in t4 6 table 2 in 2017 no significant differences were observed between the treatments the maximum gc values reached during the recovery period were around 63 69 in t1 and t2 in both years of study 48 56 in t3 and 28 33 in t4 table 2 an important indicator of turf recovery capacity after a severe drought period is the number of days after resuming irrigation needed to reach 50 of gc steinke et al 2011 in our study t1 and t2 were able to attain this threshold value in both years of study although t2 reached it 25 and 12 days earlier than t1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 2 on the contrary t3 was able to attain this threshold value only in 2016 74 days after resuming irrigation whereas t4 never reached it in either of the experimental years 3 4 comparison between visual and sensor based methods several methodologies have been employed in order to compare different ways to assess turf quality gc and otq were determined by both visual methods and by using digital image analysis dia and proximal sensing greenseeker sensor respectively fig 7 shows the relation between the gc values obtained by the grid and dia methods the gc values were very similar in both of them during all the study a bigger difference was observed between otq visual values and ndvi obtained with the proximal sensor fig 8 in this case there was dissimilar behavior between both years of the study as a better correlation was obtained in 2016 compared to 2017 r2 values of 0 85 and 0 79 respectively 4 discussion turfgrass drought resistance is markedly influenced by the species and cultivar grown as shown by sun kim and beard 2018 who compared eleven warm season species subjected to a continued water stress for 48 and 57 days in two consecutive summers in their case study tifway bermudagrass showed the poorest recovery capacity although its performance slightly improved over the second summer drought due to some rainfall which occurred during the mid stress period in addition to plant material there are several other variables that also have an influence on the recovery capacity of turfgrass such as climate conditions soil characteristics or the duration of the drought periods carrow 1996 since tifway bermudagrass is a traditional standard for golf and other sports and residential grasses in warm regions we intended to evaluate its recovery capacity to four periods of summer drought deliberately imposed by withholding irrigation under shallow sandy soil the results showed that for summer droughts lasting less than five weeks tifway bermudagrass had an acceptable recovery in terms of the required time to reach at least 50 of gc longer drought periods resulted in poor turfgrass development either not reaching 50 of gc in autumn or doing so with low quality standards the treatment subjected to 5 weeks t2 of summer drought exhibited faster recovery 55 and 75 days after resuming irrigation in order to reach 50 of gc in 2016 and 2017 respectively than t1 3 weeks of drought which required about 80 and 87 days in 2016 and 2017 respectively to reach 50 of gc the difference was significant in the first year but no sound explanation was found for that for the same cultivar steinke et al 2011 reported a much faster recovery 50 of gc was reached in 10 and 13 2 days in two consecutive years after a 60 d drought period although it is important to point out that their soil was an unrestricted native soil the turfgrass otq values observed during the recovery periods did not exceed the value of 6 in any of the experimental years which is the minimum generally considered to be acceptable for the practice of golf schiavon et al 2014 steinke et al 2011 the reason for the low visual quality may be due to the poor soil conditions shallow sandy soil with low organic matter content and sub optimal fertilization these results meet however the objectives of the golf course nursery managers who are not so much focused on the visual quality of the turf as its recovery capacity after drought to be replanted in the areas of the golf course that require it once placed in a deeper soil with more favorable conditions its quality will reach higher quality standards other researchers also found the soil depth to be a main determinant of the recovery capacity of turfgrass to drought for instance steinke et al 2011 reported that all bermudagrass cultivars tested planted in a soil with unrestricted depth survived a 60 d drought while none of them did when they were grown on a shallow soil 0 01 m of depth in addition to soil depth soil texture is also a determining factor of the recovery capacity after drought severmutlu et al 2011 compared the recovery of several bermudagrass cultivars tifway was not included in their study subjected to a 90 d drought period when grown in a different type of soil silty clay loam vs sandy soil for a silty clay loam soil bermudagrass cultivars reached 50 of gc on average 12 d after resuming irrigation while it took 60 d for those grown in a sandy soil also the turfgrass cultivated in silty clay loam soil showed 45 d after resuming irrigation otq values between 5 9 and 8 while for the same cultivars in a sandy soil the values ranged between 3 3 and 5 hejl et al 2016 characterized tifway bermudagrass fairway response to a period with different irrigation strategies including no irrigation in their work the unirrigated treatment also showed substantial recovery after resuming full irrigation in the first year of the study attaining a visual turf quality of 5 5 and 85 of gc by late fall yet in the second year only 30 of gc was observed without acceptable quality levels so they suggested a possible carryover effect of water stress in our study different plots were selected for each year of study so we cannot draw conclusions about the cumulative effects of water stress nevertheless in a recent study carried out in the same area monje jiménez et al 2019 it has been observed that the application of summer drought periods for successive years did not result in losses of bermuda recovery capacity to drought once irrigation was resumed it is important to note that the methodology used to assess the turfgrass quality can also influence the results obtained in the evaluation of the recovery from drought in our study linear correlations between the ndvi index obtained by proximal sensing and visual ratings otq have been observed r2 value of 0 76 bell et al 2009 also found a positive correlation between these values especially in bermudagrass average value of r2 0 64 when using the otq indicator there is a certain degree of subjectivity given that it relies on the expertise of the person making the evaluation of the turf quality hence if there are different evaluators or the conditions change e g light intensity the consistency of the resulting grading can be affected the use of active optical sensors such as the greenseeker that actively generates light and measures the reflected light in the red and near infrared wavebands to give a measure of ndvi can provide a solution to these drawbacks and offer advantages such as reducing the time for data collection notwithstanding a global assessment including all variables defining turf quality i e texture density and color routinely characterized by human evaluations cannot be exclusively provided by means of a sensor bell et al 2009 which means that both methods can be treated as complimentary in a similar approach when comparing the gc values obtained with the grid much more complex subjective and requiring more effort in terms of personnel and dia the correlation was even higher r2 0 99 in this case using dia over the data obtained by the personnel with a grid has only advantages if the images are taken under the same prevailing conditions i e from the same position and angle similar lighting and camera 5 conclusions the duration of drought was found to be determinant for the recovery of the tifway bermudagrass periods longer than 5 weeks resulted in failure to recover at least 50 of gc in autumn under the conditions of this study i e shallow sandy soil and low maintenance conditions the results obtained in this work demonstrate the great resistance to drought of tifway bermudagrass which in 10 cm of sandy soil and a single application of fertilizer in spring is able to recover acceptable quality levels after 5 weeks of severe summer drought acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the spanish association of greenkeepers and the royal golf federation of andalusia for funding the research project prj201602875 performance assessment and recovery of different grass species after a period of water shortage

10903,in order to reduce irrigation water withdrawal the european commission provides grants to farmers for investments in irrigation techniques that save water however little is known about the real extent of water savings at plot scale resulting from change in irrigation application equipment or the adoption of scheduling devices in a given agro pedo climatic context the aim of this study was to evaluate irrigation water savings achievable by switching from sprinkler to localized irrigation system or by using soil hydric status probes for this purpose we used the french metropolitan context for our case study and compiled all available studies conducted over the past 30 years a total of 93 records were collected from experimental field trials representative of a wide range of pedo climatic conditions 25 different sites and crops field crops fruit and vegetable production each record represents the water consumption of two different irrigation systems sprinkler system vs localized system or two scheduling systems without soil probe vs with soil probe at plot scale and is used to assess the water saving made when comparing the most water consuming system to the least consuming one results show that water savings are highly variable ranging from 0 to more than 75 of the initial consumption they originate in both irrigation technology and management their key features are the following 1 water savings made with localized systems when compared to sprinkler irrigation significantly decrease when the hydric deficit of the cropping season increases and when soil water holding capacity rises moreover they tend to be higher when irrigation is managed with soil probes 2 water savings obtained with irrigation scheduling using soil probes when compared to scheduling without probes seem on the contrary not to be influenced by hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity the type of soil probe tensiometric or capacitive used has no influence on the water savings obtained 3 water savings achieved with either localized systems or soil probes result in increased irrigation water productivity and are only marginally influenced by crop type this frame of reference for irrigation water savings can guide public policies encouraging and financially supporting the implementation of water saving systems not only on the subject of irrigation devices but also on irrigation scheduling tools keywords drip microsprinkler irrigation scheduling climatic hydric deficit soil water holding capacity irrigation water productivity 1 introduction agriculture is a sector often criticized for its excessive water consumption indeed agriculture is responsible for approximately 70 of total freshwater withdrawal in the world mostly through irrigation fao 2015 this water abstraction rate is highly variable among countries as it is estimated at 24 for the whole european union european environment agency 2009 73 for portugal 61 for spain and 12 for france gleick 2014 as water scarcity intensifies in most countries due to climate change water savings are of increasing concern and european water resource policy targets sustainable water management and water savings for this purpose it supports investments in efficient irrigation equipment via the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd in this context an investment in an improvement to an existing irrigation installation or element of irrigation infrastructure shall be eligible only if it is assessed ex ante as offering potential water savings of a minimum of between 5 and 25 according to the technical parameters of the existing installation or infrastructure european union 2013 article 46 point 4 water savings can be achieved through proper design and management of the irrigation system by optimizing water allocation over crop cycle and reducing irrigation water losses whose definition and estimation vary among approaches seckler et al 2003 jensen 2007 perry 2007 lankford 2012 van halsema and vincent 2012 the first approach linked with the concept of classical irrigation efficiency focuses on the ratio of water beneficially used by the crop evapotranspiration to the water delivered or the ratio of yield to water delivered the second one called the neoclassical approach takes into account the part of delivered water potentially available for downstream reutilization the classical approach is appropriate at plot scale and considers that water leaving the plot is lost hsiao 2007 the neoclassical one is relevant for water resource management at the basin scale as it values the reuse of return flow which is useful for the monitoring of water table levels richter et al 2017 however in this case one must take into account that the quality of reused water may be lower than the quality of the first use water in the above mentioned european regulatory context water savings are basically considered at plot or farm scale in keeping with the classical efficiency approach in this case irrigation water losses include direct evaporation and wind drift during sprinkler irrigation interception and storage by the crop canopy run off and drainage related to excessive or non uniform application soil evaporation weed transpiration and residual soil water after harvest for a comprehensive review see hsiao et al 2007 there are several types of levers used to save water by limiting irrigation water losses bio intelligence service 2012 jensen et al 2014 including soil and crop management no till farming mulching weeds management as well as the improvement of irrigation technology efficient irrigation application and management scheduling deficit irrigation irrigation upgrades at the technology level can be achieved by adding some devices to an existing system for instance a variable rate irrigation system vri can be adapted to center pivots zhao et al 2017 report 14 water savings with vri when compared to uniform rate irrigation on maize ghinassi and pezzola 2014 describe a controller used to manage sprinkler rotation speeds the use of which allows up to 15 water savings another way to take advantage of technology is to adopt systems that are more efficient i e by switching from flood or sprinkler irrigation to localized irrigation surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler all localized systems are likely to eliminate drift and direct evaporation normally occurring during sprinkler irrigation they also reduce run off and drainage as they lessen the amounts of water applied typically near yet below soil saturation allow better control of these amounts and deliver lower rates hopefully lower than soil saturated hydraulic conductivity drip irrigation also eliminates interception by the canopy subsurface drip irrigation drastically reduces soil evaporation bonachela et al 2001 lastly increasing the uniformity of the spatial distribution of irrigation also contributes to greater efficiency and water loss reductions except in specific conditions noticeable slopes uneven soil depths or types where it is better to deliver different doses to different parts of the plots therefore in the general case localized irrigation systems allow water savings only if satisfactory uniformity is achieved here are some commonly adopted averaged values of efficiency at plot scale over a cropping season taking into account direct evaporation drift canopy interception run off and drainage losses but not soil evaporation 65 55 75 for hose reel machines 75 60 85 for solid sets 80 75 90 for traditional center pivots 85 70 95 for microsprinklers and surface drip systems and 90 75 95 for subsurface drip systems howell 2003 more specifically in controlled experimental conditions carrión et al 2014 estimated efficiency of solid set irrigation to range between 77 79 and 78 82 for sprinklers spacing of 18 m 18 m and 15 m 15 m respectively higher efficiency is linked to a higher christiansen s uniformity coefficient cuc observed with 15 m 15 m spacings in the case of subsurface drip irrigation systems under plastic tunnels lozano et al 2016 observed that efficiency can reach 81 under real field conditions for surface drip irrigation benouniche et al 2014 observed very high variability in field efficiency ranging from 25 to 97 depending on farmer practices in morocco comparing the efficiency of sprinkler and surface drip systems ghinassi 2012 estimated efficiency to range from 63 to 88 for hose reel machines and from 31 to 81 for drip setups low drip efficiency values far below those usually observed were attributed to inappropriate management however when dealing with technology upgrading it must be kept in mind that localized irrigation systems require investment and maintenance costs that can be dissuasive for farmers especially for field crops improvements that can be made in irrigation management include irrigation timing daytime vs nighttime molle et al 2012 cavero et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation geerts and raes 2009 and irrigation scheduling the latter consists in adjusting irrigation frequency and quantities based on an irrigation strategy optimized with models evett and tolk 2009 li et al 2018 malik et al 2019 among many others or on climatic conditions and measured plant or soil water status jones 2004 the most commonly used sensors to monitor soil water status are capacitive probes evett et al 2012 and tensiometric probes bianchi et al 2017 soil probes are used to schedule irrigation according to actual soil water status thus avoiding over irrigation and in turn reducing run off drainage and residual soil water after harvest although it is recognized that improvement of irrigation technology and management is likely to generate water savings in practice little is known about the extent of water savings that can be really expected at plot scale the aim of this study was to evaluate irrigation water savings achievable by switching from sprinkler to localized irrigation system or by using soil hydric status probes for this purpose we used the french metropolitan i e excluding overseas french territories context as a case study and compiled all available studies conducted in france we chose to focus on water savings achieved through the change in the irrigation equipment used or the adoption of soil probes for irrigation scheduling we analysed how these water savings are influenced by factors related to the agro pedo climatic context or the irrigation equipment irrigation or scheduling systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compiled all available studies conducted on the french metropolitan territory in the past 30 years which enabled us to compare water consumption either between two different irrigation systems sprinkler or localized system or between two different scheduling modes without and with soil probes but always within the same context same year same soil same crop all these studies are based on experimental field trials carried out by chambers of agriculture technical institutes research institutes experimental stations or regional water management organizations they were conducted either in experimental stations or by farmers supervised by an irrigation technical advisor the data reported in these studies are most often produced following protocols written or validated by inra national institute for agronomical research or other public research institutes the results are most often unpublished or found in grey literature reports because their publication is not among the missions of experimental farms or technical institutes it can even be against their interest in some cases and publication policies are most of the times difficult to manage within consortium agreements when the experimental farms are used within the frame of public private scientific projects the data originate from 25 different locations mainly from french regions with the greatest irrigated surface areas fig 1 and refer to field crops fruit and vegetable production a total of 93 records of irrigation water consumption at plot scale was collected 70 records detail the comparison of two irrigation systems a sprinkler system reel machine moving lateral center pivot or solid set and a localized system surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler 23 records compare the water consumption of two scheduling modes without and with soil probes each record is used to assess the water saving achieved between the highest water consuming system and the lowest water consuming one we selected only data describing water savings achieved without significant yield or quality loss a yield reduction of up to 10 was tolerated as it is considered as the maximum yield loss economically acceptable by a farmer 2 2 database creation each record contains general data concerning the agro pedo climatic context specific

reel machine lateral move center pivot or solid set system and is called sprinkler in the following passages for simplicity sake irrigation system 2 is a localized irrigation system either based on surface drip sd subsurface drip ssd or microsprinkler ms setups two scheduling systems associated with the same irrigation system are compared as well the first one is based on either traditional farmer practices weekly irrigation recommendation bulletins or maximal evapotranspiration met evaluations and does not use any scheduling device the second one employs soil sensors tensiometric or capacitive probes to adjust the irrigation dose to soil moisture content for each irrigation or scheduling system the total amount of irrigation water applied during the cropping season with system 1 irr1 and system 2 irr2 are recorded together with the associated yields y1 and y2 for the comparison of irrigation systems 1 and 2 the mean irrigation dose applied throughout one irrigation event during the cropping season with the sprinkler system d1 is also given more information on the methodology used in all 25 experimental sites is given in the supplementary file linked with this article 2 2 3 calculated variables four calculated variables are used in the analysis starting with the hydric deficit 1 hd eto p where hd unitless is the hydric deficit of the cropping season eto mm the cumulated potential evapotranspiration and p mm the cumulated precipitation during the cropping season hd values above 1 represent situations characterized by effective hydric deficit for crops and thus requiring irrigation hd values equal or below 1 would generally not require irrigation and are therefore not considered in this study hd calculation during the cropping season is based solely on climate factors it does not include the initial water stock of the soil at the beginning of the season as this parameter is unknown in almost all cases described in this study thus hd should be considered as an indicator of climatic drought but not of irrigation requirement if it took into account the initial water stock of the soil as an input in addition to precipitations hd would be lower in years characterized by a very rainy winter with a high initial stock for the comparison of water consumption levels without and with the use of a soil probes hd was calculated only for open field conditions excluding plastic tunnel experiments water saving is evaluated as 2 ws irr1 irr2 irr1 100 where ws is the water saving obtained when using system 2 vs system 1 or when using a soil sensor vs no soil sensor and irr1 mm and irr2 mm the total amounts of irrigation water applied during the cropping season with system 1 and 2 respectively we distinguish between the water savings obtained when comparing two irrigation systems ws is and those obtained when comparing two soil probes ws sp finally we need quantities tracking irrigation water productivity 3 iwp1 y1 irr1 10 4 iwp2 y2 irr2 10 where iwp1 kg m 3 and iwp2 kg m 3 are the irrigation water productivity levels associated with the y1 ton ha 1 and y2 ton ha 1 yields and the irr1 mm and irr2 mm total irrigation amounts applied during the cropping season with systems 1 and 2 respectively to assess irrigation water productivity iwp we chose the yield irrigation amount indicator pereira et al 2012 another potential indicator describing more precisely the supplemental yield obtained thanks to irrigation could have been used yield of irrigated crop yield of non irrigated crop irrigation amount however we do not possess any experimental data on the yield of the non irrigated crop as this treatment has not been performed in most experiments when productivity increases 1 m3 irrigation water applied with a localized system gives an equivalent or higher yield than 1 m3 applied with a sprinkler system 2 3 data statistical analysis to assess the influence of the different factors involved in water saving several multifactor analyses ancova were performed the dependant variable was water saving ws is or ws sp the quantitative factors considered were hydric deficit hd soil water holding capacity whc the qualitative factors assessed were crop irrigation system soil probe when a factor was found to have a significant effect on ws the fisher test lsd at a level of significance of 0 05 was carried out mean irrigation dose applied with sprinkler system d1 was not included as a quantitative factor in the ancova as this data was missing in too many records 48 complete records on a total of 70 all statistical tests were performed using xlstat software addinsoft 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 water savings with irrigation systems ws is 3 1 1 amounts of irrigation water applied and water savings ws is fig 2 presents raw data that indicate the amounts of irrigation water applied with sprinkler systems irr1 and with localized system irr2 during the cropping season under the same agro pedo climatic conditions and the same scheduling mode for corn irr1 ranges from 88 to 331 mm the reduction obtained with localized systems ranges from 0 to 90 mm tobacco has the same range of irr1 as corn 141 338 mm but the magnitude of reduction with localized systems is higher 83 216 mm in orchards irr1 for apple trees varies between 120 and 396 mm localized systems allow a reduction ranging between 29 and 185 mm peach trees show a higher irr1 664 733 mm than apple trees but the reduction obtained with localized irrigation is lower 5 71 mm note that sprinkler irrigation above the trees is still in use in france today although it is progressively replaced by localized systems despite the fact that drip irrigation may be the best system to irrigate fruits growers tend to maintain sprinkler irrigation as it is also used for protection against frost for vegetable production irr1 ranges from 269 to 458 mm and is lowered only by 0 to 78 mm with localized irrigation all points in fig 2 are located under the 1 1 diagonal it is thus obvious that localized irrigation systems microsprinkler surface and subsurface drip can to a greater or lesser extent help reduce the amount of water applied during the cropping season compared to sprinkler systems spray gun center pivot solid set as this article is focused on the reduction of irrigation water amounts resulting from the use of localized irrigation systems the analysis will most often provide water savings ws is expressed in of irr1 and leave to one side the total irrigation amounts water savings between two irrigations systems ws is that were observed using surface drip sd subsurface drip ssd or microsprinkler ms compared to a sprinkler irrigation system ranges from 0 to 77 which evidences high variability ancova performed on the ws is variable table 2 a shows that 65 of the ws is variability can be attributed to the following four factors hydric deficit hd p 0 001 scheduling mode p 0 001 localized irrigation system p 0 05 crop type p 0 05 hd appears to be by far the most influential factor followed by the scheduling mode as illustrated in fig 3 the mean irrigation doses applied at each irrigation event with sprinkler systems vary between 18 and 41 mm for hose reel machine 15 and 32 mm for center pivot or lateral move 8 and 50 mm for solid set water savings ws is show an upward trend when sprinkler irrigation dose increases values of ws is above 40 are observed with sprinkler doses higher than 25 mm hose reel or solid set the water savings between two irrigations systems ws is are firstly explained by the more efficient application of localized systems that very likely reduce irrigation water losses occurring with sprinkler irrigation resulting from drift in windy conditions direct evaporation canopy interception and soil evaporation secondly systems allow the highest water savings when sprinkler systems are used with high application doses this suggests that in these cases sprinkler irrigation doses may not be optimal and losses resulting from run off or drainage may occur localized systems then allow a more accurate matching between the applied dose and the water holding capacity of the soil thirdly the use of rainwater with localized systems is more efficient as irrigation calendar is far less flexible for sprinkler than for localized systems considering that the interval between sprinkler irrigations varies between 3 and 10 days management constraints to share equipment or pumping station between several plots and that the weather forecast is much less accurate beyond 3 4 days rainfall can occur between two sprinkler irrigations thus leading to irrigation water waste fourthly although both irrigation systems compared in this study are used with the same scheduling mode sprinkler irrigation can be based on a looser management strategy whereas localized irrigation requires closer monitoring of soil water reserves so that the scheduling may be more accurate with localized systems finally the results reveal that localized systems may allow effective water savings which are due to both technology higher application efficiency and management better scheduling accuracy it is difficult to distinguish these two origins and we will globally consider both in this study 3 1 2 influence of hydric deficit on ws is ws is tends to decrease when hydric deficit increases fig 4 it was fitted with exponential curves in order to evidence trends but without analyzing statistical significance taking all localized systems sd ssd or ms into account the mean distance from the exponential curve reaches ws is of 18 14 and 9 for field crops fruits and vegetables respectively it appears that for a hydric deficit value exceeding 4 5 ws is always approaches 0 regardless of the irrigation system or the crop type in dry years the water amounts applied with sprinkler irr1 and localized systems irr2 are both necessarily higher than in wet years a decrease in water savings is observed when hydric deficit intensifies field operators have also observed this dependence of water savings on hydric deficit this happens when irr1 increases less in comparison to irr2 or when irr2 increases more than irr1 in the first case irr1 increases less in comparison to irr2 this phenomenon can be explained by the reduction in drainage occurring during sprinkler irrigation when the latter is not adequately scheduled in wet years rainwater can partly fill the soil water reserve so that a portion of the irrigation amounts applied with sprinkler systems can be lost through deep percolation or by storage in the profile at the end of the growing season unlike with localized systems where small amounts of water are applied daily in dry years all the irrigation water contributes to the soil water reserve replenishment so that no loss occurs and irr1 can be lowered in the second case irr2 increases more than irr1 this can be attributed to poor application uniformity which can occur with localized irrigation especially drip systems it can be partially smoothed by rainfall in wet years li 2018 in dry years however more water irr2 has to be applied to compensate soil water content heterogeneity and the potential water saving is thus reduced unless different doses can be delivered to different parts of the plot from data collected in this study it would appear that water saving cannot be made when hydric deficit exceeds 4 5 lamm 2005 also reported that water savings made for a corn crop during a seven year field experiment were dependent on weather conditions ssd allowed a 4 water saving compared to lepa low energy precision application sprinkler irrigation in normal years but this water saving was not observed in extreme dry years when on the contrary water consumption was 4 higher with ssd than with sprinkler irrigation it should be kept in mind that the data presented here were obtained from studies conducted under controlled experimental conditions under realistic farm conditions additional factors related to the farmers irrigation practices would probably reinforce this phenomenon rather than weaken it in dry conditions with sprinkler irrigation even if water should be applied more often to compensate hydric deficit the farmer may not be able to intensify his water cycles because of the technical configuration of his irrigation scheme or simply due to issues related to the availability of his irrigation equipment used on several plots during a dry period with sprinkler irrigation farmers often do not apply the entire required water amount in order to conserve water and to safeguard part of the water supply for the end of the cropping season both situations could also lead to reduced water saving because irr1 would increase relatively less than irr2 furthermore in times of drought farmers using drip irrigation admit that they tend to leave the valves open longer to totally refill the soil water reserve as they may not be able to refill it again during the next irrigation event in this case reductions in water savings would be due to a relatively higher rise in irr2 compared to irr1 3 1 3 influence of scheduling mode on ws is in addition to hydric deficit ws is would also seem to be greatly influenced by the scheduling mode as shown in fig 5 a the mean values of ws is are 17 6 and 33 7 with scheduling based on water balance alone or on soil probes plus possibly water balance respectively as described in the material and method section when both systems are compared all other factors are equal same crop same year and same soil as far as possible we have only compared systems managed with the same scheduling method either based on water balance taking into account precipitations crop evapotranspiration and soil water holding capacity or on soil water status measurement using capacitive or tensiometric probes possibly complementary to water balance however even within the same scheduling mode several factors are likely to influence water consumption when the irrigation system changes such as the run time for mobile raingun irrigators probe location and depth in the field and trigger threshold the data collected in this study suggest that localized systems when compared to sprinkler systems allow the greatest water savings in situations where irrigation is managed with soil probes this is probably because soil probes provide information that is closer to the real soil water status than that obtained with water balance therefore soil probes allow a greater reduction in the water amount applied especially with localized systems 3 1 4 influence of crop type and localized irrigation system on ws is the crop type and the localized irrigation system used have a much smaller impact on ws is than hydric deficit and the scheduling mode according to table 2a the highest ws is values fig 5b are obtained with ms and sd 45 7 and 34 5 respectively and not significantly different at 5 the lowest ws is is observed with ssd 21 6 higher ws is value with ms than sd and ssd is probably due to specific rooting system development the volume of soil explored by roots is restricted around drippers sd and ssd less limited under ms that makes possible the valorization of a larger volume of soil when hd is low lowest ws is value with ssd is rather unexpected because ssd in addition to evaporation and drift also reduces soil evaporation losses results found in the literature most often describe reduced water consumption with ssd when compared with sd camp et al 2000 evett et al 2000 karasahin 2014 one explanation could be the application heterogeneity associated with ssd originating from insufficient pressure or emitter clogging this leads to plot areas with irrigation deficit that cannot be seen directly but the effect of which can be indirectly observed on the crop to compensate for this deficit irrigation duration is sometimes extended and over irrigation may occur thus reducing the water savings potentially achievable with ssd regarding the effect of crop type fig 5c fruit production shows the highest water saving values followed by field crops and vegetable production 40 0 26 1 and 7 9 respectively 3 1 5 influence of soil water holding capacity on ws is the influence of whc on ws is is studied in the case of corn because this crop presents the highest soil whc variability 50 225 mm among the collected data the analysis of variance table 2b indicates that 68 of the ws is variability for corn is due to hydric deficit and the soil whc p 0 001 fig 6 shows that ws is decrease when whc increases the highest ws is 20 70 are observed in soils with low whc less than 100 mm it should again be noted that for each whc value studied ws is is lower in dry years high hd as stated above section 3 1 1 with sprinkler irrigation deep percolation mostly occurs in soils with low whc when the irrigation dose d1 is higher than the soil storage capacity localized irrigation reduces doses thus limiting percolation losses and allows water savings localized irrigation is therefore better suited than sprinkler irrigation to soils with low whc and this phenomenon is amplified when gun sprinklers are associated to long run times 3 1 6 irrigation water productivity and irrigation systems iwp scores are presented in fig 7 only 5 situations out of the 70 situations studied show a reduction in productivity between the localized system iwp2 and the sprinkler system iwp1 this reduction never exceeds 20 and mainly concerns ssd on field crops this seemingly atypical result relates to situations where a slight yield reduction 10 was observed between sprinkler and localized irrigation this could be attributed either to water stress induced by insufficient irrigation amounts or to causes with observed ssd but not directly linked to irrigation such as bad fertilizer dissolution on soil surface or soil crusting penalizing maize emergence some yield decreases with ssd compared to sprinkler irrigation are also found in literature e g for corn albasha et al 2015 or onions al jamal et al 2001 in all other cases iwp2 is similar or higher than iwp1 this increase in iwp evolves in the same way as ws is table 3 from ssd to sd and ms average iwp increase of 33 71 and 118 respectively and from vegetables to field crops and fruits average iwp increase of 16 50 and 81 respectively yields obtained with localized systems are equivalent to those obtained with sprinkler systems in some cases they are even greater partly due to the reduction in deep percolation and fertilizer losses resulting in better fertilizer performance therefore the reduction in irrigation volumes accounts for the increase in productivity observed depending on the localized irrigation system or the crop type this increase in productivity follows the same trend as the related water savings fig 5 although differences between drip systems and between crops are not significant table 3 in a review compiling numerous american studies lamm 2016 established a comparison between ssd and sprinkler systems for cotton tomato and corn he observed enhanced productivity with ssd compared to sprinkler irrigation which was attributed to reduced water losses as well as increased yield in egypt abd el wahed and ali 2013 concluded that the use of sd allowed higher corn productivity when compared to sprinkler irrigation in europe a similar iwp increase was also reported for corn with sd couto et al 2013 or ssd albasha et al 2015 in our results irrigation water productivity tends to be higher with sd than with ssd although not significantly in literature productivity values obtained with ssd are rather greater than with sd for instance for sugar beet hassanli et al 2010 or corn hassanli et al 2009 however some decreases in water productivity with ssd compared to sd can be found e g for potatoes onder et al 2005 3 2 water savings with soil probes ws sp 3 2 1 amounts of irrigation water applied and water savings ws sp fig 8 shows the amounts of water for irrigation managed without irr1 and with irr2 the use of soil probes for field crops irr1 varies between 114 and 294 mm the reduction when using soil probes varies between 20 and 102 mm in fruit production irr1 is greater 219 to 429 mm but the reduction observed with soil probes is lower 33 to 66 mm for vegetable production irr1 ranges from 34 to 196 mm and the reduction ranges from 7 to 135 mm in all cases water amounts are lower when irrigation is managed with soil probes indeed these devices allow real time decisions that complement scheduling strategies where changes to irrigation dates and doses can be made according to the actual soil water status this results in a reduction in over irrigation and thus in losses due to run off deep percolation and residual soil water after harvesting soil probes may also help to optimize rainfall use as irrigation can be started later in the season and stopped earlier in sprinkler irrigation the first and sometimes also the last irrigation of the season can be cancelled which leads to consistent water saving as previously stated we will hereafter focus on water savings resulting from the use of soil probes ws sp expressed in of irrigation amounts observed without soil probes observed values of ws sp are highly variable according to the situation and range from 7 8 to 75 9 in the cases where ws sp values are very high one may assume that irrigation scheduling without soil probes was incorrect maybe due to a non accurate calculation method of irrigation requirement maximum evapotranspiration usually obtained from eto and crop coefficient kc 3 2 2 influence of hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity on ws sp data collected to assess ws sp are from experiments conducted either in open fields or under plastic tunnels as hydric deficit hd takes precipitations into account only data from open field experiments i e 13 records were considered to explore the influence of hd on ws sp ws sp varies between 8 and 68 fig 9 and shows a slight tendency to increase when hd increases although this trend is not statistically significant p 0 05 data not shown it cannot be concluded that hydric deficit has a significant effect on ws sp no data for hd 4 5 could be collected the analysis of variance table 2c encompasses all collected data open field and plastic tunnel experiment hydric deficit due to its observed non significant effect was not included as a factor and 62 of the variability of ws sp can be attributed to whc probe type irrigation system and crop type however only the irrigation system and the crop type contribute significantly p 0 05 to the ws sp values contrary to ws is ws sp is not dependent on pedo climatic conditions hd and whc as hd and whc have no significant effect on ws sp as scheduling with soil probes is based not on the total precipitation amounts since the beginning of the cropping season but on their real effect on soil water status water tension or moisture content it is understandable that ws sp do not depend on the hydric deficit of the year however more data would be necessary to confirm this trend and further experiments are needed to check if soil probes are likely to allow ws in extreme dry years hd 4 5 likewise the information provided by soil probes is basically independent from whc it can be possibly computed ex post with whc to calculate the irrigation amount to be applied therefore ws sp does not depend on whc either 3 2 3 influence of soil probe type on ws sp as shown in the analysis of variance table 2c there is no significant difference between water savings originating from the use of tensiometric probes and those obtained with capacitive probes 31 0 and 36 6 respectively fig 10 a therefore it appears that to achieve water savings the key factor is to schedule irrigation regardless of the type of probe however it should be noted that both kinds of probes cannot be used indifferently in all types of soils for example tensiometers are not suitable in very stony or crack prone soils and the use of capacitive probes may be problematic in heavy clay soils 3 2 4 influence of crop type and irrigation system on ws sp the average water saving is 25 5 when using soil probes in a ssd or a sprinkler system it is significantly higher 41 5 in a sd system fig 10b water savings decrease from vegetable production 41 5 to field crops 29 3 and fruit production 20 9 fig 10c the data presented in this study are in agreement with those found in the literature on corn irrigated with sd in italy ghinassi et al 2003 show that scheduling with tensiometers resulted in water saving of 30 compared to scheduling based on advisory services in greece irrigation amounts can be reduced by 12 5 on sorghum with scheduling when using capacitive probes papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 3 2 5 irrigation water productivity and scheduling with soil probes iwp is logically always higher for irrigation scheduling using soil probes than for irrigation scheduling without soil probes fig 11 the greatest increases in productivity up to 80 are observed in sd systems for vegetable production again this gain in productivity is directly linked to water saving observed with the use of soil probes reported increases in productivity are 39 with tensiometers on corn ghinassi et al 2003 and 10 with capacitive probes on sorghum papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 4 conclusion this study compiled all available field studies conducted on the french metropolitan territory over the past 30 years concerning water savings achieved with localized systems surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler compared with sprinkler systems reel machine lateral move center pivot or solid set system as well as with scheduling based on soil probes compared with traditional water balance management our work shows that localized irrigation systems as well as soil probes are very effective solutions that can be used to save water at plot scale and thus increase irrigation water productivity however it is not reasonable to generalize values on water savings as they are highly variable and may depend on several factors hydric deficit of the cropping season soil water holding capacity scheduling mode and other factors not taken into account in the present work the main conclusions of this study are the following 1 water savings obtained with localized systems ws is severely decrease when hydric deficit increases and when soil water holding capacity rises they tend to be higher when the localized system and the sprinkler system in question are managed with soil probes 2 water savings obtained with the use of soil probes ws sp seem on the contrary independent of hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity the type of soil probe tensiometric or capacitive has no influence on the obtained water savings 3 water savings achieved with either localized systems or soil probes result in increased irrigation water productivity and are very marginally influenced by the crop type this study deals with observed values of obtained water savings they may help to evaluate water savings potentially attainable when changing the irrigation system e g from sprinkler to localized irrigation or adopting soil probes for irrigation scheduling they may also help public authorities to assess potential reduction of water withdrawal for irrigation at the regional or basin scale moreover they may provide basic guidelines to funding institutions and regulatory bodies to direct subsidies towards the most relevant equipment in terms of water saving potential a crucial observation is that water savings obtained with localized irrigation systems are highly dependent on pedo climatic conditions most significant in moderate hydric deficit conditions whereas those obtained with soil probes are not to promote water savings it seems advisable along with investments in water saving equipment to encourage the use of irrigation scheduling tools that rely on soil water data obtained from soil probes finally it is important to remember that water savings at plot level do not necessarily imply long term water savings at the territory scale grafton et al 2018 the adoption of more efficient irrigation equipment often leads to increased water withdrawal due to changes in crop choices and crop rotation patterns or to the extension of irrigated area this is the so called rebound effect pfeiffer and lin 2014 berbel et al 2015 to achieve reductions in water extractions improvements in irrigation efficiency has to be simultaneously linked with measures that decrease the quantity of water that farmers are allowed to extract funding this work was supported by the french ministry of agriculture declaration of competing interest none appendix a

supplementary data to this article 
10903,in order to reduce irrigation water withdrawal the european commission provides grants to farmers for investments in irrigation techniques that save water however little is known about the real extent of water savings at plot scale resulting from change in irrigation application equipment or the adoption of scheduling devices in a given agro pedo climatic context the aim of this study was to evaluate irrigation water savings achievable by switching from sprinkler to localized irrigation system or by using soil hydric status probes for this purpose we used the french metropolitan context for our case study and compiled all available studies conducted over the past 30 years a total of 93 records were collected from experimental field trials representative of a wide range of pedo climatic conditions 25 different sites and crops field crops fruit and vegetable production each record represents the water consumption of two different irrigation systems sprinkler system vs localized system or two scheduling systems without soil probe vs with soil probe at plot scale and is used to assess the water saving made when comparing the most water consuming system to the least consuming one results show that water savings are highly variable ranging from 0 to more than 75 of the initial consumption they originate in both irrigation technology and management their key features are the following 1 water savings made with localized systems when compared to sprinkler irrigation significantly decrease when the hydric deficit of the cropping season increases and when soil water holding capacity rises moreover they tend to be higher when irrigation is managed with soil probes 2 water savings obtained with irrigation scheduling using soil probes when compared to scheduling without probes seem on the contrary not to be influenced by hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity the type of soil probe tensiometric or capacitive used has no influence on the water savings obtained 3 water savings achieved with either localized systems or soil probes result in increased irrigation water productivity and are only marginally influenced by crop type this frame of reference for irrigation water savings can guide public policies encouraging and financially supporting the implementation of water saving systems not only on the subject of irrigation devices but also on irrigation scheduling tools keywords drip microsprinkler irrigation scheduling climatic hydric deficit soil water holding capacity irrigation water productivity 1 introduction agriculture is a sector often criticized for its excessive water consumption indeed agriculture is responsible for approximately 70 of total freshwater withdrawal in the world mostly through irrigation fao 2015 this water abstraction rate is highly variable among countries as it is estimated at 24 for the whole european union european environment agency 2009 73 for portugal 61 for spain and 12 for france gleick 2014 as water scarcity intensifies in most countries due to climate change water savings are of increasing concern and european water resource policy targets sustainable water management and water savings for this purpose it supports investments in efficient irrigation equipment via the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd in this context an investment in an improvement to an existing irrigation installation or element of irrigation infrastructure shall be eligible only if it is assessed ex ante as offering potential water savings of a minimum of between 5 and 25 according to the technical parameters of the existing installation or infrastructure european union 2013 article 46 point 4 water savings can be achieved through proper design and management of the irrigation system by optimizing water allocation over crop cycle and reducing irrigation water losses whose definition and estimation vary among approaches seckler et al 2003 jensen 2007 perry 2007 lankford 2012 van halsema and vincent 2012 the first approach linked with the concept of classical irrigation efficiency focuses on the ratio of water beneficially used by the crop evapotranspiration to the water delivered or the ratio of yield to water delivered the second one called the neoclassical approach takes into account the part of delivered water potentially available for downstream reutilization the classical approach is appropriate at plot scale and considers that water leaving the plot is lost hsiao 2007 the neoclassical one is relevant for water resource management at the basin scale as it values the reuse of return flow which is useful for the monitoring of water table levels richter et al 2017 however in this case one must take into account that the quality of reused water may be lower than the quality of the first use water in the above mentioned european regulatory context water savings are basically considered at plot or farm scale in keeping with the classical efficiency approach in this case irrigation water losses include direct evaporation and wind drift during sprinkler irrigation interception and storage by the crop canopy run off and drainage related to excessive or non uniform application soil evaporation weed transpiration and residual soil water after harvest for a comprehensive review see hsiao et al 2007 there are several types of levers used to save water by limiting irrigation water losses bio intelligence service 2012 jensen et al 2014 including soil and crop management no till farming mulching weeds management as well as the improvement of irrigation technology efficient irrigation application and management scheduling deficit irrigation irrigation upgrades at the technology level can be achieved by adding some devices to an existing system for instance a variable rate irrigation system vri can be adapted to center pivots zhao et al 2017 report 14 water savings with vri when compared to uniform rate irrigation on maize ghinassi and pezzola 2014 describe a controller used to manage sprinkler rotation speeds the use of which allows up to 15 water savings another way to take advantage of technology is to adopt systems that are more efficient i e by switching from flood or sprinkler irrigation to localized irrigation surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler all localized systems are likely to eliminate drift and direct evaporation normally occurring during sprinkler irrigation they also reduce run off and drainage as they lessen the amounts of water applied typically near yet below soil saturation allow better control of these amounts and deliver lower rates hopefully lower than soil saturated hydraulic conductivity drip irrigation also eliminates interception by the canopy subsurface drip irrigation drastically reduces soil evaporation bonachela et al 2001 lastly increasing the uniformity of the spatial distribution of irrigation also contributes to greater efficiency and water loss reductions except in specific conditions noticeable slopes uneven soil depths or types where it is better to deliver different doses to different parts of the plots therefore in the general case localized irrigation systems allow water savings only if satisfactory uniformity is achieved here are some commonly adopted averaged values of efficiency at plot scale over a cropping season taking into account direct evaporation drift canopy interception run off and drainage losses but not soil evaporation 65 55 75 for hose reel machines 75 60 85 for solid sets 80 75 90 for traditional center pivots 85 70 95 for microsprinklers and surface drip systems and 90 75 95 for subsurface drip systems howell 2003 more specifically in controlled experimental conditions carrión et al 2014 estimated efficiency of solid set irrigation to range between 77 79 and 78 82 for sprinklers spacing of 18 m 18 m and 15 m 15 m respectively higher efficiency is linked to a higher christiansen s uniformity coefficient cuc observed with 15 m 15 m spacings in the case of subsurface drip irrigation systems under plastic tunnels lozano et al 2016 observed that efficiency can reach 81 under real field conditions for surface drip irrigation benouniche et al 2014 observed very high variability in field efficiency ranging from 25 to 97 depending on farmer practices in morocco comparing the efficiency of sprinkler and surface drip systems ghinassi 2012 estimated efficiency to range from 63 to 88 for hose reel machines and from 31 to 81 for drip setups low drip efficiency values far below those usually observed were attributed to inappropriate management however when dealing with technology upgrading it must be kept in mind that localized irrigation systems require investment and maintenance costs that can be dissuasive for farmers especially for field crops improvements that can be made in irrigation management include irrigation timing daytime vs nighttime molle et al 2012 cavero et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation geerts and raes 2009 and irrigation scheduling the latter consists in adjusting irrigation frequency and quantities based on an irrigation strategy optimized with models evett and tolk 2009 li et al 2018 malik et al 2019 among many others or on climatic conditions and measured plant or soil water status jones 2004 the most commonly used sensors to monitor soil water status are capacitive probes evett et al 2012 and tensiometric probes bianchi et al 2017 soil probes are used to schedule irrigation according to actual soil water status thus avoiding over irrigation and in turn reducing run off drainage and residual soil water after harvest although it is recognized that improvement of irrigation technology and management is likely to generate water savings in practice little is known about the extent of water savings that can be really expected at plot scale the aim of this study was to evaluate irrigation water savings achievable by switching from sprinkler to localized irrigation system or by using soil hydric status probes for this purpose we used the french metropolitan i e excluding overseas french territories context as a case study and compiled all available studies conducted in france we chose to focus on water savings achieved through the change in the irrigation equipment used or the adoption of soil probes for irrigation scheduling we analysed how these water savings are influenced by factors related to the agro pedo climatic context or the irrigation equipment irrigation or scheduling systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compiled all available studies conducted on the french metropolitan territory in the past 30 years which enabled us to compare water consumption either between two different irrigation systems sprinkler or localized system or between two different scheduling modes without and with soil probes but always within the same context same year same soil same crop all these studies are based on experimental field trials carried out by chambers of agriculture technical institutes research institutes experimental stations or regional water management organizations they were conducted either in experimental stations or by farmers supervised by an irrigation technical advisor the data reported in these studies are most often produced following protocols written or validated by inra national institute for agronomical research or other public research institutes the results are most often unpublished or found in grey literature reports because their publication is not among the missions of experimental farms or technical institutes it can even be against their interest in some cases and publication policies are most of the times difficult to manage within consortium agreements when the experimental farms are used within the frame of public private scientific projects the data originate from 25 different locations mainly from french regions with the greatest irrigated surface areas fig 1 and refer to field crops fruit and vegetable production a total of 93 records of irrigation water consumption at plot scale was collected 70 records detail the comparison of two irrigation systems a sprinkler system reel machine moving lateral center pivot or solid set and a localized system surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler 23 records compare the water consumption of two scheduling modes without and with soil probes each record is used to assess the water saving achieved between the highest water consuming system and the lowest water consuming one we selected only data describing water savings achieved without significant yield or quality loss a yield reduction of up to 10 was tolerated as it is considered as the maximum yield loss economically acceptable by a farmer 2 2 database creation each record contains general data concerning the agro pedo climatic context specific

irrigation situations irrigation systems 1 and 2 are compared system 1 being the most water consumptive and system 2 the least consumptive in all cases irrigation system 1 is a sprinkler system hose reel machine lateral move center pivot or solid set system and is called sprinkler in the following passages for simplicity sake irrigation system 2 is a localized irrigation system either based on surface drip sd subsurface drip ssd or microsprinkler ms setups two scheduling systems associated with the same irrigation system are compared as well the first one is based on either traditional farmer practices weekly irrigation recommendation bulletins or maximal evapotranspiration met evaluations and does not use any scheduling device the second one employs soil sensors tensiometric or capacitive probes to adjust the irrigation dose to soil moisture content for each irrigation or scheduling system the total amount of irrigation water applied during the cropping season with system 1 irr1 and system 2 irr2 are recorded together with the associated yields y1 and y2 for the comparison of irrigation systems 1 and 2 the mean irrigation dose applied throughout one irrigation event during the cropping season with the sprinkler system d1 is also given more information on the methodology used in all 25 experimental sites is given in the supplementary file linked with this article 2 2 3 calculated variables four calculated variables are used in the analysis starting with the hydric deficit 1 hd eto p where hd unitless is the hydric deficit of the cropping season eto mm the cumulated potential evapotranspiration and p mm the cumulated precipitation during the cropping season hd values above 1 represent situations characterized by effective hydric deficit for crops and thus requiring irrigation hd values equal or below 1 would generally not require irrigation and are therefore not considered in this study hd calculation during the cropping season is based solely on climate factors it does not include the initial water stock of the soil at the beginning of the season as this parameter is unknown in almost all cases described in this study thus hd should be considered as an indicator of climatic drought but not of irrigation requirement if it took into account the initial water stock of the soil as an input in addition to precipitations hd would be lower in years characterized by a very rainy winter with a high initial stock for the comparison of water consumption levels without and with the use of a soil probes hd was calculated only for open field conditions excluding plastic tunnel experiments water saving is evaluated as 2 ws irr1 irr2 irr1 100 where ws is the water saving obtained when using system 2 vs system 1 or when using a soil sensor vs no soil sensor and irr1 mm and irr2 mm the total amounts of irrigation water applied during the cropping season with system 1 and 2 respectively we distinguish between the water savings obtained when comparing two irrigation systems ws is and those obtained when comparing two soil probes ws sp finally we need quantities tracking irrigation water productivity 3 iwp1 y1 irr1 10 4 iwp2 y2 irr2 10 where iwp1 kg m 3 and iwp2 kg m 3 are the irrigation water productivity levels associated with the y1 ton ha 1 and y2 ton ha 1 yields and the irr1 mm and irr2 mm total irrigation amounts applied during the cropping season with systems 1 and 2 respectively to assess irrigation water productivity iwp we chose the yield irrigation amount indicator pereira et al 2012 another potential indicator describing more precisely the supplemental yield obtained thanks to irrigation could have been used yield of irrigated crop yield of non irrigated crop irrigation amount however we do not possess any experimental data on the yield of the non irrigated crop as this treatment has not been performed in most experiments when productivity increases 1 m3 irrigation water applied with a localized system gives an equivalent or higher yield than 1 m3 applied with a sprinkler system 2 3 data statistical analysis to assess the influence of the different factors involved in water saving several multifactor analyses ancova were performed the dependant variable was water saving ws is or ws sp the quantitative factors considered were hydric deficit hd soil water holding capacity whc the qualitative factors assessed were crop irrigation system soil probe when a factor was found to have a significant effect on ws the fisher test lsd at a level of significance of 0 05 was carried out mean irrigation dose applied with sprinkler system d1 was not included as a quantitative factor in the ancova as this data was missing in too many records 48 complete records on a total of 70 all statistical tests were performed using xlstat software addinsoft 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 water savings with irrigation systems ws is 3 1 1 amounts of irrigation water applied and water savings ws is fig 2 presents raw data that indicate the amounts of irrigation water applied with sprinkler systems irr1 and with localized system irr2 during the cropping season under the same agro pedo climatic conditions and the same scheduling mode for corn irr1 ranges from 88 to 331 mm the reduction obtained with localized systems ranges from 0 to 90 mm tobacco has the same range of irr1 as corn 141 338 mm but the magnitude of reduction with localized systems is higher 83 216 mm in orchards irr1 for apple trees varies between 120 and 396 mm localized systems allow a reduction ranging between 29 and 185 mm peach trees show a higher irr1 664 733 mm than apple trees but the reduction obtained with localized irrigation is lower 5 71 mm note that sprinkler irrigation above the trees is still in use in france today although it is progressively replaced by localized systems despite the fact that drip irrigation may be the best system to irrigate fruits growers tend to maintain sprinkler irrigation as it is also used for protection against frost for vegetable production irr1 ranges from 269 to 458 mm and is lowered only by 0 to 78 mm with localized irrigation all points in fig 2 are located under the 1 1 diagonal it is thus obvious that localized irrigation systems microsprinkler surface and subsurface drip can to a greater or lesser extent help reduce the amount of water applied during the cropping season compared to sprinkler systems spray gun center pivot solid set as this article is focused on the reduction of irrigation water amounts resulting from the use of localized irrigation systems the analysis will most often provide water savings ws is expressed in of irr1 and leave to one side the total irrigation amounts water savings between two irrigations systems ws is that were observed using surface drip sd subsurface drip ssd or microsprinkler ms compared to a sprinkler irrigation system ranges from 0 to 77 which evidences high variability ancova performed on the ws is variable table 2 a shows that 65 of the ws is variability can be attributed to the following four factors hydric deficit hd p 0 001 scheduling mode p 0 001 localized irrigation system p 0 05 crop type p 0 05 hd appears to be by far the most influential factor followed by the scheduling mode as illustrated in fig 3 the mean irrigation doses applied at each irrigation event with sprinkler systems vary between 18 and 41 mm for hose reel machine 15 and 32 mm for center pivot or lateral move 8 and 50 mm for solid set water savings ws is show an upward trend when sprinkler irrigation dose increases values of ws is above 40 are observed with sprinkler doses higher than 25 mm hose reel or solid set the water savings between two irrigations systems ws is are firstly explained by the more efficient application of localized systems that very likely reduce irrigation water losses occurring with sprinkler irrigation resulting from drift in windy conditions direct evaporation canopy interception and soil evaporation secondly systems allow the highest water savings when sprinkler systems are used with high application doses this suggests that in these cases sprinkler irrigation doses may not be optimal and losses resulting from run off or drainage may occur localized systems then allow a more accurate matching between the applied dose and the water holding capacity of the soil thirdly the use of rainwater with localized systems is more efficient as irrigation calendar is far less flexible for sprinkler than for localized systems considering that the interval between sprinkler irrigations varies between 3 and 10 days management constraints to share equipment or pumping station between several plots and that the weather forecast is much less accurate beyond 3 4 days rainfall can occur between two sprinkler irrigations thus leading to irrigation water waste fourthly although both irrigation systems compared in this study are used with the same scheduling mode sprinkler irrigation can be based on a looser management strategy whereas localized irrigation requires closer monitoring of soil water reserves so that the scheduling may be more accurate with localized systems finally the results reveal that localized systems may allow effective water savings which are due to both technology higher application efficiency and management better scheduling accuracy it is difficult to distinguish these two origins and we will globally consider both in this study 3 1 2 influence of hydric deficit on ws is ws is tends to decrease when hydric deficit increases fig 4 it was fitted with exponential curves in order to evidence trends but without analyzing statistical significance taking all localized systems sd ssd or ms into account the mean distance from the exponential curve reaches ws is of 18 14 and 9 for field crops fruits and vegetables respectively it appears that for a hydric deficit value exceeding 4 5 ws is always approaches 0 regardless of the irrigation system or the crop type in dry years the water amounts applied with sprinkler irr1 and localized systems irr2 are both necessarily higher than in wet years a decrease in water savings is observed when hydric deficit intensifies field operators have also observed this dependence of water savings on hydric deficit this happens when irr1 increases less in comparison to irr2 or when irr2 increases more than irr1 in the first case irr1 increases less in comparison to irr2 this phenomenon can be explained by the reduction in drainage occurring during sprinkler irrigation when the latter is not adequately scheduled in wet years rainwater can partly fill the soil water reserve so that a portion of the irrigation amounts applied with sprinkler systems can be lost through deep percolation or by storage in the profile at the end of the growing season unlike with localized systems where small amounts of water are applied daily in dry years all the irrigation water contributes to the soil water reserve replenishment so that no loss occurs and irr1 can be lowered in the second case irr2 increases more than irr1 this can be attributed to poor application uniformity which can occur with localized irrigation especially drip systems it can be partially smoothed by rainfall in wet years li 2018 in dry years however more water irr2 has to be applied to compensate soil water content heterogeneity and the potential water saving is thus reduced unless different doses can be delivered to different parts of the plot from data collected in this study it would appear that water saving cannot be made when hydric deficit exceeds 4 5 lamm 2005 also reported that water savings made for a corn crop during a seven year field experiment were dependent on weather conditions ssd allowed a 4 water saving compared to lepa low energy precision application sprinkler irrigation in normal years but this water saving was not observed in extreme dry years when on the contrary water consumption was 4 higher with ssd than with sprinkler irrigation it should be kept in mind that the data presented here were obtained from studies conducted under controlled experimental conditions under realistic farm conditions additional factors related to the farmers irrigation practices would probably reinforce this phenomenon rather than weaken it in dry conditions with sprinkler irrigation even if water should be applied more often to compensate hydric deficit the farmer may not be able to intensify his water cycles because of the technical configuration of his irrigation scheme or simply due to issues related to the availability of his irrigation equipment used on several plots during a dry period with sprinkler irrigation farmers often do not apply the entire required water amount in order to conserve water and to safeguard part of the water supply for the end of the cropping season both situations could also lead to reduced water saving because irr1 would increase relatively less than irr2 furthermore in times of drought farmers using drip irrigation admit that they tend to leave the valves open longer to totally refill the soil water reserve as they may not be able to refill it again during the next irrigation event in this case reductions in water savings would be due to a relatively higher rise in irr2 compared to irr1 3 1 3 influence of scheduling mode on ws is in addition to hydric deficit ws is would also seem to be greatly influenced by the scheduling mode as shown in fig 5 a the mean values of ws is are 17 6 and 33 7 with scheduling based on water balance alone or on soil probes plus possibly water balance respectively as described in the material and method section when both systems are compared all other factors are equal same crop same year and same soil as far as possible we have only compared systems managed with the same scheduling method either based on water balance taking into account precipitations crop evapotranspiration and soil water holding capacity or on soil water status measurement using capacitive or tensiometric probes possibly complementary to water balance however even within the same scheduling mode several factors are likely to influence water consumption when the irrigation system changes such as the run time for mobile raingun irrigators probe location and depth in the field and trigger threshold the data collected in this study suggest that localized systems when compared to sprinkler systems allow the greatest water savings in situations where irrigation is managed with soil probes this is probably because soil probes provide information that is closer to the real soil water status than that obtained with water balance therefore soil probes allow a greater reduction in the water amount applied especially with localized systems 3 1 4 influence of crop type and localized irrigation system on ws is the crop type and the localized irrigation system used have a much smaller impact on ws is than hydric deficit and the scheduling mode according to table 2a the highest ws is values fig 5b are obtained with ms and sd 45 7 and 34 5 respectively and not significantly different at 5 the lowest ws is is observed with ssd 21 6 higher ws is value with ms than sd and ssd is probably due to specific rooting system development the volume of soil explored by roots is restricted around drippers sd and ssd less limited under ms that makes possible the valorization of a larger volume of soil when hd is low lowest ws is value with ssd is rather unexpected because ssd in addition to evaporation and drift also reduces soil evaporation losses results found in the literature most often describe reduced water consumption with ssd when compared with sd camp et al 2000 evett et al 2000 karasahin 2014 one explanation could be the application heterogeneity associated with ssd originating from insufficient pressure or emitter clogging this leads to plot areas with irrigation deficit that cannot be seen directly but the effect of which can be indirectly observed on the crop to compensate for this deficit irrigation duration is sometimes extended and over irrigation may occur thus reducing the water savings potentially achievable with ssd regarding the effect of crop type fig 5c fruit production shows the highest water saving values followed by field crops and vegetable production 40 0 26 1 and 7 9 respectively 3 1 5 influence of soil water holding capacity on ws is the influence of whc on ws is is studied in the case of corn because this crop presents the highest soil whc variability 50 225 mm among the collected data the analysis of variance table 2b indicates that 68 of the ws is variability for corn is due to hydric deficit and the soil whc p 0 001 fig 6 shows that ws is decrease when whc increases the highest ws is 20 70 are observed in soils with low whc less than 100 mm it should again be noted that for each whc value studied ws is is lower in dry years high hd as stated above section 3 1 1 with sprinkler irrigation deep percolation mostly occurs in soils with low whc when the irrigation dose d1 is higher than the soil storage capacity localized irrigation reduces doses thus limiting percolation losses and allows water savings localized irrigation is therefore better suited than sprinkler irrigation to soils with low whc and this phenomenon is amplified when gun sprinklers are associated to long run times 3 1 6 irrigation water productivity and irrigation systems iwp scores are presented in fig 7 only 5 situations out of the 70 situations studied show a reduction in productivity between the localized system iwp2 and the sprinkler system iwp1 this reduction never exceeds 20 and mainly concerns ssd on field crops this seemingly atypical result relates to situations where a slight yield reduction 10 was observed between sprinkler and localized irrigation this could be attributed either to water stress induced by insufficient irrigation amounts or to causes with observed ssd but not directly linked to irrigation such as bad fertilizer dissolution on soil surface or soil crusting penalizing maize emergence some yield decreases with ssd compared to sprinkler irrigation are also found in literature e g for corn albasha et al 2015 or onions al jamal et al 2001 in all other cases iwp2 is similar or higher than iwp1 this increase in iwp evolves in the same way as ws is table 3 from ssd to sd and ms average iwp increase of 33 71 and 118 respectively and from vegetables to field crops and fruits average iwp increase of 16 50 and 81 respectively yields obtained with localized systems are equivalent to those obtained with sprinkler systems in some cases they are even greater partly due to the reduction in deep percolation and fertilizer losses resulting in better fertilizer performance therefore the reduction in irrigation volumes accounts for the increase in productivity observed depending on the localized irrigation system or the crop type this increase in productivity follows the same trend as the related water savings fig 5 although differences between drip systems and between crops are not significant table 3 in a review compiling numerous american studies lamm 2016 established a comparison between ssd and sprinkler systems for cotton tomato and corn he observed enhanced productivity with ssd compared to sprinkler irrigation which was attributed to reduced water losses as well as increased yield in egypt abd el wahed and ali 2013 concluded that the use of sd allowed higher corn productivity when compared to sprinkler irrigation in europe a similar iwp increase was also reported for corn with sd couto et al 2013 or ssd albasha et al 2015 in our results irrigation water productivity tends to be higher with sd than with ssd although not significantly in literature productivity values obtained with ssd are rather greater than with sd for instance for sugar beet hassanli et al 2010 or corn hassanli et al 2009 however some decreases in water productivity with ssd compared to sd can be found e g for potatoes onder et al 2005 3 2 water savings with soil probes ws sp 3 2 1 amounts of irrigation water applied and water savings ws sp fig 8 shows the amounts of water for irrigation managed without irr1 and with irr2 the use of soil probes for field crops irr1 varies between 114 and 294 mm the reduction when using soil probes varies between 20 and 102 mm in fruit production irr1 is greater 219 to 429 mm but the reduction observed with soil probes is lower 33 to 66 mm for vegetable production irr1 ranges from 34 to 196 mm and the reduction ranges from 7 to 135 mm in all cases water amounts are lower when irrigation is managed with soil probes indeed these devices allow real time decisions that complement scheduling strategies where changes to irrigation dates and doses can be made according to the actual soil water status this results in a reduction in over irrigation and thus in losses due to run off deep percolation and residual soil water after harvesting soil probes may also help to optimize rainfall use as irrigation can be started later in the season and stopped earlier in sprinkler irrigation the first and sometimes also the last irrigation of the season can be cancelled which leads to consistent water saving as previously stated we will hereafter focus on water savings resulting from the use of soil probes ws sp expressed in of irrigation amounts observed without soil probes observed values of ws sp are highly variable according to the situation and range from 7 8 to 75 9 in the cases where ws sp values are very high one may assume that irrigation scheduling without soil probes was incorrect maybe due to a non accurate calculation method of irrigation requirement maximum evapotranspiration usually obtained from eto and crop coefficient kc 3 2 2 influence of hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity on ws sp data collected to assess ws sp are from experiments conducted either in open fields or under plastic tunnels as hydric deficit hd takes precipitations into account only data from open field experiments i e 13 records were considered to explore the influence of hd on ws sp ws sp varies between 8 and 68 fig 9 and shows a slight tendency to increase when hd increases although this trend is not statistically significant p 0 05 data not shown it cannot be concluded that hydric deficit has a significant effect on ws sp no data for hd 4 5 could be collected the analysis of variance table 2c encompasses all collected data open field and plastic tunnel experiment hydric deficit due to its observed non significant effect was not included as a factor and 62 of the variability of ws sp can be attributed to whc probe type irrigation system and crop type however only the irrigation system and the crop type contribute significantly p 0 05 to the ws sp values contrary to ws is ws sp is not dependent on pedo climatic conditions hd and whc as hd and whc have no significant effect on ws sp as scheduling with soil probes is based not on the total precipitation amounts since the beginning of the cropping season but on their real effect on soil water status water tension or moisture content it is understandable that ws sp do not depend on the hydric deficit of the year however more data would be necessary to confirm this trend and further experiments are needed to check if soil probes are likely to allow ws in extreme dry years hd 4 5 likewise the information provided by soil probes is basically independent from whc it can be possibly computed ex post with whc to calculate the irrigation amount to be applied therefore ws sp does not depend on whc either 3 2 3 influence of soil probe type on ws sp as shown in the analysis of variance table 2c there is no significant difference between water savings originating from the use of tensiometric probes and those obtained with capacitive probes 31 0 and 36 6 respectively fig 10 a therefore it appears that to achieve water savings the key factor is to schedule irrigation regardless of the type of probe however it should be noted that both kinds of probes cannot be used indifferently in all types of soils for example tensiometers are not suitable in very stony or crack prone soils and the use of capacitive probes may be problematic in heavy clay soils 3 2 4 influence of crop type and irrigation system on ws sp the average water saving is 25 5 when using soil probes in a ssd or a sprinkler system it is significantly higher 41 5 in a sd system fig 10b water savings decrease from vegetable production 41 5 to field crops 29 3 and fruit production 20 9 fig 10c the data presented in this study are in agreement with those found in the literature on corn irrigated with sd in italy ghinassi et al 2003 show that scheduling with tensiometers resulted in water saving of 30 compared to scheduling based on advisory services in greece irrigation amounts can be reduced by 12 5 on sorghum with scheduling when using capacitive probes papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 3 2 5 irrigation water productivity and scheduling with soil probes iwp is logically always higher for irrigation scheduling using soil probes than for irrigation scheduling without soil probes fig 11 the greatest increases in productivity up to 80 are observed in sd systems for vegetable production again this gain in productivity is directly linked to water saving observed with the use of soil probes reported increases in productivity are 39 with tensiometers on corn ghinassi et al 2003 and 10 with capacitive probes on sorghum papanikolaou and sakellariou makrantonaki 2013 4 conclusion this study compiled all available field studies conducted on the french metropolitan territory over the past 30 years concerning water savings achieved with localized systems surface drip subsurface drip or microsprinkler compared with sprinkler systems reel machine lateral move center pivot or solid set system as well as with scheduling based on soil probes compared with traditional water balance management our work shows that localized irrigation systems as well as soil probes are very effective solutions that can be used to save water at plot scale and thus increase irrigation water productivity however it is not reasonable to generalize values on water savings as they are highly variable and may depend on several factors hydric deficit of the cropping season soil water holding capacity scheduling mode and other factors not taken into account in the present work the main conclusions of this study are the following 1 water savings obtained with localized systems ws is severely decrease when hydric deficit increases and when soil water holding capacity rises they tend to be higher when the localized system and the sprinkler system in question are managed with soil probes 2 water savings obtained with the use of soil probes ws sp seem on the contrary independent of hydric deficit and soil water holding capacity the type of soil probe tensiometric or capacitive has no influence on the obtained water savings 3 water savings achieved with either localized systems or soil probes result in increased irrigation water productivity and are very marginally influenced by the crop type this study deals with observed values of obtained water savings they may help to evaluate water savings potentially attainable when changing the irrigation system e g from sprinkler to localized irrigation or adopting soil probes for irrigation scheduling they may also help public authorities to assess potential reduction of water withdrawal for irrigation at the regional or basin scale moreover they may provide basic guidelines to funding institutions and regulatory bodies to direct subsidies towards the most relevant equipment in terms of water saving potential a crucial observation is that water savings obtained with localized irrigation systems are highly dependent on pedo climatic conditions most significant in moderate hydric deficit conditions whereas those obtained with soil probes are not to promote water savings it seems advisable along with investments in water saving equipment to encourage the use of irrigation scheduling tools that rely on soil water data obtained from soil probes finally it is important to remember that water savings at plot level do not necessarily imply long term water savings at the territory scale grafton et al 2018 the adoption of more efficient irrigation equipment often leads to increased water withdrawal due to changes in crop choices and crop rotation patterns or to the extension of irrigated area this is the so called rebound effect pfeiffer and lin 2014 berbel et al 2015 to achieve reductions in water extractions improvements in irrigation efficiency has to be simultaneously linked with measures that decrease the quantity of water that farmers are allowed to extract funding this work was supported by the french ministry of agriculture declaration of competing interest none appendix a

10904,farmer s management is considered a key factor for efficient cost effective irrigation in this study the effect of proper irrigation management in the solid set systems of kurdistan province in iran was investigated performance indices including coefficient of uniformity cu potential application efficiency of the low quarter pelq wind drift and evaporation loss wdel adequacy of irrigation adirr deep percolation losses dp and application efficiency ae were measured in ten different local plots in 2007 and 2017 the performance of selected systems remained similar in 2007 and 2017 the management of the plots evaluated in 2017 was modified taking into account the preliminary design considerations and applying changes such as irrigation scheduling and sprinkler type these plots with improved management were re evaluated results showed that cu and pelq were improved by 29 and 82 respectively in all systems in addition deep percolation losses dp were reduced by more than 40 insufficient training for farmers and the use of unskilled labor are of the main reasons for sustained underperformance in the study area actions are required in farmers education and in public performance monitoring additionally the results of this research have shown that management improvement measurements are urgently required for the satisfactory performance of the above mentioned systems keywords application efficiency coefficient of uniformity irrigation performance sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction one of the critical challenges currently faced by the world is the optimal use of water resources for agricultural production efficient irrigation systems minimize water use in agricultural lands by controlling on farm water losses peterson and ding 2005 additionally optimum irrigation management is required to increase water productivity saccon 2018 competition among water users is currently leading to water shortages thevs et al 2015 and can have irreversible effects on natural ecosystems chen et al 2016 adequate design and management of irrigation systems can reduce water losses and increase productivity in fact one of the key reasons for low productivity in agriculture is poor irrigation management world bank 1994 high variability in irrigation performance among farmers indicates a significant potential for improving these systems even more if the average current performance is low fernández et al 2007 a number of authors have shown that farmers are more involved when managing their irrigation systems in small communities bardhan and mookherjee 2006 ostrom et al 2011 senanayake et al 2015 this has been attributed to lower transaction costs and more co operation between farmers araral 2009 bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 one of the factors accelerating success of this management model is the existence of appropriate leaders and extension specialists fujiie et al 2005 khwaja 2009 mishra et al 2011 these experts interact with farmers to make a change in irrigation system performance however in developing countries policies aiming at increasing agricultural productivity are often based on structural approaches rather than on managerial approaches in iran two decades of implementation of pressurized irrigation systems particularly sprinkler solid sets with more than 244 000 ha fao 2008 have required very large government investments researchers have reported on the low efficiency of these systems al faraj et al 2016 in the current situation an effective solution would be to replace these irrigation systems in developing countries the effectiveness of on farm irrigation water management is not properly recognized and extension organizations are much more active on plant protection than on irrigation management one of the key aspects of sprinkler solid set performance is the uniformity of water application often expressed by the coefficient of uniformity cu christiansen 1942 many studies have shown that cu is one of the most important indicators for the design and management of irrigation systems pair 1968 regan 1987 irrigation uniformity directly affects efficiency and crop yield bai and li 2003 dechmi et al 2003a li and rao 2000 mateos et al 1997 seginer 1983 stern and bresler 1983 varlev 1976 in turn cu is affected by hydraulic characteristics of the on farm irrigation system such as the type of sprinkler impact gear boxed or reaction the trajectory angle the nozzle diameter the riser height the sprinkler operation pressure and the sprinkler spacing fukui et al 1980 montero et al 2003 playán et al 2006 environmental factors such as wind speed temperature and humidity also affect cu kincaid et al 1996 sanchez et al 2010 zapata et al 2007 the flexibility of sprinkler irrigation systems regarding irrigation scheduling is a significant advantage when comparing with surface irrigation systems cavero et al 2008 playán et al 2005 urrego pereira et al 2013 kohl and deboer 1984 and solomon 1979 analyzed the effect of improved sprinklers and nozzles on irrigation management and efficiency several authors have reported that sprinkler irrigation is characterized by high uniformity cuenca 1989 keller and bliesner 1990 however these high uniformities have not been reported in the recently developed iranian solid set systems the lack of specialized labor in the operation of irrigation systems and the lack of incentives due to the absence of volumetric water tariffs are the reason why farmers accept low performance in iran therefore it is necessary to develop management measures and approaches for iranian irrigation systems according to the authors adopting design considerations for these systems and some simple management measures would result in a sharp improvement in irrigation performance attaining satisfactory levels the objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of proper management on irrigation performance indicators in iranian solid sets which include 1 investigation of the improvement of irrigation performance indicators in 2007 and 2017 2 initial evaluation of farmers management on the iranian solid set systems and 3 improvement of irrigation performance indicators after simple modification actions on the farmer s management it is believed that this research will encourage local and regional decision makers in developing proper strategies for rehabilitating the failing irrigation systems and improving the farmers agreement capacity 2 materials and methods the dehgolan plain basin with an area of 164 120 ha

irrigated with solid set sprinkler systems in these systems pipelines are buried in the complete field farmers only have raisers and sprinklers for one block during the seasonal irrigation of the farm these raisers and sprinklers are moved from one block to the other fig 1 presents the location of the study area in this research irrigation performance indicators were estimated for ten randomly selected on farm systems in 2007 ten additional systems were randomly selected in 2017 in the same region in 2017 performance assessment was performed in two stages in the first stage farmers were operating the irrigation systems as they usually do in the second stage of 2017 an irrigation expert performed changes in each irrigation system to improve their performance after these reforms the irrigation systems were evaluated again and performance indicators were determined and compared with the first stage the results of 2007 and the first stage of 2017 were compared to assess the time evolution of system irrigation performance as operated by the farmers table 1 presents the characteristics of the on farm sprinkler irrigation systems analyzed in 2017 as obtained from the farmers the

deficiencies in systems fig 3 presents the average values of selected performance indicators in 2007 and 2017 the figure reveals moderate changes in system performance as a consequence it can be assumed that farmers did not modify the operation and management of their systems in other words despite the low performance of their systems farmers maintained the same procedures as used in 2007 therefore system modifications are required in 2017 in order to identify deficiencies in the studied systems in 2017 consideration of their criteria and conditions in the initial design is necessary the local solid set systems with moving sprinklers are based on design considerations that farmers are often not aware of for example the diameter of the irrigation laterals is often do 63 mm and the discharge rate of the sprinklers is q 3 l s this implies that only one sprinkler should be in operation at the same time in one the lateral to avoid large friction losses and then excessive pressure variations in the lateral ideally not exceeding 20 keller and bliesner 1990 this restriction was not observed by the farmers in their operation of the systems also the design sprinkler operating pressure was 400 kpa in the local semi flat lands this usually requires a pressure downstream from the pump of 500 600 kpa however farmers usually set their pumps to 400 450 kpa another consideration for the design of these systems is the maximum number of simultaneous sprinklers in the farm which is determined by the available discharge the type of pump and the sprinkler discharge farmers often use more sprinklers to accelerate their work regardless of their effects on irrigation performance when farmers observe insufficient sprinkler overlap or areas with low plant growth they resort to nozzles with smaller diameter instead of increasing the throw diameter at a given pressure these smaller nozzles reduce the throw diameter lack of perpendicularity of the sprinkler risers during their operation use of several types of sprinklers in an irrigation unit water leakages in the quick coupling valves and other system points are other sources of low performance that are not usually observed in these systems the items above lie in the category of preliminary considerations for the operation of the systems and farmers are expected to comply with them 3 2 evaluation of systems before reforms first stage in 2017 after conducting field experiments on the selected systems in stage 1 2017 table 2 presents the results of irrigation performance indicators in each system according to table 2 cu was in all systems lower than the values proposed by merriam and keller 1978 81 cu 87 the average cu was 66 15 points lower than the recommended value the reasons for generalized low uniformity include the large sprinklers spacings and the use of inadequate sprinkler configurations not meeting the spacing also in systems s1 s3 s5 and s10 the low sprinkler pressure in comparison with the design pressure should be mentioned the installation of more than one sprinkler on each lateral was observed in systems s1 s2 s5 s6 s7 s8 also in all systems the effective sprinkler throw radius was low particularly when considering the measured wind speed inter sprinkler pressure variations in systems s1 s2 and s8 were 24 22 and 42 and 22 respectively exceeding the 20 limit keller and bliesner 1990 irrigation water losses were high with a system average of 46 table 2 in systems s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 the value of adirr was above the 75 threshold merriam and keller 1978 table 2 the most important factor determining the low application efficiency in s1 s3 s4 s5 s6 and s9 table 2 was high dp in these systems the average infiltrated depth well exceeded the soil water deficit before irrigation this resulted from low uniformity and or excessive irrigation in these systems wind drift and evaporation losses were also important resulting from meteorological factors such as high wind speed during the irrigation events and technical factors such as the abundance of fine water droplets due to the inappropriately high sprinkler operating pressure kincaid et al 1996 tarjuelo et al 1999b in general in all systems the average depth of infiltrated water exceeded smd in the s2 s7 s8 and s10 systems the most important factor for the low ae was associated with wdel in s4 both dp and wdel were high pelq was in all cases lower than the recommended values of 65 85 merriam and keller 1978 the average dp in the area was 26 table 2 high deep percolation losses induced low adirr mantovani et al 1995 reported a systematic increase in the irrigation rates to compensate for the losses caused by low uniformity in areas where water prices were low this increase in irrigation depth also leads to increased losses deep percolation wind drift and evaporation and or runoff this seems to be the case in the analyzed area of iran due to the low cost of water to farmers 3 3 modifications applied to systems in stage 2 2017 with the coordination of farmers preliminary considerations for the operation of systems were carried out also changes were introduced in the sprinklers and nozzles in the nozzle pressure and in the irrigation time the goals were to improve sprinkler overlapping covering all the space between lines and sprinklers and to better refill soil water deficit in fact playán et al 2006 documented the effect of the sprinkler model nozzle and pressure on irrigation uniformity in order to refill the soil moisture deficit and reduce the deep percolation ratio irrigation time was reduced in accordance with the circumstances of each farm according to pelea et al 2016 due to the effect of atmospheric conditions on the performance of sprinkler irrigation systems and to the high wind drift and evaporation losses irrigation was only performed in periods of low wind speed several studies such as zapata et al 2007 and zapata et al 2009 recommend changing the irrigation schedule in relation with wind speed irrigation stops when the wind speed is greater than a threshold table 3 shows a summary of changes in the type of sprinkler and time irrigation as can be clearly seen from the table the pressure of all systems was set to 0 4 mpa except s10 as recommended by canessa and hermanson 1995 for correct overlap there should be an appropriate choice of sprinkler spacing pressure and nozzle size so in this study sprinklers with a suitable throw radius were also selected table 3 table 3 presents a combination of manufacturer s recommendations experience and local conditions in the design of solid set sprinkler systems in dehgolan plain 3 4 evaluation and comparison of systems between two stages in 2017 after these hardware and managerial modifications the systems were re evaluated table 4 differences in the value of the indicators between stage 2 and stage 1 2017 were determined table 5 according to table 5 and fig 4 cu increased in all systems with an average improvement of 29 after the proposed management improvements seven out of the ten evaluated systems except s1 s7 s8 systems attained the recommended 81 threshold and the three remaining systems s1 s7 and s8 were 2 4 and 1 less than the 81 respectively additionally the management improvements of stage 2 improved pelq by more than 80 on the average fig 5 the highest and lowest pelq improvements were related to s6 176 and s3 20 respectively these improvements led to a reduction in wdel and dp in most systems except s1 s5 s6 in wdel in stage 2 the average value of dp decreased by more than 40 respect to stage 1 the average value of both parameters in stage 2 was below 16 fig 6 according to tables 4 and 5 the improvement of ae in stage 2 was above 33 at the same time adirr improved by more than 12 fig 7 presents average values of the indicators in stages 1 and 2 4 discussion our results underline the fact that management practices can produce a substantial improvement in irrigation performance attaining satisfactory indicators this is particularly interesting when considering that these practices have very low implementation cost as compared to structural actions the question then is why these practices have not been implemented in dehgolan plain the main problem is the lack of official farmers training by the responsible organizations it should be mentioned that the government has already offered a grant of 85 100 of the cost for establishing pressurized irrigation systems in iran however the government does not have any comprehensive plan for the satisfactory operation of these systems promotional programs are more relevant to other agricultural operations and inputs also most farmers do not have enough literacy and their knowledge of these systems is very low irrigators are sometimes temporarily hired personnel working for a landowner in one particular irrigation season in other cases the farm is rented and tenants are rarely obliged to repair or maintain the irrigation systems another important point is the lack of volumetric flowmeters at the pumping stations to control the amount of water used by farmers water tariffs are exclusively based on the area under cultivation therefore farmers do not see any advantage in improving their water efficiency frequently irrigators compensate low uniformity with excess irrigation if a farmer obtains a high yield due to adequate irrigation he may mistakenly relate the yield increase to the quality and quantity of other farming inputs many farmers value the positive aspects of the management practices resulting in poor irrigation performance for instance installing several sprinklers on a lateral instead of just one and in adjacent laterals may avoid long walking distances to the irrigators setting the pressure at the pump outlet below the required 500 600 kpa may avoid leakages in the quick coupling valves and other connections leakages result from the low construction standards and inadequate maintenance therefore we believe that farmer s training on the local irrigation technology should be considered a priority in connection to the development of these systems by the government a training certificate should be required for farmers exploiting government installed irrigation systems only recently volumetric flowmeters have become mandatory for all local irrigation systems this regulation should be accompanied by the establishment of a group of irrigation extension specialists in the plains this group should be in charge of training control and benchmarking to make the most of public investments and natural resources according to smith and munoz 2002 consultancy services are critical in order to adopt techniques for increasing the water efficiency that need to be considered by planners 5 conclusion in this study the evalution of irrigation performance indicators was assessed in iranian solid set sprinkler irrigation systems ten irrigation systems were investigated and mistakes were found in their operation which generally included the type of sprinklers nozzles operating pressure and irrigation time the best pressure for systems was considered to be 0 4 mpa and in most systems the types of sprinklers were changed to zm22 by changing the type of sprinkler the throw radius was up to 25 m but for the s10 system it was 16 m which was used the vyr35 type among the performance indices pelq had the highest improvement with 82 followed by dp with 41 after modifying the systems the average cu reached 84 while initially 66 factors that could lead to lower cus included the number and size of nozzles the operating pressure and sprinkler spacing tarjuelo et al 1999a in this research we tried to increase the performance of systems at low cost finally training farmers and operators and establishing performance control programmes as key measures were identified to improve the performance of these iranian solid set sprinkler irrigation systems acknowledgments this work was funded by grant 4 53064 of the research plan of the management and planning organization of kurdistan province

10904,farmer s management is considered a key factor for efficient cost effective irrigation in this study the effect of proper irrigation management in the solid set systems of kurdistan province in iran was investigated performance indices including coefficient of uniformity cu potential application efficiency of the low quarter pelq wind drift and evaporation loss wdel adequacy of irrigation adirr deep percolation losses dp and application efficiency ae were measured in ten different local plots in 2007 and 2017 the performance of selected systems remained similar in 2007 and 2017 the management of the plots evaluated in 2017 was modified taking into account the preliminary design considerations and applying changes such as irrigation scheduling and sprinkler type these plots with improved management were re evaluated results showed that cu and pelq were improved by 29 and 82 respectively in all systems in addition deep percolation losses dp were reduced by more than 40 insufficient training for farmers and the use of unskilled labor are of the main reasons for sustained underperformance in the study area actions are required in farmers education and in public performance monitoring additionally the results of this research have shown that management improvement measurements are urgently required for the satisfactory performance of the above mentioned systems keywords application efficiency coefficient of uniformity irrigation performance sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction one of the critical challenges currently faced by the world is the optimal use of water resources for agricultural production efficient irrigation systems minimize water use in agricultural lands by controlling on farm water losses peterson and ding 2005 additionally optimum irrigation management is required to increase water productivity saccon 2018 competition among water users is currently leading to water shortages thevs et al 2015 and can have irreversible effects on natural ecosystems chen et al 2016 adequate design and management of irrigation systems can reduce water losses and increase productivity in fact one of the key reasons for low productivity in agriculture is poor irrigation management world bank 1994 high variability in irrigation performance among farmers indicates a significant potential for improving these systems even more if the average current performance is low fernández et al 2007 a number of authors have shown that farmers are more involved when managing their irrigation systems in small communities bardhan and mookherjee 2006 ostrom et al 2011 senanayake et al 2015 this has been attributed to lower transaction costs and more co operation between farmers araral 2009 bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 one of the factors accelerating success of this management model is the existence of appropriate leaders and extension specialists fujiie et al 2005 khwaja 2009 mishra et al 2011 these experts interact with farmers to make a change in irrigation system performance however in developing countries policies aiming at increasing agricultural productivity are often based on structural approaches rather than on managerial approaches in iran two decades of implementation of pressurized irrigation systems particularly sprinkler solid sets with more than 244 000 ha fao 2008 have required very large government investments researchers have reported on the low efficiency of these systems al faraj et al 2016 in the current situation an effective solution would be to replace these irrigation systems in developing countries the effectiveness of on farm irrigation water management is not properly recognized and extension organizations are much more active on plant protection than on irrigation management one of the key aspects of sprinkler solid set performance is the uniformity of water application often expressed by the coefficient of uniformity cu christiansen 1942 many studies have shown that cu is one of the most important indicators for the design and management of irrigation systems pair 1968 regan 1987 irrigation uniformity directly affects efficiency and crop yield bai and li 2003 dechmi et al 2003a li and rao 2000 mateos et al 1997 seginer 1983 stern and bresler 1983 varlev 1976 in turn cu is affected by hydraulic characteristics of the on farm irrigation system such as the type of sprinkler impact gear boxed or reaction the trajectory angle the nozzle diameter the riser height the sprinkler operation pressure and the sprinkler spacing fukui et al 1980 montero et al 2003 playán et al 2006 environmental factors such as wind speed temperature and humidity also affect cu kincaid et al 1996 sanchez et al 2010 zapata et al 2007 the flexibility of sprinkler irrigation systems regarding irrigation scheduling is a significant advantage when comparing with surface irrigation systems cavero et al 2008 playán et al 2005 urrego pereira et al 2013 kohl and deboer 1984 and solomon 1979 analyzed the effect of improved sprinklers and nozzles on irrigation management and efficiency several authors have reported that sprinkler irrigation is characterized by high uniformity cuenca 1989 keller and bliesner 1990 however these high uniformities have not been reported in the recently developed iranian solid set systems the lack of specialized labor in the operation of irrigation systems and the lack of incentives due to the absence of volumetric water tariffs are the reason why farmers accept low performance in iran therefore it is necessary to develop management measures and approaches for iranian irrigation systems according to the authors adopting design considerations for these systems and some simple management measures would result in a sharp improvement in irrigation performance attaining satisfactory levels the objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of proper management on irrigation performance indicators in iranian solid sets which include 1 investigation of the improvement of irrigation performance indicators in 2007 and 2017 2 initial evaluation of farmers management on the iranian solid set systems and 3 improvement of irrigation performance indicators after simple modification actions on the farmer s management it is believed that this research will encourage local and regional decision makers in developing proper strategies for rehabilitating the failing irrigation systems and improving the farmers agreement capacity 2 materials and methods the dehgolan plain basin with an area of 164 120 ha is framed by eastern longitudes 47 06 36 and 47 36 56 and by northern latitudes 35 1 1 and 35 41 7 the basin is located in the province of kurdistan iran more than 42 000 ha of the province are irrigated with solid set sprinkler systems in these systems pipelines are buried in the complete field farmers only have raisers and sprinklers for one block during the seasonal irrigation of the farm these raisers and sprinklers are moved from one block to the other fig 1 presents the location of the study area in this research irrigation performance indicators were estimated for ten randomly selected on farm systems in 2007 ten additional systems were randomly selected in 2017 in the same region in 2017 performance assessment was performed in two stages in the first stage farmers were operating the irrigation systems as they usually do in the second stage of 2017 an irrigation expert performed changes in each irrigation system to improve their performance after these reforms the irrigation systems were evaluated again and performance indicators were determined and compared with the first stage the results of 2007 and the first stage of 2017 were compared to assess the time evolution of system irrigation performance as operated by the farmers table 1 presents the characteristics of the on farm sprinkler irrigation systems analyzed in 2017 as obtained from the farmers the

and their knowledge of these systems is very low irrigators are sometimes temporarily hired personnel working for a landowner in one particular irrigation season in other cases the farm is rented and tenants are rarely obliged to repair or maintain the irrigation systems another important point is the lack of volumetric flowmeters at the pumping stations to control the amount of water used by farmers water tariffs are exclusively based on the area under cultivation therefore farmers do not see any advantage in improving their water efficiency frequently irrigators compensate low uniformity with excess irrigation if a farmer obtains a high yield due to adequate irrigation he may mistakenly relate the yield increase to the quality and quantity of other farming inputs many farmers value the positive aspects of the management practices resulting in poor irrigation performance for instance installing several sprinklers on a lateral instead of just one and in adjacent laterals may avoid long walking distances to the irrigators setting the pressure at the pump outlet below the required 500 600 kpa may avoid leakages in the quick coupling valves and other connections leakages result from the low construction standards and inadequate maintenance therefore we believe that farmer s training on the local irrigation technology should be considered a priority in connection to the development of these systems by the government a training certificate should be required for farmers exploiting government installed irrigation systems only recently volumetric flowmeters have become mandatory for all local irrigation systems this regulation should be accompanied by the establishment of a group of irrigation extension specialists in the plains this group should be in charge of training control and benchmarking to make the most of public investments and natural resources according to smith and munoz 2002 consultancy services are critical in order to adopt techniques for increasing the water efficiency that need to be considered by planners 5 conclusion in this study the evalution of irrigation performance indicators was assessed in iranian solid set sprinkler irrigation systems ten irrigation systems were investigated and mistakes were found in their operation which generally included the type of sprinklers nozzles operating pressure and irrigation time the best pressure for systems was considered to be 0 4 mpa and in most systems the types of sprinklers were changed to zm22 by changing the type of sprinkler the throw radius was up to 25 m but for the s10 system it was 16 m which was used the vyr35 type among the performance indices pelq had the highest improvement with 82 followed by dp with 41 after modifying the systems the average cu reached 84 while initially 66 factors that could lead to lower cus included the number and size of nozzles the operating pressure and sprinkler spacing tarjuelo et al 1999a in this research we tried to increase the performance of systems at low cost finally training farmers and operators and establishing performance control programmes as key measures were identified to improve the performance of these iranian solid set sprinkler irrigation systems acknowledgments this work was funded by grant 4 53064 of the research plan of the management and planning organization of kurdistan province government of iran we are also immensely grateful to enrique playán department of soil and water estación experimental de aula dei csic zaragoza 50059 spain for their comments on an earlier version of the manuscript although any errors are our own and should not tarnish the reputations of these esteemed person
