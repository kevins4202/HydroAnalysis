4870,lack of high spatial resolution soil moisture data is a major limitation in many regional scale hydrologic climatic and agricultural applications the available satellite soil moisture data products are too coarse and unable to cater for this resolution requirement downscaling coarse spatial resolution satellite soil moisture retrievals is a feasible option to meet the required level of spatial resolution for those applications the main focus of this study is to compare two soil thermal inertia based downscaling models built by using long term time records of i point scale in situ data and ii 25 km resolution global land data assimilation system gldas land surface model outputs the developed models were tested over goulburn river catchment in the upper hunter region of nsw australia to downscale soil moisture active passive smap 36 km radiometric product into 1 km resolution the downscaled smap product from both models produced encouraging results with unbiased root mean square errors ubrmses of 0 07 0 10 cm3 cm3 against in situ field data and an average ubrmses of 0 07 cm3 cm3 when compared to the national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals both models showed promising results over semi arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution but with their own strengths and weaknesses the findings here provide useful insights on the robustness of the soil thermal inertia relationship across scales and the effects of the model resolution to the downscaled soil moisture estimates the approach demonstrated

a crucial factor for a number of environmental processes including hydrology climatology agriculture and ecology soil moisture varies rapidly over both spatial and temporal domains depending on the heterogeneity of land use land cover vegetation soil texture and meteorology pacheco et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 wooldridge et al 2003 in situ monitoring from a sparse monitoring networks are unable to capture the variability of soil moisture at a high spatial resolution on the other hand dense in situ monitoring networks are not cost effective especially over larger extents during the last four decades satellite observations emerged as a viable method of estimating global scale near surface soil moisture lakshmi 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the two l band soil moisture missions soil moisture and ocean salinity smos launched by the european satellite agency esa in 2009 kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2015 entekhabi et al 2010a marked the beginning of a new era of satellite remote sensing of soil moisture these two missions aimed to provide high accuracy 0 04 cm3 cm3 globally near surface top 5 cm radiometric soil moisture products but at a coarser spatial resolution 40 km although this spatial resolution is sufficient for some of the global or regional scale applications many hydrologic climatic and agricultural applications demand for soil moisture information at a much higher spatial resolution i e from several kilometres to tens of meters from catchment to paddock scales downscaling satellite derived soil moisture products is a feasible option to meet this resolution requirement researchers have been exploring and testing different algorithms to downscale satellite derived soil moisture products merlin et al 2010 lakshmi 2013 peng et al 2017 however the performance of each of these methods varied based on local biogeophysical factors e g meteorology topography soils and vegetation affecting the soil moisture content across scales with the reported accuracy from 0 03 to 0 21 m3 m3 peng et al 2017 among available downscaling methods active passive microwave data fusion methods are used in smap algorithm das et al 2011 but this provides a moderate resolution product e g 9 km in smap downscaling models based on geoinformation data are often affected by model uncertainties associated with their input data quality model parameters and process representations peng et al 2017 in recent years machine learning methods such as random forest regression boosted regression trees and artificial neural networks have been employed in downscaling satellite soil moisture products alemohammad et al 2018 im et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in most of the cases it is difficult to provide physical interpretation for machine learning algorithms since they often act as black boxes the same downscaling method can provide quite different accuracy levels depending on test sites and the season due to inherent nature of soil moisture variability and uncertainty associated with the downscaling models lakshmi 2013 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 due to the limited soil moisture data availability many downscaling methods were developed with input data collected over a short time span and a limited spatial domain they often required a scene to scene calibration with large ancillary input data e g a gridded climatic data at a high spatial resolution to achieve a high resolution downscaling peng et al 2017 downscaling methods based on fusing passive microwave retrievals with optical thermal data such as land surface temperature lst surface albedo and vegetation indices can provide a high spatial resolution soil moisture product e g merlin et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2009 piles et al 2011 among such methods the algorithms based on the universal triangle concept between soil moisture lst and vegetation index carlson et al 1994 have shown good results especially in arid and semi arid regions peng et al 2017 disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch is one of such models tested over the murrumbidgee river catchment in south eastern australia merlin et al 2012 in the dispatch model the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lsts at 1 km spatial resolution were divided into soil and vegetation components based on the universal triangle carlson et al 1994 petropoulos et al 2009 and later modified as the trapezoidal model to distinguish the variability of soil moisture across fully vegetated surfaces merlin et al 2008 2010 2012 moran et al 1994 the dispatch model has shown a notable variation in the accuracy of the downscaled products with the season depicting rmses of 0 06 m3 m3 in summer and 0 18 m3 m3 in the winter merlin et al 2012 sabaghy et al 2018 soil thermal inertia based downscaling approaches see the section 4 2 for further discussion have been tested by a number of researchers with encouraging results over arid and semi arid regions fang et al 2013 2018 fang and lakshmi 2014 and senanayake et al 2019 the background of this method goes back to the mallick et al 2009 where modis lsts and vegetation indices were used to estimate soil wetness index which was then converted into 1 km resolution soil moisture lakshmi 2013 the thermal inertia principle was used by minacapilli et al 2009 to estimate soil moisture at a bare soil field using airborne thermal infrared observations fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 used soil moisture and soil temperature information extracted from the north american land data assimilation system nldas dataset at 12 5 km spatial resolution to develop a regression tree based downscaling methods at a monthly time scale these regression models were used to map the catchment scale spatial variability of soil moisture at a high spatial resolution 1 km senanayake et al 2019 developed a similar regression tree model for downscaling but by using a long term point scale in situ observation from a monitoring network in south eastern australia in nldas and in situ data based models fang et al 2013 fang and lakshmi 2014 senanayake et al 2019 the relationship between the diurnal difference of soil temperature δt and the daily mean soil moisture content μsm were captured respectively by using long term time records of lsm outputs or in situ observations in these studies the δt μsm relationship developed at one spatial resolution i e point scale vs 12 5 km aerial resolution was used to infer the spatial variability of soil moisture at a different resolution e g 1 km resolution assuming its consistency across the spatial scales this underlying presumption cannot be easily tested due to the limited soil moisture data availability here we argue that a long term time record of in situ observations from representative locations provides a reliable δt and μsm dataset under different climatic and vegetation conditions and furthermore this temporal dynamics of soil moisture help to understand the spatial variability of soil moisture across the scales chen et al 2014 on the other hand reliable lsm outputs would capture this overall change dynamics consistently under different climatic and vegetation conditions but averaged over their pixels the mutual agreement between upscaled in situ lsm outputs and satellite observations and the consistency in the downscaled products derived from in situ or lsm based models may suggest the robustness of the proposed approach and its potential for the operational use in many other locations without requiring local input data readily available soil moisture and soil temperature model outputs such as the global land data assimilation system gldas dataset comes in a much coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km therefore it is crucial to evaluate and compare the performance of in situ data based and gldas based downscaling models such a comparison provides insights on the effect of model resolution onto the downscaling product and its accuracy this paper follows on the study from senanayake et al 2019 and compares the performance of two variants of a model to downscale satellite soil moisture products built at two different spatial resolutions here two δt μsm regression tree models built at two scales i using a point scale in situ dataset and ii 25 km spatial resolution global land data assimilation system gldas dataset over a semi arid australian catchment the downscaled soil moisture was compared against in situ observations and the model was further tested against high resolution airborne retrievals from the national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 panciera et al 2008 the approach developed here is applicable to elsewhere with globally available gldas dataset it can easily update the soil moisture information at a high spatial resolution with newly available satellite information without the need to perform a calibration for each scene separately also this model does not require the datasets such as precipitation and evapotranspiration which are difficult to obtain at a high spatial resolution the effect of those factors over a region is included in the δt μsm relationship for each day while the temporal effect of those factors is eliminated by bias correcting with coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product 2 study area this study was conducted over the northern half of the goulburn river catchment located in the upper hunter region of nsw australia the goulburn river catchment extends from latitudes 31 46 s to 32 51 s and longitudes 149 40 e to 150 36 e and located 150 km northwest to sydney over an area of 7000 km2 fig 1 the elevation of the catchment varies from 100 m to 1300 m from the floodplains towards the mountain ranges at northern and southern parts of the catchment the catchment shows a semi arid climatic condition with an average annual rainfall of 700 mm which increases from 500 mm in floodplains to 1100 mm at higher altitudes the catchment has a clear distinction between its northern and southern halves based on land use land cover and soil characteristics the northern half consists of mostly grazing and cropping representing typical agricultural landscape in south eastern australia fig 2 a and dominated by basalt derived soils the southern half encompasses of dense vegetation and dominated by sandstone conglomerate and shale derived rocks in summer and winter the monthly mean temperatures of the catchment vary from 16 to 30 c and 3 to 17 c respectively rüdiger et al 2003 2007 krui 562 km2 and merriwa 651 km2 river catchments located in the northern half of the goulburn river catchment were the main foci of this study fig 2 b e show the topography and soil texture over the krui and merriwa river catchments 3 data a summary of the datasets employed in this study is given in table 1 3 1 sasmas in situ dataset the goulburn river catchment is instrumented under the scaling and assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow sasmas project http www eng newcastle edu au sasmas sasmas sasmas htm from 2002 at 26 sites to measure soil moisture content at different soil layers across the root zone 0 90 cm with soil temperature and other auxiliary parameters fig 1 and table 2 krui river catchment was instrumented with six monitoring stations merriwa river catchment and stanley micro catchment were instrumented with seven monitoring stations in each catchment martinez et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 at the initial stage of the sasmas project three vertical campbell scientific cs616 water content reflectometers were installed at sites to measure soil moisture content at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil layers at a later stage starting in 2005 the sites were instrumented with stevens water hydraprobes to measure soil moisture content at the top 5 cm and soil temperature at 2 5 cm soil depths the top 5 cm soil depth can be considered as the depth of penetration of the l band microwave radiation o neill et al 2010 the sasmas soil moisture and soil temperature measurements were taken at each one minute and averaged over 20 min intervals the dataset was compiled into hourly daily weekly and monthly average values after careful data quality control the daily mean soil moisture of the near surface top 5 cm soil layer was used as μsm values when developing the downscaling models the top 5 cm soil moisture and soil temperature observations from sasmas sites in the krui and merriwa river catchments were used in this work to develop downscaling algorithms and for validation the sasmas dataset from 2005 to 2015 consists of some data gaps at multiple stations over different time periods due to a number of reasons such as sensor telemetry failures and removing erroneous readings caused by soil cracking specially in clay rich areas in the northern half of krui and merriwa river catchments and ponding of water after extreme rainfall events this area has experienced climatic extremes during this period including the millennium drought from 2001 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 pasha bulker storm in 2007 a 100 year return period storm event mills et al 2010 and strong la niña events in 2010 2011 boening et al 2012 this long term sasmas dataset was able to capture diverse soil moisture conditions across its temporal domain and hence to build a robust statistical downscaling model see section 4 the land use land cover soil texture and topographic information of the sasmas monitoring sites in the krui and merriwa river catchments and the stanley micro catchment are given in table 2 the sasmas monitoring stations were established at mid slope sites with representative soil vegetation and topographic characteristics rüdiger et al 2003 2007 these locations are able to provide representative soil moisture over the whole catchment chen et al 2014 and hence upon upscaling sasmas observations could represent soil moisture content over a coarse resolution satellite footprint grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 crow et al 2012 senanayake et al 2019 in their study at stanley micro catchment area chen et al 2014 showed that a point scale soil moisture measurements can be extrapolated over a catchment with homogeneous soil texture and vegetation further kunkel et al 2016 found that the temperature characteristics to be similar over the catchments with similar land surface properties in their study over this area they also found that the soil temperature measurements at a geographic centre of the catchments can represent the average soil temperature characteristics over those catchments 3 2 gldas estimates for the lsm estimate based regression tree model three hourly outputs of the top 10 cm soil moisture and soil temperature were extracted from the gldas noah land surface model l4 3 hourly 0 25 0 25 v2 1 gldas noah025 3h 2 1 dataset beaudoing and rodell 2016 rodell et al 2004 over the period of 2000 2017 at five 25 km grid cells covering the study area fig 3 note that the effective soil depth of the gldas near surface soil moisture estimates 0 10 cm is different from the near surface soil moisture measured by the sasmas in situ monitoring network and the l band satellites i e 0 5 cm however in situ sasmas data showed that soil temperature values of these two depths are closely identical over the study area

cylindrical 36 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 0 ease grid 2 0 o neill et al 2016 the smap 36 km radiometric product has generally shown its target accuracy unbiased rmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3 over its core validation sites cvs with rmses varying from 0 027 to 0 103 cm3 cm3 unbiased rmses varying from 0 020 to 0 058 cm3 cm3 note that unbiased rmse ubrmse is obtained by bias correcting rmse using the mean difference overall a better performance was observed at cvs where cultivated agriculture is not the dominating land use type the inability of the retrieval algorithms to capture highly heterogeneous surface roughness and vegetation conditions across different seasons can be identified as the reasons behind the lower accuracies of smap soil moisture products across the cultivated lands colliander et al 2017 and forests fig 3 shows the study area with the smap 36 km grid 3 4 modis lst and ndvi products the δt values were calculated at 1 km spatial resolution using am and pm lsts extracted from the modis aqua lst and emissivity lst e daily l3 global 1 km grid v006 myd11a1 dataset wan et al 2015 to predict 1 km resolution soil moisture the am and pm overpass times of modis aqua satellite over the study area 01 00 h and 13 00 h provided good approximates for daily minimum and maximum lsts for calculating δt values when compared with in situ data senanayake et al 2019 ndvi values over the study area at 1 km spatial resolution for the period of 2005 2015 were extracted from the modis terra vegetation indices 16 day l3 global 1 km grid mod13a2 dataset didan 2015 and were linearly interpolated over the time to acquire a time record of daily ndvi estimates at each sasmas station 3 5 soil and landscape grid national soil attributes maps the soil clay content of the

grundy et al 2015 the top 5 cm soil clay content of the dataset showed an average uncertainty of 18 5 across the country rossel et al 2015 3 6 nafe 05 airborne dataset the nafe 05 l band airborne campaign was conducted over a 40 km 40 km land area within krui and merriwa catchments fig 3 this campaign was carried through four consecutive mondays commencing from 31st october 2005 to provide smos simulations using an l band radiometer the airborne and the field data collections during nafe 05 were carried out with the objectives of developing smos retrieval algorithms developing downscaling algorithms and assimilating smos retrievals with lsms to estimate root zone soil moisture panciera et al 2008 a long drying period after rainfall events on 31st october and 1st november 2005 created very wet saturated to very dry conditions in near surface soil moisture during the nafe 05 campaign panciera et al 2008 nafe 05 airborne soil moisture dataset was obtained by employing a polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr with a two channel inversion of the l band microwave emission of the biosphere l meb model panciera et al 2009 the nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals consist of a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km though with the pixels varying from 860 m to 1 070 m in size as a result of constant flight altitudes above the median elevation across the heterogeneous terrain the airborne datasets were obtained between 6 00 h and 10 00 h in the morning along the flight lines oriented in north south direction with an average altitude of 3000 m above ground level agl panciera et al 2008 nafe 05 soil moisture dataset showed an accuracy of 0 04 0 05 v v gao et al 2018 4 methodology the methodology of this study is summarized in fig 4 4 1 inter comparison of datasets the accuracy of the downscaling work is highly dependent on the accuracy of the datasets used firstly soil moisture datasets captured by smap gldas and sasmas were compared and secondly modis ndvi data captured at point scale and aggregated over the gldas pixels were compared these comparisons provide insights onto how soil moisture and ndvi values have been captured over the area at different spatial domains across scales during the study period 4 2 developing the downscaling models the two variants of the downscaling model were developed based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between δt and μsm following fang et al 2013 and senanayake et al 2019 thermal inertia ti is the resistance of an object to change its temperature as a response to the temperature fluctuations in the surrounding environment sellers 1965 and relates to the object s bulk density ρ in kg m 3 specific heat capacity k in j kg 1 k 1 and the thermal conductivity c in w m 1 k 1 wang et al 2010 i e 1 ti ρ k c wet soils demonstrate a higher thermal inertia compared to dry soils due to the high specific heat capacity of water this results in a proportionality between soil wetness and thermal inertia soil thermal inertia shows an inversely proportional relationship with δt so δt can be given as a function of thermal inertia engman 1991 i e 2 δ t f 1 ti therefore wet soils exhibit low δt and vice versa leading to an inversely proportional relationship between μsm and δt this relationship can be affected by other factors including vegetation cover and soil texture which determines the water holding capacity of soils engman 1991 farrar et al 1994 pratt and ellyett 1979 sandholt et al 2002 4 2 1 developing the point scale in situ data based downscaling model a regression tree model has the potential of mapping such non linear relationships between soil moisture and temperature modulated by other factors by using a rule based classification system such a model can be used for lookup functions between input e g radiometric soil moisture product and other environmental data and target variables e g 1 km soil moisture products under different conditions de ath and fabricius 2000 fang et al 2013 senanayake et al 2019 the first variant of the δt μsm regression tree model was developed using the top 5 cm observations of the hourly sasmas in situ soil moisture and soil temperature data nearly 20 000 δt μsm data records from ten monitoring stations located in krui and merriwa catchments were used to build this regression tree model the early morning tam and mid afternoon tpm soil temperature values were extracted in accordance with the modis aqua daytime and night time overpass times across the catchments i e 13 00 and 01 00 h to calculate δt values for each day i e 3 δ t t pm t am chen et al 2014 have showed vegetation index and soil type as the key parameters driving the soil moisture patterns over this study area using physics based hydrologic model hydrus simunek et al 1998 accordingly season ndvi and soil clay content were employed as modulating factors similar to senanayake et al 2019 many researchers have showed a strong relationship between soil moisture and vegetation cover and their interrelationship on available water capacity and transpiration on the other hand soil temperature is regulated by soil moisture and vegetation cover taktikou et al 2016 therefore vegetation density acts as a modulating factor for δt μsm relationship a detailed classification of ndvi has a potential of providing a better accuracy but can lead to the overfitting in this study the regression trees were classified into three ndvi classes based on vegetation density following silva et al 2016 i e ndvi 0 4 as no vegetation cover to grass 0 4 ndvi 0 6 as moderate vegetation cover and ndvi 0 6 as dense vegetation cover soil clay content at monitoring sites were extracted from the sasmas site descriptions and subsequently classified into two classes here we used the classification of heavy soils clay soils and others as per bonan 2015 i e i clay or heavy soils clay 35 and ii other soils clay 35 to classify the regression trees clay content was chosen as a modulating factor in the regression tree by considering the effect of soil texture on soil thermal properties such as thermal conductive which directly affects thermal inertia of the soil abu hamdeh 2003 in addition the distribution of soil clay content over krui and merriwa river catchments and sasmas stations medians 40 and 30 respectively were considered when defining these ranges separate regression trees were built for each season considering the seasonal temperature changes in australia austral seasons are defined as spring from september to november summer from december to february autumn from march to may and winter from june to august considering lag in heating and cooling as per the sun s movement across the equator these are often use when analysing climatic based statistics bureau of meteorology australia 2020 classification by season will help to minimize the effect of daily cooling and heating to the δt μsm regression tree model 4 2 2 eveloping the 25 km resolution gldas estimates based downscaling model the second variant of the regression tree model was developed by using top 10 cm δt and μsm gldas outputs at 25 km resolution tpm and tam were extracted by considering the modis aqua daytime and night time overpass times i e 13 00 h and 01 00 h modis 16 day 1 km ndvi values were temporally interpolated at a daily time step as explained in section 3 4 and then spatially averaged over 25 km gldas grid to obtain the daily spatial average over gldas grid cells the 25 km ndvi values were classified into 3 classes similar to section 4 2 1 however clay content could not be employed in this regression tree model as soil characteristics were simulated as lumped parameter after the spatial averaging over gldas grid cells hence the sub grid spatial variability of soil clay content could not be explicitly shown with the gldas estimate based model for each of the gldas pixels separate regression trees were developed by using the time series of 25 km scale δt μsm and ndvi records for each season about 6 500 δt and μsm data pairs over each gldas pixel were employed in developing the regression tree model from 2000 to 2017 similar to the in situ data based model the long term gldas dataset was used to build a robust regression tree model note that the dataset from april to december 2015 and november 2005 was not used for model building since they were used for validation 4 3 estimating soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution to estimate soil moisture at 1 km δt μsm ndvi data and soil clay content data were fed into the regression tree models at a spatial resolution of 1 km the daily δt values were extracted from modis daytime and night time lsts eq 3 in year 2015 for downscaling smap and november 2005 for downscaling aggregated airborne nafe data modis derived lst values showed a strong correlation with sasmas near surface soil temperature observations with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 74 and 0 76 at daytime and night time respectively senanayake et al 2019 accordingly a linear calibration was applied to modis lst values against sasmas in situ observations before calculating δt values this helped to minimize any bias including the effect of the mismatch between effective sensing depths i e skin temperature with modis and sasmas soil temperature measured at 2 5 cm depth soil clay content was obtained at 1 km resolution by spatially averaging the clay content from the national soil grid over the 1 km modis grid the downscaling work has been undertaken with i smap 36 km radiometric product in 2015 and ii using aggregated l band airborne soil moisture products from the nafe 05 in november 2005 the nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals aggregated over the 40 km 40 km area of airborne campaign provided an approximation for a coarse spatial resolution l band satellite soil moisture product the coarse resolution smap and aggregated nafe 05 l band soil moisture products were downscaled using 4 s m ds p s m est p s m sat q 1 n i 1 n s m est i where smds p is downscaled soil moisture at 1 km pixel p smest p is soil moisture at pixel p estimated by the regression tree model smsat q is the radiometric satellite soil moisture value at the coarse resolution pixel q where p is laid within n is the total count of 1 km pixels within the coarse resolution pixel q and smest i is estimated soil moisture at a 1 km pixel i i 1 n within the pixel q eq 4 shows that the estimated soil moisture values are bias corrected using the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product after soil moisture values at 1 km are estimated by the regression tree models based on the δt μsm relationship in the section 4 2 1 4 2 2 4 4 validation of the downscaled soil moisture products firstly the validation of the downscaled products was performed by comparing the downscaled smap soil moisture with sasmas in situ data observations from three sasmas sites k 3 s 3 and m 6 were employed in this comparison based on the availability of soil moisture data of the top 5 cm soil layer secondly the downscaled product of aggregated nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals was compared against the 1 km airborne retrievals from nafe 05 on 7th 14th and 21st november 2005 the second comparison was carried through since the number of in situ stations were insufficient to represent the soil moisture variability and its changing spatial pattern over the study area r2 and ubrmse were used to evaluate the model performance at 1 km downscaling resolution ubrmse can be defined as 5 ubrmse p 1 n θ ds p θ ds θ obs p θ obs 2 n 1 where θds p and θobs p are downscaled and observed soil moisture at 1 km pixel p n is number of pixels or observations p 1 n θ ds and θ obs are means of downscaled and observed soil moisture values respectively colliander et al 2018 entekhabi et al 2010b ubrmse is useful in comparison between soil moisture captured at pixels scale against point scale in situ data especially when the number of in situ monitoring stations are limited colliander et al 2018 6 r 2 1 θ i θ r e g i 2 θ i θ 2 where θreg i is the soil moisture of predicted from the regression between θds and θobs at i th value 5 results 5 1 inter comparison of datasets the comparison between smap 36 km radiometric soil moisture product and the average sasmas in situ soil moisture observations over the smap grid cell sp 2 fig 3 from april to december 2015 is shown in fig 6 a note this is the study time period when both datasets are available a slight underestimation of smap soil moisture is apparent in fig 6 compared with sasmas in situ observations an ubrmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3 and a r2 value of 0 75 fig 6b showed a good temporal agreement between the two datasets the comparison between the gldas 25 km soil moisture estimates and the average sasmas soil moisture observations over two gldas grid cells gl 3 and gl 4 fig 3 is shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows the temporal agreement of gldas and sasmas soil moisture from 2007 to 2015 over these two grid cells an overestimation was observed for gldas compared to in situ observations as expected gldas estimates showed much less variable soil moisture compared to the sasmas in situ observations fig 8 shows the results from the comparison of smap and gldas soil moisture estimates over four smap 36 km soil moisture pixels the two datasets showed a good temporal agreement fig 8a though an underestimation can be observed in smap relative to gldas especially for dryer conditions fig 9 a shows temporally averaged modis 1 km ndvi values over the study area point scale ndvi values at sasmas stations averaged over each gldas grid cell are shown in fig 9b and 1 km modis ndvi values spatially averaged over gldas grid cells are shown in fig 9c similar to fig 9a the temporal means of modis ndvi values over the period of 2004 to 2014 were used in fig 9b c the point scale ndvi values extracted at sasmas stations and 1 km ndvi values over the study area upscaled to the gldas grid showed similar characteristics in the north south direction the denser vegetation in the northern part and moderate vegetation cover cropping and grazing in the southern part fig 9a have been represented i e point scale ndvi values at sasmas stations and 1 km ndvi values when upscaled to the gldas grid however the areal average of ndvi over the gldas grid cells located in the northern half fig 9c showed higher values compared to the upscaled point data fig 9b this can be due to the lack of sasmas stations in the area covered with dense vegetation across the northernmost part of the catchments with high rainfalls also fig 9b c both show that gridding the ndvi over 25 km gldas grid has improved the spatial representation of vegetation cover compared to a single ndvi value averaged over the study area 5 2 evaluating the downscaling models a summary in table 3 shows a comparison between the in situ based and gldas based downscaling models the regressions developed for austral spring using sasmas in situ observations for all three ndvi classes with clay content 35 clay content 35 and without using clay content are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively the regressions developed using gldas estimates for the spring at gl 3 grid cell are shown in fig 10d statistics of the regression models shown in fig 10 are given in appendix 1 as expected adding clay content has improve the strength of the model and this can be shown as an advantage of the in situ data based model the fluctuations of both soil moisture and soil temperature are rapid at the surface soil layer due to its direct exposure to the solar radiation and other climate forcing compared to deeper soil layers adams et al 2015 choi and jacobs 2007 gülser and ekberli 2004 the larger effective soil depth 0 10 cm and moderation of temperature and soil moisture over a larger spatial modelling resolution 25 km can be possible reasons for the smaller δt and μsm ranges calculated by the gldas estimates compared to the sasmas in situ observations and this directly affected the regression model fit fig 10 and downscaled soil moisture products 5 3 validation of the downscaled soil moisture 5 3 1 comparing downscaled soil moisture with sasmas in situ data fig 11 a shows the temporal agreement of downscaled soil moisture products against in situ observations downscaled products from both the in situ and gldas follow very similar patterns they demonstrated a good spatial and temporal agreement with sasmas in situ observations but with a slight underestimation at m6 which consists of vertisols with high clay content table 2 this type of soils undergoes volumetric expansions during wetting and soil cracks during dry periods the in situ data based model and the gldas estimate based models showed encouraging results with ubrmses of 0 07 and 0 10 cm3 cm3 respectively against the sasmas in situ data fig 11b and c the downscaled datasets from the two models showed a good agreement with an ubrmse of 0 05 cm3 cm3 against each other fig 11d fig 12 shows a comparison between smap 36 km radiometric soil moisture product and downscaled smap soil moisture products achieved from both models on 14th august 2015 over the study area table 4 describes the agreement between downscaled data and in situ observations at the sasmas stations k3 s3 and m6 separately 5 3 2 comparing downscaled soil moisture against airborne soil moisture retrievals comparison between nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals and downscaled soil moisture products are shown in fig 13 a c fig 13d e show the absolute difference between nafe 05 retrievals and downscaled soil moisture from in situ data based and gldas estimates based models respectively the downscaled soil moisture from both models showed similar results with a good agreement with nafe 05 observations fig 14 a and b boxplots in fig 14c shows a comparison of the distributions of soil moisture as captured by the nafe 05 and the downscaled soil moisture products from in situ data based and gldas estimate based models on 7th 14th and 21st november 2005 it shows that both models captured the drying down of soil moisture the overall change trend with mean but limited to capture the variability in soil moisture in the study area however both models seemed to capture the relative wetness of soil moisture illustrating similar soil moisture change patterns compared to nafe 05 observations fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 comparison of datasets smap showed a good agreement with sasmas in situ observations with an ubrmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3 i e smap expected accuracy globally however smap soil moisture observations have decreased with time more rapidly than in situ observations showing a slight underestimation bias at drying fig 6a this general underestimation of smap against in situ observations has been identified previously especially for vegetated surfaces and dry down periods chen et al 2017 ma et al 2017 for example the smap grid cell sp 2 is mostly covered with cropping and grazing therefore the vegetation response can affect the smap signal jackson and schmugge 1991 ma et al 2017 the uncertainties in auxiliary data layers used in smap retrieval algorithms chen et al 2017 mismatches between the sensing depths between satellites and in situ observations adams et al 2015 and uncertainties in in situ data can also contribute to this discrepancy the gldas derived soil moisture estimates on the other hand are associated with uncertainties caused by model input structure and parameter errors the comparison between sasmas and gldas soil temperature showed a good agreement with 1 1 linear relationship appendix 2 3 this strong linear correlation between sasmas and gldas soil temperatures seems to suggest that sasmas stations located in mid slope locations can represent the soil temperature over a larger extent due to the average incidence radiation and similar land surface properties such as vegetation and soil kunkel et al 2016 while both showed very similar early morning temperature with less variability r2 0 92 with ubrmse 1 7 c but more variable changes in mid afternoon soil temperature r2 0 76 with ubrmse 3 6 c were noticed this relatively large difference in the mid afternoon soil moisture compared to the early morning temperature between two datasets could amplify their differences in the diurnal temperature difference and produced different soil moisture patterns after the downscaling especially during the dry conditions similarly the ndvi values extracted from sasmas stations also show their ability to represent a larger extent such as the study catchment however the areal average of ndvi over the gldas grid cells located in the northern half showed higher values compared to the upscaled point data from the sasmas site section 5 1 it was due to relatively low the spatial coverage of the study catchment area within the gldas grid cell i e less representative sasmas site over the gldas spatial domain to capture the vegetation distribution patterns the differences in ndvi along with δt between two models directly affected downscaling results 6 2 evaluating downscaling models and soil moisture datasets a long term record of soil moisture and temperature from the sasmas monitoring network stations and the gldas outputs showed the consistent δt μsm relationship despite the differences in input data spatial domain and scales soil moisture changes are highly variable over the spatial and temporal domains and its interpolation at any given spatial scale e g paddock scale cannot be easily done without extensive monitoring and detailed modelling over the study extent the study results suggest upscaling of in situ i e point scale observations from selected sites representative for the study area or use of the globally available lsm outputs at a coarse spatial scale e g 25 km with high quality forcing and process representation may help to overcome the data gap to downscale soil moil moisture at 1 km the long term data records from both datasets were consistent with each other and agreed well with multiple satellite data products the gldas based downscaling model can be applied over larger extents since gldas estimates are available globally at 25 km spatial resolution the accuracy of the lsm output based downscaling models is dependent on the representativeness of the spatially averaged land surface properties across its grid cells the accuracy of an in situ data based model on the other hand depends on the data quality size of the dataset number of stations and their spatial distribution and representativeness for the study area for example the sasmas network has a good potential in effectively representing the catchment as a whole even with a limited number of stations due to the catchment representative locations of its monitoring stations grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 the in situ data based regression tree model has the ability and flexibility to be improved by adding site specific factors such as soil texture and topography with further classification for example the clay rich soils clay content 35 showed higher soil moisture ranges and low δt ranges compared to soils with clay content 35 fig 10a and b a regression model without soil classification e g fig 10c was unable to capture the effect of soil texture on soil moisture variability appendix 1 including soil factor has improved the soil moisture distribution pattern during the wet state fig 13 such a classification is unachievable with the gldas based regression tree model since on site factors such as soil texture are lumped i e no sub grid variability in input and parameter values over the 25 km grid cells if the classification based on clay content is disregarded the in situ data based gldas estimate based models showed very similar regressions lines e g fig 10c and d and appendix 1 the uncertainties caused by the sharp boundaries in the regression tree classification can be minimized by employing classification schemes such as fuzzy logic based classification scheme lemos et al 2011 the downscaled soil moisture product from the in situ data based model outperformed its gldas based counterpart when compared with the sasmas in situ dataset fig 11 this can be due to the use of sasmas data in building the in situ data based model which can probably give better results over the sasmas stations the downscaled smap and aggregated nafe 05 soil moisture maps fig 13b c from both models showed the general northward increasing gradient of the soil moisture over the study area resulted by the rainfall patterns and the soil texture the downscaled soil moisture from the gldas estimate based model showed slightly smoothed patterns with an apparent tile effect compared to those from the in situ data based downscaling model fig 13c this tile effect appears mainly due to having different regression algorithms for each gldas grid cell a similar tile effect can be seen in fig 12 caused by coarse scale smap pixels the drying period after the rainfall events at the beginning of nafe 05 experiment can be observed in both the downscaled soil moisture products fig 14c however nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals showed higher variance of soil moisture compared to its downscaled counterpart the absence of factors affecting the spatial variability of soil moisture e g crop types and more detailed classifications of these factors might be a reason for the lower variance of soil moisture at the downscaled products downscaled soil moisture from both models show less absolute error against nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals during dry conditions i e 0 17 cm3 cm3 average soil moisture content with a standard deviation of 0 06 cm3 cm3 on 21st november 2005 compared to wet conditions i e 0 41 cm3 cm3 average soil moisture content with a standard deviation of 0 08 cm3 cm3 on 7th november 2005 fig 11d and e it was expected as the variability of soil moisture reduced as the study site dried down during the dry conditions the gldas based model captured the spatial soil moisture patterns slightly better than in situ based model the in situ observations showed more variability and its δt μsm relationship was more sensitive to the relative changes i e a steeper slope compared to the gldas based model fig 10 further the gldas soil temperature showed less variable and underestimated mid afternoon temperature and hence a smaller and more subtle δt changes during the dry condition with relatively high ndvi in late spring following the rainfalls and smaller δt during the dry condition the gldas showed subtle change patterns of soil moisture while these differences were underestimated and less obvious from the in situ data based downscaled products errors presented in the nafe 05 airborne soil moisture retrievals gao et al 2018 is another contributor to the ubrmse of the comparison between downscaled and nafe 05 soil moisture both in situ data and gldas based downscaling models show promising results over the study area the downscaled soil moisture data are able to provide detailed information about the spatial variability of soil moisture compared to available smap soil moisture products both models despite their different spatial domains were able to capture the heterogeneity of δt μsm relationship and the influence of vegetation relatively well the insights here provide confidence to develop and test a combined in situ data and gldas estimate based model over a larger area 6 3 future work the effect of atmospheric forcing on δt values can impose uncertainties to the current model although the model was classified based on austral season considering seasonal temperature difference the δt μsm relationship can be affected by the variation of temperature under different atmospheric environments including atmospheric forcing factors that affect the energy and water fluxes including wind speed and daily mean temperature can improve the accuracy of the model similarly including more localised biophysical variables such as topography and albedo can be used to improve the model considering their influence on δt μsm relationship for example topography of the study area which has an increase towards north table 2 has effects on solar radiation lst and precipitation patterns this topographic effect was not captured in the current model the readily available gldas outputs were used in this study using the land surface models tailed for the regional area with the local forcing data gridded at a high spatial resolution would improve the downscaling results the joint uk land environment simulator jules best et al 2011 and community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable kowalczyk et al 2006 wang et al 2011 models can be suggested for the future work in australia the data gaps in the downscaled products caused by the cloud contamination is a major drawback in the optical thermal data based downscaling methods especially when both tpm and tam data are required zhao and li 2015 employing lst data from geostationary satellites that provide lst data at a high temporal resolution to obtain the possible cloud free tpm and tam approximates within a longer time window might be suggested as potential methods to address this problem the cloud contamination problems might be addressed by calibrating model derived soil moisture estimates with downscaled products spatial and temporal interpolation methods statistical methods and use of persistent spatial patterns for gap filling ghafarian malamiri et al 2018 metz et al 2017 padhee and dutta 2020 pham et al 2019 yang and hu 2018 there is an ongoing work of producing a consistent smap and smos combined l band soil moisture product with 1 day temporal resolution bindlish et al 2017 given its high temporal resolution downscaling this combined dataset has the potential of providing a better time record of high spatial resolution soil moisture products 7 conclusion two variants of the δt μsm relationship based regression tree models were built by using long term i point scale in situ data and ii 25 km resolution gldas estimates to downscale coarse spatial resolution soil moisture products smap 36 km gridded product and aggregated nafe 05 airborne soil moisture products were downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using the regression models with the aid of modis lst ndvi and soil data both these models though built at two different spatial scales showed promising results with a good accuracy level the long term in situ soil moisture observations from the sasmas sites and gldas model outputs provided representative areal responses to capture changes in soil moisture and temperature under different climate and vegetation growth conditions and helped to develop robust the thermal inertia relationship between the diurnal temperature δt and the daily mean soil moisture μsm for downscaling satellite soil moisture products given their strengths and drawbacks the results augur well in building a combined in situ and lsm output based downscaling model to build a long term time record of soil moisture in arid semi arid

4870,lack of high spatial resolution soil moisture data is a major limitation in many regional scale hydrologic climatic and agricultural applications the available satellite soil moisture data products are too coarse and unable to cater for this resolution requirement downscaling coarse spatial resolution satellite soil moisture retrievals is a feasible option to meet the required level of spatial resolution for those applications the main focus of this study is to compare two soil thermal inertia based downscaling models built by using long term time records of i point scale in situ data and ii 25 km resolution global land data assimilation system gldas land surface model outputs the developed models were tested over goulburn river catchment in the upper hunter region of nsw australia to downscale soil moisture active passive smap 36 km radiometric product into 1 km resolution the downscaled smap product from both models produced encouraging results with unbiased root mean square errors ubrmses of 0 07 0 10 cm3 cm3 against in situ field data and an average ubrmses of 0 07 cm3 cm3 when compared to the national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals both models showed promising results over semi arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution but with their own strengths and weaknesses the findings here provide useful insights on the robustness of the soil thermal inertia relationship across scales and the effects of the model resolution to the downscaled soil moisture estimates the approach demonstrated encouraging results over semi arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution keywords downscaling gldas modis smap soil moisture thermal inertia 1 introduction soil moisture is a crucial factor for a number of environmental processes including hydrology climatology agriculture and ecology soil moisture varies rapidly over both spatial and temporal domains depending on the heterogeneity of land use land cover vegetation soil texture and meteorology pacheco et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 wooldridge et al 2003 in situ monitoring from a sparse monitoring networks are unable to capture the variability of soil moisture at a high spatial resolution on the other hand dense in situ monitoring networks are not cost effective especially over larger extents during the last four decades satellite observations emerged as a viable method of estimating global scale near surface soil moisture lakshmi 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the two l band soil moisture missions soil moisture and ocean salinity smos launched by the european satellite agency esa in 2009 kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2015 entekhabi et al 2010a marked the beginning of a new era of satellite remote sensing of soil moisture these two missions aimed to provide high accuracy 0 04 cm3 cm3 globally near surface top 5 cm radiometric soil moisture products but at a coarser spatial resolution 40 km although this spatial resolution is sufficient for some of the global or regional scale applications many hydrologic climatic and agricultural applications demand for soil moisture information at a much higher spatial resolution i e from several kilometres to tens of meters from catchment to paddock scales downscaling satellite derived soil moisture products is a feasible option to meet this resolution requirement researchers have been exploring and testing different algorithms to downscale satellite derived soil moisture products merlin et al 2010 lakshmi 2013 peng et al 2017 however the performance of each of these methods varied based on local biogeophysical factors e g meteorology topography soils and vegetation affecting the soil moisture content across scales with the reported accuracy from 0 03 to 0 21 m3 m3 peng et al 2017 among available downscaling methods active passive microwave data fusion methods are used in smap algorithm das et al 2011 but this provides a moderate resolution product e g 9 km in smap downscaling models based on geoinformation data are often affected by model uncertainties associated with their input data quality model parameters and process representations peng et al 2017 in recent years machine learning methods such as random forest regression boosted regression trees and artificial neural networks have been employed in downscaling satellite soil moisture products alemohammad et al 2018 im et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in most of the cases it is difficult to provide physical interpretation for machine learning algorithms since they often act as black boxes the same downscaling method can provide quite different accuracy levels depending on test sites and the season due to inherent nature of soil moisture variability and uncertainty associated with the downscaling models lakshmi 2013 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 due to the limited soil moisture data availability many downscaling methods were developed with input data collected over a short time span and a limited spatial domain they often required a scene to scene calibration with large ancillary input data e g a gridded climatic data at a high spatial resolution to achieve a high resolution downscaling peng et al 2017 downscaling methods based on fusing passive microwave retrievals with optical thermal data such as land surface temperature lst surface albedo and vegetation indices can provide a high spatial resolution soil moisture product e g merlin et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2009 piles et al 2011 among such methods the algorithms based on the universal triangle concept between soil moisture lst and vegetation index carlson et al 1994 have shown good results especially in arid and semi arid regions peng et al 2017 disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch is one of such models tested over the murrumbidgee river catchment in south eastern australia merlin et al 2012 in the dispatch model the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lsts at 1 km spatial resolution were divided into soil and vegetation components based on the universal triangle carlson et al 1994 petropoulos et al 2009 and later modified as the trapezoidal model to distinguish the variability of soil moisture across fully vegetated surfaces merlin et al 2008 2010 2012 moran et al 1994 the dispatch model has shown a notable variation in the accuracy of the downscaled products with the season depicting rmses of 0 06 m3 m3 in summer and 0 18 m3 m3 in the winter merlin et al 2012 sabaghy et al 2018 soil thermal inertia based downscaling approaches see the section 4 2 for further discussion have been tested by a number of researchers with encouraging results over arid and semi arid regions fang et al 2013 2018 fang and lakshmi 2014 and senanayake et al 2019 the background of this method goes back to the mallick et al 2009 where modis lsts and vegetation indices were used to estimate soil wetness index which was then converted into 1 km resolution soil moisture lakshmi 2013 the thermal inertia principle was used by minacapilli et al 2009 to estimate soil moisture at a bare soil field using airborne thermal infrared observations fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 used soil moisture and soil temperature information extracted from the north american land data assimilation system nldas dataset at 12 5 km spatial resolution to develop a regression tree based downscaling methods at a monthly time scale these regression models were used to map the catchment scale spatial variability of soil moisture at a high spatial resolution 1 km senanayake et al 2019 developed a similar regression tree model for downscaling but by using a long term point scale in situ observation from a monitoring network in south eastern australia in nldas and in situ data based models fang et al 2013 fang and lakshmi 2014 senanayake et al 2019 the relationship between the diurnal difference of soil temperature δt and the daily mean soil moisture content μsm were captured respectively by using long term time records of lsm outputs or in situ observations in these studies the δt μsm relationship developed at one spatial resolution i e point scale vs 12 5 km aerial resolution was used to infer the spatial variability of soil moisture at a different resolution e g 1 km resolution assuming its consistency across the spatial scales this underlying presumption cannot be easily tested due to the limited soil moisture data availability here we argue that a long term time record of in situ observations from representative locations provides a reliable δt and μsm dataset under different climatic and vegetation conditions and furthermore this temporal dynamics of soil moisture help to understand the spatial variability of soil moisture across the scales chen et al 2014 on the other hand reliable lsm outputs would capture this overall change dynamics consistently under different climatic and vegetation conditions but averaged over their pixels the mutual agreement between upscaled in situ lsm outputs and satellite observations and the consistency in the downscaled products derived from in situ or lsm based models may suggest the robustness of the proposed approach and its potential for the operational use in many other locations without requiring local input data readily available soil moisture and soil temperature model outputs such as the global land data assimilation system gldas dataset comes in a much coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km therefore it is crucial to evaluate and compare the performance of in situ data based and gldas based downscaling models such a comparison provides insights on the effect of model resolution onto the downscaling product and its accuracy this paper follows on the study from senanayake et al 2019 and compares the performance of two variants of a model to downscale satellite soil moisture products built at two different spatial resolutions here two δt μsm regression tree models built at two scales i using a point scale in situ dataset and ii 25 km spatial resolution global land data assimilation system gldas dataset over a semi arid australian catchment the downscaled soil moisture was compared against in situ observations and the model was further tested against high resolution airborne retrievals from the national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 panciera et al 2008 the approach developed here is applicable to elsewhere with globally available gldas dataset it can easily update the soil moisture information at a high spatial resolution with newly available satellite information without the need to perform a calibration for each scene separately also this model does not require the datasets such as precipitation and evapotranspiration which are difficult to obtain at a high spatial resolution the effect of those factors over a region is included in the δt μsm relationship for each day while the temporal effect of those factors is eliminated by bias correcting with coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product 2 study area this study was conducted over the northern half of the goulburn river catchment located in the upper hunter region of nsw australia the goulburn river catchment extends from latitudes 31 46 s to 32 51 s and longitudes 149 40 e to 150 36 e and located 150 km northwest to sydney over an area of 7000 km2 fig 1 the elevation of the catchment varies from 100 m to 1300 m from the floodplains towards the mountain ranges at northern and southern parts of the catchment the catchment shows a semi arid climatic condition with an average annual rainfall of 700 mm which increases from 500 mm in floodplains to 1100 mm at higher altitudes the catchment has a clear distinction between its northern and southern halves based on land use land cover and soil characteristics the northern half consists of mostly grazing and cropping representing typical agricultural landscape in south eastern australia fig 2 a and dominated by basalt derived soils the southern half encompasses of dense vegetation and dominated by sandstone conglomerate and shale derived rocks in summer and winter the monthly mean temperatures of the catchment vary from 16 to 30 c and 3 to 17 c respectively rüdiger et al 2003 2007 krui 562 km2 and merriwa 651 km2 river catchments located in the northern half of the goulburn river catchment were the main foci of this study fig 2 b e show the topography and soil texture over the krui and merriwa river catchments 3

and streamflow sasmas project http www eng newcastle edu au sasmas sasmas sasmas htm from 2002 at 26 sites to measure soil moisture content at different soil layers across the root zone 0 90 cm with soil temperature and other auxiliary parameters fig 1 and table 2 krui river catchment was instrumented with six monitoring stations merriwa river catchment and stanley micro catchment were instrumented with seven monitoring stations in each catchment martinez et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 at the initial stage of the sasmas project three vertical campbell scientific cs616 water content reflectometers were installed at sites to measure soil moisture content at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil layers at a later stage starting in 2005 the sites were instrumented with stevens water hydraprobes to measure soil moisture content at the top 5 cm and soil temperature at 2 5 cm soil depths the top 5 cm soil depth can be considered as the depth of penetration of the l band microwave radiation o neill et al 2010 the sasmas soil moisture and soil temperature measurements were taken at each one minute and averaged over 20 min intervals the dataset was compiled into hourly daily weekly and monthly average values after careful data quality control the daily mean soil moisture of the near surface top 5 cm soil layer was used as μsm values when developing the downscaling models the top 5 cm soil moisture and soil temperature observations from sasmas sites in the krui and merriwa river catchments were used in this work to develop downscaling algorithms and for validation the sasmas dataset from 2005 to 2015 consists of some data gaps at multiple stations over different time periods due to a number of reasons such as sensor telemetry failures and removing erroneous readings caused by soil cracking specially in clay rich areas in the northern half of krui and merriwa river catchments and ponding of water after extreme rainfall events this area has experienced climatic extremes during this period including the millennium drought from 2001 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 pasha bulker storm in 2007 a 100 year return period storm event mills et al 2010 and strong la niña events in 2010 2011 boening et al 2012 this long term sasmas dataset was able to capture diverse soil moisture conditions across its temporal domain and hence to build a robust statistical downscaling model see section 4 the land use land cover soil texture and topographic information of the sasmas monitoring sites in the krui and merriwa river catchments and the stanley micro catchment are given in table 2 the sasmas monitoring stations were established at mid slope sites with representative soil vegetation and topographic characteristics rüdiger et al 2003 2007 these locations are able to provide representative soil moisture over the whole catchment chen et al 2014 and hence upon upscaling sasmas observations could represent soil moisture content over a coarse resolution satellite footprint grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 crow et al 2012 senanayake et al 2019 in their study at stanley micro catchment area chen et al 2014 showed that a point scale soil moisture measurements can be extrapolated over a catchment with homogeneous soil texture and vegetation further kunkel et al 2016 found that the temperature characteristics to be similar over the catchments with similar land surface properties in their study over this area they also found that the soil temperature measurements at a geographic centre of the catchments can represent the average soil temperature characteristics over those catchments 3 2 gldas estimates for the lsm estimate based regression tree model three hourly outputs of the top 10 cm soil moisture and soil temperature

grid cells covering the study area fig 3 note that the effective soil depth of the gldas near surface soil moisture estimates 0 10 cm is different from the near surface soil moisture measured by the sasmas in situ monitoring network and the l band satellites i e 0 5 cm however in situ sasmas data showed that soil temperature values of these two depths are closely identical over the study area

cylindrical 36 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 0 ease grid 2 0 o neill et al 2016 the smap 36 km radiometric product has generally shown its target accuracy unbiased rmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3

using the mean difference overall a better performance was observed at cvs where cultivated agriculture is not the dominating land use type the inability of the retrieval algorithms to capture highly heterogeneous surface roughness and vegetation conditions across different seasons can be identified as the reasons behind the lower accuracies of smap soil moisture products across the cultivated lands colliander et al 2017 and forests fig 3 shows the study area with the smap 36 km grid 3 4 modis lst and ndvi products the δt values were calculated at 1 km spatial resolution using am and pm lsts extracted from the modis aqua lst and emissivity lst e daily l3 global 1 km grid v006 myd11a1 dataset wan et al 2015 to predict 1 km resolution soil moisture the am and pm overpass times of modis aqua satellite over the study area 01 00 h and 13 00 h provided good approximates for daily minimum and maximum lsts for calculating δt values when compared with in situ data senanayake et al 2019 ndvi values over the study area at 1 km spatial resolution for the period of 2005 2015 were extracted from the modis terra vegetation indices 16 day l3 global 1 km grid mod13a2 dataset didan 2015 and were linearly interpolated over the time to acquire a time record of daily ndvi estimates at each sasmas station 3 5 soil and landscape grid national soil attributes maps the soil clay content of the 0 5 cm layer in the study area was obtained from the national soil attributes maps of the soil and landscape grid a k a national soil grid of australia at 90 m spatial resolution https data csiro au grundy et al 2015 the top 5 cm soil clay content of the dataset showed an average uncertainty of 18 5 across the country rossel et al 2015 3 6 nafe 05 airborne dataset the nafe 05 l band airborne campaign was conducted over a 40 km 40 km land area within krui and merriwa catchments fig 3 this campaign was carried through four consecutive mondays commencing from 31st october 2005 to provide smos simulations using an l band radiometer the airborne and the field data collections during nafe 05 were carried out with the objectives of developing smos retrieval algorithms developing downscaling algorithms and assimilating smos retrievals with lsms to estimate root zone soil moisture panciera et al 2008 a long drying period after rainfall events on 31st october and 1st november 2005 created very wet saturated to very dry conditions in near surface soil moisture during the nafe 05 campaign panciera et al 2008 nafe 05 airborne soil moisture dataset was obtained by employing a polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr with a two channel inversion of the l band microwave emission of the biosphere l meb model panciera et al 2009 the nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals consist of a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km though with the pixels varying from 860 m to 1 070 m in size as a result of constant flight altitudes above the median elevation across the heterogeneous terrain the airborne datasets were obtained between 6 00 h and 10 00 h in the morning along the flight lines oriented in north south direction with an average altitude of 3000 m above ground level agl panciera et al 2008 nafe 05 soil moisture dataset showed an accuracy of 0 04 0 05 v v gao et al 2018 4 methodology the methodology of this study is summarized in fig 4 4 1 inter comparison of datasets the accuracy of the downscaling work is highly dependent on the accuracy of the datasets used firstly soil moisture datasets captured by smap gldas and sasmas were compared and secondly modis ndvi data captured at point scale and aggregated over the gldas pixels were compared these comparisons provide insights onto how soil moisture and ndvi values have been captured over the area at different spatial domains across scales during the study period 4 2 developing the downscaling models the two variants of the downscaling model were developed based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between δt and μsm following fang et al 2013 and senanayake et al 2019 thermal inertia ti is the resistance of an object to change its temperature as a response to the temperature fluctuations in the surrounding environment sellers 1965 and relates to the object s bulk density ρ in kg m 3 specific heat capacity k in j kg 1 k 1 and the thermal conductivity c in w m 1 k 1 wang et al 2010 i e 1 ti ρ k c wet soils demonstrate a higher thermal inertia compared to dry soils due to the high specific heat capacity of water this results in a proportionality between soil wetness and thermal inertia soil thermal inertia shows an inversely proportional relationship with δt so δt can be given as a function of thermal inertia engman 1991 i e 2 δ t f 1 ti therefore wet soils exhibit low δt and vice versa leading to an inversely proportional relationship between μsm and δt this relationship can be affected by other factors including vegetation cover and soil texture which determines the water holding capacity of soils engman 1991 farrar et al 1994 pratt and ellyett 1979 sandholt et al 2002 4 2 1 developing the point scale in situ data based downscaling model a regression tree model has the potential of mapping such non linear relationships between soil moisture and temperature modulated by other factors by using a rule based classification system such a model can be used for lookup functions between input e g radiometric soil moisture product and other environmental data and target variables e g 1 km soil moisture products under different conditions de ath and fabricius 2000 fang et al 2013 senanayake et al 2019 the first variant of the δt μsm regression tree model was developed using the top 5 cm observations of the hourly sasmas in situ soil moisture and soil temperature data nearly 20 000 δt μsm data records from ten monitoring stations located in krui and merriwa catchments were used to build this regression tree model the early morning tam and mid afternoon tpm soil temperature values were extracted in accordance with the modis aqua daytime and night time overpass times across the catchments i e 13 00 and 01 00 h to calculate δt values for each day i e 3 δ t t pm t am chen et al 2014 have showed vegetation index and soil type as the key parameters driving the soil moisture patterns over this study area using physics based hydrologic model hydrus simunek et al 1998 accordingly season ndvi and soil clay content were employed as modulating factors similar to senanayake et al 2019 many researchers have showed a strong relationship between soil moisture and vegetation cover and their interrelationship on available water capacity and transpiration on the other hand soil temperature is regulated by soil moisture and vegetation cover taktikou et al 2016 therefore vegetation density acts as a modulating factor for δt μsm relationship a detailed classification of ndvi has a potential of providing a better accuracy but can lead to the overfitting in this study the regression trees were classified into three ndvi classes based on vegetation density following silva et al 2016 i e ndvi 0 4 as no vegetation cover to grass 0 4 ndvi 0 6 as moderate vegetation cover and ndvi 0 6 as dense vegetation cover soil clay content at monitoring sites were extracted from the sasmas site descriptions and subsequently classified into two classes here we used the classification of heavy soils clay soils and others as per bonan 2015 i e i clay or heavy soils clay 35 and ii other soils clay 35 to classify the regression trees clay content was chosen as a modulating factor in the regression tree by considering the effect of soil texture on soil thermal properties such as thermal conductive which directly affects thermal inertia of the soil abu hamdeh 2003 in addition the distribution of soil clay content over krui and merriwa river catchments and sasmas stations medians 40 and 30 respectively were considered when defining these ranges separate regression trees were built for each season considering the seasonal temperature changes in australia austral seasons are defined as spring from september to november summer from december to february autumn from march to may and winter from june to august considering lag in heating and cooling as per the sun s movement across the equator these are often use when analysing climatic based statistics bureau of meteorology australia 2020 classification by season will help to minimize the effect of daily cooling and heating to the δt μsm regression tree model 4 2 2 eveloping the 25 km resolution gldas estimates based downscaling model the second variant of the regression tree model was developed by using top 10 cm δt and μsm gldas outputs at 25 km resolution tpm and tam were extracted by considering the modis aqua daytime and night time overpass times i e 13 00 h and 01 00 h modis 16 day 1 km ndvi values were temporally interpolated at a daily time step as explained in section 3 4 and then spatially averaged over 25 km gldas grid to obtain the daily spatial average over gldas grid cells the 25 km ndvi values were classified into 3 classes similar to section 4 2 1 however clay content could not be employed in this regression tree model as soil characteristics were simulated as lumped parameter after the spatial averaging over gldas grid cells hence the sub grid spatial variability of soil clay content could not be explicitly shown with the gldas estimate based model for each of the gldas pixels separate regression trees were developed by using the time series of 25 km scale δt μsm and ndvi records for each season about 6 500 δt and μsm data pairs over each gldas pixel were employed in developing the regression tree model from 2000 to 2017 similar to the in situ data based model the long term gldas dataset was used to build a robust regression tree model note that the dataset from april to december 2015 and november 2005 was not used for model building since they were used for validation 4 3 estimating soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution to estimate soil moisture at 1 km δt μsm ndvi data and soil clay content data were fed into the regression tree models at a spatial resolution of 1 km the daily δt values were extracted from modis daytime and night time lsts eq 3 in year 2015 for downscaling smap and november 2005 for downscaling aggregated airborne nafe data modis derived lst values showed a strong correlation with sasmas near surface soil temperature observations with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 74 and 0 76 at daytime and night time respectively senanayake et al 2019 accordingly a linear calibration was applied to modis lst values against sasmas in situ observations before calculating δt values this helped to minimize any bias including the effect of the mismatch between effective sensing depths i e skin temperature with modis and sasmas soil temperature measured at 2 5 cm depth soil clay content was obtained at 1 km resolution by spatially averaging the clay content from the national soil grid over the 1 km modis grid the downscaling work has been undertaken with i smap 36 km radiometric product in 2015 and ii using aggregated l band airborne soil moisture products from the nafe 05 in november 2005 the nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals aggregated over the 40 km 40 km area of airborne campaign provided an approximation for a coarse spatial resolution l band satellite soil moisture product the coarse resolution smap and aggregated nafe 05 l band soil moisture products were downscaled using 4 s m ds p s m est p s m sat q 1 n i 1 n s m est i where smds p is downscaled soil moisture at 1 km pixel p smest p is soil moisture at pixel p estimated by the regression tree model smsat q is the radiometric satellite soil moisture value at the coarse resolution pixel q where p is laid within n is the total count of 1 km pixels within the coarse resolution pixel q and smest i is estimated soil moisture at a 1 km pixel i i 1 n within the pixel q eq 4 shows that the estimated soil moisture values are bias corrected using the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product after soil moisture values at 1 km are estimated by the regression tree models based on the δt μsm relationship in the section 4 2 1 4 2 2 4 4 validation of the downscaled soil moisture products firstly the validation of the downscaled products was performed by comparing the downscaled smap soil moisture with sasmas in situ data observations from three sasmas sites k 3 s 3 and m 6 were employed in this comparison based on the availability of soil moisture data of the top 5 cm soil layer secondly the downscaled product of aggregated nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals was compared against the 1 km airborne retrievals from nafe 05 on 7th 14th and 21st november 2005 the second comparison was carried through since the number of in situ stations were insufficient to represent the soil moisture variability and its changing spatial pattern over the study area r2 and ubrmse were used to evaluate the model performance at 1 km downscaling resolution ubrmse can be defined as 5 ubrmse p 1 n θ ds p θ ds θ obs p θ obs 2 n 1 where θds p and θobs p are downscaled and observed soil moisture at 1 km pixel p n is number of pixels or observations p 1 n θ ds and θ obs are means of downscaled and observed soil moisture values respectively colliander et al 2018 entekhabi et al 2010b ubrmse is useful in comparison between soil moisture captured at pixels scale against point scale in situ data especially when the number of in situ monitoring stations are limited colliander et al 2018 6 r 2 1 θ i θ r e g i 2 θ i θ 2 where θreg i is the soil moisture of predicted from the regression between θds and θobs at i th value 5 results 5 1 inter comparison of datasets the comparison between smap 36 km radiometric soil moisture product and the average sasmas in situ soil moisture observations over the smap grid cell sp 2 fig 3 from april to december 2015 is shown in fig 6 a note this is the study time period when both datasets are available a slight underestimation of smap soil moisture is apparent in fig 6 compared with sasmas in situ observations an ubrmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3 and a r2 value of 0 75 fig 6b showed a good temporal agreement between the two datasets the comparison between the gldas 25 km soil moisture estimates and the average sasmas soil moisture observations over two gldas grid cells gl 3 and gl 4 fig 3 is shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows the temporal agreement of gldas and sasmas soil moisture from 2007 to 2015 over these two grid cells an overestimation was observed for gldas compared to in situ observations as expected gldas estimates showed much less variable soil moisture compared to the sasmas in situ observations fig 8 shows the results from the comparison of smap and gldas soil moisture estimates over four smap 36 km soil moisture pixels the two datasets showed a good temporal agreement fig 8a though an underestimation can be observed in smap relative to gldas especially for dryer conditions fig 9 a shows temporally averaged modis 1 km ndvi values over the study area point scale ndvi values at sasmas stations averaged over each gldas grid cell are shown in fig 9b and 1 km modis ndvi values spatially averaged over gldas grid cells are shown in fig 9c similar to fig 9a the temporal means of modis ndvi values over the period of 2004 to 2014 were used in fig 9b c the point scale ndvi values extracted at sasmas stations and 1 km ndvi values over the study area upscaled to the gldas grid showed similar characteristics in the north south direction the denser vegetation in the northern part and moderate vegetation cover cropping and grazing in the southern part fig 9a have been represented i e point scale ndvi values at sasmas stations and 1 km ndvi values when upscaled to the gldas grid however the areal average of ndvi over the gldas grid cells located in the northern half fig 9c showed higher values compared to the upscaled point data fig 9b this can be due to the lack of sasmas stations in the area covered with dense vegetation across the northernmost part of the catchments with high rainfalls also fig 9b c both show that gridding the ndvi over 25 km gldas grid has improved the spatial representation of vegetation cover compared to a single ndvi value averaged over the study area 5 2 evaluating the downscaling models a summary in table 3 shows a comparison between the in situ based and gldas based downscaling models the regressions developed for austral spring using sasmas in situ observations for all three ndvi classes with clay content 35 clay content 35 and without using clay content are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively the regressions developed using gldas estimates for the spring at gl 3 grid cell are shown in fig 10d statistics of the regression models shown in fig 10 are given in appendix 1 as expected adding clay content has improve the strength of the model and this can be shown as an advantage of the in situ data based model the fluctuations of both soil moisture and soil temperature are rapid at the surface soil layer due to its direct exposure to the solar radiation and other climate forcing compared to deeper soil layers adams et al 2015 choi and jacobs 2007 gülser and ekberli 2004 the larger effective soil depth 0 10 cm and moderation of temperature and soil moisture over a larger spatial modelling resolution 25 km can be possible reasons for the smaller δt and μsm ranges calculated by the gldas estimates compared to the sasmas in situ observations and this directly affected the regression model fit fig 10 and downscaled soil moisture products 5 3 validation of the downscaled soil moisture 5 3 1 comparing downscaled soil moisture with sasmas in situ data fig 11 a shows the temporal agreement of downscaled soil moisture products against in situ observations downscaled products from both the in situ and gldas follow very similar patterns they demonstrated a good spatial and temporal agreement with sasmas in situ observations but with a slight underestimation at m6 which consists of vertisols with high clay content table 2 this type of soils undergoes volumetric expansions during wetting and soil cracks during dry periods the in situ data based model and the gldas estimate based models showed encouraging results with ubrmses of 0 07 and 0 10 cm3 cm3 respectively against the sasmas in situ data fig 11b and c the downscaled datasets from the two models showed a good agreement with an ubrmse of 0 05 cm3 cm3 against each other fig 11d fig 12 shows a comparison between smap 36 km radiometric soil moisture product and downscaled smap soil moisture products achieved from both models on 14th august 2015 over the study area table 4 describes the agreement between downscaled data and in situ observations at the sasmas stations k3 s3 and m6 separately 5 3 2 comparing downscaled soil moisture against airborne soil moisture retrievals comparison between nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals and downscaled soil moisture products are shown in fig 13 a c fig 13d e show the absolute difference between nafe 05 retrievals and downscaled soil moisture from in situ data based and gldas estimates based models respectively the downscaled soil moisture from both models showed similar results with a good agreement with nafe 05 observations fig 14 a and b boxplots in fig 14c shows a comparison of the distributions of soil moisture as captured by the nafe 05 and the downscaled soil moisture products from in situ data based and gldas estimate based models on 7th 14th and 21st november 2005 it shows that both models captured the drying down of soil moisture the overall change trend with mean but limited to capture the variability in soil moisture in the study area however both models seemed to capture the relative wetness of soil moisture illustrating similar soil moisture change patterns compared to nafe 05 observations fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 comparison of datasets smap showed a good agreement with sasmas in situ observations with an ubrmse of 0 04 cm3 cm3 i e smap expected accuracy globally however smap soil moisture observations have decreased with time more rapidly than in situ observations showing a slight underestimation bias at drying fig 6a this general underestimation of smap against in situ observations has been identified previously especially for vegetated surfaces and dry down periods chen et al 2017 ma et al 2017 for example the smap grid cell sp 2 is mostly covered with cropping and grazing therefore the vegetation response can affect the smap signal jackson and schmugge 1991 ma et al 2017 the uncertainties in auxiliary data layers used in smap retrieval algorithms chen et al 2017 mismatches between the sensing depths between satellites and in situ observations adams et al 2015 and uncertainties in in situ data can also contribute to this discrepancy the gldas derived soil moisture estimates on the other hand are associated with uncertainties caused by model input structure and parameter errors the comparison between sasmas and gldas soil temperature showed a good agreement with 1 1 linear relationship appendix 2 3 this strong linear correlation between sasmas and gldas soil temperatures seems to suggest that sasmas stations located in mid slope locations can represent the soil temperature over a larger extent due to the average incidence radiation and similar land surface properties such as vegetation and soil kunkel et al 2016 while both showed very similar early morning temperature with less variability r2 0 92 with ubrmse 1 7 c but more variable changes in mid afternoon soil temperature r2 0 76 with ubrmse 3 6 c were noticed this relatively large difference in the mid afternoon soil moisture compared to the early morning temperature between two datasets could amplify their differences in the diurnal temperature difference and produced different soil moisture patterns after the downscaling especially during the dry conditions similarly the ndvi values extracted from sasmas stations also show their ability to represent a larger extent such as the study catchment however the areal average of ndvi over the gldas grid cells located in the northern half showed higher values compared to the upscaled point data from the sasmas site section 5 1 it was due to relatively low the spatial coverage of the study catchment area within the gldas grid cell i e less representative sasmas site over the gldas spatial domain to capture the vegetation distribution patterns the differences in ndvi along with δt between two models directly affected downscaling results 6 2 evaluating downscaling models and soil moisture datasets a long term record of soil moisture and temperature from the sasmas monitoring network stations and the gldas outputs showed the consistent δt μsm relationship despite the differences in input data spatial domain and scales soil moisture changes are highly variable over the spatial and temporal domains and its interpolation at any given spatial scale e g paddock scale cannot be easily done without extensive monitoring and detailed modelling over the study extent the study results suggest upscaling of in situ i e point scale observations from selected sites representative for the study area or use of the globally available lsm outputs at a coarse spatial scale e g 25 km with high quality forcing and process representation may help to overcome the data gap to downscale soil moil moisture at 1 km the long term data records from both datasets were consistent with each other and agreed well with multiple satellite data products the gldas based downscaling model can be applied over larger extents since gldas estimates are available globally at 25 km spatial resolution the accuracy of the lsm output based downscaling models is dependent on the representativeness of the spatially averaged land surface properties across its grid cells the accuracy of an in situ data based model on the other hand depends on the data quality size of the dataset number of stations and their spatial distribution and representativeness for the study area for example the sasmas network has a good potential in effectively representing the catchment as a whole even with a limited number of stations due to the catchment representative locations of its monitoring stations grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 the in situ data based regression tree model has the ability and flexibility to be improved by adding site specific factors such as soil texture and topography with further classification for example the clay rich soils clay content 35 showed higher soil moisture ranges and low δt ranges compared to soils with clay content 35 fig 10a and b a regression model without soil classification e g fig 10c was unable to capture the effect of soil texture on soil moisture variability appendix 1 including soil factor has improved the soil moisture distribution pattern during the wet state fig 13 such a classification is unachievable with the gldas based regression tree model since on site factors such as soil texture are lumped i e no sub grid variability in input and parameter values over the 25 km grid cells if the classification based on clay content is disregarded the in situ data based gldas estimate based models showed very similar regressions lines e g fig 10c and d and appendix 1 the uncertainties caused by the sharp boundaries in the regression tree classification can be minimized by employing classification schemes such as fuzzy logic based classification scheme lemos et al 2011 the downscaled soil moisture product from the in situ data based model outperformed its gldas based counterpart when compared with the sasmas in situ dataset fig 11 this can be due to the use of sasmas data in building the in situ data based model which can probably give better results over the sasmas stations the downscaled smap and aggregated nafe 05 soil moisture maps fig 13b c from both models showed the general northward increasing gradient of the soil moisture over the study area resulted by the rainfall patterns and the soil texture the downscaled soil moisture from the gldas estimate based model showed slightly smoothed patterns with an apparent tile effect compared to those from the in situ data based downscaling model fig 13c this tile effect appears mainly due to having different regression algorithms for each gldas grid cell a similar tile effect can be seen in fig 12 caused by coarse scale smap pixels the drying period after the rainfall events at the beginning of nafe 05 experiment can be observed in both the downscaled soil moisture products fig 14c however nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals showed higher variance of soil moisture compared to its downscaled counterpart the absence of factors affecting the spatial variability of soil moisture e g crop types and more detailed classifications of these factors might be a reason for the lower variance of soil moisture at the downscaled products downscaled soil moisture from both models show less absolute error against nafe 05 soil moisture retrievals during dry conditions i e 0 17 cm3 cm3 average soil moisture content with a standard deviation of 0 06 cm3 cm3 on 21st november 2005 compared to wet conditions i e 0 41 cm3 cm3 average soil moisture content with a standard deviation of 0 08 cm3 cm3 on 7th november 2005 fig 11d and e it was expected as the variability of soil moisture reduced as the study site dried down during the dry conditions the gldas based model captured the spatial soil moisture patterns slightly better than in situ based model the in situ observations showed more variability and its δt μsm relationship was more sensitive to the relative changes i e a steeper slope compared to the gldas based model fig 10 further the gldas soil temperature showed less variable and underestimated mid afternoon temperature and hence a smaller and more subtle δt changes during the dry condition with relatively high ndvi in late spring following the rainfalls and smaller δt during the dry condition the gldas showed subtle change patterns of soil moisture while these differences were underestimated and less obvious from the in situ data based downscaled products errors presented in the nafe 05 airborne soil moisture retrievals gao et al 2018 is another contributor to the ubrmse of the comparison between downscaled and nafe 05 soil moisture both in situ data and gldas based downscaling models show promising results over the study area the downscaled soil moisture data are able to provide detailed information about the spatial variability of soil moisture compared to available smap soil moisture products both models despite their different spatial domains were able to capture the heterogeneity of δt μsm relationship and the influence of vegetation relatively well the insights here provide confidence to develop and test a combined in situ data and gldas estimate based model over a larger area 6 3 future work the effect of atmospheric forcing on δt values can impose uncertainties to the current model although the model was classified based on austral season considering seasonal temperature difference the δt μsm relationship can be affected by the variation of temperature under different atmospheric environments including atmospheric forcing factors that affect the energy and water fluxes including wind speed and daily mean temperature can improve the accuracy of the model similarly including more localised biophysical variables such as topography and albedo can be used to improve the model considering their influence on δt μsm relationship for example topography of the study area which has an increase towards north table 2 has effects on solar radiation lst and precipitation patterns this topographic effect was not captured in the current model the readily available gldas outputs were used in this study using the land surface models tailed for the regional area with the local forcing data gridded at a high spatial resolution would improve the downscaling results the joint uk land environment simulator jules best et al 2011 and community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable kowalczyk et al 2006 wang et al 2011 models can be suggested for the future work in australia the data gaps in the downscaled products caused by the cloud contamination is a major drawback in the optical thermal data based downscaling methods especially when both tpm and tam data are required zhao and li 2015 employing lst data from geostationary satellites that provide lst data at a high temporal resolution to obtain the possible cloud free tpm and tam approximates within a longer time window might be suggested as potential methods to address this problem the cloud contamination problems might be addressed by calibrating model derived soil moisture estimates with downscaled products spatial and temporal interpolation methods statistical methods and use of persistent spatial patterns for gap filling ghafarian malamiri et al 2018 metz et al 2017 padhee and dutta 2020 pham et al 2019 yang and hu 2018 there is an ongoing work of producing a consistent smap and smos combined l band soil moisture product with 1 day temporal resolution bindlish et al 2017 given its high temporal resolution downscaling this combined dataset has the potential of providing a better time record of high spatial resolution soil moisture products 7 conclusion two variants of the δt μsm relationship based regression tree models were built by using long term i point scale in situ data and ii 25 km resolution gldas estimates to downscale coarse spatial resolution soil moisture products smap 36 km gridded product and aggregated nafe 05 airborne soil moisture products were downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using the regression models with the aid of modis lst ndvi and soil data both these models though built at two different spatial scales showed promising results with a good accuracy level the long term in situ soil moisture observations from the sasmas sites and gldas model outputs provided representative areal responses to capture changes in soil moisture and temperature under different climate and vegetation growth conditions and helped to develop robust the thermal inertia relationship between the diurnal temperature δt and the daily mean soil moisture μsm for downscaling satellite soil moisture products given their strengths and drawbacks the results augur well in building a combined in situ and lsm output based downscaling model to build a long term time record of soil moisture in arid semi arid regions and easily update soil moisture information without much scene to scene corrections credit authorship contribution statement i p senanayake conceptualization methodology software investigation

4871,given increasing demand for high frequency streamflow series hfss at daily and subdaily time scales there is increasing need for reliable metrics of relative variability for such series hfss can exhibit enormous relative variability especially in comparison with low frequency streamflow series formed by aggregation of hfss the product moment estimator of the coefficient of variation c defined as the ratio of sample standard deviation to sample mean as well as ten other common estimators of c are shown to provide severely downward biased and highly variable estimates of c for very long records of highly skewed and periodic hfss particularly for rivers which exhibit zeros resorting to the theory of compound distributions we introduce an estimator of c corresponding to a mixture of monthly zero inflated lognormal distributions denoted as a delta lognormal monthly mixture δ ln3mm model through monthly stratification our δ ln3mm model accounts for the seasonality skewness multimodality and the possible intermittency of hfss in comparisons among estimators our δ ln3mm based c estimator is shown to yield much more reliable and approximately unbiased estimates of c not only for small samples but also for very large samples tens of thousands of observations we document values of c in the range of 0 18 42 000 with a median of 1 9 and an interquartile range of 1 34 3 75 for 6807 daily streamflow series across the u s from gages ii dataset with the highest values of c occurring in arid and semiarid regions a multivariate analysis and national contour map reveal that extremely large values of c never previously documented tend to occur in arid watersheds with low runoff ratios which tend to also exhibit a considerable number of zero streamflows keywords relative variability skewness intermittent periodic bimodal zero inflated mixture 1 introduction streamflow variability has a profound impact on nearly every aspect of water resource design planning and management and therefore its quantification plays a key role reliable and unbiased metrics for streamflow variability are needed in a range of activities including but not limited to classification of regional hydrologic homogeneity goodness of fit assessments of hydrologic models evaluation of impacts of climatic variability and change on hydrologic systems and in a wide range of research activities which seek to understand the hydroclimatic mechanisms which give rise to hydrologic variability recent research has shown that high levels of hydrologic variability play a dominant role and create considerable obstacles relating to our ability to estimate very common hydrologic statistics such as the pearson correlation coefficient barber et al 2019 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency goodness of fit metric lamontagne et al 2020 among the existing measures of relative variability the coefficient of variation c introduced by pearson 1896 pp 276 277 is now perhaps the most widely used metric c is defined as c σ μ where μ and σ denote the population mean and standard deviation respectively of the random variable of interest the index c has been applied in many other research areas including business engineering science medicine economics psychology and other social sciences as well as many other fields nairy and rao 2003 kelley 2007 soliman et al 2012 alternatively the standard deviation σ is often used for comparing the variability of samples because it has the same units as the random variable of interest however when one s interest is in comparing the relative variability of several samples each with different mean values c is preferred to σ because it is nondimensional and thus accounts for differences in the mean of the samples in finance the inverse of c is commonly used as a measure of the performance of an investment portfolio knight and satchell 2005 and is often termed the risk to reward ratio we note at the outset that c should only be computed for data measured on a ratio scale and would have no meaning for summarizing data on an interval scale velleman and wilkinson 1993 ratio scale data are equally spaced data which exhibit a zero whereas interval scale data are equally spaced data without a predefined zero point examples of ratio scale variables include streamflow precipitation and temperature measured in kelvin in contrast most common temperature scales e g celsius fahrenheit etc are interval scales with arbitrary zeros so c would be different depending on which scale is used most statistics including c are meaningful for ratio data because their interpretation is unchanged when linear transformations are applied to the data other statistics such as means standard deviations and product moment correlations are meaningful for summarizing data on both ratio and interval scales 1 1 skewness and streamflow variability streamflow variability and skewness are linked vargo et al 2010 fig 3 document the theoretical relationship between c and the coefficient of skewness γ for 36 probability distribution functions pdfs for two parameter pdfs a unique relationship usually exists between c and γ see fig 4 and discussion in vogel and fennessey 1993 for example for positively skewed gamma and ln2 variables γ is related to c via the relations γ 2 c and γ 3 c c 3 respectively for more complex pdfs with more than two parameters there is usually no unique relationship between c and γ however there still remains a linkage between the two given by a two dimensional region within the plot of c versus γ as depicted in fig 3 of vargo et al 2010 it is widely understood that streamflow observations exhibit both variability and skewness yet due to numerous factors discussed in section 1 5 the most common and widely used product moment estimators of the coefficients of variation c and skewness γ exhibit both severe downward bias and variability and are generally not to be trusted even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands see vogel and fennessey 1993 obtaining reliable estimates of c for daily flow series constitutes the central challenge of this study initial efforts to obtain reliable estimates of c for daily streamflow series were made by limbrunner et al 2000 and vogel et al 2003 who applied an l moment estimator of c based on a three parameter lognormal distribution to flow series at 1571 watersheds across the u s vogel et al 2003 reported values of c for daily flow series ranging from approximately 0 5 to 10 000 with a median value of 10 and an interquartile range from 3 to 33 we were unable to find examples of such high values of c reported for any other variables across multiple disciplines which in part explains the need for new methods introduced here 1 2 influence of aggregation on streamflow variability in the past many water resources design planning and management problems relied on low frequency streamflow series lfss such as annual and monthly series resulting from the temporal aggregation average of daily hourly or subhourly high frequency streamflow series hfss all such lfss exhibit much less variability than the hfss from which they were created regardless of the random variable of interest aggregation leads to a reduction in variability given our focus on streamflow variability it is instructive to first consider the impact of aggregation of independent and identically distributed series the aggregation i e taking the average of any independent and identically distributed iid random variable x over n intervals leads to a drop in its standard deviation σ to σ n so that the coefficient of variation of the aggregated variable denoted as c n is reduced to c n c n assume a daily time scale as a reference and denote the corresponding c as c 1 since average annual streamflows are known to exhibit values of c 365 in the range of 0 2 1 5 across the conterminous u s see vogel et al 1998 one would expect c for daily streamflows to be in the range 3 8 28 5 resulting from the relationship c 1 365 c 365 19 c 365 3 8 28 5 these initial results are only very crude approximations because daily streamflows are neither identically distributed nor independent and both of these factors affect the estimation of c a central focus of this study 1 3 the influence of periodicity on estimates of streamflow variability most streamflow statistics attempt to provide a summary of the statistical behavior of streamflow as distinguished from its physical or deterministic characteristics daily streamflow is subject to numerous deterministic characteristics including a periodic component which is dominated by seasonal climatic conditions which can lead to intermittent and ephemeral streamflows and the occurrence of observations equal to zero hfss such as hourly streamflow may be subject to other forms of periodic behavior such as diurnal variations in a recent study closely related to this study the need to account for periodicity when estimating sample statistics of daily streamflow series was documented by lamontagne et al 2020 in their monte carlo experiments which evaluated the sampling variability of estimates of the goodness of fit metric termed efficiency e fig 4 of lamontagne et al 2020 documents that accounting for the periodic behavior of daily streamflow led to marked reductions in the variability of estimates of e when compared with estimators of e which did not account for streamflow periodicity 1 4 the influence of zeros on streamflow variability zero streamflows are defined as streamflow below the measurement threshold which is approximately 0 01 cfs in the u s granato et al 2017 of the 20 438 u s geological survey usgs river gages evaluated by granato et al 2017 36 of those gages had at least one occurrence of zero streamflow and 2 6 of those gages had more than 297 days per year or 81 3 of zero streamflow according to levick et al 2008 ephemeral and intermittent streams make up approximately 59 of all streams in the united states excluding alaska and over 81 in the arid and semi arid southwest according to the usgs national hydrography dataset such streams usually reside in the headwaters or major tributaries of perennial streams in the southwest since the occurrence of zero daily streamflow is so common we introduce a model which accommodates their occurrence such a model that allows for frequent zero valued observations is known as a zero inflated model we document later using both a zero inflated model and streamflow observations that the occurrence of zero streamflows leads to considerable increases in c requiring estimators of c that accommodate their occurrence 1 5 the sampling properties of estimates of the coefficient of variation c all statistics have both a theoretical and empirical interpretation for example the sample mean x computed from a single sample of length n is a sample estimate of the true or population mean μ the theoretical sampling properties of x are known for any iid variable and can be summarized by the mean and variance of x since e x μ x is said to be an unbiased estimator of μ barber et al 2019 and lamontagne et al 2020 provided examples of the sampling properties of estimates of the correlation coefficient and the nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively the difference between the population c and the mean of estimates of c is often referred to as sampling bias because it results from estimating the true population value by a finite sample wallis et al 1974 first exposed the importance of sampling bias in their seminal paper just a moment bias results from the combination of numerous phenomena acting together the occurrence of zeros skewness persistence and seasonality characterizing hfss lead to considerable challenges associated with estimation of c kirby 1974 also derived an upper bound on the product moment estimator of c which until this study was only considered to be important for small samples values of population c exceeding unity correspond to samples with extremely high skewness leading to enormous downward bias in all ratio estimators commonly used in hydrology for example for the case of population c 10 vogel and fennessey 1993 reported downward bias associated with conventional product moment estimator of c of about 40 and 80 for samples of length 10 000 from synthetic iid samples from lognormal and generalized pareto distributions respectively note that limbrunner et al 2000 vogel et al 2003 and this study all document that a value of c 10 for daily streamflows is not uncommon it is well known that autocorrelation inflates the sampling variance of most statistics vogel et al 1998 and lombardo et al 2014 analyzed the effect of the autocorrelation on the sampling properties of various moments and moment ratios expanding the results of wallis et al 1974 one can think of the impact of autocorrelation as decreasing the effective sample size so that in the limit the sample size approaches unity as the autocorrelation approaches unity which is the case for hfss moreover all ratio estimators are known to exhibit bias which is induced by the fact that the numerator and denominator are often correlated random variables each with different sampling properties of their own resulting in bias in estimation of the overall ratio all product moment ratio estimators are known to exhibit bias due to outliers because very large small observations which are far away from the sample mean exert much more influence than the other observations due to the exponentiation involved in higher order moments in such instances which occur frequently in daily streamflow series observations do not exert the same weight and single or few observations can dictate the value of the sample estimates vogel and fennessey 1993 fig 3 documented the enormous impact of the largest observation even for very large samples of daily streamflows in the tens of thousands they also discussed remarkably large downward bias associated with product moment estimates of skewness and by analogy the same would be true for kurtosis and all other higher order moment ratios for highly skewed bivariate lognormal samples lai et al 1999 concluded that significant upward bias in estimates of the pearson correlation coefficient exist and only begins to disappear for sample sizes in the range of 3 4 million observations barber et al 2019 extend the results of lai et al 1999 to highly skewed and periodic hydrologic series showing clearly that the ordinary product moment estimator of the pearson correlation coefficient should generally be avoided for use with daily and sub daily streamflow series thus there is ample evidence in the literature that new methods are needed to better estimate c for highly skewed hydrologic data even for very large samples the study of the sampling bias associated with commonly used product moment ratio estimators of hfss has received very little attention which is surprising when one considers the increasing attention being given to the application of hfss in water resource management activities it is now commonplace for hydrologists to model streamflow at sub daily scales including hourly and even sub hourly scales for use in flood forecasting as well as for real time stormwater and water quality management activities and in hillslope hydrology applications for example the national water model office of water prediction 2017 provides hourly streamflow forecasts for any location within the u s with increasing focus on challenges relating to big data combined with increasing access to graphical processing units supercomputer resources and the internet of things one can expect to see continuing development of new hfss modeling and data acquisition approaches which will result in profound challenges associated with estimation of various summary statistics corresponding to zero inflated periodic and highly skewed hfss examples of research which address such challenges include this study as well as the two recent studies by barber et al 2019 and lamontagne et al 2020 1 6 study goals the primary goals of this paper are 1 to develop and compare approximately unbiased estimators of c for use with highly skewed periodic and possibly intermittent daily flow series and 2 to apply those estimators to large samples of daily streamflow data to enable a better understanding of the influence of skewness zeros periodicity and other physical factors on the relative variability of streamflow we begin with a literature review of estimators of c followed by introduction of zero inflated and monthly mixture models to deal with periodicity skewness and non perennial rivers three classes of estimators of c are introduced the first class of estimators account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with daily streamflows the second class of estimators account for both skewness and zero inflation while the third class of estimators account for skewness zero inflation and the periodicity of daily streamflows then we perform monte carlo experiments which compare the behavior of these estimators of c and finally we apply those estimators to observed daily flow series across the u s a multivariate analysis and contour map of estimates of c enable us to summarize some of the hydroclimatic mechanisms which drive daily streamflow variability summary and recommendations conclude this study 2 estimation of c literature review our review reveals that nearly all approaches to estimation of c and its sampling properties assume that the random variable of interest is independent and identically distributed iid daily streamflow is neither independent nor identically distributed yet since this is the assumption behind every estimator of c we could locate we begin with a review of the estimators of c which stem from this assumption most literature on the sampling properties of estimators of c assume independent normally distributed variates with extensive results for the approximate mckay 1932 and the exact sampling distribution of estimators of c hendricks and robey 1936 as well as confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing johnson and welch 1940 of particular interest here are the properties of estimators of c for non normal populations yet there are very few publications on this subject koopmans et al 1964 developed analytical confidence intervals for lognormal distributions pang et al 2005 developed confidence interval estimates of c for weibull lognormal and gamma distributions amiri and zwanzig 2010 described the use of resampling approaches based on the bootstrap for computing confidence intervals for c for non normal and non iid samples while there are numerous publications which have introduced methods for construction of confidence intervals for c for non normal populations there is very little attention given to the development of unbiased estimators of c for non normal and periodic populations the central goal of this study banik and kibria 2011 compared numerous estimators of c for skewed distributions soliman et al 2012 considered estimation of c for a burr xii distribution and pang et al 2008 considered estimation of c for a bounded random variable following a beta distribution soliman et al 2011 introduced a simulation based approach to estimation of c for a censored gompertz distribution by far the most common estimator of c is obtained using product moments so that 1 c p m s x x where s x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 and x i 1 n x i n kirby 1974 documented that c k i r b y v x x with v x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n is bounded above with an algebraic upper bound equal to n 1 wallis et al 1974 and vogel and fennessey 1993 documented that c p m is remarkably downward biased with that bias increasing as the skewness increases and or sample size decreases vogel and fennessey 1993 considered much larger sample sizes than wallis et al 1974 and reported that for highly skewed samples from lognormal and generalized pareto models c p m exhibits enormous bias and variance which does not disappear even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands it is for this reason that vogel and fennessey 1993 and others have recommended the use of the l moment ratio known as l cv instead of c because estimates of l cv are nearly unbiased regardless of the distribution from which the samples arise we elect to estimate and focus attention on c instead of l cv because c is still far more widely reported applied and understood than l cv furthermore it is much easier to provide a physical interpretation of c than l cv and one of our goals is to explain the physical drivers of streamflow variability breunig 2011 derived expressions for the bias and variance of c pm 2 for a sample arising from any distribution breunig 2011 reported the bias in c pm 2 as 2 b i a s c pm 2 e c pm 2 c 2 c 3 2 n 3 c 1 2 2 γ where γ is the skewness of the observations of x it would be difficult to use 2 to obtain b i a s c pm instead the reader is referred to vogel and fennessey 1993 fig 5 who report b i a s c pm computed from monte carlo experiments based on lognormal and generalized pareto distributions 2 1 lognormal estimators of c of particular interest in hydrology is the lognormal distribution which may be the most widely used distribution for characterizing a very wide range of skewed hydrologic variables hydrologic applications of the lognormal distribution include the frequency analysis of low flows floods and water quality data flow duration curves rainfall intensity duration waste load allocations and the physical chemical and microbiological properties of soils and other geophysical media including but not limited to hydraulic conductivity soil water retention pore radius and pore capillary pressure chow 1954 stedinger 1980 parkin et al 1988 among others naturally the lognormal assumption is only an approximation though importantly it is a much better approximation than normality which is the assumption associated with most previous research concerning estimation of c vogel et al 1998 considered estimation of c for annual streamflow series that are well approximated by a two parameter lognormal distribution ln2 in this case an attractive estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator 3 c l n 2 exp v y 2 1 where v y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 n and y i 1 n y i n with y ln x another attractive lognormal estimator of c is based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimators umvue of the mean μ finney and variance σ finney 2 introduced by finney 1941 which can be expressed as 4 c f i n n e y σ finney μ finney e 2 y g 2 s y 2 g n 2 n 1 s y 2 e y g s y 2 2 where again y ln x with y i 1 n y i n and s y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 n 1 and g n t k 0 v k v 2 k v v 2 v 2 k v v 1 k 1 k t k with v n 1 parkin et al 1988 compared the sampling properties of the estimators c p m c l n 2 and c f i n n e y under lognormal sampling for n 100 and found that c f i n n e y exhibits significantly lower mean square error than both c p m and c l n 2 particularly for small n and large values of c for large values of n well in excess of 100 we expect c l n 2 and c f i n n e y to have similar performance an approximately unbiased estimator for the ln2 distribution can be derived from eq 2 which yields an expression for b i a s c pm 2 as a function of both skewness and sample size for a lognormal distribution the skewness γ is a function of c so that γ 3 c c 3 which can be combined with 2 to obtain the following approximately unbiased estimator c breunig c pm 2 b i a s c pm 2 c pm 2 c 3 2 n 3 c 1 2 2 γ 5 c pm 2 c breunig 3 2 n 3 c breunig 1 2 2 3 c breunig c breunig 3 eq 5 must be solved for c breunig using an iterative numerical approach such as a newton raphson algorithm an estimate of c can also be obtained by fitting a three parameter lognormal l n 3 distribution resulting in the estimator 6 c l n 3 exp 2 y s y 2 exp s y 2 1 τ exp y s y 2 2 where y ln x τ y 1 n j 1 n y j s y 1 n j 1 n y j y 2 and τ x 1 x n x 0 5 2 x 1 x n 2 x 0 5 the expression for the lower bound τ in 6 is the attractive estimator introduced by stedinger 1980 where x 1 and x n are the smallest and largest nonzero observations respectively and x 0 5 is an estimate of the median of x the condition x 1 x n 2 x 0 5 0 must be satisfied to obtain a reliable estimate of τ in 6 if this condition is not satisfied we assume an ln2 model so that τ 0 and therefore c l n 3 c l n 2 in addition whenever τ 0 using 6 we elected to set τ 0 to ensure that no negative streamflows could be generated later on in our monte carlo experiments 2 2 kappa and wakeby estimators of c blum et al 2017 evaluated the goodness of fit of various pdfs to distributions of nonzero daily streamflow across the u s and found that good approximations to f x include the four parameter kappa kap distribution as well as the three parameter lognormal ln3 however they did not evaluate mixture distributions as we do later on in this study blum et al 2017 also provide a detailed review of studies which have sought to approximate the pdf of daily flow series for various regions of the world more recently brunner and gilleland 2020 fit a separate kappa distribution to the daily streamflows on each day of the year appendix a provides estimators of c for nonzero streamflow series corresponding to the four parameter kappa kap distribution and a five parameter wakeby wak distribution note that we do not constrain the lower bound on the fitted kap and wak distributions to be zero because this approach enables improvements in the goodness of fit of the fitted distributions to the nonzero observations nonzero daily streamflow observations are not usually bounded by zero anyway as there is often a measurement threshold such as 0 01 cfs see rantz et al 1982 page 571 which represents the minimum streamflow measurement reported by the usgs we employ l moment estimators of the parameters of these pdfs based on the work of hosking 1990 and hosking and wallis 1997 using the software developed specifically for these purposes hosking 2017 appendix a derives l moment estimators of c corresponding to the kap and wak distributions termed c kap and c wak respectively 2 3 mixture distributions for streamflow as discussed in the introduction intermittent and ephemeral streamflows are common and result in a mixture of random variables describing 1 the occurrence of zero streamflow and 2 the magnitude of positive streamflow the occurrence of zero streamflows complicates hydrologic frequency analyses because it creates a discontinuity in the pdf of streamflow thus requiring a mixture model to adequately capture the pdf of both zero and nonzeros baldwin and lall 1999 prairie 2006 and others have documented that annual seasonal and other periodic variations in daily streamflow can lead to complex bimodal pdfs unlike single pdfs mixture models provide a flexible approach to capture the potential multimodal behavior of streamflow for this reason mixture models are now widely used in flood frequency analysis and have been found to yield improved estimates of flood quantiles when compared to methods based on single pdfs yan et al 2017 and szulczewski and jakubowki 2018 in summary daily streamflow series exhibit two mixture processes 1 a mixture of periodic components as well as 2 a mixture of zero and non zero flows a discrete continuous distribution is needed to account for both the occurrence of zero streamflows and the strong deterministic signals associated with seasonal periodicity within the daily flow series which can give rise to multimodal behavior in the pdf in the following section we introduce a mixture modeling approach for handling both the occurrence of zeros and periodicity when computing hydrologic summary statistics from daily flow series 2 4 a zero inflated lognormal mixture δ ln3 model for handling zeros and skewness in addition to periodicity and the occurrence of zeros daily and sub daily streamflows are known to exhibit extremely high values of skewness thus any mixture distribution will need to provide a flexible accounting of skewness barber et al 2019 blum et al 2017 and limbrunner et al 2000 fig 6 used l moment diagrams to illustrate that ln2 and ln3 distributions provide a good and very good respectively first approximation to the pdf of daily streamflow observations for hundreds of stations across the conterminous u s other more complex distributions such as the four parameter kappa or five parameter wakeby distribution were found to provide even better fits blum et al 2017 particularly when the model parameters are allowed to vary from day to day brunner and gilleland 2020 unlike this study none of the above cited studies accounted for the discontinuity in the pdf of daily streamflows which can occur with intermittent and ephemeral rivers zero inflated pdfs have been introduced to handle the occurrence of zeros by modeling the streamflow process as a mixture of two processes 1 zero flows and 2 magnitude of non zero values for example guo et al 2016 applied a zero inflated lognormal model which they termed a mixed lognormal model for modeling daily streamflows similarly kedeem et al 1990 and shimizu 1993 applied a zero inflated lognormal model to rainfall processes zero inflated lognormal models were first introduced by aitchison 1955 and are more recently referred to by crow and shimizu 1988 as the delta lognormal model all such models to date referred to as delta lognormal models δ ln2 are three parameter models which combine the ln2 model with a third parameter defined as the probability of a zero observation here we introduce a natural extension to δ ln2 termed the δ ln3 which combines an ln3 model with a probability of zero defined as 1 δ we employ a δ ln3 model because hfss are known to exhibit both zero streamflow as well as the remaining positive streamflows which are typically greater than some positive lower bound τ which represents either the minimum measurement threshold or the minimum value of reported streamflow discharge for example the u s geological survey only report nonzero streamflow discharge measurements above a minimum value of 0 01 cfs rantz et al 1982 page 571 thus in addition to the mean and variance of the nonzero streamflows i e the two parameters of a ln2 model the δ ln3 model has two additional parameters 1 the lower bound τ of the positive streamflows and 2 the probability of zero streamflow 1 δ following the existing literature aitchison 1955 crow and shimizu 1988 shimizu 1993 kedeem et al 1990 guo et al 2016 we define the cumulative distribution function cdf of the mixture process x in month i as f i x p i x x which is made up of the cdf of the zero daily streamflows in month i given by the heaviside step function h i x 0 when x 0 and h i x 1 otherwise and the continuous cdf of the nonzero daily streamflows in month i g i x we extend this model into a monthly mixture model in the next section the cdf of the mixture of zero and nonzero streamflows in month i denoted f i x is given by 7a f i x 1 δ i h i x δ i g i x which can be rewritten as 7b f i x 0 x 0 1 δ i x 0 1 δ i 0 x τ i 1 δ i δ i g i x τ i x where τ i is the lower bound of streamflow in month i and 1 δ i is the probability of a zero streamflow in month i combining 7 with the fact that e x k x k d g x δ 0 x k f x d x we obtain an expression for the coefficient of variation of daily flows in month i denoted c i σ i μ i as a function of the coefficient of variation of the nonzero flows in month i termed c nz i and the probability of zero flows 1 δ i as 8 c i c nz i 2 1 δ i δ i note that this result holds for all distributions g i x and is not unique to the δ l n 2 and δ l n 3 models below as an example of the increase in variability resulting from the occurrence of zeros c i increases from 1 1 to 4 4 for fixed c nz i 1 and probabilities of zero flows 1 δ i equal to 0 1 and 0 9 respectively thus arid and semi arid regions are expected to experience extremely high values of c i when g i x in 7 is an ln3 cdf x follows a δ ln3 model in which case one can easily extend results for the δ ln2 model from aitchison 1955 to obtain the mean and variance in month i as 9a μ i τ i δ i exp μ y i σ y i 2 2 9b σ i 2 δ i exp 2 μ y i σ y i 2 exp σ y i 2 δ i where μ y i and σ y i 2 are the mean and variance of y ln x τ i in month i with τ i equal to the lower bound of the l n 3 model in month i we approximate the pdf of hfss in a given month i using the above four parameter δ l n 3 model with moments given by 9 as shown in the next section 2 5 a delta ln3 monthly mixture δ ln3mm model for handling periodicity zeros and skewness selecting and fitting a single pdf to daily streamflow series as was done in the previous section and in many previous studies is ill advised because such series are not identically distributed due to their seasonal behavior one expects the parameters of any pdf fit to daily streamflow series to exhibit seasonal and possibly other periodic behavior thus we chose to model daily streamflow series using a monthly mixture model where the daily streamflows in each month are modeled by the four parameter δ ln3 model given in the previous section the resulting model is termed a δ ln3 monthly mixture δ ln3mm model for daily streamflow a more parsimonious seasonal model could be employed but such an approach would require the definition of seasons which differ by hydro climatologic regime adding a degree of subjectivity which could cloud our ability to draw definitive conclusions concerning the impact of periodicity on estimation of c other approaches to modeling seasonality such as by fitting smooth periodic functions should be considered in future studies since daily flow samples considered here are in the tens of thousands we elected not to concern ourselves with the often critical issue of parsimony the δ ln3mm model involves fitting a separate δ ln3 model to the daily flows in each month so that each month i is characterized by the four parameters of the δ ln3 model given by its mean μ y i variance σ y i 2 lower bound τ i and probability of zero 1 δ i corresponding to the daily streamflows x and their transformed values y ln x τ i we employ this 48 parameter δ ln3mm model to generate synthetic streamflow series which are shown in section 5 2 to better mimic the complex marginal distribution of daily streamflows than a single δ ln3 model we also show later how to exploit this δ ln3mm model for obtaining improved estimators of c the δ ln3mm model will produce daily streamflows that no longer follow a δ ln3 model and nonzero daily streamflows that no longer follow a ln3 distribution as usual for compound distributions dubey 1970 porporato et al 2006 and others importantly the δ ln3mm is able to model the distribution of extremely complex periodic highly skewed multimodal ephemeral and intermittent streamflows consider a monthly mixture distribution made up of fitting a separate δ ln3 distribution f x μ i σ i τ i δ i to the daily streamflows in each of i 1 12 months where x denotes the daily streamflow observations within month i τ i denotes the lower bound 1 δ i denotes the probability of zeros of the fitted δ l n 3 distribution in month i and μ i and σ i denote the mean and standard deviation of the streamflows x in month i given in 9 the resulting δ ln3mm pdf of all the daily streamflows is given by 10 f x μ 1 μ 12 σ 1 σ 12 τ 1 τ 12 δ 1 δ 12 i 1 12 w i f i x μ i σ i τ i δ i where f denotes the overall pd of x and f i denotes the δ l n 3 pdf of the streamflows x in month i and i 1 12 w i 1 combining 10 with the facts that e x k 0 x k f x d x and σ 2 e x μ 2 e x 2 μ 2 leads to 11a e x μ i 1 12 w i μ i and 11b e x μ 2 σ 2 i 1 12 w i μ i 2 σ i 2 μ 2 eq 11 can be used to obtain the overall coefficient of variation c σ μ of the resulting fitted δ ln3mm distribution note that one can fit more complex distributions than either an δ ln2 or δ ln3 distribution to the daily streamflows in each month as long as one can obtain estimates of both the mean and variance μ i and σ i 2 of x for each of the 12 fitted distributions in 9 2 6 estimation of parameters of the δ ln3mm model in this section we document how to estimate the parameters and overall cdf corresponding to the δ ln3mm model in section 2 5 the cdf of the daily streamflows corresponding to the monthly mixture model is obtained by integration of 10 which leads to 12 f x μ 1 μ 12 σ 1 σ 12 τ 1 τ 12 δ 1 δ 12 i 1 12 w i f i x μ i σ i τ i δ i where f denotes the cdf of all the daily streamflows x and f i denotes the δ ln3 cdf of the streamflows x in month i here we assume the same number of days in each month which leads to the fixed weights w i 1 12 however future work may benefit from use of maximum likelihood or bayesian estimators of the mixture weights as recommended by mclachlan et al 2019 efficient estimation of the cdf of all the streamflows f in 12 is as follows first we note that in a given month i nonzero streamflows x follow an ln3 model so that in each month y ln x τ i follows a different normal model where an attractive estimator of the lower bound τ i in each month i is given by the stedinger 1980 estimator given in 6 from 7 an efficient estimate of the cdf of all the streamflows in month i f i x is then given by 13 f i x 0 x 0 1 δ i 0 x 1 δ i δ i g i y x τ i τ i with δ i 1 m i n i g i y φ i y y i s y i y i 1 n i m i j 1 n i m i ln x j τ i s y i 1 n i m i j 1 n i m i ln x j τ i y i 2 where m i is the number zero streamflows in month i n i is the total number of streamflow observations in month i y ln x τ i with τ i given in 6 and φ denotes the cdf of a standard normal variable we are concatenating daily flows across the entire n period of record so that m and n denote the total number of zeros and the total number of streamflows in the entire n year record for example if there were no zero flows in any month i so that m i 0 in every month i then there would be roughly n 12 flows in each month an estimate of the cdf of all the daily streamflows f x in 12 is obtained from 14 f x i 1 12 1 12 f i x with f i x given in 13 2 7 goodness of fit of the fitted δ ln3 δ kap δ wak and δ ln3mm models an important contribution of this study involves documenting the improved goodness of fit of the monthly mixture model over numerous common single pdf s often advocated for modeling daily flow duration curves here we assess the goodness of fit of the various fitted zero inflated models also termed delta models as well as the monthly mixture model fitted to streamflow observations any pdf for nonzero observations can be converted to a zero inflated model or delta model by substitution of the pdf of the nonzero values g x into 7 when g x is an l n 3 kap wak cdf then f x in 7 corresponds to the δ l n 3 δ k a p and δ w a k models which are all compared in this section with the δ l n 3 m m model we employ the same procedure regardless of whether or not the flow series exhibit zeros we employ the widely used probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc to evaluate the goodness of fit stedinger et al 1993 of the fitted pdfs to the streamflow observations there are two types of ppcc s one based on a quantile quantile q q probability plot and another based on a probability probability p p plot gan and koehler 1990 we employ p p plots instead of q q plots because daily and hourly streamflow quantiles vary over 3 5 orders of magnitude thus ppcc estimates from such q q plots suffer from the same type of systematic bias that ratio estimators of c skewness and kurtosis are known to exhibit particularly for data series with very high values of c as is the focus here see vogel and fennessey 1993 gan and koehler 1990 describe ppcc hypothesis tests based upon p p plots where the percentiles associated with each of the ranked observations computed from the fitted distribution are plotted against their unbiased weibull plotting positions the ppcc statistic based on a p p plot is the pearson correlation between these two axes both of which have values between 0 and 1 using ppcc statistics based on p p plots treats each observation with effectively equal weight and as a result is influenced far less by outliers than a ppcc based on a q q plot ppcc hypothesis tests require an assumption that the flows are iid however since we only employ this statistic as a relative goodness of fit metric our comparisons do not depend on the iid assumption estimates of r p p c c corresponding to the fitted δ l n 3 δ k a p δ w a k and δ l n 3 m m models are obtained from the pearson correlation estimator defined by 15 r j 1 n f x j f x j p j p j j 1 n f x j f x j 2 j 1 n p j p j 2 where f x j is obtained by substitution of the jth ordered value of x denoted x j into the expression for the cdf of the distribution given in 7b and 13 and f x j denotes their mean values across all n observations at a site in 15 p j denotes the weibull plotting position estimate of the cumulative probabilities given by p j j n 1 here a weibull plotting position is ideally suited because it yields an unbiased estimate of the cumulative probability associated with the observations regardless of their pdf stedinger et al 1993 when there are m zero flows among the n flows then an estimate of the cumulative probability of a zero flow is obtained from p m m n 1 2 7 1 p p probability plot for δ l n 3 δ k a p δ w a k models estimates of the cdf of all streamflows denoted f x j is needed to compute r p p c c in 15 and can be computed for each of the three fitted zero inflated δ l n 3 δ k a p and δ w a k models from 16 f x j 0 x 0 1 δ 0 x τ 1 δ δ g x j x τ with δ 1 m n where m is the overall number of zero observations and n is the overall sample size ppcc for δ ln3 model substitution of the cdf of the nonzero observations g y j φ y j y s y with y j 1 n m ln x j τ n m and s y j 1 n m ln x τ y 2 n m into 16 yields an estimate of the cdf f x j for the δ l n 3 model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 ppcc for δ kap model substitution of l moment estimates of the kap parameters α κ h and ξ into a2 yields an estimate of the cdf of the nonzero observations g x j which can be substituted into 16 to yield an estimate of the cdf f x j for an δ k a p model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 ppcc for δ wak model an analytical form of the pdf and cdf of a wak distribution does not exist however it is possible to estimate g x by solving a5 numerically for g substitution of l moment estimates of the wak parameters α β γ θ and ξ into a5 combined with a numerical solution yields an estimate of the cdf of the nonzero observations g x j which can be substituted into 16 to yield an estimate of the cdf f x j for an δ w a k model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 2 7 2 p p probability plot for δ ln3mm model a p p probability plot is constructed by first ranking all the nonzero daily streamflow observations denoted x j j 1 2 n m where n i 1 12 n i is the total record length of the daily flow series and m i 1 12 m i is the total number of zero observations each ordered daily flow x j corresponds to a transformed flow y j ln x j τ i for i 1 2 12 and j 1 2 n where τ i is given in 6 under the ln3 hypothesis x follows an ln3 distribution and y j ln x j τ i follows a normal distribution so that a p p probability plot is obtained by plotting a weibull plotting position estimate of the cumulative probabilities p j j n 1 versus an estimate of the cumulative probability of the fitted mixture distribution for the jth observation obtained from 14 where one replaces the observation x with the ordered observation x j with f i x j given in 13 analogous to replacing x with x j in 14 one replaces the observation y with the ordered observation y j in 13 the ppcc is then obtained by computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the n values of the plotting positions p j and f x j obtained from 14 3 summary of estimators of c three classes of estimators of c are introduced in this study 1 sample estimators based on the assumption that daily streamflow arises from a single distribution which is equivalent to the assumption of identically distributed streamflows throughout the year 2 sample estimators based on a single zero inflated which assume two populations one for zero flows and one for nonzero flows and 3 a mixture model which combines monthly zero inflated ln3 model with a monthly mixture model the first class of estimators attempt to account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with daily streamflows the second class of estimators account for both skewness and the occurrence of zeros while the third class of models account for skewness zeros and the periodicity of daily streamflows 3 1 estimators of c based on a single distribution section 2 and appendix a summarizes a suite of estimators which assume that all streamflows arise from a single pdf those sample estimators were denoted c pm c l n 2 c finney c breunig c l n 3 c kap and c wak given in eqs 1 3 4 5 6 a4 and a6 respectively 3 2 estimators of c based on a single zero inflated distribution eq 8 documents the analytical relationship between c i corresponding to all streamflows in a given month and the value of c nz i corresponding to only the nonzero observations in that month if one assumes that daily streamflows arise from the same zero inflated distribution in every month then 8 reduces to 17 c c nz 2 1 δ δ three single zero inflated models were considered previously including the δ ln3 δ kap and the δ wak models in each case a value for c nz corresponding to the nonzero observations was derived and denoted c l n 3 c kap and c wak in equations 6 a4 and a6 respectively substitution of each of those corresponding values of c nz into 17 leads to the estimators c δ l n 3 c δ k a p and c δ w a k corresponding to the three zero inflated distributions 3 3 estimator of c based on monthly zero inflated distributions and the monthly ln3 mixture model the model which is expected to perform best in this study is the δ ln3mm model because it accounts for skewness periodicity and zero streamflows all factors which influence the variability of streamflow estimation involving a zero inflated monthly mixture model in arid regions could lead to small sample estimation issues even when dealing with long records of daily streamflow recall it is not uncommon for ephemeral headwater streams to experience values of 1 δ in excess of 0 8 or 0 9 in which case the number of non zero streamflows could be quite small for example a 10 year record n 3 650 of daily streamflow with 1 δ 0 9 results in only 365 nonzero streamflows or only 30 nonzero flows per month if they are distributed evenly christman 2019 documents that the naïve estimators of the δ l n 3 m m model in 13 exhibit significant bias for small iid samples i e 100 observations and that the umuve estimators introduced by aitchison 1955 are preferred thus we incorporate them below into our δ l n 3 m m estimator of c the theoretical expression for c corresponding to a monthly mixture model in 11 can be rewritten in the form of an estimator for the δ l n 3 m m model by combining various results from 9 11 and 13 with those of aitchison 1955 to obtain 18a c δ l n 3 m m σ μ i 1 12 μ i 2 σ i 2 μ 2 12 i 1 12 μ i 12 where 18b μ i τ i δ i exp y i g n i m i s y i 2 2 18c σ i 2 δ i exp 2 y i g n i m i 2 s y i 2 1 m i n i 1 g n i m i n i m i 2 n i m i 1 s y i 2 δ i 1 m i n i where g n i m i is given in 4 m i is the number zero streamflows in month i n i is the total number of streamflow observations in month i and formulas for the sample mean y i and sample variance s y i 2 of the values of y ln x τ i in a given month i are given in 13 and τ i is given in 6 but here is only applied to the n i m i nonzero streamflows note once again 18 assumes the same number of days in each month so that w i 1 12 for all months 4 results in the following section we first evaluate and compare the goodness of fit of the various pdfs introduced for modeling daily streamflow observations at thousands of watersheds across the conterminous u s we also perform monte carlo experiments which evaluate the sampling properties bias and rmse of the various estimators of c introduced previously with the goal of determining which estimator is best suited to use with hfss we then apply the estimator of c which performs best in those experiments to summarize the behavior of c and to determine those factors which influence the relative variability of streamflow 4 1 database of streamflows estimates of c were obtained for a subset of the gages ii database falcone 2011 based on two criteria 1 there are continuous discharge data for more than 20 years and 2 the percentage of missing data is 5 table 1 uses square brackets to summarize various statistical and hydroclimatic characteristics of discharge data and drainage area for the 6886 watersheds considered record lengths range from 20 120 years or 7300 43 827 days corresponding to a median of 47 4 years or 17 289 days and the drainage areas a range from 0 77 to 49 802 km2 with a median of 525 km2 the climate aridity ratio ar defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation p was obtained for each watershed from the prism dataset prism climate group 2017 the values of ar in table 1 illustrate a very broad range of hydro climatologic regimes because according to the climatic classification system introduced by ponce et al 2000 table 1 the values of ar pet p reported in table 1 range from approximately 0 1 5 71 which corresponds to hydro climatological conditions ranging from arid to super humid conditions note that energy limited ar 1 basins are more common than water limited ar 1 basins since the median ar is 0 68 this characterization is consistent with the probability of zero discharge 1 δ which is higher in the water limited regions than that in the energy limited regions values of the runoff ratio rr defined as the ratio of runoff to precipitation summarized in table 1 were obtained from the gages ii database and the median runoff ratio is 0 34 it is worth noting that the runoff ratio in 32 of the 6886 watersheds is greater than 1 the potential reasons for this include 1 the watersheds are not closed basins and may be subject to groundwater inflows and or possible water diversions into the basin and 2 the areal rainfall data are underestimated since the rainfall stations may not be representative of their entire watersheds 4 2 goodness of fit evaluations using p p plots section 3 4 summarized our approach for evaluating the goodness of fit of the δ ln3 δ kap δ wak and δ ln3mm models using p p plots and the ppcc statistic we emphasize at the outset that we expect that the less parsimonious δ ln3mm to exhibit much higher ppcc values than the other more parsimonious models in many hydrologic applications parsimony is a paramount concern however here sample sizes are very large compared to say flood frequency analysis thus parsimony is not as important a concern as in small sample applications and our goal is to employ a model with a nearly perfect goodness of fit for all basins considered so that the model can be used to both mimic streamflow variability and to enable unbiased estimation of c unfortunately we were only able to fit a kap distribution to 4607 of the 6886 watersheds fig 1 uses boxplots of the ppcc statistic to compare the goodness of fit among the ln3 kap δ kap and δ ln3mm models at 4528 of the 6886 sites where all four models could be fit fig 1 documents the considerable improvement in goodness of fit resulting from the δ ln3mm model when compared to the ln3 kap and δ kap models the difficulty of fitting a kap distribution to daily streamflow observations has been experienced before see blum et al 2017 and studies cited therein thus we drop both the kap and the δ kap model from further goodness of fit comparisons however we encourage others to consider seasonal or monthly mixture models based on a kap model analogous to the recent work by brunner and gilleland 2020 who fit a separate kap model to daily streamflows on each day an advantage of the ln3 models over the kap models is that we were able to fit them at nearly all 6886 watersheds though the ln3 model reduced to an ln2 model at 3287 sites where the lower bound τ was set to zero for the reasons described in our discussion of eq 6 fig 2 compares boxplots of ppcc values corresponding to the three ln3 models ln3 δ ln3 and δ ln3mm at 6807 of the 6886 watersheds where all three models could be fit we were unable to fit the δ ln3mm at 79 watersheds due to the occurrence of all zero flows in some months importantly fig 2 documents the considerable improvement in the goodness of fit of the 48 parameter δ ln3mm model over both the four parameter δ ln3 model and the three parameter ln3 model which reinforces and quantifies the importance of accounting for both the occurrence of zeros and the periodicity of streamflow series fig 3 uses a scatterplot to compare the ppcc value corresponding to the δ ln3mm and δ ln3mm models and again documents the nearly global and rather significant improvement in the goodness of fit of the δ ln3mm model over the single δ ln3 zero inflated model 4 3 monte carlo experiments the goal of this section is to perform controlled monte carlo experiments which enable us to conclude which estimator of c denoted c performs best in terms of its percent bias b i a s c 100 c e c c and it s percent root mean square error r m s e c 100 e c c 2 c these are standard metrics used in the statistics literature to evaluate the precision and accuracy of any estimator due to the well known fact that mean square error of an estimator is made up of the sum of its bias squared and its variance one can easily show that r m s e c 2 b i a s c 2 v a r c thus it is only necessary to report any two of these indices to understand the general performance of the estimator c to compute b i a s c and r m s e c the true value c must be known or assumed for the purposes of our monte carlo experiments we assume that values of c δ l n 3 m m in 18 computed from the complete records summarized in table 1 are the true values of c at each site we selected a subset of 190 watersheds among the 6 886 watersheds for monte carlo experiments due to the high computational burden associated with these experiments the watershed characteristics of the chosen subset of 190 watersheds are summarized using parentheses in table 1 for comparison with the 6886 watersheds shown using square brackets the 190 watersheds were chosen so that 1 they all exhibited extremely high goodness of fit associated with the fitted δ ln3mm model and 2 they reflect the distribution of c δ l n 3 m m which was observed among the 6886 sites the δ ln3mm ppcc values for the 190 sites ranged from 0 9966 to 0 9999 with a median value of 0 9996 and an interquartile range equal to 0 9993 0 9998 which is evidence of the extremely high goodness of fit associated with the δ ln3mm model for these sites the distribution of the values of c δ l n 3 m m associated with the 190 selected stations ranged from 0 48 to 4072 with an interquartile range from 1 2 to 8 2 and a median value of 2 among the 190 sites 14 stations had c δ l n 3 m m 100 and 4 stations had c δ l n 3 m m 1000 among the 6807 sites for which we could fit the δ ln3mm model c δ l n 3 m m ranged from 0 19 to 42 000 with an interquartile range from 1 3 to 3 8 and a median value of 1 9 these results combined with comparisons given in table 1 indicate that the subset of 190 sites should reflect the overall behavior of the much larger set of 6807 watersheds note that the largest value of c δ l n 3 m m corresponding to the 6807 sites was much greater than the largest value among the 190 sites because those extremely large values of c δ l n 3 m m correspond to sites with poor goodness of fit associated with the δ ln3mm and hence were not included in the 190 sites we generate synthetic streamflow series using the δ ln3mm model with parameters estimated by applying 13 to the 190 streamflow records the algorithm for generating 50 year n 18 250 days synthetic streamflow records at each site from the δ ln3mm model is as follows 1 for a given site estimate the true values of the δ ln3mm model parameters in each month i from 13 so that δ i δ i μ y y i σ y i s y i with τ i τ i computed from 6 2 generate the uniform random variates u i j over the interval 0 1 where i 1 12 months and j 1 n i where n i is the total number of daily streamflows both zero and nonzero in month i for the site under consideration 3 generate a total of n 18 250 daily 50 year streamflows x i j at each site using 19 x i j 0 if u i j 1 δ i τ i exp μ y i z u i j σ y i otherwise where z denotes a standard normal variate eq 19 is used to generate j 1 n i daily streamflows in each month i figs 4 7 illustrate boxplots of b i a s c and r m s e c for the suite of estimators of c introduced here when applied to the synthetic streamflow series generated at each of the 190 experimental sites from this analysis we note that c δ l n 3 m m is a considerable improvement over all other estimators considered in terms of both b i a s c and r m s e c estimates of c values for some of the 190 stations could not be calculated from the δ kap or δ wak models thus two sets of figures are included for bias and rmse the bias fig 4 and rmse fig 6 could only be computed at 129 of the 190 stations using all 11 estimators whereas the bias fig 5 and rmse fig 7 could be computed for all 190 stations using the 7 methods which are not based on kappa and wakeby distributions importantly both the bias and rmse of the δ ln3mm estimator is smallest and generally much smaller than that of any other methods the biases for the single distribution estimators c finney and c l n 2 are the largest the biases for the estimators c pm and c breunig are always positive indicating that c pm and c breunig are underestimated compared with the theoretical value of considerable interest is the behavior of the most common estimator of c the product moment estimator c pm fig 8 illustrates a scatterplot of b i a s c pm versus the assumed true value c c δ l n 3 m m which illustrates as expected that the enormous downward bias associated with c pm is greatest at sites with the highest values of c δ l n 3 m m which also tend to be those sites in arid and semi arid regions as shown in section 5 fig 9 is a plot of c pm versus c δ l n 3 m m for 6807 sites which illustrates that c δ l n 3 m m is able to cover a much broader range of values of c than c pm giving us more sensitivity to the range of high values of c fig 9 highlights that there are many watersheds throughout the u s which have enormous values of c δ l n 3 m m in the hundreds and even thousands whereas the naïve estimator c pm leads us to believe that there is an upper bound on c in the vicinity of 50 recall kirby s 1974 upper bound on c pm equal to n 1 has an impact here because the upper bounds on c pm corresponding to the range of sample sizes 7300 43827 reported in table 1 would range from 85 209 kirby s bounds have an impact regardless of the stochastic structure of the observations and only require that the flows be nonnegative thus kirby s upper bound on c pm could very well be causing some of the downward bias illustrated in figs 8 and 9 together figs 8 and 9 document that until the introduction of the estimator c δ l n 3 m m we have been unable to understand depict and approximate an unbiased representation of the true relative variability of streamflow across broad hydroclimatic regimes 5 summary of behavior of estimates of c of considerable interest are the factors which give rise to such extremely large values of c δ l n 3 m m depicted in fig 9 across the conterminous u s naturally there are many factors which would explain the gross variations in c δ l n 3 m m including but not limited to physical watershed characteristics climatic characteristics and numerous water management variables relating to withdrawals diversions return flows reservoir operations and other factors it is beyond the scope of this initial study to consider all these factors hence we only consider the impact of a few watershed and climatic characteristics a natural sequel to this study would be a much more exhaustive study with the goal of determining the key drivers of streamflow variability to this aim we plotted c δ l n 3 m m versus the physical and statistical characteristics including the probability of a zero 1 δ watershed area a runoff ratio rr and aridity ratio ar these scatter plots revealed no obvious discernable relationship except in the case of c δ l n 3 m m versus 1 δ thus we only illustrate that scatterplot in fig 10 to save space and we perform a more detailed multivariate analysis below the scatterplot in fig 10 indicates a strong relationship between c δ l n 3 m m and the probability of zeros 1 δ for the 2166 watersheds that exhibited zeros to further evaluate the multivariate relationship between c δ l n 3 m m and 1 δ a rr and ar we fit the following multivariate model using ordinary least squares regression 20 ln c δ l n 3 m m β 0 β 1 φ 1 1 δ β 2 ln ar β 3 ln rr β 4 ln a ε where φ 1 is the inverse of a standard normal distribution β j j 0 4 are model coefficients and ε are model errors the transformation φ 1 1 δ is only used to ensure that the probability of zero 1 δ is bounded on the interval 0 1 whereas all other independent variables have no such constraints equation 20 was fit to 2166 of the 6807 of the watersheds summarized in table 1 which exhibited zero streamflows table 2 summarizes estimates of the model coefficients and their corresponding t ratios and p values associated with each explanatory variable diagnostic plots indicated relatively well behaved residuals which were roughly independent homoscedastic and normally distributed the high t ratios and very low p values in table 2 along with the reasonably well behaved residuals enable us to conclude that all model coefficients are highly significant and stable influence statistics indicated that no watersheds exerted unusual influence on the model coefficient values all variance inflation factors were below 2 0 revealing a general lack of multicollinearity among the explanatory variables see helsel et al 2020 for background on influence statistics variance inflation factors and other regression methods reported here the magnitude of the t ratio is proportional to the explanatory power of its associated explanatory variable the fitted model in 20 summarized in table 2 resulted in an adjusted r2 42 2 substitution of the fitted model coefficients from table 2 into 20 and exponentiation yields a model for c δ l n 3 m m 21 c δ l n 3 m m exp 2 97 0 728 φ 1 1 δ a r 0 342 r r 0 0748 a 0 0608 we conclude that increases in c δ l n 3 m m result from increases in ar a and the probability of zero flows 1 δ and from decreases in rr we also note that the exponents on ar rr and a in eq 21 can be interpreted as nondimensional elasticities so that a 1 increase in ar and a is expected to result in a 0 34 and a 0 06 increase in c δ l n 3 m m respectively similarly a 1 increase in rr is expected to result in a 0 075 decrease in c δ l n 3 m m fig 11 illustrates a contour maps of values of a c δ l n 3 m m and b c pm based on the 6 807 gages ii watersheds summarized in table 1 these maps were constructed using an inverse distance weighting interpolation method between the gages ii gauging station locations a comparison of the two maps in fig 11 reveals the remarkable differences in our understanding of the geographic variations in relative variability of daily streamflows revealed by these two different estimators of c particularly in arid and semi arid regions a comparison of fig 11a and b reveals that our estimator c δ l n 3 m m is able to represent an entirely new level of streamflow variability never before witnessed analogous to the results of our multivariate analysis the extremely high values of c δ l n 3 m m reported in fig 11 generally occur in arid and semi arid regions of the southwestern u s and eastern washington other instances of extremely high values of c δ l n 3 m m tend to correspond to locations with a high frequency of zero flows as in southern florida and some regions of the upper midwest 6 impact of persistence on the behavior of estimates of c previous sections have accounted for the influence of periodicity skewness intermittent and ephemeral streamflow conditions on the properties of c in this section we discuss briefly the influence of persistence on flow variability evidence of streamflow persistence can be described by its autocorrelation structure which is known to have an impact on the sampling properties of estimators of c the topic of this section vogel et al 1998 documented the impact of serial correlation of the flow sequences on both the bias and variance of various estimators of c they derived an approximately unbiased estimator of c in their eq 18 for flows which arise from an ln2 lag one autoregressive process and documented using monte carlo experiments that their analytical expressions provide good approximations to both the bias and variance of their recommended estimator an evaluation of their bias correction for autocorrelation indicates that it is only important for small samples i e n 100 even when autocorrelations approache unity as is the case for daily and hourly streamflows since daily and hourly flow sequences usually have sample sizes well in excess of 100 we neglect the impact of serial correlation on bias and refer the reader to vogel et al 1998 for further information 7 conclusions and recommendations this study has sought to improve our understanding of the behavior of and our ability to estimate the coefficient of variation c of high frequency streamflow series hfss such as daily and subdaily series we have also documented the critical need to account for the high levels of periodicity skewness and zero streamflows associated with hfss when attempting to estimate summary statistics of such series although other measures of relative variability exist we focus on c because it is easy to interpret and understand and is probably the most widely used index of relative variability in hydrology given the enormous impact of streamflow variability on nearly every aspect of water resource design planning and management this study has sought to provide unbiased and reliable estimates of c for daily streamflows at watersheds exhibiting a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions recent research has shown that knowledge of the magnitude of c plays a dominant role and creates considerable obstacles relating to our ability to estimate very common hydrologic statistics such as the pearson correlation coefficient barber et al 2019 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency goodness of fit metric lamontagne et al 2020 three classes of estimators of c are introduced in this study the first class of estimators are the traditional estimators c pm c l n 2 c finney c breunig c l n 3 c kap and c wak which can account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with hfss but only perform well when streamflows are identically distributed which is rarely the case the second class of estimators c δ l n 3 c δ k a p and c δ w a k are based on the three zero inflated models δ l n 3 δ k a p and the δ w a k which account for both skewness and the occurrence of zeros finally we introduce the new and promising estimator c δ l n 3 m m which accounts for skewness zeros and the periodicity of daily streamflows all factors shown to be integral to reliable and unbiased estimation of c our findings are based on monte carlo experiments based on both 1 long series of daily streamflows at 6886 gages ii watersheds as well as 2 synthetic daily streamflows generated from a zero inflated lognormal mixture model which we term the δ l n 3 m m model and the following conclusions are reached 1 on the probability distribution of daily streamflows goodness of fit evaluations at thousands of watersheds across the conterminous u s indicate that the δ l n 3 m m monthly mixture model provides an improved goodness of fit to the pdf of daily streamflow series over a wide range of common single distribution functions recommended by others including zero inflated versions of those distributions fig 2 documents the consistent and considerable improvement in the goodness of fit of the 48 parameter δ l n 3 m m model over both the four parameter δ l n 3 model and the three parameter l n 3 models which reinforces and quantifies the importance of accounting for both the occurrence of zeros and periodicity in addition to the high skewness associated with daily streamflow series 2 on the need for mixture models to account for seasonality our monte carlo experiments reveal that among the eleven different estimators of c considered the estimator c δ l n 3 m m based on the δ l n 3 m m model exhibited remarkably lower bias and rmse than any other estimator importantly those controlled experiments documented that accounting for the seasonal nonstationarity in the flow series with a monthly mixture model led to dramatic reductions in both the bias and rmse when compared to all other estimators considered our zero inflated δ l n 3 m m model accounts for the extremely complex periodic highly skewed multimodal and possibly ephemeral and intermittent characteristics of hfss which is shown to be necessary to obtain both unbiased and reliable estimates of c future studies should consider other methods for handling seasonality whether through different types of mixture models or through the introduction of periodic functions which approximate observed seasonality 3 extraordinary levels of streamflow variability are revealed from monthly mixture models extending the results documented by vogel and fennessey 1993 for c 10 our experiments revealed downward bias in the traditional estimator of c termed c pm which approached 100 for samples with extremely high values of c in excess of about 100 comparison of values of the common product moment estimator c pm with the estimator c δ l n 3 m m at 6886 watersheds in fig 11 led us to conclude that until now we have been unable to understand and depict the relative variability of streamflow c across broad hydroclimatic regimes those comparisons reveal that c δ l n 3 m m is able to represent an entirely new and higher level of streamflow variability never before exposed or verified such high values of c in arid and semi arid regions imply that in such situations even estimates of the sample mean will exhibit such extraordinary variability that its use in such situations should be questioned therefore improved zero inflated monthly mixture estimators or their equivalent are needed for estimation of a host of other statistics in addition to the mean and c of daily and subdaily flow series in arid and semi arid regions analogous to our findings concerning estimation of c lamontagne et al 2020 document that an ln3 monthly mixture model is also quite useful for estimation of the nash sutcliffe goodness of fit statistic when working with daily streamflows 4 the impact of sample size skewness zeros and seasonality wallis et al 1974 first identified the enormous bias and variability associated with c pm for iid skewed samples with small sample sizes i e n 100 and vogel and fennessey 1993 found similar results for sample sizes in the tens of thousands from highly skewed iid samples with c 10 this study is in some sense a sequel to those two studies revealing that the extraordinary bias and variability associated with traditional estimators of c even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands results from the high degree of skewness periodicity and the occurrence of zeros associated with hfss what is unique to this study is our introduction of the δ l n 3 m m model which accounts for the three factors skewness zeros and periodicity together which enabled us to obtain unbiased and reliable estimates of c increases in skewness periodicity and the likelihood of zeros were all shown to contribute to increases in both the bias and rmse of resulting estimators of c we have also demonstrated that some of the downward bias in c pm is due in part to kirby s 1974 upper bound even with samples in the tens of thousands 5 the physical causes of streamflow variability a multivariate analysis of the 2166 streamgauges that experienced zero streamflow revealed that increases in c δ l n 3 m m result from increases in the aridity ratio ar drainage area a and the probability of zero flows 1 δ and from decreases in the runoff ratio rr a comparison of national contour maps of c δ l n 3 m m and c pm documents the considerable improvement in our understanding of geographic variations in relative variability of daily streamflows resulting from the use of c δ l n 3 m m particularly in arid and semiarid regions those maps also illustrate the enormous geographic variations in the relative variability of daily flow series across the u s 6 extensions and recommendations we expect future applications of zero inflated mixture models to enable corresponding improvements in our ability to model the pdf and to estimate various summary statistics of daily flow series and other hydrologic series which exhibit high levels of skewness periodicity and zeros for example given results of this study and the study by brunner and gilleland 2020 combined with recent recommendations by blum et al 2017 a natural extension to this study would be to evaluate the goodness of fit of zero inflated kappa monthly mixture models for modeling the pdf of daily flow series the vast and consistent improvement in goodness of fit of our δ l n 3 m m model over single pdf models could also be of considerable value to research on the application of flow duration curves castellarin et al 2013 analogous to this study lamontagne et al 2020 introduced a bivariate monthly mixture modeling for daily streamflow observations and simulations for the purpose of improving our ability to estimate model goodness of fit we anticipate that zero inflated monthly mixture models may be useful for estimating a wide range of common summary statistics including the mean variance skewness kurtosis and correlation coefficients we encourage future studies to consider alternative approaches to those considered here for accounting for skewness periodicity and zeros when estimating hydrologic statistics such as c credit authorship contribution statement lei ye software validation formal analysis investigation

distribution kap numerous investigators have suggested the four parameter kappa kap distribution as the distribution of choice for fitting nonzero daily streamflow series see blum et al 2017 for a recent review the quantile function for a kap distribution is a1 x g ξ α k 1 1 g h h k where g denotes the cdf of the nonzero observations the cdf of the nonzero observations needed in 16 to fit a δ k a p distribution is given by a2 g x 1 h 1 k x ξ α 1 k 1 h an estimate of the cdf f x of all the streamflows both zeros and nonzeros corresponding to a δ k a p is obtained by substitution of a2 into 16 using l moment estimators of the four parameters of the nonzero kap cdf hosking 2017 provided algorithms for estimating the parameters of the kap distribution using the method of l moments hosking 1994 showed that all rth central moments of a kap variable exists if h 0 and k 0 however there are conditions for which only some of the rth moments exist such as for r 1 hk in which case they only exist for h 0 and k 0 and for r 1 k in which case they only exist if k 0 thus we anticipate that situations may arise when c does not exist for the fitted kap distribution hosking 1994 provided analytical expressions which relate the parameters of a kap distribution to its product moments for most reasonable streamflow distributions the kap is limited to values of h 0 in which case hosking 1994 reported the rth moment of a kap variate as a3 e y r e 1 k x ξ α r h 1 r k γ 1 r k γ 1 h γ 1 r k 1 h using the fact that x ξ α 1 y k the moments of x are easily derived from the moments of y so that one can compute the coefficient of variation of the nonzero values of x using a4 c kap σ x μ x α σ y ξ k α 1 μ y α e y 2 e y 2 ξ k α 1 e y with e y and e y 2 obtained from a3 substitution of l moment estimators of the parameters α κ h and ξ into a4 leads to the estimator c kap the wakeby distribution wak houghton 1978 introduced the five parameter wakeby distribution as a distribution which could act as the parent distribution in hydrology due to its extreme flexibility and ability to encompass and approximate the behavior of most other distributions in hydrology here we follow the parameterization of the five parameter wakeby wak given by hosking and wallis 1997 with a quantile function given by a5 x g ξ α β 1 1 g β γ θ 1 1 g δ where g denotes the cdf of the nonzero observations note that unlike the original version of a wakeby distribution introduced by houghton 1978 this version of a wakeby distribution introduced by hosking and wallis 1997 always exhibits a lower bound at ξ so that x ξ always an analytical form of the pdf and cdf of a wak distribution does not exist however it is possible to estimate g x by solving a5 numerically for g houghton 1978 eqn 2 and 3 derived the first four ordinary product moments of a wakeby distribution as a function of its parameters for the case when the quantile function takes the form x f a 1 f b c 1 f d e which is different from the quantile function in a5 given by hosking and wallis 1997 the two quantile functions are equivalent when a α β b β c γ θ d θ and e ξ α β γ θ and that correspondence enables us to express c wak for the nonzero observations as a6 c wak β 1 θ 1 α 2 β 2 2 β 1 γ 2 θ 2 2 θ 1 2 γ α β θ β θ 1 γ β 1 β α θ θ 1 2 β 2 θ 2 1 β 2 θ 1 2 γ 1 β α 1 θ ξ 1 θ 1 β note that there are numerous combinations of the model parameters for which either the mean and or variance does not exist for example the mean does not exist if either β 1 and or θ 1 similarly the variance does not exist when β takes on values of 0 1 2 or 1 or when θ takes on values of ½ or 1 etc thus it is entirely possible that fitted wak distributions will have population values of c wak which simply do not exist when one is unable to fit a five parameter wak distribution it may be possible to fit special cases of the distribution such as the four parameter wakeby distribution see appendix to hosking and wallis 1997 for method substitution of the l moment estimators of the five parameters a β γ θ and ξ into a6 leads to the estimator c wak 
4871,given increasing demand for high frequency streamflow series hfss at daily and subdaily time scales there is increasing need for reliable metrics of relative variability for such series hfss can exhibit enormous relative variability especially in comparison with low frequency streamflow series formed by aggregation of hfss the product moment estimator of the coefficient of variation c defined as the ratio of sample standard deviation to sample mean as well as ten other common estimators of c are shown to provide severely downward biased and highly variable estimates of c for very long records of highly skewed and periodic hfss particularly for rivers which exhibit zeros resorting to the theory of compound distributions we introduce an estimator of c corresponding to a mixture of monthly zero inflated lognormal distributions denoted as a delta lognormal monthly mixture δ ln3mm model through monthly stratification our δ ln3mm model accounts for the seasonality skewness multimodality and the possible intermittency of hfss in comparisons among estimators our δ ln3mm based c estimator is shown to yield much more reliable and approximately unbiased estimates of c not only for small samples but also for very large samples tens of thousands of observations we document values of c in the range of 0 18 42 000 with a median of 1 9 and an interquartile range of 1 34 3 75 for 6807 daily streamflow series across the u s from gages ii dataset with the highest values of c occurring in arid and semiarid regions a multivariate analysis and national contour map reveal that extremely large values of c never previously documented tend to occur in arid watersheds with low runoff ratios which tend to also exhibit a considerable number of zero streamflows keywords relative variability skewness intermittent periodic bimodal zero inflated mixture 1 introduction streamflow variability has a profound impact on nearly every aspect of water resource design planning and management and therefore its quantification plays a key role reliable and unbiased metrics for streamflow variability are needed in a range of activities including but not limited to classification of regional hydrologic homogeneity goodness of fit assessments of hydrologic models evaluation of impacts of climatic variability and change on hydrologic systems and in a wide range of research activities which seek to understand the hydroclimatic mechanisms which give rise to hydrologic variability recent research has shown that high levels of hydrologic variability play a dominant role and create considerable obstacles relating to our ability to estimate very common hydrologic statistics such as the pearson correlation coefficient barber et al 2019 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency goodness of fit metric lamontagne et al 2020 among the existing measures of relative variability the coefficient of variation c introduced by pearson 1896 pp 276 277 is now perhaps the most widely used metric c is defined as c σ μ where μ and σ denote the population mean and standard deviation respectively of the random variable of interest the index c has been applied in many other research areas including business engineering science medicine economics psychology and other social sciences as well as many other fields nairy and rao 2003 kelley 2007 soliman et al 2012 alternatively the standard deviation σ is often used for comparing the variability of samples because it has the same units as the random variable of interest however when one s interest is in comparing the relative variability of several samples each with different mean values c is preferred to σ because it is nondimensional and thus accounts for differences in the mean of the samples in finance the inverse of c is commonly used as a measure of the performance of an investment portfolio knight and satchell 2005 and is often termed the risk to reward ratio we note at the outset that c should only be computed for data measured on a ratio scale and would have no meaning for summarizing data on an interval scale velleman and wilkinson 1993 ratio scale data are equally spaced data which exhibit a zero whereas interval scale data are equally spaced data without a predefined zero point examples of ratio scale variables include streamflow precipitation and temperature measured in kelvin in contrast most common temperature scales e g celsius fahrenheit etc are interval scales with arbitrary zeros so c would be different depending on which scale is used most statistics including c are meaningful for ratio data because their interpretation is unchanged when linear transformations are applied to the data other statistics such as means standard deviations and product moment correlations are meaningful for summarizing data on both ratio and interval scales 1 1 skewness and streamflow variability streamflow variability and skewness are linked vargo et al 2010 fig 3 document the theoretical relationship between c and the coefficient of skewness γ for 36 probability distribution functions pdfs for two parameter pdfs a unique relationship usually exists between c and γ see fig 4 and discussion in vogel and fennessey 1993 for example for positively skewed gamma and ln2 variables γ is related to c via the relations γ 2 c and γ 3 c c 3 respectively for more complex pdfs with more than two parameters there is usually no unique relationship between c and γ however there still remains a linkage between the two given by a two dimensional region within the plot of c versus γ as depicted in fig 3 of vargo et al 2010 it is widely understood that streamflow observations exhibit both variability and skewness yet due to numerous factors discussed in section 1 5 the most common and widely used product moment estimators of the coefficients of variation c and skewness γ exhibit both severe downward bias and variability and are generally not to be trusted even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands see vogel and fennessey 1993 obtaining reliable estimates of c for daily flow series constitutes the central challenge of this study initial efforts to obtain reliable estimates of c for daily streamflow series were made by limbrunner et al 2000 and vogel et al 2003 who applied an l moment estimator of c based on a three parameter lognormal distribution to flow series at 1571 watersheds across the u s vogel et al 2003 reported values of c for daily flow series ranging from approximately 0 5 to 10 000 with a median value of 10 and an interquartile range from 3 to 33 we were unable to find examples of such high values of c reported for any other variables across multiple disciplines which in part explains the need for new methods introduced here 1 2 influence of aggregation on streamflow variability in the past many water resources design planning and management problems relied on low frequency streamflow series lfss such as annual and monthly series resulting from the temporal aggregation average of daily hourly or subhourly high frequency streamflow series hfss all such lfss exhibit much less variability than the hfss from which they were created regardless of the random variable of interest aggregation leads to a reduction in variability given our focus on streamflow variability it is instructive to first consider the impact of aggregation of independent and identically distributed series the aggregation i e taking the average of any independent and identically distributed iid random variable x over n intervals leads to a drop in its standard deviation σ to σ n so that the coefficient of variation of the aggregated variable denoted as c n is reduced to c n c n assume a daily time scale as a reference and denote the corresponding c as c 1 since average annual streamflows are known to exhibit values of c 365 in the range of 0 2 1 5 across the conterminous u s see vogel et al 1998 one would expect c for daily streamflows to be in the range 3 8 28 5 resulting from the relationship c 1 365 c 365 19 c 365 3 8 28 5 these initial results are only very crude approximations because daily streamflows are neither identically distributed nor independent and both of these factors affect the estimation of c a central focus of this study 1 3 the influence of periodicity on estimates of streamflow variability most streamflow statistics attempt to provide a summary of the statistical behavior of streamflow as distinguished from its physical or deterministic characteristics daily streamflow is subject to numerous deterministic characteristics including a periodic component which is dominated by seasonal climatic conditions which can lead to intermittent and ephemeral streamflows and the occurrence of observations equal to zero hfss such as hourly streamflow may be subject to other forms of periodic behavior such as diurnal variations in a recent study closely related to this study the need to account for periodicity when estimating sample statistics of daily streamflow series was documented by lamontagne et al 2020 in their monte carlo experiments which evaluated the sampling variability of estimates of the goodness of fit metric termed efficiency e fig 4 of lamontagne et al 2020 documents that accounting for the periodic behavior of daily streamflow led to marked reductions in the variability of estimates of e when compared with estimators of e which did not account for streamflow periodicity 1 4 the influence of zeros on streamflow variability zero streamflows are defined as streamflow below the measurement threshold which is approximately 0 01 cfs in the u s granato et al 2017 of the 20 438 u s geological survey usgs river gages evaluated by granato et al 2017 36 of those gages had at least one occurrence of zero streamflow and 2 6 of those gages had more than 297 days per year or 81 3 of zero streamflow according to levick et al 2008 ephemeral and intermittent streams make up approximately 59 of all streams in the united states excluding alaska and over 81 in the arid and semi arid southwest according to the usgs national hydrography dataset such streams usually reside in the headwaters or major tributaries of perennial streams in the southwest since the occurrence of zero daily streamflow is so common we introduce a model which accommodates their occurrence such a model that allows for frequent zero valued observations is known as a zero inflated model we document later using both a zero inflated model and streamflow observations that the occurrence of zero streamflows leads to considerable increases in c requiring estimators of c that accommodate their occurrence 1 5 the sampling properties of estimates of the coefficient of variation c all statistics have both a theoretical and empirical interpretation for example the sample mean x computed from a single sample of length n is a sample estimate of the true or population mean μ the theoretical sampling properties of x are known for any iid variable and can be summarized by the mean and variance of x since e x μ x is said to be an unbiased estimator of μ barber et al 2019 and lamontagne et al 2020 provided examples of the sampling properties of estimates of the correlation coefficient and the nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively the difference between the population c and the mean of estimates of c is often referred to as sampling bias because it results from estimating the true population value by a finite sample wallis et al 1974 first exposed the importance of sampling bias in their seminal paper just a moment bias results from the combination of numerous phenomena acting together the occurrence of zeros skewness persistence and seasonality characterizing hfss lead to considerable challenges associated with estimation of c kirby 1974 also derived an upper bound on the product moment estimator of c which until this study was only considered to be important for small samples values of population c exceeding unity correspond to samples with extremely high skewness leading to enormous downward bias in all ratio estimators commonly used in hydrology for example for the case of population c 10 vogel and fennessey 1993 reported downward bias associated with conventional product moment estimator of c of about 40 and 80 for samples of length 10 000 from synthetic iid samples from lognormal and generalized pareto distributions respectively note that limbrunner et al 2000 vogel et al 2003 and this study all document that a value of c 10 for daily streamflows is not uncommon it is well known that autocorrelation inflates the sampling variance of most statistics vogel et al 1998 and lombardo et al 2014 analyzed the effect of the autocorrelation on the sampling properties of various moments and moment ratios expanding the results of wallis et al 1974 one can think of the impact of autocorrelation as decreasing the effective sample size so that in the limit the sample size approaches unity as the autocorrelation approaches unity which is the case for hfss moreover all ratio estimators are known to exhibit bias which is induced by the fact that the numerator and denominator are often correlated random variables each with different sampling properties of their own resulting in bias in estimation of the overall ratio all product moment ratio estimators are known to exhibit bias due to outliers because very large small observations which are far away from the sample mean exert much more influence than the other observations due to the exponentiation involved in higher order moments in such instances which occur frequently in daily streamflow series observations do not exert the same weight and single or few observations can dictate the value of the sample estimates vogel and fennessey 1993 fig 3 documented the enormous impact of the largest observation even for very large samples of daily streamflows in the tens of thousands they also discussed remarkably large downward bias associated with product moment estimates of skewness and by analogy the same would be true for kurtosis and all other higher order moment ratios for highly skewed bivariate lognormal samples lai et al 1999 concluded that significant upward bias in estimates of the pearson correlation coefficient exist and only begins to disappear for sample sizes in the range of 3 4 million observations barber et al 2019 extend the results of lai et al 1999 to highly skewed and periodic hydrologic series showing clearly that the ordinary product moment estimator of the pearson correlation coefficient should generally be avoided for use with daily and sub daily streamflow series thus there is ample evidence in the literature that new methods are needed to better estimate c for highly skewed hydrologic data even for very large samples the study of the sampling bias associated with commonly used product moment ratio estimators of hfss has received very little attention which is surprising when one considers the increasing attention being given to the application of hfss in water resource management activities it is now commonplace for hydrologists to model streamflow at sub daily scales including hourly and even sub hourly scales for use in flood forecasting as well as for real time stormwater and water quality management activities and in hillslope hydrology applications for example the national water model office of water prediction 2017 provides hourly streamflow forecasts for any location within the u s with increasing focus on challenges relating to big data combined with increasing access to graphical processing units supercomputer resources and the internet of things one can expect to see continuing development of new hfss modeling and data acquisition approaches which will result in profound challenges associated with estimation of various summary statistics corresponding to zero inflated periodic and highly skewed hfss examples of research which address such challenges include this study as well as the two recent studies by barber et al 2019 and lamontagne et al 2020 1 6 study goals the primary goals of this paper are 1 to develop and compare approximately unbiased estimators of c for use with highly skewed periodic and possibly intermittent daily flow series and 2 to apply those estimators to large samples of daily streamflow data to enable a better understanding of the influence of skewness zeros periodicity and other physical factors on the relative variability of streamflow we begin with a literature review of estimators of c followed by introduction of zero inflated and monthly mixture models to deal with periodicity skewness and non perennial rivers three classes of estimators of c are introduced the first class of estimators account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with daily streamflows the second class of estimators account for both skewness and zero inflation while the third class of estimators account for skewness zero inflation and the periodicity of daily streamflows then we perform monte carlo experiments which compare the behavior of these estimators of c and finally we apply those estimators to observed daily flow series across the u s a multivariate analysis and contour map of estimates of c enable us to summarize some of the hydroclimatic mechanisms which drive daily streamflow variability summary and recommendations conclude this study 2 estimation of c literature review our review reveals that nearly all approaches to estimation of c and its sampling properties assume that the random variable of interest is independent and identically distributed iid daily streamflow is neither independent nor identically distributed yet since this is the assumption behind every estimator of c we could locate we begin with a review of the estimators of c which stem from this assumption most literature on the sampling properties of estimators of c assume independent normally distributed variates with extensive results for the approximate mckay 1932 and the exact sampling distribution of estimators of c hendricks and robey 1936 as well as confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing johnson and welch 1940 of particular interest here are the properties of estimators of c for non normal populations yet there are very few publications on this subject koopmans et al 1964 developed analytical confidence intervals for lognormal distributions pang et al 2005 developed confidence interval estimates of c for weibull lognormal and gamma distributions amiri and zwanzig 2010 described the use of resampling approaches based on the bootstrap for computing confidence intervals for c for non normal and non iid samples while there are numerous publications which have introduced methods for construction of confidence intervals for c for non normal populations there is very little attention given to the development of unbiased estimators of c for non normal and periodic populations the central goal of this study banik and kibria 2011 compared numerous estimators of c for skewed distributions soliman et al 2012 considered estimation of c for a burr xii distribution and pang et al 2008 considered estimation of c for a bounded random variable following a beta distribution soliman et al 2011 introduced a simulation based approach to estimation of c for a censored gompertz distribution by far the most common estimator of c is obtained using product moments so that 1 c p m s x x where s x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 and x i 1 n x i n kirby 1974 documented that c k i r b y v x x with v x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 n is bounded above with an algebraic upper bound equal to n 1 wallis et al 1974 and vogel and fennessey 1993 documented that c p m is remarkably downward biased with that bias increasing as the skewness increases and or sample size decreases vogel and fennessey 1993 considered much larger sample sizes than wallis et al 1974 and reported that for highly skewed samples from lognormal and generalized pareto models c p m exhibits enormous bias and variance which does not disappear even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands it is for this reason that vogel and fennessey 1993 and others have recommended the use of the l moment ratio known as l cv instead of c because estimates of l cv are nearly unbiased regardless of the distribution from which the samples arise we elect to estimate and focus attention on c instead of l cv because c is still far more widely reported applied and understood than l cv furthermore it is much easier to provide a physical interpretation of c than l cv and one of our goals is to explain the physical drivers of streamflow variability breunig 2011 derived expressions for the bias and variance of c pm 2 for a sample arising from any distribution breunig 2011 reported the bias in c pm 2 as 2 b i a s c pm 2 e c pm 2 c 2 c 3 2 n 3 c 1 2 2 γ where γ is the skewness of the observations of x it would be difficult to use 2 to obtain b i a s c pm instead the reader is referred to vogel and fennessey 1993 fig 5 who report b i a s c pm computed from monte carlo experiments based on lognormal and generalized pareto distributions 2 1 lognormal estimators of c of particular interest in hydrology is the lognormal distribution which may be the most widely used distribution for characterizing a very wide range of skewed hydrologic variables hydrologic applications of the lognormal distribution include the frequency analysis of low flows floods and water quality data flow duration curves rainfall intensity duration waste load allocations and the physical chemical and microbiological properties of soils and other geophysical media including but not limited to hydraulic conductivity soil water retention pore radius and pore capillary pressure chow 1954 stedinger 1980 parkin et al 1988 among others naturally the lognormal assumption is only an approximation though importantly it is a much better approximation than normality which is the assumption associated with most previous research concerning estimation of c vogel et al 1998 considered estimation of c for annual streamflow series that are well approximated by a two parameter lognormal distribution ln2 in this case an attractive estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator 3 c l n 2 exp v y 2 1 where v y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 n and y i 1 n y i n with y ln x another attractive lognormal estimator of c is based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimators umvue of the mean μ finney and variance σ finney 2 introduced by finney 1941 which can be expressed as 4 c f i n n e y σ finney μ finney e 2 y g 2 s y 2 g n 2 n 1 s y 2 e y g s y 2 2 where again y ln x with y i 1 n y i n and s y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 n 1 and g n t k 0 v k v 2 k v v 2 v 2 k v v 1 k 1 k t k with v n 1 parkin et al 1988 compared the sampling properties of the estimators c p m c l n 2 and c f i n n e y under lognormal sampling for n 100 and found that c f i n n e y exhibits significantly lower mean square error than both c p m and c l n 2 particularly for small n and large values of c for large values of n well in excess of 100 we expect c l n 2 and c f i n n e y to have similar performance an approximately unbiased estimator for the ln2 distribution can be derived from eq 2 which yields an expression for b i a s c pm 2 as a function of both skewness and sample size for a lognormal distribution the skewness γ is a function of c so that γ 3 c c 3 which can be combined with 2 to obtain the following approximately unbiased estimator c breunig c pm 2 b i a s c pm 2 c pm 2 c 3 2 n 3 c 1 2 2 γ 5 c pm 2 c breunig 3 2 n 3 c breunig 1 2 2 3 c breunig c breunig 3 eq 5 must be solved for c breunig using an iterative numerical approach such as a newton raphson algorithm an estimate of c can also be obtained by fitting a three parameter lognormal l n 3 distribution resulting in the estimator 6 c l n 3 exp 2 y s y 2 exp s y 2 1 τ exp y s y 2 2 where y ln x τ y 1 n j 1 n y j s y 1 n j 1 n y j y 2 and τ x 1 x n x 0 5 2 x 1 x n 2 x 0 5 the expression for the lower bound τ in 6 is the attractive estimator introduced by stedinger 1980 where x 1 and x n are the smallest and largest nonzero observations respectively and x 0 5 is an estimate of the median of x the condition x 1 x n 2 x 0 5 0 must be satisfied to obtain a reliable estimate of τ in 6 if this condition is not satisfied we assume an ln2 model so that τ 0 and therefore c l n 3 c l n 2 in addition whenever τ 0 using 6 we elected to set τ 0 to ensure that no negative streamflows could be generated later on in our monte carlo experiments 2 2 kappa and wakeby estimators of c blum et al 2017 evaluated the goodness of fit of various pdfs to distributions of nonzero daily streamflow across the u s and found that good approximations to f x include the four parameter kappa kap distribution as well as the three parameter lognormal ln3 however they did not evaluate mixture distributions as we do later on in this study blum et al 2017 also provide a detailed review of studies which have sought to approximate the pdf of daily flow series for various regions of the world more recently brunner and gilleland 2020 fit a separate kappa distribution to the daily streamflows on each day of the year appendix a provides estimators of c for nonzero streamflow series corresponding to the four parameter kappa kap distribution and a five parameter wakeby wak distribution note that we do not constrain the lower bound on the fitted kap and wak distributions to be zero because this approach enables improvements in the goodness of fit of the fitted distributions to the nonzero observations nonzero daily streamflow observations are not usually bounded by zero anyway as there is often a measurement threshold such as 0 01 cfs see rantz et al 1982 page 571 which represents the minimum streamflow measurement reported by the usgs we employ l moment estimators of the parameters of these pdfs based on the work of hosking 1990 and hosking and wallis 1997 using the software developed specifically for these purposes hosking 2017 appendix a derives l moment estimators of c corresponding to the kap and wak distributions termed c kap and c wak respectively 2 3 mixture distributions for streamflow as discussed in the introduction intermittent and ephemeral streamflows are common and result in a mixture of random variables describing 1 the occurrence of zero streamflow and 2 the magnitude of positive streamflow the occurrence of zero streamflows complicates hydrologic frequency analyses because it creates a discontinuity in the pdf of streamflow thus requiring a mixture model to adequately capture the pdf of both zero and nonzeros baldwin and lall 1999 prairie 2006 and others have documented that annual seasonal and other periodic variations in daily streamflow can lead to complex bimodal pdfs unlike single pdfs mixture models provide a flexible approach to capture the potential multimodal behavior of streamflow for this reason mixture models are now widely used in flood frequency analysis and have been found to yield improved estimates of flood quantiles when compared to methods based on single pdfs yan et al 2017 and szulczewski and jakubowki 2018 in summary daily streamflow series exhibit two mixture processes 1 a mixture of periodic components as well as 2 a mixture of zero and non zero flows a discrete continuous distribution is needed to account for both the occurrence of zero streamflows and the strong deterministic signals associated with seasonal periodicity within the daily flow series which can give rise to multimodal behavior in the pdf in the following section we introduce a mixture modeling approach for handling both the occurrence of zeros and periodicity when computing hydrologic summary statistics from daily flow series 2 4 a zero inflated lognormal mixture δ ln3 model for handling zeros and skewness in addition to periodicity and the occurrence of zeros daily and sub daily streamflows are known to exhibit extremely high values of skewness thus any mixture distribution will need to provide a flexible accounting of skewness barber et al 2019 blum et al 2017 and limbrunner et al 2000 fig 6 used l moment diagrams to illustrate that ln2 and ln3 distributions provide a good and very good respectively first approximation to the pdf of daily streamflow observations for hundreds of stations across the conterminous u s other more complex distributions such as the four parameter kappa or five parameter wakeby distribution were found to provide even better fits blum et al 2017 particularly when the model parameters are allowed to vary from day to day brunner and gilleland 2020 unlike this study none of the above cited studies accounted for the discontinuity in the pdf of daily streamflows which can occur with intermittent and ephemeral rivers zero inflated pdfs have been introduced to handle the occurrence of zeros by modeling the streamflow process as a mixture of two processes 1 zero flows and 2 magnitude of non zero values for example guo et al 2016 applied a zero inflated lognormal model which they termed a mixed lognormal model for modeling daily streamflows similarly kedeem et al 1990 and shimizu 1993 applied a zero inflated lognormal model to rainfall processes zero inflated lognormal models were first introduced by aitchison 1955 and are more recently referred to by crow and shimizu 1988 as the delta lognormal model all such models to date referred to as delta lognormal models δ ln2 are three parameter models which combine the ln2 model with a third parameter defined as the probability of a zero observation here we introduce a natural extension to δ ln2 termed the δ ln3 which combines an ln3 model with a probability of zero defined as 1 δ we employ a δ ln3 model because hfss are known to exhibit both zero streamflow as well as the remaining positive streamflows which are typically greater than some positive lower bound τ which represents either the minimum measurement threshold or the minimum value of reported streamflow discharge for example the u s geological survey only report nonzero streamflow discharge measurements above a minimum value of 0 01 cfs rantz et al 1982 page 571 thus in addition to the mean and variance of the nonzero streamflows i e the two parameters of a ln2 model the δ ln3 model has two additional parameters 1 the lower bound τ of the positive streamflows and 2 the probability of zero streamflow 1 δ following the existing literature aitchison 1955 crow and shimizu 1988 shimizu 1993 kedeem et al 1990 guo et al 2016 we define the cumulative distribution function cdf of the mixture process x in month i as f i x p i x x which is made up of the cdf of the zero daily streamflows in month i given by the heaviside step function h i x 0 when x 0 and h i x 1 otherwise and the continuous cdf of the nonzero daily streamflows in month i g i x we extend this model into a monthly mixture model in the next section the cdf of the mixture of zero and nonzero streamflows in month i denoted f i x is given by 7a f i x 1 δ i h i x δ i g i x which can be rewritten as 7b f i x 0 x 0 1 δ i x 0 1 δ i 0 x τ i 1 δ i δ i g i x τ i x where τ i is the lower bound of streamflow in month i and 1 δ i is the probability of a zero streamflow in month i combining 7 with the fact that e x k x k d g x δ 0 x k f x d x we obtain an expression for the coefficient of variation of daily flows in month i denoted c i σ i μ i as a function of the coefficient of variation of the nonzero flows in month i termed c nz i and the probability of zero flows 1 δ i as 8 c i c nz i 2 1 δ i δ i note that this result holds for all distributions g i x and is not unique to the δ l n 2 and δ l n 3 models below as an example of the increase in variability resulting from the occurrence of zeros c i increases from 1 1 to 4 4 for fixed c nz i 1 and probabilities of zero flows 1 δ i equal to 0 1 and 0 9 respectively thus arid and semi arid regions are expected to experience extremely high values of c i when g i x in 7 is an ln3 cdf x follows a δ ln3 model in which case one can easily extend results for the δ ln2 model from aitchison 1955 to obtain the mean and variance in month i as 9a μ i τ i δ i exp μ y i σ y i 2 2 9b σ i 2 δ i exp 2 μ y i σ y i 2 exp σ y i 2 δ i where μ y i and σ y i 2 are the mean and variance of y ln x τ i in month i with τ i equal to the lower bound of the l n 3 model in month i we approximate the pdf of hfss in a given month i using the above four parameter δ l n 3 model with moments given by 9 as shown in the next section 2 5 a delta ln3 monthly mixture δ ln3mm model for handling periodicity zeros and skewness selecting and fitting a single pdf to daily streamflow series as was done in the previous section and in many previous studies is ill advised because such series are not identically distributed due to their seasonal behavior one expects the parameters of any pdf fit to daily streamflow series to exhibit seasonal and possibly other periodic behavior thus we chose to model daily streamflow series using a monthly mixture model where the daily streamflows in each month are modeled by the four parameter δ ln3 model given in the previous section the resulting model is termed a δ ln3 monthly mixture δ ln3mm model for daily streamflow a more parsimonious seasonal model could be employed but such an approach would require the definition of seasons which differ by hydro climatologic regime adding a degree of subjectivity which could cloud our ability to draw definitive conclusions concerning the impact of periodicity on estimation of c other approaches to modeling seasonality such as by fitting smooth periodic functions should be considered in future studies since daily flow samples considered here are in the tens of thousands we elected not to concern ourselves with the often critical issue of parsimony the δ ln3mm model involves fitting a separate δ ln3 model to the daily flows in each month so that each month i is characterized by the four parameters of the δ ln3 model given by its mean μ y i variance σ y i 2 lower bound τ i and probability of zero 1 δ i corresponding to the daily streamflows x and their transformed values y ln x τ i we employ this 48 parameter δ ln3mm model to generate synthetic streamflow series which are shown in section 5 2 to better mimic the complex marginal distribution of daily streamflows than a single δ ln3 model we also show later how to exploit this δ ln3mm model for obtaining improved estimators of c the δ ln3mm model will produce daily streamflows that no longer follow a δ ln3 model and nonzero daily streamflows that no longer follow a ln3 distribution as usual for compound distributions dubey 1970 porporato et al 2006 and others importantly the δ ln3mm is able to model the distribution of extremely complex periodic highly skewed multimodal ephemeral and intermittent streamflows consider a monthly mixture distribution made up of fitting a separate δ ln3 distribution f x μ i σ i τ i δ i to the daily streamflows in each of i 1 12 months where x denotes the daily streamflow observations within month i τ i denotes the lower bound 1 δ i denotes the probability of zeros of the fitted δ l n 3 distribution in month i and μ i and σ i denote the mean and standard deviation of the streamflows x in month i given in 9 the resulting δ ln3mm pdf of all the daily streamflows is given by 10 f x μ 1 μ 12 σ 1 σ 12 τ 1 τ 12 δ 1 δ 12 i 1 12 w i f i x μ i σ i τ i δ i where f denotes the overall pd of x and f i denotes the δ l n 3 pdf of the streamflows x in month i and i 1 12 w i 1 combining 10 with the facts that e x k 0 x k f x d x and σ 2 e x μ 2 e x 2 μ 2 leads to 11a e x μ i 1 12 w i μ i and 11b e x μ 2 σ 2 i 1 12 w i μ i 2 σ i 2 μ 2 eq 11 can be used to obtain the overall coefficient of variation c σ μ of the resulting fitted δ ln3mm distribution note that one can fit more complex distributions than either an δ ln2 or δ ln3 distribution to the daily streamflows in each month as long as one can obtain estimates of both the mean and variance μ i and σ i 2 of x for each of the 12 fitted distributions in 9 2 6 estimation of parameters of the δ ln3mm model in this section we document how to estimate the parameters and overall cdf corresponding to the δ ln3mm model in section 2 5 the cdf of the daily streamflows corresponding to the monthly mixture model is obtained by integration of 10 which leads to 12 f x μ 1 μ 12 σ 1 σ 12 τ 1 τ 12 δ 1 δ 12 i 1 12 w i f i x μ i σ i τ i δ i where f denotes the cdf of all the daily streamflows x and f i denotes the δ ln3 cdf of the streamflows x in month i here we assume the same number of days in each month which leads to the fixed weights w i 1 12 however future work may benefit from use of maximum likelihood or bayesian estimators of the mixture weights as recommended by mclachlan et al 2019 efficient estimation of the cdf of all the streamflows f in 12 is as follows first we note that in a given month i nonzero streamflows x follow an ln3 model so that in each month y ln x τ i follows a different normal model where an attractive estimator of the lower bound τ i in each month i is given by the stedinger 1980 estimator given in 6 from 7 an efficient estimate of the cdf of all the streamflows in month i f i x is then given by 13 f i x 0 x 0 1 δ i 0 x 1 δ i δ i g i y x τ i τ i with δ i 1 m i n i g i y φ i y y i s y i y i 1 n i m i j 1 n i m i ln x j τ i s y i 1 n i m i j 1 n i m i ln x j τ i y i 2 where m i is the number zero streamflows in month i n i is the total number of streamflow observations in month i y ln x τ i with τ i given in 6 and φ denotes the cdf of a standard normal variable we are concatenating daily flows across the entire n period of record so that m and n denote the total number of zeros and the total number of streamflows in the entire n year record for example if there were no zero flows in any month i so that m i 0 in every month i then there would be roughly n 12 flows in each month an estimate of the cdf of all the daily streamflows f x in 12 is obtained from 14 f x i 1 12 1 12 f i x with f i x given in 13 2 7 goodness of fit of the fitted δ ln3 δ kap δ wak and δ ln3mm models an important contribution of this study involves documenting the improved goodness of fit of the monthly mixture model over numerous common single pdf s often advocated for modeling daily flow duration curves here we assess the goodness of fit of the various fitted zero inflated models also termed delta models as well as the monthly mixture model fitted to streamflow observations any pdf for nonzero observations can be converted to a zero inflated model or delta model by substitution of the pdf of the nonzero values g x into 7 when g x is an l n 3 kap wak cdf then f x in 7 corresponds to the δ l n 3 δ k a p and δ w a k models which are all compared in this section with the δ l n 3 m m model we employ the same procedure regardless of whether or not the flow series exhibit zeros we employ the widely used probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc to evaluate the goodness of fit stedinger et al 1993 of the fitted pdfs to the streamflow observations there are two types of ppcc s one based on a quantile quantile q q probability plot and another based on a probability probability p p plot gan and koehler 1990 we employ p p plots instead of q q plots because daily and hourly streamflow quantiles vary over 3 5 orders of magnitude thus ppcc estimates from such q q plots suffer from the same type of systematic bias that ratio estimators of c skewness and kurtosis are known to exhibit particularly for data series with very high values of c as is the focus here see vogel and fennessey 1993 gan and koehler 1990 describe ppcc hypothesis tests based upon p p plots where the percentiles associated with each of the ranked observations computed from the fitted distribution are plotted against their unbiased weibull plotting positions the ppcc statistic based on a p p plot is the pearson correlation between these two axes both of which have values between 0 and 1 using ppcc statistics based on p p plots treats each observation with effectively equal weight and as a result is influenced far less by outliers than a ppcc based on a q q plot ppcc hypothesis tests require an assumption that the flows are iid however since we only employ this statistic as a relative goodness of fit metric our comparisons do not depend on the iid assumption estimates of r p p c c corresponding to the fitted δ l n 3 δ k a p δ w a k and δ l n 3 m m models are obtained from the pearson correlation estimator defined by 15 r j 1 n f x j f x j p j p j j 1 n f x j f x j 2 j 1 n p j p j 2 where f x j is obtained by substitution of the jth ordered value of x denoted x j into the expression for the cdf of the distribution given in 7b and 13 and f x j denotes their mean values across all n observations at a site in 15 p j denotes the weibull plotting position estimate of the cumulative probabilities given by p j j n 1 here a weibull plotting position is ideally suited because it yields an unbiased estimate of the cumulative probability associated with the observations regardless of their pdf stedinger et al 1993 when there are m zero flows among the n flows then an estimate of the cumulative probability of a zero flow is obtained from p m m n 1 2 7 1 p p probability plot for δ l n 3 δ k a p δ w a k models estimates of the cdf of all streamflows denoted f x j is needed to compute r p p c c in 15 and can be computed for each of the three fitted zero inflated δ l n 3 δ k a p and δ w a k models from 16 f x j 0 x 0 1 δ 0 x τ 1 δ δ g x j x τ with δ 1 m n where m is the overall number of zero observations and n is the overall sample size ppcc for δ ln3 model substitution of the cdf of the nonzero observations g y j φ y j y s y with y j 1 n m ln x j τ n m and s y j 1 n m ln x τ y 2 n m into 16 yields an estimate of the cdf f x j for the δ l n 3 model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 ppcc for δ kap model substitution of l moment estimates of the kap parameters α κ h and ξ into a2 yields an estimate of the cdf of the nonzero observations g x j which can be substituted into 16 to yield an estimate of the cdf f x j for an δ k a p model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 ppcc for δ wak model an analytical form of the pdf and cdf of a wak distribution does not exist however it is possible to estimate g x by solving a5 numerically for g substitution of l moment estimates of the wak parameters α β γ θ and ξ into a5 combined with a numerical solution yields an estimate of the cdf of the nonzero observations g x j which can be substituted into 16 to yield an estimate of the cdf f x j for an δ w a k model needed to compute the ppcc in 15 2 7 2 p p probability plot for δ ln3mm model a p p probability plot is constructed by first ranking all the nonzero daily streamflow observations denoted x j j 1 2 n m where n i 1 12 n i is the total record length of the daily flow series and m i 1 12 m i is the total number of zero observations each ordered daily flow x j corresponds to a transformed flow y j ln x j τ i for i 1 2 12 and j 1 2 n where τ i is given in 6 under the ln3 hypothesis x follows an ln3 distribution and y j ln x j τ i follows a normal distribution so that a p p probability plot is obtained by plotting a weibull plotting position estimate of the cumulative probabilities p j j n 1 versus an estimate of the cumulative probability of the fitted mixture distribution for the jth observation obtained from 14 where one replaces the observation x with the ordered observation x j with f i x j given in 13 analogous to replacing x with x j in 14 one replaces the observation y with the ordered observation y j in 13 the ppcc is then obtained by computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the n values of the plotting positions p j and f x j obtained from 14 3 summary of estimators of c three classes of estimators of c are introduced in this study 1 sample estimators based on the assumption that daily streamflow arises from a single distribution which is equivalent to the assumption of identically distributed streamflows throughout the year 2 sample estimators based on a single zero inflated which assume two populations one for zero flows and one for nonzero flows and 3 a mixture model which combines monthly zero inflated ln3 model with a monthly mixture model the first class of estimators attempt to account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with daily streamflows the second class of estimators account for both skewness and the occurrence of zeros while the third class of models account for skewness zeros and the periodicity of daily streamflows 3 1 estimators of c based on a single distribution section 2 and appendix a summarizes a suite of estimators which assume that all streamflows arise from a single pdf those sample estimators were denoted c pm c l n 2 c finney c breunig c l n 3 c kap and c wak given in eqs 1 3 4 5 6 a4 and a6 respectively 3 2 estimators of c based on a single zero inflated distribution eq 8 documents the analytical relationship between c i corresponding to all streamflows in a given month and the value of c nz i corresponding to only the nonzero observations in that month if one assumes that daily streamflows arise from the same zero inflated distribution in every month then 8 reduces to 17 c c nz 2 1 δ δ three single zero inflated models were considered previously including the δ ln3 δ kap and the δ wak models in each case a value for c nz corresponding to the nonzero observations was derived and denoted c l n 3 c kap and c wak in equations 6 a4 and a6 respectively substitution of each of those corresponding values of c nz into 17 leads to the estimators c δ l n 3 c δ k a p and c δ w a k corresponding to the three zero inflated distributions 3 3 estimator of c based on monthly zero inflated distributions and the monthly ln3 mixture model the model which is expected to perform best in this study is the δ ln3mm model because it accounts for skewness periodicity and zero streamflows all factors which influence the variability of streamflow estimation involving a zero inflated monthly mixture model in arid regions could lead to small sample estimation issues even when dealing with long records of daily streamflow recall it is not uncommon for ephemeral headwater streams to experience values of 1 δ in excess of 0 8 or 0 9 in which case the number of non zero streamflows could be quite small for example a 10 year record n 3 650 of daily streamflow with 1 δ 0 9 results in only 365 nonzero streamflows or only 30 nonzero flows per month if they are distributed evenly christman 2019 documents that the naïve estimators of the δ l n 3 m m model in 13 exhibit significant bias for small iid samples i e 100 observations and that the umuve estimators introduced by aitchison 1955 are preferred thus we incorporate them below into our δ l n 3 m m estimator of c the theoretical expression for c corresponding to a monthly mixture model in 11 can be rewritten in the form of an estimator for the δ l n 3 m m model by combining various results from 9 11 and 13 with those of aitchison 1955 to obtain 18a c δ l n 3 m m σ μ i 1 12 μ i 2 σ i 2 μ 2 12 i 1 12 μ i 12 where 18b μ i τ i δ i exp y i g n i m i s y i 2 2 18c σ i 2 δ i exp 2 y i g n i m i 2 s y i 2 1 m i n i 1 g n i m i n i m i 2 n i m i 1 s y i 2 δ i 1 m i n i where g n i m i is given in 4 m i is the number zero streamflows in month i n i is the total number of streamflow observations in month i and formulas for the sample mean y i and sample variance s y i 2 of the values of y ln x τ i in a given month i are given in 13 and τ i is given in 6 but here is only applied to the n i m i nonzero streamflows note once again 18 assumes the same number of days in each month so that w i 1 12 for all months 4 results in the following section we first evaluate and compare the goodness of fit of the various pdfs introduced for modeling daily streamflow observations at thousands of watersheds across the conterminous u s we also perform monte carlo experiments which evaluate the sampling properties bias and rmse of the various estimators of c introduced previously with the goal of determining which estimator is best suited to use with hfss we then apply the estimator of c which performs best in those experiments to summarize the behavior of c and to determine those factors which influence the relative variability of streamflow 4 1 database of streamflows estimates of c were obtained for a subset of the gages ii database falcone 2011 based on two criteria 1 there are continuous discharge data for more than 20 years and 2 the percentage of missing data is 5 table 1 uses square brackets to summarize various statistical and hydroclimatic characteristics of discharge data and drainage area for the 6886 watersheds considered record lengths range from 20 120 years or 7300 43 827 days corresponding to a median of 47 4 years or 17 289 days and the drainage areas a range from 0 77 to 49 802 km2 with a median of 525 km2 the climate aridity ratio ar defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation p was obtained for each watershed from the prism dataset prism climate group 2017 the values of ar in table 1 illustrate a very broad range of hydro climatologic regimes because according to the climatic classification system introduced by ponce et al 2000 table 1 the values of ar pet p reported in table 1 range from approximately 0 1 5 71 which corresponds to hydro climatological conditions ranging from arid to super humid conditions note that energy limited ar 1 basins are more common than water limited ar 1 basins since the median ar is 0 68 this characterization is consistent with the probability of zero discharge 1 δ which is higher in the water limited regions than that in the energy limited regions values of the runoff ratio rr defined as the ratio of runoff to precipitation summarized in table 1 were obtained from the gages ii database and the median runoff ratio is 0 34 it is worth noting that the runoff ratio in 32 of the 6886 watersheds is greater than 1 the potential reasons for this include 1 the watersheds are not closed basins and may be subject to groundwater inflows and or possible water diversions into the basin and 2 the areal rainfall data are underestimated since the rainfall stations may not be representative of their entire watersheds 4 2 goodness of fit evaluations using p p plots section 3 4 summarized our approach for evaluating the goodness of fit of the δ ln3 δ kap δ wak and δ ln3mm models using p p plots and the ppcc statistic we emphasize at the outset that we expect that the less parsimonious δ ln3mm to exhibit much higher ppcc values than the other more parsimonious models in many hydrologic applications parsimony is a paramount concern however here sample sizes are very large compared to say flood frequency analysis thus parsimony is not as important a concern as in small sample applications and our goal is to employ a model with a nearly perfect goodness of fit for all basins considered so that the model can be used to both mimic streamflow variability and to enable unbiased estimation of c unfortunately we were only able to fit a kap distribution to 4607 of the 6886 watersheds fig 1 uses boxplots of the ppcc statistic to compare the goodness of fit among the ln3 kap δ kap and δ ln3mm models at 4528 of the 6886 sites where all four models could be fit fig 1 documents the considerable improvement in goodness of fit resulting from the δ ln3mm model when compared to the ln3 kap and δ kap models the difficulty of fitting a kap distribution to daily streamflow observations has been experienced before see blum et al 2017 and studies cited therein thus we drop both the kap and the δ kap model from further goodness of fit comparisons however we encourage others to consider seasonal or monthly mixture models based on a kap model analogous to the recent work by brunner and gilleland 2020 who fit a separate kap model to daily streamflows on each day an advantage of the ln3 models over the kap models is that we were able to fit them at nearly all 6886 watersheds though the ln3 model reduced to an ln2 model at 3287 sites where the lower bound τ was set to zero for the reasons described in our discussion of eq 6 fig 2 compares boxplots of ppcc values corresponding to the three ln3 models ln3 δ ln3 and δ ln3mm at 6807 of the 6886 watersheds where all three models could be fit we were unable to fit the δ ln3mm at 79 watersheds due to the occurrence of all zero flows in some months importantly fig 2 documents the considerable improvement in the goodness of fit of the 48 parameter δ ln3mm model over both the four parameter δ ln3 model and the three parameter ln3 model which reinforces and quantifies the importance of accounting for both the occurrence of zeros and the periodicity of streamflow series fig 3 uses a scatterplot to compare the ppcc value corresponding to the δ ln3mm and δ ln3mm models and again documents the nearly global and rather significant improvement in the goodness of fit of the δ ln3mm model over the single δ ln3 zero inflated model 4 3 monte carlo experiments the goal of this section is to perform controlled monte carlo experiments which enable us to conclude which estimator of c denoted c performs best in terms of its percent bias b i a s c 100 c e c c and it s percent root mean square error r m s e c 100 e c c 2 c these are standard metrics used in the statistics literature to evaluate the precision and accuracy of any estimator due to the well known fact that mean square error of an estimator is made up of the sum of its bias squared and its variance one can easily show that r m s e c 2 b i a s c 2 v a r c thus it is only necessary to report any two of these indices to understand the general performance of the estimator c to compute b i a s c and r m s e c the true value c must be known or assumed for the purposes of our monte carlo experiments we assume that values of c δ l n 3 m m in 18 computed from the complete records summarized in table 1 are the true values of c at each site we selected a subset of 190 watersheds among the 6 886 watersheds for monte carlo experiments due to the high computational burden associated with these experiments the watershed characteristics of the chosen subset of 190 watersheds are summarized using parentheses in table 1 for comparison with the 6886 watersheds shown using square brackets the 190 watersheds were chosen so that 1 they all exhibited extremely high goodness of fit associated with the fitted δ ln3mm model and 2 they reflect the distribution of c δ l n 3 m m which was observed among the 6886 sites the δ ln3mm ppcc values for the 190 sites ranged from 0 9966 to 0 9999 with a median value of 0 9996 and an interquartile range equal to 0 9993 0 9998 which is evidence of the extremely high goodness of fit associated with the δ ln3mm model for these sites the distribution of the values of c δ l n 3 m m associated with the 190 selected stations ranged from 0 48 to 4072 with an interquartile range from 1 2 to 8 2 and a median value of 2 among the 190 sites 14 stations had c δ l n 3 m m 100 and 4 stations had c δ l n 3 m m 1000 among the 6807 sites for which we could fit the δ ln3mm model c δ l n 3 m m ranged from 0 19 to 42 000 with an interquartile range from 1 3 to 3 8 and a median value of 1 9 these results combined with comparisons given in table 1 indicate that the subset of 190 sites should reflect the overall behavior of the much larger set of 6807 watersheds note that the largest value of c δ l n 3 m m corresponding to the 6807 sites was much greater than the largest value among the 190 sites because those extremely large values of c δ l n 3 m m correspond to sites with poor goodness of fit associated with the δ ln3mm and hence were not included in the 190 sites we generate synthetic streamflow series using the δ ln3mm model with parameters estimated by applying 13 to the 190 streamflow records the algorithm for generating 50 year n 18 250 days synthetic streamflow records at each site from the δ ln3mm model is as follows 1 for a given site estimate the true values of the δ ln3mm model parameters in each month i from 13 so that δ i δ i μ y y i σ y i s y i with τ i τ i computed from 6 2 generate the uniform random variates u i j over the interval 0 1 where i 1 12 months and j 1 n i where n i is the total number of daily streamflows both zero and nonzero in month i for the site under consideration 3 generate a total of n 18 250 daily 50 year streamflows x i j at each site using 19 x i j 0 if u i j 1 δ i τ i exp μ y i z u i j σ y i otherwise where z denotes a standard normal variate eq 19 is used to generate j 1 n i daily streamflows in each month i figs 4 7 illustrate boxplots of b i a s c and r m s e c for the suite of estimators of c introduced here when applied to the synthetic streamflow series generated at each of the 190 experimental sites from this analysis we note that c δ l n 3 m m is a considerable improvement over all other estimators considered in terms of both b i a s c and r m s e c estimates of c values for some of the 190 stations could not be calculated from the δ kap or δ wak models thus two sets of figures are included for bias and rmse the bias fig 4 and rmse fig 6 could only be computed at 129 of the 190 stations using all 11 estimators whereas the bias fig 5 and rmse fig 7 could be computed for all 190 stations using the 7 methods which are not based on kappa and wakeby distributions importantly both the bias and rmse of the δ ln3mm estimator is smallest and generally much smaller than that of any other methods the biases for the single distribution estimators c finney and c l n 2 are the largest the biases for the estimators c pm and c breunig are always positive indicating that c pm and c breunig are underestimated compared with the theoretical value of considerable interest is the behavior of the most common estimator of c the product moment estimator c pm fig 8 illustrates a scatterplot of b i a s c pm versus the assumed true value c c δ l n 3 m m which illustrates as expected that the enormous downward bias associated with c pm is greatest at sites with the highest values of c δ l n 3 m m which also tend to be those sites in arid and semi arid regions as shown in section 5 fig 9 is a plot of c pm versus c δ l n 3 m m for 6807 sites which illustrates that c δ l n 3 m m is able to cover a much broader range of values of c than c pm giving us more sensitivity to the range of high values of c fig 9 highlights that there are many watersheds throughout the u s which have enormous values of c δ l n 3 m m in the hundreds and even thousands whereas the naïve estimator c pm leads us to believe that there is an upper bound on c in the vicinity of 50 recall kirby s 1974 upper bound on c pm equal to n 1 has an impact here because the upper bounds on c pm corresponding to the range of sample sizes 7300 43827 reported in table 1 would range from 85 209 kirby s bounds have an impact regardless of the stochastic structure of the observations and only require that the flows be nonnegative thus kirby s upper bound on c pm could very well be causing some of the downward bias illustrated in figs 8 and 9 together figs 8 and 9 document that until the introduction of the estimator c δ l n 3 m m we have been unable to understand depict and approximate an unbiased representation of the true relative variability of streamflow across broad hydroclimatic regimes 5 summary of behavior of estimates of c of considerable interest are the factors which give rise to such extremely large values of c δ l n 3 m m depicted in fig 9 across the conterminous u s naturally there are many factors which would explain the gross variations in c δ l n 3 m m including but not limited to physical watershed characteristics climatic characteristics and numerous water management variables relating to withdrawals diversions return flows reservoir operations and other factors it is beyond the scope of this initial study to consider all these factors hence we only consider the impact of a few watershed and climatic characteristics a natural sequel to this study would be a much more exhaustive study with the goal of determining the key drivers of streamflow variability to this aim we plotted c δ l n 3 m m versus the physical and statistical characteristics including the probability of a zero 1 δ watershed area a runoff ratio rr and aridity ratio ar these scatter plots revealed no obvious discernable relationship except in the case of c δ l n 3 m m versus 1 δ thus we only illustrate that scatterplot in fig 10 to save space and we perform a more detailed multivariate analysis below the scatterplot in fig 10 indicates a strong relationship between c δ l n 3 m m and the probability of zeros 1 δ for the 2166 watersheds that exhibited zeros to further evaluate the multivariate relationship between c δ l n 3 m m and 1 δ a rr and ar we fit the following multivariate model using ordinary least squares regression 20 ln c δ l n 3 m m β 0 β 1 φ 1 1 δ β 2 ln ar β 3 ln rr β 4 ln a ε where φ 1 is the inverse of a standard normal distribution β j j 0 4 are model coefficients and ε are model errors the transformation φ 1 1 δ is only used to ensure that the probability of zero 1 δ is bounded on the interval 0 1 whereas all other independent variables have no such constraints equation 20 was fit to 2166 of the 6807 of the watersheds summarized in table 1 which exhibited zero streamflows table 2 summarizes estimates of the model coefficients and their corresponding t ratios and p values associated with each explanatory variable diagnostic plots indicated relatively well behaved residuals which were roughly independent homoscedastic and normally distributed the high t ratios and very low p values in table 2 along with the reasonably well behaved residuals enable us to conclude that all model coefficients are highly significant and stable influence statistics indicated that no watersheds exerted unusual influence on the model coefficient values all variance inflation factors were below 2 0 revealing a general lack of multicollinearity among the explanatory variables see helsel et al 2020 for background on influence statistics variance inflation factors and other regression methods reported here the magnitude of the t ratio is proportional to the explanatory power of its associated explanatory variable the fitted model in 20 summarized in table 2 resulted in an adjusted r2 42 2 substitution of the fitted model coefficients from table 2 into 20 and exponentiation yields a model for c δ l n 3 m m 21 c δ l n 3 m m exp 2 97 0 728 φ 1 1 δ a r 0 342 r r 0 0748 a 0 0608 we conclude that increases in c δ l n 3 m m result from increases in ar a and the probability of zero flows 1 δ and from decreases in rr we also note that the exponents on ar rr and a in eq 21 can be interpreted as nondimensional elasticities so that a 1 increase in ar and a is expected to result in a 0 34 and a 0 06 increase in c δ l n 3 m m respectively similarly a 1 increase in rr is expected to result in a 0 075 decrease in c δ l n 3 m m fig 11 illustrates a contour maps of values of a c δ l n 3 m m and b c pm based on the 6 807 gages ii watersheds summarized in table 1 these maps were constructed using an inverse distance weighting interpolation method between the gages ii gauging station locations a comparison of the two maps in fig 11 reveals the remarkable differences in our understanding of the geographic variations in relative variability of daily streamflows revealed by these two different estimators of c particularly in arid and semi arid regions a comparison of fig 11a and b reveals that our estimator c δ l n 3 m m is able to represent an entirely new level of streamflow variability never before witnessed analogous to the results of our multivariate analysis the extremely high values of c δ l n 3 m m reported in fig 11 generally occur in arid and semi arid regions of the southwestern u s and eastern washington other instances of extremely high values of c δ l n 3 m m tend to correspond to locations with a high frequency of zero flows as in southern florida and some regions of the upper midwest 6 impact of persistence on the behavior of estimates of c previous sections have accounted for the influence of periodicity skewness intermittent and ephemeral streamflow conditions on the properties of c in this section we discuss briefly the influence of persistence on flow variability evidence of streamflow persistence can be described by its autocorrelation structure which is known to have an impact on the sampling properties of estimators of c the topic of this section vogel et al 1998 documented the impact of serial correlation of the flow sequences on both the bias and variance of various estimators of c they derived an approximately unbiased estimator of c in their eq 18 for flows which arise from an ln2 lag one autoregressive process and documented using monte carlo experiments that their analytical expressions provide good approximations to both the bias and variance of their recommended estimator an evaluation of their bias correction for autocorrelation indicates that it is only important for small samples i e n 100 even when autocorrelations approache unity as is the case for daily and hourly streamflows since daily and hourly flow sequences usually have sample sizes well in excess of 100 we neglect the impact of serial correlation on bias and refer the reader to vogel et al 1998 for further information 7 conclusions and recommendations this study has sought to improve our understanding of the behavior of and our ability to estimate the coefficient of variation c of high frequency streamflow series hfss such as daily and subdaily series we have also documented the critical need to account for the high levels of periodicity skewness and zero streamflows associated with hfss when attempting to estimate summary statistics of such series although other measures of relative variability exist we focus on c because it is easy to interpret and understand and is probably the most widely used index of relative variability in hydrology given the enormous impact of streamflow variability on nearly every aspect of water resource design planning and management this study has sought to provide unbiased and reliable estimates of c for daily streamflows at watersheds exhibiting a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions recent research has shown that knowledge of the magnitude of c plays a dominant role and creates considerable obstacles relating to our ability to estimate very common hydrologic statistics such as the pearson correlation coefficient barber et al 2019 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency goodness of fit metric lamontagne et al 2020 three classes of estimators of c are introduced in this study the first class of estimators are the traditional estimators c pm c l n 2 c finney c breunig c l n 3 c kap and c wak which can account for the high degree of variability and skewness associated with hfss but only perform well when streamflows are identically distributed which is rarely the case the second class of estimators c δ l n 3 c δ k a p and c δ w a k are based on the three zero inflated models δ l n 3 δ k a p and the δ w a k which account for both skewness and the occurrence of zeros finally we introduce the new and promising estimator c δ l n 3 m m which accounts for skewness zeros and the periodicity of daily streamflows all factors shown to be integral to reliable and unbiased estimation of c our findings are based on monte carlo experiments based on both 1 long series of daily streamflows at 6886 gages ii watersheds as well as 2 synthetic daily streamflows generated from a zero inflated lognormal mixture model which we term the δ l n 3 m m model and the following conclusions are reached 1 on the probability distribution of daily streamflows goodness of fit evaluations at thousands of watersheds across the conterminous u s indicate that the δ l n 3 m m monthly mixture model provides an improved goodness of fit to the pdf of daily streamflow series over a wide range of common single distribution functions recommended by others including zero inflated versions of those distributions fig 2 documents the consistent and considerable improvement in the goodness of fit of the 48 parameter δ l n 3 m m model over both the four parameter δ l n 3 model and the three parameter l n 3 models which reinforces and quantifies the importance of accounting for both the occurrence of zeros and periodicity in addition to the high skewness associated with daily streamflow series 2 on the need for mixture models to account for seasonality our monte carlo experiments reveal that among the eleven different estimators of c considered the estimator c δ l n 3 m m based on the δ l n 3 m m model exhibited remarkably lower bias and rmse than any other estimator importantly those controlled experiments documented that accounting for the seasonal nonstationarity in the flow series with a monthly mixture model led to dramatic reductions in both the bias and rmse when compared to all other estimators considered our zero inflated δ l n 3 m m model accounts for the extremely complex periodic highly skewed multimodal and possibly ephemeral and intermittent characteristics of hfss which is shown to be necessary to obtain both unbiased and reliable estimates of c future studies should consider other methods for handling seasonality whether through different types of mixture models or through the introduction of periodic functions which approximate observed seasonality 3 extraordinary levels of streamflow variability are revealed from monthly mixture models extending the results documented by vogel and fennessey 1993 for c 10 our experiments revealed downward bias in the traditional estimator of c termed c pm which approached 100 for samples with extremely high values of c in excess of about 100 comparison of values of the common product moment estimator c pm with the estimator c δ l n 3 m m at 6886 watersheds in fig 11 led us to conclude that until now we have been unable to understand and depict the relative variability of streamflow c across broad hydroclimatic regimes those comparisons reveal that c δ l n 3 m m is able to represent an entirely new and higher level of streamflow variability never before exposed or verified such high values of c in arid and semi arid regions imply that in such situations even estimates of the sample mean will exhibit such extraordinary variability that its use in such situations should be questioned therefore improved zero inflated monthly mixture estimators or their equivalent are needed for estimation of a host of other statistics in addition to the mean and c of daily and subdaily flow series in arid and semi arid regions analogous to our findings concerning estimation of c lamontagne et al 2020 document that an ln3 monthly mixture model is also quite useful for estimation of the nash sutcliffe goodness of fit statistic when working with daily streamflows 4 the impact of sample size skewness zeros and seasonality wallis et al 1974 first identified the enormous bias and variability associated with c pm for iid skewed samples with small sample sizes i e n 100 and vogel and fennessey 1993 found similar results for sample sizes in the tens of thousands from highly skewed iid samples with c 10 this study is in some sense a sequel to those two studies revealing that the extraordinary bias and variability associated with traditional estimators of c even for sample sizes in the tens of thousands results from the high degree of skewness periodicity and the occurrence of zeros associated with hfss what is unique to this study is our introduction of the δ l n 3 m m model which accounts for the three factors skewness zeros and periodicity together which enabled us to obtain unbiased and reliable estimates of c increases in skewness periodicity and the likelihood of zeros were all shown to contribute to increases in both the bias and rmse of resulting estimators of c we have also demonstrated that some of the downward bias in c pm is due in part to kirby s 1974 upper bound even with samples in the tens of thousands 5 the physical causes of streamflow variability a multivariate analysis of the 2166 streamgauges that experienced zero streamflow revealed that increases in c δ l n 3 m m result from increases in the aridity ratio ar drainage area a and the probability of zero flows 1 δ and from decreases in the runoff ratio rr a comparison of national contour maps of c δ l n 3 m m and c pm documents the considerable improvement in our understanding of geographic variations in relative variability of daily streamflows resulting from the use of c δ l n 3 m m particularly in arid and semiarid regions those maps also illustrate the enormous geographic variations in the relative variability of daily flow series across the u s 6 extensions and recommendations we expect future applications of zero inflated mixture models to enable corresponding improvements in our ability to model the pdf and to estimate various summary statistics of daily flow series and other hydrologic series which exhibit high levels of skewness periodicity and zeros for example given results of this study and the study by brunner and gilleland 2020 combined with recent recommendations by blum et al 2017 a natural extension to this study would be to evaluate the goodness of fit of zero inflated kappa monthly mixture models for modeling the pdf of daily flow series the vast and consistent improvement in goodness of fit of our δ l n 3 m m model over single pdf models could also be of considerable value to research on the application of flow duration curves castellarin et al 2013 analogous to this study lamontagne et al 2020 introduced a bivariate monthly mixture modeling for daily streamflow observations and simulations for the purpose of improving our ability to estimate model goodness of fit we anticipate that zero inflated monthly mixture models may be useful for estimating a wide range of common summary statistics including the mean variance skewness kurtosis and correlation coefficients we encourage future studies to consider alternative approaches to those considered here for accounting for skewness periodicity and zeros when estimating hydrologic statistics such as c credit authorship contribution statement lei ye software validation formal analysis investigation

distribution kap numerous investigators have suggested the four parameter kappa kap distribution as the distribution of choice for fitting nonzero daily streamflow series see blum et al 2017 for a recent review the quantile function for a kap distribution is a1 x g ξ α k 1 1 g h h k where g denotes the cdf of the nonzero observations the cdf of the nonzero observations needed in 16 to fit a δ k a p distribution is given by a2 g x 1 h 1 k x ξ α 1 k 1 h an estimate of the cdf f x of all the streamflows both zeros and nonzeros corresponding to a δ k a p is obtained by substitution of a2 into 16 using l moment estimators of the four parameters of the nonzero kap cdf hosking 2017 provided algorithms for estimating the parameters of the kap distribution using the method of l moments hosking 1994 showed that all rth central moments of a kap variable exists if h 0 and k 0 however there are conditions for which only some of the rth moments exist such as for r 1 hk in which case they only exist for h 0 and k 0 and for r 1 k in which case they only exist if k 0 thus we anticipate that situations may arise when c does not exist for the fitted kap distribution hosking 1994 provided analytical expressions which relate the parameters of a kap distribution to its product moments for most reasonable streamflow distributions the kap is limited to values of h 0 in which case hosking 1994 reported the rth moment of a kap variate as a3 e y r e 1 k x ξ α r h 1 r k γ 1 r k γ 1 h γ 1 r k 1 h using the fact that x ξ α 1 y k the moments of x are easily derived from the moments of y so that one can compute the coefficient of variation of the nonzero values of x using a4 c kap σ x μ x α σ y ξ k α 1 μ y α e y 2 e y 2 ξ k α 1 e y with e y and e y 2 obtained from a3 substitution of l moment estimators of the parameters α κ h and ξ into a4 leads to the estimator c kap the wakeby distribution wak houghton 1978 introduced the five parameter wakeby distribution as a distribution which could act as the parent distribution in hydrology due to its extreme flexibility and ability to encompass and approximate the behavior of most other distributions in hydrology here we follow the parameterization of the five parameter wakeby wak given by hosking and wallis 1997 with a quantile function given by a5 x g ξ α β 1 1 g β γ θ 1 1 g δ where g denotes the cdf of the nonzero observations note that unlike the original version of a wakeby distribution introduced by houghton 1978 this version of a wakeby distribution introduced by hosking and wallis 1997 always exhibits a lower bound at ξ so that x ξ always an analytical form of the pdf and cdf of a wak distribution does not exist however it is possible to estimate g x by solving a5 numerically for g houghton 1978 eqn 2 and 3 derived the first four ordinary product moments of a wakeby distribution as a function of its parameters for the case when the quantile function takes the form x f a 1 f b c 1 f d e which is different from the quantile function in a5 given by hosking and wallis 1997 the two quantile functions are equivalent when a α β b β c γ θ d θ and e ξ α β γ θ and that correspondence enables us to express c wak for the nonzero observations as a6 c wak β 1 θ 1 α 2 β 2 2 β 1 γ 2 θ 2 2 θ 1 2 γ α β θ β θ 1 γ β 1 β α θ θ 1 2 β 2 θ 2 1 β 2 θ 1 2 γ 1 β α 1 θ ξ 1 θ 1 β note that there are numerous combinations of the model parameters for which either the mean and or variance does not exist for example the mean does not exist if either β 1 and or θ 1 similarly the variance does not exist when β takes on values of 0 1 2 or 1 or when θ takes on values of ½ or 1 etc thus it is entirely possible that fitted wak distributions will have population values of c wak which simply do not exist when one is unable to fit a five parameter wak distribution it may be possible to fit special cases of the distribution such as the four parameter wakeby distribution see appendix to hosking and wallis 1997 for method substitution of the l moment estimators of the five parameters a β γ θ and ξ into a6 leads to the estimator c wak

or anthropogenic factors avila sandoval et al 2018 in the case of natural variation in as concentrations it could be a consequence of climatic and seasonal changes wet and dry periods although these factors are not commonly related to variation in as concentrations avila sandoval et al 2018 ayotte et al 2015 the temporal variability of as concentrations in drinking water is a potential concern for human health studies ayotte et al 2015 a fundamental aspect of the study of as contamination is that the degree to which the temporal variability of this analyte occurs in gw has not been well characterized many studies indicate that the as concentration in many aquifers is not particularly variable however other studies in lesser quantity reveal significant fluctuations over time during periods of weeks to years ayotte et al 2015 arsenic concentrations in waters and sediments can normally be cumulatively high due to the result of biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic activities for this reason the high concentrations of as in the sediments are of great environmental concern since this analyte can be released into pore water and the overlying water by desorption and resuspension qin et al 2014 the release and immobilization of as in the environment are fundamentally associated with factors such as ph do dissolved oxygen eh and other elements in turn microorganisms also play an important role in controlling the mobility of as in the environment qin et al 2014 ahmad et al 2020 a limited number of studies have so far been conducted on the occurrence

encompasses the cities of el alto and viacha which receives discharges from urban centers and many small scale industries located along the banks of the seque seco and pallina rivers tributaries of the katari river pnuma 2008 2011 ribera arismendi 2010 archundia et al 2017 finally the katari basin ends at cb located on lake titicaca the sub basins such as achicala anana jahuira higher katari lower katari higher pallina middle pallina lower pallina sallani and seque seco are part of the katari basin mmaya 2010 the study area is located in southeastern part of lake titicaca with an elevation range between 3800 to 4200 m a s l includes the entire lkb part of lower pallina middle pallina higher katari sallani basins and part of cb fig 2 it is part of four municipalities pucarani laja puerto pérez and tiahuanacu has an area of 484 km2 with 37 781 inhabitants distributed in rural communities of quellani tircani queñapampa pujri machacamarca caycoma chacalleta iskacaspa masaya

2017 respectively are the closest cities the inhabitants of these rural regions use gw from excavated and some drilled wells mean 4 m range 0 7 12 8 m normally the wells are in dwellings but a whole village uses others in a few locations there are deep wells with pumps installed in general the water from these wells is dedicated to human consumption but is also used for irrigation in a few locations 2 2 climate in lkb the climate is tempered with dry winter and soft summer and is mainly determined by the seasonal movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and its high elevation 3800 m a s l mmaya 2010 the mean annual rainfall of the lkb is 509 86 mm the rainiest months are december january february march mean monthly 89 03 mm and the driest months are may june july mean monthly 5 82 mm mmaya 2010 the mean annual temperature is 7 7 c tiwanaku station and solar radiation el alto station has a high level of ultraviolet radiation mean annual 533 cal cm2 day due to the low atmospheric density and a diaphanous atmosphere iis 2013 2 3 geology the study area is formed by scattered hills belonging to the devonian period sandstones lutites and siltstones and the neogene period conglomerates sandstones arcilites marlstones with volcanic rocks as tuff interspersed lava and diapirs fig 3 the surface geology is dominated by alluvial fluvial lacustrine fluvioglacial colluvial lacustrine moraine and dune deposits from the quaternary period mmaya 2010 the study area has a slight inclination mean slope 3 8 towards the northwest which allows the flow of surface currents iis 2013 fig 3 lacustrine sediments overlap and are interspersed with fluvial sediments forming confining layers and consequently produce artesian conditions quaternary fluviolacustrine deposits iis 2013 lacustrine sediments originated from the pleistocene era until around 10 000b p before present servant vildary 1993 the lacustrine plains 3800 m a s l have uniform deposition surfaces and do not reflect differentiated climatic events their surface reflects traces of flood areas in rainy seasons rase due to the remains of salt in different areas left by temporary lagoons mmaya 2010 the mountainous surfaces 4100 4400 m a s l are represented among others by the volcanic hills with rounded shapes and medium slopes mmaya 2010 fig 3 the structural surfaces with relatively flat surface relief which are composed of rocky outcrops have an origin often related to the development of tabular geological formations composed of volcanic clastic spills mostly of ignimbritic nature of whitish tones slightly compact associated with the volcanism of plio pleistocene mmaya 2010 2 4 hydrogeology the mud schist is observed from the devonian silurian paleozoic fences in the gw reservoir the la paz formation of tertiary age is distributed above this reservoir and the sediments of la paz formation are formed in the aquifer a formation with higher permeability that is formed of thick and unsorted materials these sediments are from the quaternary system represented by moraines and alluvial deposits fig 3 there are gw resources under artesian conditions confined and phreatic conditions iis 2013 the sediments of the aquifer were mainly deposited by rivers that carry sediments from the eastern cordillera to the southwest sediments finer than those in the eastern part where better transmissibility conditions are found this area is topographically variable with mountainous areas with high slopes range from 45 to 66 on mean and in some cases 100 and plains with relatively low slopes mean slope 3 8 as well as with the presence of isolated hills the water level is one meter below the surface which forms swampy terrain as a result of flood during the rase the gw by infiltration from katari basin flows from the northeast side of mountainous areas the estimated gw flow direction towards the southwest path and is discharged by evapotranspiration in topographically low areas iis 2013 3 material and methods 3 1 field investigations four sampling campaigns were carried out considering the first two during rase february 2016 and march 2017 and

suggested by farnham et al 2002 the diagrammes software 6 59 laboratoire d hydrogéologie d avignon 1999 was used to create the piper plots aqueachem software 4 0 264 waterloo hydrogeologic inc 2003 was used to create the stiff and box and whisker plots and to determine water type the aqueous speciation of as saturation indices and distribution of species in water samples was calculated using the phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 using the minteq database minteq dat which includes a thermodynamic database for as 3 5 2 spatial analysis the tools of the geographic information systems gis were applied to data selected parameters were directly spatialized for sw and the kriging method advanced geostatistical procedure esri 2016 was used for gw the geometrical interval classification

result esri 2008 these procedures were done in arcgis 10 2 2 software 4 results 4 1 quantitative spatial temporal variation of water the main characteristics of gw and sw wells piezometers rivers and lake in different sampling locations are presented in table 2 the field measurements statistical summary concentrations of major ions and tes are shown in table 3 the depth to the gw level in the study area varies considerably between rase in feb16gw mean 2 4 m range 0 3 6 7 m and in mar17gw mean 2 9 m range 0 4 9 2 m drse in oct16gw mean 2 9 m range 0 4 8 2 m and in aug17gw mean 2 9 m range 0 2 9 m as can be observed in the fig 4 a b c d respectively the increase of the gw level from 0 2 to 0 5 m in rase is observed in the wells and piezometers of the study area fig 4a however the pk2 piezometer located in iskacaspa flat area showed gw levels that vary by one meter between sampling campaigns august 2015 february 2016 july 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 fig 4b the spatial variation of the gw level in the study area varies from the area of the terraces greater depth to the flat area lesser depth fig 4c d except in the area near lake titicaca the seasonal variation between feb17gw rase fig 4c and aug17gw drse fig 4d is also evident it is also observed that the direction of preliminary flow follows the course from the hills recharge area to terraces and from terraces to the flat area katari river and finally the trend indicates that the direction of the flow is directed to lake titicaca fig 4c d according to gw level in piezometers and wells there is a great variation in the flow of water in rivers fig 4c d e considering the temporal variation mean 4 m3 s range 0 9 5 1 m3 s especially after the confluence between pallina and katari rivers the water flow of the katari river varies only 1 m between the seasons rase and drse before the confluence with the pallina river and this shows the great impact of the water flow of the pallina river in the study area the possible interaction of sw with gw could be occurring 25 km kar3 away downstream of the study area fig 4e due to the decrease in the flow values in both periods rase and drse precisely this is the region flat where floods occur due to the low slope of terrain mean slope of plain 3 8 also the gw level in the area is shallow fig 4c d the interaction of sw with gw is verified considering the flow direction of gw and it follows the same course of sw there are some sectors such as chacalleta and huancarani where could be direct interaction of sw with gw this hypothesis is supported by the shallow depth of gw levels in the wells of this area and the proximity of the wells to the course of the katari river e g cuap1 10 m another probable explanation for the decrease in flow rates in this sector could be the greater evaporation of sw and consequently the reduction of water flow that increases the evaporation ratio generating a reduction in its quantity especially in drse the drag of solid material by pallina river significantly affects the katari river along its course after their confluence this process is increased in the central and northwest region of the basin in the regions of low slope where solid materials garbage are deposited along the banks in drse and then are washed away in rase in rase the katari river is often overflowed by extreme events that originate from the increase in precipitation upstream of the basin causing large floods downstream of the basin disseminating all the solid material that drags the river these events although not frequent generate a great environmental impact on the entire region and populations near the course from the katari river suffer due to the direct consequences 4 2 quantity and quality of drinking water in general 60 of the wells from lkb are used as drinking water and 30 of the wells are used alternatively when the drinking water distribution system does not work whereas the remaining 10 of the wells are used for irrigation or animal consumption purpose the northwest cohana wilajahuira north aygachi iquiaca east mucuña and central sectors flat area on the right side of the katari river course fig 2 shows a scarcity of drinking water during drse the gw shows elevated salinity ec 35 n 46 of the all wells exceed the nb 512 bolivian regulation for drinking water 1500 µs cm in feb16gw rase 30 n 43 in oct16gw drse 31 n 59 in mar17gw rase and 28 n 58 in aug17gw drse arsenic concentration in gw are elevated 39 and 44 of wells samples compare to nb 512 10 µg l and who 10 µg l in feb16gw and mar17gw respectively where both representing the rase finally 37 of wells sampled in oct16gw and 40 in aug17gw both in the drse the boron b values exceed the nb 512 300 µg l in 84 of the wells in feb16gw 49 in mar17gw 42 in oct16gw and 48 in aug17gw 24 of all wells exceed the nb 512 100 µg l of manganese mn in feb16gw 40 in oct16gw 31 in mar17gw and 29 in aug17gw the sw of the pallina and katari rivers are not suitable for human consumption due to elevated concentrations of as b mn cl so4 2 and ec compare to the nb 512 since the pallina river transports industrial and wastewater from el alto and viacha cities the natural water of katari river are affected after receiving the water flow of pallina river observing the increase in the water flow from 0 9 to 5 1 m3 s as seen in fig 4e and also in water quality in some cases there are dilution processes of some elements ec so4 2 cl na especially in rase 4 3 spatial temporal variation of ground and surface water chemistry 4 3 1 ph eh and ec in gw the ph is slightly alkaline and did not show great changes in both seasons table 3 eh indicates oxidizing conditions table 3 it was also observed that there is greater variability in the eh ranges in rase whereas it was noticed more constant in the drse eh ph diagram of the gw samples indicate that the h2aso4 and haso4 2 are the dominant as species fig 8a b c d in fig 8c and d the stability in the eh values is observed even though the ph values slightly increased towards the alkalinity which could be indicating a certain oxidizing system stability in the drse in comparison to the rase there is a slight increase 1 10 in 2017 in ec in gw at rase especially in the south and flat area near the katari river fig 5 a b which could indicate a greater dissolution of paleo salts deposition the ec in the terrace area is more stable northeast and southwest from lkb in both seasons the salt deposits of the paleo lakes and evaporative enrichment are responsible for high ec values in regions with sediments lacustrine origin and by evaporative concentration in a semi arid climate servant vildary et al 1993 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 quino et al 2019 these characteristics are especially present in the flat area of the basin fig 5a b in sw the ph was noticed more alkaline in drse table 3 the eh indicated an oxidizing condition table 3 the ec increases by 54 of the values in drse the elevated values of ec were noted to be in the katari river upstream and the cascachi region lake titicaca fig 5a b in both seasons after the confluence of the pallina river there is a dilution effect in the values of ec 4 3 2 major ions data of major ions for gw samples were plotted in box whisker fig 6 a b stiff fig 5e f g h and piper diagrams fig 7 a b where the major water type was identified in the shallow gw as ca hco3 mean 42 rase and 50 drse other as na cl mean 24 rase and 18 drse and na hco3 mean 12 rase and 14 drse the composition of the remaining samples is more scattered as can be seen in the piper diagram for feb16gw rase fig 7a and aug17gw drse fig 7b there are two trends in geochemical evolution one is towards na hco3 and the other towards na cl in both seasons fig 7a b the fig 6a b show the values of campaigns of rase feb16gw and drse aug17gw the na and cl ions were presented with the highest concentrations in rase and in drse table 3 fig 6a b thus the na and cl are positively correlated in all campaigns fig 5d suggesting the dissolution of evaporated minerals such as halite which is common in semi arid areas quintanilla et al 1995 banks et al 2004 ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 ormachea muñoz et al 2016 confirmed by geochemical modeling fig 8i the predominant ions such as hco3 was noticed in rase and in drse table 3 fig 5e along with other predominant ions such as ca2 was exhibited in rase and in drse table 3 fig 5e the so4 2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 showed a positive correlation slope 1 fig 5c and suggesting a possible source by weathering and or dissolution of limestone calcite dolomite and gypsum ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 this is confirmed by geochemical modeling fig 8i the so4 2 concentration is an important anion in rase and in drse table 3 due to the high salinity in gw the elevated concentrations of no3 indicated the existence of anthropogenic sources especially in specified regions around the pallina river the confluence between the katari and pallina rivers and near lake titicaca the cations such as mg2 and k have low concentration compared to ca2 and especially to na in fig 7a b the main water type was observed as ca hco3 as a predominant hydrochemical facies fig 5e f g h however the ions with the highest concentrations are na and cl fig 6a b as can be seen in the plotted values of total dissolved solids tds corresponding to each point in the piper diagrams fig 7a b the major ions for sw samples show in box whisker stiff and piper diagrams fig 6e f fig 5g h fig 7c d the major water type identified in the sw is ca hco3 mean in rase 39 mean in drse 69 there is a trend in geochemical evolution towards na hco3 in both seasons fig 7c d fig 6e and f show the representative campaigns of feb16sw and aug17sw respectively in rase all major ions occur in a range between 0 01 and 426 5 mg l in rase and between 0 01 and 544 2 mg l in drse table 3 the increase of the concentrations in drse compared to rase was 61 for hco3 31 for cl 41 for so4 2 21 for ca2 12 for mg2 53 for k and 54 for na table 3 4 3 3 arsenic speciation of as indicates that the predominant oxidation state is as v with the range of 60 79 of samples in rase gw and sw and 70 100 in drse gw and sw the as concentration and other tes in gw are shown in fig 6c d the elevated concentration of as was noticed downstream of the basin northwest area in the wells with the most shallow phreatic level mean in rase 0 6 m mean in drse 0 8 m in a flood area sediments of lacustrine origin with a low slope 3 8 within the north plain of lacaya cohana lacp3 and wilajahuira wip1 with 253 5 µg l and 147 µg l respectively in rase whereas 288 5 µg l and 233 3 µg l respectively in drse fig 8e f g h the mean value of as in this region cohana lacaya wilajahuira is 156 µg l in rase and 190 µg l in drse the slightly higher terrain around volcanic formations korila quiripujo lacaya chojasivi huacullani has lower concentrations rase mean 29 µg l drse mean 22 µg l the general flow of water increases during the rase and it is assumed that this reduces the contact time between water and sediments which would explain the trend of lower levels of as in high terrain during this season ormachea muñoz et al 2013 in the wells near the katari river of the central plain region there are some sectors that have high concentrations of as such as masaya pk5 81 µg l pk4 109 µg l and tircani tirp3 86 µg l there is a predominant scenario for as rich gw due to the presence of alluvial sediments bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b especially in some wells located in the lowlands pujp1 56 µg l iqup1 122 µg l there could be exchangeable as present in the sediments which can be mobilized to gw due to increased salinity ormachea muñoz et al 2013 caused by evaporation the wells situated in sedimentary rock formations outside the north and northwest regions have relatively low concentrations of as mean 21 µg l however the threat to the population that uses this water for consumption still remains arsenic concentrations increase by 16 in drse relative to rase table 3 in general in all sampling points of the study area the as shows a lower correlation with iron fe r2 0 5 in rase and no correlation with b aluminum al mn and other physicochemical parameters in general all river water samples sw have a low concentration of as except in the north plain region flood delta in drse at the location of cohana cor1 48 µg l lacaya cor2 26 µg l and calachaca cor3 25 µg l fig 8e f g h the as concentration in cor1 cohana increases in drse compared to rase by 84 in 2016 and 90 in 2017 the katari river contains low levels of as in upstream of the basin however these levels increase along with the flow especially downstream of the basin in the same region where the wells have high concentrations of as cohana lacaya wilajahuira the present results are strongly agreements with the findings related to the as concentration by evaporation as suggested by banks et al 2004 corroborated by the high salinity considering the concentrations of na and cl in the same distance 4 3

increase significantly in drse compared to rase fig 6g h 4 4 hydrogeochemical calculations the hydrochemical calculation with code phreeqc considering the saturation indices si indicated that the gw is supersaturated with respect to the fe oxide hydroxide minerals such as goethite α feooh and hematite fe2o3 and the al minerals such as gibbsite al oh 3 k mica kal3si3o10 oh 2 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 suggesting precipitation of fe iii and al iii phases in gw the si for carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 are more negative or at equilibrium it could be suggesting that the chemistry of gw is controlled by precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals the si also revealed the dissolution of halite nacl and gypsum caso4 2h2o minerals fig 8i the calculation for species distribution in gw indicate that the predominant species is as v with 89 feb16 66 oct16 59 mar17 and 98 aug17 with different degree of protonation haso4 2 52 in feb16 50 in oct16 50 in mar17

sampling of the piezometers revealed high vertical variability in their characteristics and some differences between all sampling sites 17 piezometers the study area has a recent quaternary formation corresponding to deposits of riverine and lacustrine origin according to the information of the sediments at different levels taken during the drilling of the monitoring wells these deposits of lacustrine origin could be formed by the silty clay and clay materials distributed in the extensive plain of the sector the result of slow sedimentation events of lagoon processes the riverine deposits have varied sandy granulometry fine medium and thick a consolidated layer of 0 3 to 0 1 m is also evident conformed by silt and clay the variation in the lithology of the subsoil lateral and in depth is shown in fig 10a considering the lithological profiles of the piezometers parallel to the katari riverbed the piezometers were installed along an approximate length of 10 km in a southeast northwest direction from the town of pujri to the catavi community the piezometers that were used to elaborate the general lithological profile are pk1 pk2 pk6 pk8 and pk10 fig 10a the lithological profile shows several layers of lacustrine origin to riverine lacustrine with intercalations of fine material such as clay silt and organic matter with the sand horizons between thin medium and thick the depth of the profiles reached in a range of 3 to 5 m where the first sedimentation layer is composed of medium to thick grain sand with a thickness between 1 3 and 5 m of depth besides some clay layers are observed in a range of 0 4 to 0 9 m thick the overlying layer is composed of a mixture of a varied proportion of clay and brown consolidated silt generating a thickness that decreases from 0 3 to 0 1 m so that decrease in depth from 2 to 1 4 and 2 3 m is also observed along with the profile fig 10b c d e the upper contiguous layer is composed of slow deposition lacustrine material such as yellow clays portions and black with an organic matter where its thickness changes from 0 85 m at the beginning of the profile to 0 6 m and then reaches its thickness again at the finish the same 0 85 m the surface layer is formed by silty clay deposits constituting a thickness of 1 8 to 2 4 m along with the profile the lithological record of the superficial perforations and those of the lithology in the communal wells of the area allow indicating at the regional level the existence of hydrogeological units constituted by lacustrine and riverine materials of the geological formation of the quaternary 4 6 hydrology 4 6 1 aquifer units the phreatic level in piezometers and communal wells is below the impermeable and semi impermeable layers of silt and clays fig 4a b c d in other shallow wells it could be assumed that they are free aquifers aquifer containing unconfined groundwater that has a water table and an unsaturated zone un 2019 it would not be strange if there was also the presence of semi confined aquifers and this can only be corroborated by a more detailed geophysical and hydrogeological analysis 4 6 2 groundwater flow direction in order to estimate the direction of gw flow through static levels the topographic levels of the region both piezometers and communal wells in the area at ground level were considered making measurements to the millimeter this due to the smooth slope of the plain fig 9 the hydraulic load and the hydraulic gradient are calculated with the elevation information topographic levels and static levels recorded during gw collection an equipotential map of the gw level is drawn up that graphically represents the direction of the gw in the direction from southeast to northwest se nw based on the topographic map the static levels and the hydraulic load the gw course presents a similar trend to the surface watercourse and the topography of the area with gentle slope changes in the plain fig 9 4 6 3 hydrogeological signature of study according to the first evaluation carried out in the hydrogeological study it was possible to demonstrate the formation of a shallow aquifer unit which was formed by the debris of medium to coarse sand with a varying thickness according to depth reached from 0 5 to 1 3 m the direction of gw flows still under evaluation and indicates that it flows from southeast to northwest showing sectors where gw flows to the river in the towns of chacalleta and pujri and in the lower area of the plain the river flows into the gw fig 9 it was not possible to clearly define the recharge zones that allow identifying the origin of the gw in the study area the analysis and interpretation of environmental isotopes are required it is also considered important to be able to obtain information on the hydraulic parameters of the deep aquifer units 4 7 geochemical characteristics of sediments 4 7 1 elemental characteristics of core sediments of piezometers the mean values of the total extraction of as in each piezometer are presented in table 4 for sediment samples of lkb in order of southeast to northwest fig 9 in a layer of piezometers pk6 and pk12 high as levels were identified at depth of 3 m below the ground surface containing 62 9 and 84 8 mg kg respectively fig 10f the existence of astotal were found in pk2 2 2 m 24 5 mg kg 3 m 26 4 mg kg pk10 2 7 m 25 8 mg kg pk13 2 m 24 6 mg kg 5 m 28 mg kg pk14 3 m 29 6 mg kg pk15 3 m 27 9 mg kg pk16 2 m 20 3 mg kg and pk19 2 5 m 23 1 mg kg which represents a tendency to increase the astotal content with depth the mean content of as and tes fe al sb b shows a low correlation as r2 0 46 the mean values of fe and al in all piezometers were found ranged between 18 6 and 27 1 g kg and 9 6 24 6 g kg respectively where mn content was observed lower as 0 3 1 2 g kg there is a tendency to increase the concentration of these elements with depth fig 10g h i j a significant difference in sulfur s content was observed in pk1 mean 118 9 mg kg and pk8 mean 7278 0 mg kg in pk8 elevated s concentrations were found at depths of 0 5 3 m in reducing condition of the sediments as could be bound to sulphides ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the elevated concentration of calcium ca was found in pk11 11 1 g kg pk3 12 8 g kg pk7 13 2 g kg pk18 15 7 g kg and pk8 22 7 g kg at depths of 0 5 3 m however a slight decreasing trend of ca content was observed with depth in the shallow sediments 4 7 2 elemental characteristics of river sediments in pallina river in pas1 and at the confluence between the pallina and katari rivers in kas2 there is an increase in as concentration in drse from 14 6 to 17 5 mg kg 19 6 and from 23 7 to 25 9 mg kg 9 respectively fig 10 k on the contrary there is an increase in as concentration in katari river in rase by 16 in kas1 32 in kas3 30 in kas4 44 in kas5 and 8 in kas6 fig 10 k the highest as content was found in katari river in the northwest of the study area in the lacaya region cos3 42 3 mg kg near cb fig 2 the concentration of fe in the sediments varied with in a range of 19 8 22 1 g kg in rase and 18 2 26 9 g kg in drse where 4 of increased concentrations was observed in drse the range of al concentration varied between 9 7 15 2 g kg and 5 9 15 4 g kg in the rase and drse respectively the comparison of the content of the other tes such as mn rase range 283 6 492 mg kg drse range 270 1 474 4 mg kg zn rase range 90 8 212 8 mg kg drse range 74 7 491 1 mg kg si rase range 78 5 273 5 mg kg drse range 98 170 7 mg kg b rase range 43 4 64 1 mg kg drse range 50 2 88 9 mg kg sb rase range 3 1 4 9 mg kg drse range 3 4 60 3 mg kg and li rase range 48 6 67 9 mg kg drse range 34 3 92 4 mg kg were variable but no trends were observed 4 7 3 sequential extraction of as in core sediments of piezometers the sequential extraction procedure of the bcr method ure et al 1993 allowed to determine the distribution of as and among the different geochemical fractions f1 f2 f3 and f4 which reflected the relative proportions of as transported by different chemical mechanisms fig 11 the as rich layers found from highest to lowest through the sequential extraction in first layer 0 1 1 5 m as f4 range 6 4 33 4 mg kg f2 range 0 3 2 6 mg kg f1 range 0 2 1 7 mg kg and f3 range 0 1 0 9 mg kg in the second layer 1 5 2 5 m it from highest to lowest exhibited as f4 range 11 7 94 mg kg f2 range 0 03 5 7 mg kg f1 range 0 1 5 1 mg kg and f3 range 0 2 1 2 mg kg in the third layer 2 4 3 2 m it from highest to lowest was noticed as f4 range 10 2 38 7 mg kg f2 range 0 5 3 6 mg kg f1 range 0 2 1 9 mg kg and f3 range 0 3 1 mg kg finally the last layer 2 5 3 3 m it from highest to lowest was observed as f4 range 12 1 16 4 mg kg f2 range 1 3 1 6 mg kg f1 range 0 5 1 mg kg and f3 range 0 3 0 4 mg kg in all cases the concentration of as was highest in the f4 residual fraction followed by f2 reducible fraction f1 exchangeable fraction and f3 oxidizable the concentrations of as extracted are much higher in layers 2 and 3 table 5 in general being the largest residual fraction approximately 84 the as is associated with primary and secondary minerals it probably does not dissolve under natural conditions mäkelä et al 2011 this indicates that the as has reduced mobility low release of as by sediment f4 the reducible fraction of as is approximately 9 which this indicates the as is associated with oxides of mn and fe and forms normally known as sinks of tes in a surface environment silveti et al 2013 f2 in 5 of the extractions the as is found exchangeable form it could be released by ion exchange processes or co precipitated with carbonates this form would be the most readily available gleyzes et al 2002 f1 finally only 2 of the extractions are in the oxidizable form sulfides in this form the as is not considered bioavailable filgueiras et al 2002 f3 fig 11 5 discussions 5 1 sources of arsenic the concentrations of as in the study area shows a progression of as enrichment however these are located in specific regions such as flood area which indicates the distribution of as is not homogeneous in the basin the northern region flood plain area specifically the flat region has the highest as concentration this indicates that sediments are the most important sources of as the concentrations of as in sediments are slightly higher than the global mean estimated 1 5 mg kg bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b ravenscroft et al 2009 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 because alluvial sediments are the predominant scenario for gw enriched in as such as in many places of the world bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b the as concentrations in the sediments are varied according to the depth as the second 2 3 5 m and the third level 3 5 4 5 m where have clays silts and fine sands and which have sediments of lacustrine origin as 63 84 mg kg maximum values there are considerable variations of as concentration in between or different strata which leads to indicate a high spatial variety in the characteristics of the sediments the high variation in as concentrations could be explained as a consequence of the alluvial processes from the paleo lakes and the subsequent wind processes that would have redistributed the material over the entire altiplano making the sediments more heterogeneous ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the evaporites sedimentary rocks that are formed by crystallization of dissolved salts in lakes intermingle with the sediments found in places that have high as contents which makes their distribution irregular banks et al 2004 the direct effect of volcanic rocks on water quality in the northwest region near lake titicaca is limited since as concentrations are lower compared to those in the northern region where lacustrine sediments predominate volcanic rock weathering despite its moderate as content is considered in many studies as an important source of as smedley and kinniburgh 2002 banks et al 2004 schnoor 1996 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 tapia and audry 2013 higher values of ph 8 5 and na indicate these rocks smedley and kinniburgh 2002 would affect that gw the tiwanaku coniri and kollu kollu geological formations of the tertiary and quaternary age martínez et al 2007 represents in the study area which has a significant influence on the general water chemistry in particular of the northwestern region the as and b are elements are existed in volcanic deposits northwest region exhibiting a correlation ec vs as r2 0 36 ec vs b r2 0 65 with the salinity of gw due to this characteristic they could be expected to persist in sw and accumulate in gw ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the salinity of the northern plain in a semi arid climate the evaporation could mobilize some types of exchangeable as present towards the gw on the contrary the low concentrations of as in the central and southern plains of the study area having waters enrichment in ca2 and hco3 could indicate that as is linked to caco3 minerals that are insoluble especially at high ph stollenwerk et al 2002 5 2 sediment water interaction sediments consist of a dominant texture class clay sandy loam and have good drainage capacity and probably good aeration the amount of extracted as in different depth levels has a certain correlation with the type of sediment material the second 1 5 2 5 m and the third 2 5 3 2 m level which are composed of finer materials sandy clay loam this would reflect the greater weathering of fine sediments due to their greater reactive surface area gustafsson et al 2006 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 since most of the as is found in the residual fraction f4 84 in the sediments of the central region of the plain the role of refractory primary minerals fe al is essential although the as has reduced mobility in the sediments its high concentration indicates that in the long term they could be a very important source of as contamination for the environment being able to develop the dissolution of minerals with high as content high ph values together with the oxic characteristic of the terrain are conducive to the increase in as concentrations smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 due to the decrease in as adsorption to the oxides and hydroxides of fe and al which vary according to the ph appelo and postma 2005 that is why even a small increase in ph could generate a significant increase in as concentration in gw this is evidenced in the ph values in the northern plain rase mean ph 7 3 drse mean ph 7 9 the adsorption of as to oxides and hydroxides of fe and al decreases under oxidizing condition in addition to high ph values with a reduction in adsorption and stability of aso4 3 stollenwerk et al 2002 the importance of carbonates in as levels in gw is not entirely clear since in the geochemical modeling the si found reveal that gw is unsaturated or in equilibrium with respect to calcite in some wells since it is known that the adsorption of as in calcite or clay minerals could be one of the most important as immobilization processes in areas with a ph range 7 9 stollenwerk et al 2002 romero et al 2004 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 another study indicates that carbonates have a negative effect on the adsorption of as to fe oxides claesson and fagerberg 2003 stollenwerk et al 2002 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 ahmad et al 2019 the interchangeable fraction f1 5 in the region of the central and southern plains could indicate that the as in sediments can be better mobilized at higher ph however being low only 5 in relation to the other fractions suggests that the ph has a low impact on the release of as in this region the adsorption of as due to the oxides and hydroxides of fe al and mn which is one of the most studied processes regarding the mobility of as in natural waters bhattacharya et al 2006 van genuchten and ahmad 2020 ahmad et al 2019 represents the second most important fraction of the study f2 9 the insignificant correlation was exhibited between as and fe concentrations in gw samples throughout the region r2 0 27 0 52 except in the northern plain region r2 0 93 0 94 the lack of a correlation between these two elements indicates that the reducing dissolution is not important in the region corroborated with the values of eh slightly oxidizing medium under reducing conditions the oxides of fe iii with adsorbed as are dissolved fe and releases as gustafsson et al 2006 and this reductive dissolution is a common cause of the high concentration of as bhattacharya et al 2006 this process explains the good correlation between as and fe r2 0 93 0 94 in the northern plain region geochemical modeling indicates the probable precipitation of oxides and hydroxides of fe and al in the study area with the exception of the north and northeast region which confirms the as adsorbents there are several minerals that according to the si would be responsible for the low as values such as hematite fe2o3 goethite α feooh gibbsite al oh 3 k mica kal3si3o10 oh 2 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 possible evaporation conditions could be an important factor for the high concentration of as in gw bhattacharya et al 2006 considering that the gw levels are shallow in the northern region 0 6 0 8 m and northeast 1 1 0 9 of the study area the si is an important element that could be competing for adsorption spaces in minerals because it has significant concentrations in the north 8 4 8 mg l and northwest 13 1 12 5 mg l regions where as concentrations are also high it is known that high si values 10 mg l and an elevated ph could decrease as adsorption stollenwerk et al 2002 davis et al 2001 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 6 conclusions the lack of good quality water according to nb 512 and who guidelines for consumption in the northwest north east and the right side of katari river in the plain area is due to the low rainfall semi arid climate and high salinity salt evaporation the water bodies in lkb are affected by the elevated presence of as b mn and no3 this problem remains despite the fact that the sw presents dilution in its salt and mineral contents after the confluence of pallina and katari rivers the sw does not represent a possible source of drinking water due to the negative effect of wastewater pallina river and its entire load solids and liquids along the katari river the large temporal variation in the amounts of water causes a direct action on gw and a larger scale on sw the drag material coming from the wastewater represents a significant negative health impact for lkb and in particular for the populations of the lower part wilajahuira lacaya pampa cohana the general trend in the direction of gw flow is from southeast to northwest showing sectors with probable interaction between sw and gw the highest concentrations of as in gw are found downstream of the basin northwest area and could be associated with alluvial sediments enriched with as it was observed that due to the low slope 3 8 the gw would have a slow movement and along with the large surface area of fine grained sediments would be facilitating the release of as in rase there is a decrease in as concentrations because as the flow of water increases the contact time between water and sediment is reduced the sw with somewhat higher concentrations of as is found downstream of the basin which is enriched the concentration of as due to evaporation possibly the geological characteristics of lkb generate a great spatial variability of as due to the presence of evaporites that are distributed unevenly in the sediments in the region where volcanic formations exist although the concentrations are lower compared to the northern plain it is still harmful to health another important phenomenon considers the as b and li present in the sw that would be accumulating in the gw and the interchangeable as in the lowlands could be mobilized to the gw due to the increase in salinity semi arid climate and evaporation of salts especially in the plain region sequential extraction of sediments and geochemical modeling indicates that as is associated with the oxides and hydroxides of fe and al which are probably the most important adsorbents of as in the sediments the low mobility of as in the central and southern region of the basin would be due to calcium carbonates e g calcite although the mobility of as in the sediments of these areas is reduced its high concentration indicates that in the long term it could become a great source of water contamination for future studies in the area it is recommended to model surface water flows and quality by applying qual2kw or other surface water modeling software the sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 was established by the united nations general assembly in 2015 which fundamentally deals with ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all this study promotes technological empowerment of people rural populations of the study area to implement the sdgs as a consequence of this study a monitoring network of water bodies and sediments was established which is very useful to evaluate the quality and quantity of the water in the shallow aquifers and the surrounding rivers the knowledge generated now serves to suggest possible mitigation options that can be adopted by local communities as well as other interesting parties in mitigation of water pollution decision makers in water management policies such as the ministry of water municipal governments and water committees the identification of the problem as contamination and other trace metals the current deteriorated state of drinking water in some regions of the basin was evidenced areas with major suitability for use as a source of drinking water are proposed

4872,arsenic as contamination of drinking water is a worldwide problem the natural origin of as its mobility and transport are of paramount interest in bolivian altiplano due to its presence in mineral deposits brines hot springs and volcanic rocks in this study a geochemical spatial temporal approach was used to understand the sources and factors that regulate the mobilization and fate of

study indicates that the groundwater flows from southeast to northwest se nw which indicate interaction between groundwater and surface water in this region the spatial distribution of as varies considerably due to geological characteristics of the area as well as due to the heterogeneously distributed evaporites in the sediments alluvial fluvial lacustrine however the highest concentrations of as are observed in the alluvial sediments of the northern region sequential extraction bcr of sediments along with geochemical modeling mineral saturation indices indicates that iron fe and aluminum al hydr oxides are the most important adsorbent minerals of as in the central and southern region of lkb the hydrochemistry of water bodies in lkb is strongly influenced by the interaction with the sediment constituents and by the spatial temporal variations therefore the determination of the distribution of as among the different geochemical fractions was useful to find the relative

or anthropogenic factors avila sandoval et al 2018 in the case of natural variation in as concentrations it could be a consequence of climatic and seasonal changes wet and dry periods although these factors are not commonly related to variation in as concentrations avila sandoval et al 2018 ayotte et al 2015 the temporal variability of as concentrations in drinking water is a potential concern for human health studies ayotte et al 2015 a fundamental aspect of the study of as contamination is that the degree to which the temporal variability of this analyte occurs in gw has not been well characterized many studies indicate that the as concentration in many aquifers is not particularly variable however other studies in lesser quantity reveal significant fluctuations over time during periods of weeks to years ayotte et al 2015 arsenic concentrations in waters and sediments can normally be cumulatively high due to the result of biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic activities for this reason the high concentrations of as in the sediments are of great environmental concern since this analyte can be released into pore water and the overlying water by desorption and resuspension qin et al 2014 the release and immobilization of as in the environment are fundamentally associated with factors such as ph do dissolved oxygen eh and other elements in turn microorganisms also play an important role in controlling the mobility of as in the environment qin et al 2014 ahmad et al 2020 a limited number of studies have so far been conducted on the occurrence and natural distribution of as in the bolivian altiplano quino et al 2019 quino lima et al 2020a 2020b coomar et al 2019 tapia et al 2020 high concentrations of as were reported in the samples of drinking water collected in an area not affected by mining located in the south and west of the lake poopó basin fig 1 ppo 1996a hermansson and karlsson 2004 van den bergh et al 2010 ramos ramos et al

reported an elevated as concentrations in gw the sources of as are present in different geological formations of the bolivian altiplano and multiple geochemical processes such as the weathering of volcanic rocks adsorption desorption of as from different sediments and the oxidation of sulfide minerals rich in as ormachea muñoz et al 2013 coomar et al 2019 quino et al 2019 quino lima et al 2020a

village uses others in a few locations there are deep wells with pumps installed in general the water from these wells is dedicated to human consumption but is also used for irrigation in a few locations 2 2 climate in lkb the climate is tempered with dry winter and soft summer and is mainly determined by the seasonal movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and its high elevation 3800 m a s l mmaya 2010 the mean annual rainfall of the lkb is 509 86 mm the rainiest months are december january february march mean monthly 89 03 mm and the driest months are may june july mean monthly 5 82 mm mmaya 2010 the mean annual temperature is 7 7 c tiwanaku station and solar radiation el alto station has a high level of ultraviolet radiation mean annual 533 cal cm2 day due to the low atmospheric density and a diaphanous atmosphere iis 2013 2 3 geology the study area is formed by scattered hills belonging to the devonian period sandstones lutites and siltstones and the neogene period conglomerates sandstones arcilites marlstones with volcanic rocks as tuff interspersed lava and diapirs fig 3 the surface geology is dominated by alluvial fluvial lacustrine fluvioglacial colluvial lacustrine moraine and dune deposits from the quaternary period mmaya 2010 the study area has a slight inclination mean slope 3 8 towards the northwest which allows the flow of surface currents iis 2013 fig 3 lacustrine sediments overlap and are interspersed with fluvial sediments forming confining layers and consequently produce artesian conditions quaternary fluviolacustrine deposits iis 2013 lacustrine sediments originated from the pleistocene era until around 10 000b p before present servant vildary 1993 the lacustrine plains 3800 m a s l have uniform deposition surfaces and do not reflect differentiated climatic events their surface reflects traces of flood areas in rainy seasons rase due to the remains of salt in different areas left by temporary lagoons mmaya 2010 the mountainous surfaces 4100 4400 m a s l are represented among others by the volcanic hills with rounded shapes and medium slopes mmaya 2010 fig 3 the structural surfaces with relatively flat surface relief which are composed of rocky outcrops have an origin often related to the development of tabular geological formations composed of volcanic clastic spills mostly of ignimbritic nature of whitish tones slightly compact associated with the volcanism of plio pleistocene mmaya 2010 2 4 hydrogeology the mud schist is observed from the devonian silurian paleozoic fences in the gw reservoir the la paz formation of tertiary age is distributed above this reservoir and the sediments of la paz formation are formed in the aquifer a formation with higher permeability that is formed of thick and unsorted materials these sediments are from the quaternary system represented by moraines and alluvial deposits fig 3 there are gw resources under artesian conditions confined and phreatic conditions iis 2013 the sediments of the aquifer were mainly deposited by rivers that carry sediments from the eastern cordillera to the southwest sediments finer than those in the eastern part where better transmissibility conditions are found this area is topographically variable with mountainous areas with high slopes range from 45 to 66 on mean and in some cases 100 and plains with relatively low slopes mean slope 3 8 as well as with the presence of isolated hills the water level is one meter below the surface which forms swampy terrain as a result of flood during the rase the gw by infiltration from katari basin flows from the northeast side of mountainous areas the estimated gw flow direction towards the southwest path and is discharged by evapotranspiration

result esri 2008 these procedures were done in arcgis 10 2 2 software 4 results 4 1 quantitative spatial temporal variation of water the main characteristics of gw and sw wells piezometers rivers and lake in different sampling locations are presented in table 2 the field measurements statistical summary concentrations of major ions and tes are shown in table 3 the depth to the gw level in the study area varies considerably between rase in feb16gw mean 2 4 m range 0 3 6 7 m and in mar17gw mean 2 9 m range 0 4 9 2 m drse in oct16gw mean 2 9 m range 0 4 8 2 m and in aug17gw mean 2 9 m range 0 2 9 m as can be observed in the fig 4 a b c d respectively the increase of the gw level from 0 2 to 0 5 m in rase is observed in the wells and piezometers of the study area fig 4a however the pk2 piezometer located in iskacaspa flat area showed gw levels that vary by one meter between sampling campaigns august 2015 february 2016 july 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 fig 4b the spatial variation of the gw level in the study area varies from the area of the terraces greater depth to the flat area lesser depth fig 4c d except in the area near lake titicaca the seasonal variation between feb17gw rase fig 4c and aug17gw drse fig 4d is also evident it is also observed that the direction of preliminary flow follows the course from the hills recharge area to terraces and from terraces to the flat area katari river and finally the trend indicates that the direction of the flow is directed to lake titicaca fig 4c d according to gw level in piezometers and wells there is a great variation in the flow of water in rivers fig 4c d e considering the temporal variation mean 4 m3 s range 0 9 5 1 m3 s especially after the confluence between pallina and katari rivers the water flow of the katari river varies only 1 m between the seasons rase and drse before the confluence with the pallina river and this shows the great impact of the water flow of the pallina river in the study area the possible interaction of sw with gw could be occurring 25 km kar3 away downstream of the study area fig 4e due to the decrease in the flow values in both periods rase and drse precisely this is the region flat where floods occur due to the low slope of terrain mean slope of plain 3 8 also the gw level in the area is shallow fig 4c d the interaction of sw with gw is verified considering the flow direction of gw and it follows the same course of sw there are some sectors such as chacalleta and huancarani where could be direct interaction of sw with gw this hypothesis is supported by the shallow depth of gw levels in the wells of this area and the proximity of the wells to the course of the katari river e g cuap1 10 m another probable explanation for the decrease in flow rates in this sector could be the greater evaporation of sw and consequently the reduction of water flow that increases the evaporation ratio generating a reduction in its quantity especially in drse the drag of solid material by pallina river significantly affects the katari river along its course after their confluence this process is increased in the central and northwest region of the basin in the regions of low slope where solid materials garbage are deposited along the banks in drse and then are washed away in rase in rase the katari river is often overflowed by extreme events that originate from the increase in precipitation upstream of the basin causing large floods downstream of the basin disseminating all the solid material that drags the river these events although not frequent generate a great environmental impact on the entire region and populations near the course from the katari river suffer due to the direct consequences 4 2 quantity and quality of drinking water in general 60 of the wells from lkb are used as drinking water and 30 of the wells are used alternatively when the drinking water distribution system does not work whereas the remaining 10 of the wells are used for irrigation or animal consumption purpose the northwest cohana wilajahuira north aygachi iquiaca east mucuña and central sectors flat area on the right side of the katari river course fig 2 shows a scarcity of drinking water during drse the gw shows elevated salinity ec 35 n 46 of the all wells exceed the nb 512 bolivian regulation for drinking water 1500 µs cm in feb16gw rase 30 n 43 in oct16gw drse 31 n 59 in mar17gw rase and 28 n 58 in aug17gw drse arsenic concentration in gw are elevated 39 and 44 of wells samples compare to nb 512 10 µg l and who 10 µg l in feb16gw and mar17gw respectively where both representing the rase finally 37 of wells sampled in oct16gw and 40 in aug17gw both in the drse the boron b values exceed the nb 512 300 µg l in 84 of the wells in feb16gw 49 in mar17gw 42 in oct16gw and 48 in aug17gw 24 of all wells exceed the nb 512 100 µg l of manganese mn in feb16gw 40 in oct16gw 31 in mar17gw and 29 in aug17gw the sw of the pallina and katari rivers are not suitable for human consumption due to elevated concentrations of as b mn cl so4 2 and ec compare to the nb 512 since the pallina river transports industrial and wastewater from el alto and viacha cities the natural water of katari river are affected after receiving the water flow of pallina river observing the increase in the water flow from 0 9 to 5 1 m3 s as seen in fig 4e and also in water quality in some cases there are dilution processes of some elements ec so4 2 cl na especially in rase 4 3 spatial temporal variation of ground and surface water chemistry 4 3 1 ph eh and ec in gw the ph is slightly alkaline and did not show great changes in both seasons table 3 eh indicates oxidizing conditions table 3 it was also observed that there is greater variability in the eh ranges in rase whereas it was noticed more constant in the drse eh ph diagram of the gw samples indicate that the h2aso4 and haso4 2 are the dominant as species fig 8a b c d in fig 8c and d the stability in the eh values is observed even though the ph values slightly increased towards the alkalinity which could be indicating a certain oxidizing system stability in the drse in comparison to the rase there is a slight increase 1 10 in 2017 in ec in gw at rase especially in the south and flat area near the katari river fig 5 a b which could indicate a greater dissolution of paleo salts deposition the ec in the terrace area is more stable northeast and southwest from lkb in both seasons the salt deposits of the paleo lakes and evaporative enrichment are responsible for high ec values in regions with sediments lacustrine origin and by evaporative concentration in a semi arid climate servant vildary et al 1993 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 quino et al 2019 these characteristics are especially present in the flat area of the basin fig 5a b in sw the ph was noticed more alkaline in drse table 3 the eh indicated an oxidizing condition table 3 the ec increases by 54 of the values in drse the elevated values of ec were noted to be in the katari river upstream and the cascachi region lake titicaca fig 5a b in both seasons after the confluence of the pallina river there is a dilution effect in the values of ec 4 3 2 major ions data of major ions for gw samples were plotted in box whisker fig 6 a b stiff fig 5e f g h and piper diagrams fig 7 a b where the major water type was identified in the shallow gw as ca hco3 mean 42 rase and 50 drse other as na cl mean 24 rase and 18 drse and na hco3 mean 12 rase and 14 drse the composition of the remaining samples is more scattered as can be seen in the piper diagram for feb16gw rase fig 7a and aug17gw drse fig 7b there are two trends in geochemical evolution one is towards na hco3 and the other towards na cl in both seasons fig 7a b the fig 6a b show the values of campaigns of rase feb16gw and drse aug17gw the na and cl ions were presented with the highest concentrations in rase and in drse table 3 fig 6a b thus the na and cl are positively correlated in all campaigns fig 5d suggesting the dissolution of evaporated minerals such as halite which is common in semi arid areas quintanilla et al 1995 banks et al 2004 ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 ormachea muñoz et al 2016 confirmed by geochemical modeling fig 8i the predominant ions such as hco3 was noticed in rase and in drse table 3 fig 5e along with other predominant ions such as ca2 was exhibited in rase and in drse table 3 fig 5e the so4 2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 showed a positive correlation slope 1 fig 5c and suggesting a possible source by weathering and or dissolution of limestone calcite dolomite and gypsum ramos ramos et al 2012 2014 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 this is confirmed by geochemical modeling fig 8i the so4 2 concentration is an important anion in rase and in drse table 3 due to the high salinity in gw the elevated concentrations of no3 indicated the existence of anthropogenic sources especially in specified regions around the pallina river the confluence between the katari and pallina rivers and near lake titicaca the cations such as mg2 and k have low concentration compared to ca2 and especially to na in fig 7a b the main water type was observed as ca hco3 as a predominant hydrochemical facies fig 5e f g h however the ions with the highest concentrations are na and cl fig 6a b as

chojasivi huacullani has lower concentrations rase mean 29 µg l drse mean 22 µg l the general flow of water increases during the rase and it is assumed that this reduces the contact time between water and sediments which would explain the trend of lower levels of as in high terrain during this season ormachea muñoz et al 2013 in the wells near the katari river of the central plain region there are some sectors that have high concentrations of as such as masaya pk5 81 µg l pk4 109 µg l and tircani tirp3 86 µg l there is a predominant scenario for as rich gw due to the presence of alluvial sediments bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b especially in some wells located in the lowlands pujp1 56 µg l iqup1 122 µg l there could be exchangeable as present in the sediments which can be mobilized to gw due to increased salinity ormachea muñoz et al 2013 caused by evaporation the wells situated in sedimentary rock formations outside the north and northwest regions have relatively low

increase along with the flow especially downstream of the basin in the same region where the wells have high concentrations of as cohana lacaya wilajahuira the present results are strongly agreements with the findings related to the as concentration by evaporation as suggested by banks et al 2004 corroborated by the high salinity considering the concentrations of na and cl in the same distance 4 3

increase significantly in drse compared to rase fig 6g h 4 4 hydrogeochemical calculations the hydrochemical calculation with code phreeqc considering the saturation indices si indicated that the gw is supersaturated with respect to the fe oxide hydroxide minerals such as goethite α feooh and hematite fe2o3 and the al minerals such as gibbsite al oh 3 k mica kal3si3o10 oh 2 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 suggesting precipitation of fe iii and al iii phases in gw the si for carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 are more negative or at equilibrium it could be suggesting that the chemistry of gw is controlled by precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals the si also revealed the dissolution of halite nacl and gypsum caso4 2h2o minerals fig 8i the calculation for species distribution in gw indicate that the predominant species is as v with 89 feb16 66 oct16 59 mar17 and 98 aug17 with different degree of protonation haso4 2 52 in feb16 50 in oct16 50 in mar17

sampling of the piezometers revealed high vertical variability in their characteristics and some differences between all sampling sites 17 piezometers the study area has a recent quaternary formation corresponding to deposits of riverine and lacustrine origin according to the information of the sediments at different levels taken during the drilling of the monitoring wells these deposits of lacustrine origin could be formed by the silty clay and clay materials distributed in the extensive plain of the sector the result of slow sedimentation events of lagoon processes the riverine deposits have varied sandy granulometry fine medium and thick a consolidated layer of 0 3 to 0 1 m is also evident conformed by silt and clay the variation in the lithology of the subsoil lateral and in depth is shown in fig 10a considering the lithological profiles of the piezometers parallel to the katari riverbed the piezometers were installed along an approximate length of 10 km in a southeast northwest direction from the town of pujri to the catavi community the piezometers that were used to elaborate the general lithological profile are pk1 pk2 pk6 pk8 and pk10 fig 10a the lithological profile shows several layers of lacustrine origin to riverine lacustrine with intercalations of fine material such as clay silt and organic matter with the sand horizons between thin medium and thick the depth of the profiles reached in a range of 3 to 5 m where the first sedimentation layer is composed of medium to thick grain sand with a thickness between 1 3 and 5 m of depth besides some clay layers are observed in a range of 0 4 to 0 9 m thick the overlying layer is composed of a mixture of a varied proportion of clay and brown consolidated silt generating a thickness that decreases from 0 3 to 0 1 m so that decrease in depth from 2 to 1 4 and 2 3 m is also observed along with the profile fig 10b c d e the upper contiguous layer is composed of slow deposition lacustrine material such as yellow clays portions and black with an organic matter where its thickness changes from 0 85 m at the beginning of the profile to 0 6 m and then reaches its thickness again at the finish the same 0 85 m the surface layer is formed by silty clay deposits constituting a thickness of 1 8 to 2 4 m along with the profile the lithological record of the superficial perforations and those of the lithology in the communal wells of the area allow indicating at the regional level the existence of hydrogeological units constituted by lacustrine and riverine materials of the geological formation of the quaternary 4 6 hydrology 4 6 1 aquifer units the phreatic level in piezometers and communal wells is below the impermeable and semi impermeable layers of silt and clays fig 4a b c d in other shallow wells it could be assumed that they are free aquifers aquifer containing unconfined groundwater that has a water table and an unsaturated zone un 2019 it would not be strange if there was also the presence of semi confined aquifers and this can only be corroborated by a more detailed geophysical and hydrogeological analysis 4 6 2 groundwater flow direction in order to estimate the direction of gw flow through static levels the topographic levels of the region both piezometers and communal wells in the area at ground level were considered making measurements to the millimeter this due to the smooth slope of the plain fig 9 the hydraulic load and the hydraulic gradient are calculated with the elevation information topographic levels and static levels recorded during gw collection an equipotential map of the gw level is drawn up that graphically represents the direction of the gw in the direction from southeast to northwest se nw based on the topographic map the static levels and the hydraulic load the gw course presents a similar trend to the surface watercourse and the topography of the area with gentle slope changes in the plain fig 9 4 6 3 hydrogeological signature of study according to the first evaluation carried out in the hydrogeological study it was possible to demonstrate the formation of a shallow aquifer unit which was formed by the debris of medium to coarse sand with a varying thickness according to depth reached from 0 5 to 1 3 m the direction of gw flows still under evaluation and indicates that it flows from southeast to northwest showing sectors where gw flows to the river in the towns of chacalleta and pujri and in the lower area of the plain the river flows into the gw fig 9 it was not possible to clearly define the recharge zones that allow identifying the origin of the gw in the study area the analysis and interpretation of environmental isotopes are required it is also considered important to be able to obtain information on the hydraulic parameters of the deep aquifer units 4 7 geochemical characteristics of sediments 4 7 1 elemental characteristics of core sediments of piezometers the mean values of the total extraction of as in each piezometer are presented in table 4 for sediment samples of lkb in order of southeast to northwest fig 9 in a layer of piezometers pk6 and pk12 high as levels were identified at depth of 3 m below the ground surface containing 62 9 and 84 8 mg kg respectively fig 10f the existence of astotal were found in pk2 2 2 m 24 5 mg kg 3 m 26 4 mg kg pk10 2 7 m 25 8 mg kg pk13 2 m 24 6 mg kg 5 m 28 mg kg pk14 3 m 29 6 mg kg pk15 3 m 27 9 mg kg pk16 2 m 20 3 mg kg and pk19 2 5 m 23 1 mg kg which represents a tendency to increase the astotal content with depth the mean content of as and tes fe al sb b shows a low correlation as r2 0 46 the mean values of fe and al in all piezometers were found ranged between 18 6 and 27 1 g kg and 9 6 24 6 g kg respectively where mn content was observed lower as 0 3 1 2 g kg there is a tendency to increase the concentration of these elements with depth fig 10g h i j a significant difference in sulfur s content was observed in pk1 mean 118 9 mg kg and pk8 mean 7278 0 mg kg in pk8 elevated s concentrations were found at depths of 0 5 3 m in reducing condition of the sediments as could be bound to sulphides ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the elevated concentration of calcium ca was found in pk11 11 1 g kg pk3 12 8 g kg pk7 13 2 g kg pk18 15 7 g kg and pk8 22 7 g kg at depths of 0 5 3 m however a slight decreasing trend of ca content was observed with depth in the shallow sediments 4 7 2 elemental characteristics of river sediments in pallina river in pas1 and at the confluence between the pallina and katari rivers in kas2 there is an increase in as concentration in drse from 14 6 to 17 5 mg kg 19 6 and from 23 7 to 25 9 mg kg 9 respectively fig 10 k on the contrary there is an increase in as concentration in katari river in rase by 16 in kas1 32 in kas3 30 in kas4 44 in kas5 and 8 in kas6 fig 10 k the highest as content was found in katari river in the northwest of the study area in the lacaya region cos3 42 3 mg kg near cb fig 2 the concentration of fe in the sediments varied with in a range of 19 8 22 1 g kg in rase and 18 2 26 9 g kg in drse where 4 of increased concentrations was observed in drse the range of al concentration varied between 9 7 15 2 g kg and 5 9 15 4 g kg in the rase and drse respectively the comparison of the content of the other tes such as mn rase range 283 6 492 mg kg drse range 270 1 474 4 mg kg zn rase range 90 8 212 8 mg kg drse range 74 7 491 1 mg kg si rase range 78 5 273 5 mg kg drse range 98 170 7 mg kg b rase range 43 4 64 1 mg kg drse range 50 2 88 9 mg kg sb rase range 3 1 4 9 mg kg drse range 3 4 60 3 mg kg and li rase range 48 6 67 9 mg kg drse range 34 3 92 4 mg kg were variable but no trends were observed 4 7 3 sequential extraction of as in core sediments of piezometers the sequential extraction procedure of the bcr method ure et al 1993 allowed to determine the distribution of as and among the different geochemical fractions f1 f2 f3 and f4 which reflected the relative proportions of as transported by different chemical mechanisms fig 11 the as rich layers found from highest to lowest through the sequential extraction in first layer 0 1 1 5 m as f4 range 6 4 33 4 mg kg f2 range 0 3 2 6 mg kg f1 range 0 2 1 7 mg kg and f3 range 0 1 0 9 mg kg in the second layer 1 5 2 5 m it from highest to lowest exhibited as f4 range 11 7 94 mg kg f2 range 0 03 5 7 mg kg f1 range 0 1 5 1 mg kg and f3 range 0 2 1 2 mg kg in the third layer 2 4 3 2 m it from highest to lowest was noticed as f4 range 10 2 38 7 mg kg f2 range 0 5 3 6 mg kg f1 range 0 2 1 9 mg kg and f3 range 0 3 1 mg kg finally the last layer 2 5 3 3 m it from highest to lowest was observed as f4 range 12 1 16 4 mg kg f2 range 1 3 1 6 mg kg f1 range 0 5 1 mg kg and f3 range 0 3 0 4 mg kg in all cases the concentration of as was highest in the f4 residual fraction followed by f2 reducible fraction f1 exchangeable fraction and f3 oxidizable the concentrations of as extracted are much higher in layers 2 and 3 table 5 in general being the largest residual fraction approximately 84 the as is associated with primary and secondary minerals it probably does not dissolve under natural conditions mäkelä et al 2011 this indicates that the as has reduced mobility low release of as by sediment f4 the reducible fraction of as is approximately 9 which this indicates the as is associated with oxides of mn and fe and forms normally known as sinks of tes in a surface environment silveti et al 2013 f2 in 5 of the extractions the as is found exchangeable form it could be released by ion exchange processes or co precipitated with carbonates this form would be the most readily available gleyzes et al 2002 f1 finally only 2 of the extractions are in the oxidizable form sulfides in this form the as is not considered bioavailable filgueiras et al 2002 f3 fig 11 5 discussions 5 1 sources of arsenic the concentrations of as in the study area shows a progression of as enrichment however these are located in specific regions such as flood area which indicates the distribution of as is not homogeneous in the basin the northern region flood plain area specifically the flat region has the highest as concentration this indicates that sediments are the most important sources of as the concentrations of as in sediments are slightly higher than the global mean estimated 1 5 mg kg bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b ravenscroft et al 2009 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 because alluvial sediments are the predominant scenario for gw enriched in as such as in many places of the world bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b the as concentrations in the sediments are varied according to the depth as the second 2 3 5 m and the third level 3 5 4 5 m where have clays silts and fine sands and which have sediments of lacustrine origin as 63 84 mg kg maximum values there are considerable variations of as concentration in between or different strata which leads to indicate a high spatial variety in the characteristics of the sediments the high variation in as concentrations could be explained as a consequence of the alluvial processes from the paleo lakes and the subsequent wind processes that would have redistributed the material over the entire altiplano making the sediments more heterogeneous ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the evaporites sedimentary rocks that are formed by crystallization of dissolved salts in lakes intermingle with the sediments found in places that have high as contents which makes their distribution irregular banks et al 2004 the direct effect of volcanic rocks on water quality in the northwest region near lake titicaca is limited since as concentrations are lower compared to those in the northern region where lacustrine sediments predominate volcanic rock weathering despite its moderate as content is considered in many studies as an important source of as smedley and kinniburgh 2002 banks et al 2004 schnoor 1996 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 tapia and audry 2013 higher values of ph 8 5 and na indicate these rocks smedley and kinniburgh 2002 would affect that gw the tiwanaku coniri and kollu kollu geological formations of the tertiary and quaternary age martínez et al 2007 represents in the study area which has a significant influence on the general water chemistry in particular of the northwestern region the as and b are elements are existed in volcanic deposits northwest region exhibiting a correlation ec vs as r2 0 36 ec vs b r2 0 65 with the salinity of gw due to this characteristic they could be expected to persist in sw and accumulate in gw ormachea muñoz et al 2013 the salinity of the northern plain in a semi arid climate the evaporation could mobilize some types of exchangeable as present towards the gw on the contrary the low concentrations of as in the central and southern plains of the study area having waters enrichment in ca2 and hco3 could indicate that as is linked to caco3 minerals that are insoluble especially at high ph stollenwerk et al 2002 5 2 sediment water interaction sediments consist of a dominant texture class clay sandy loam and have good drainage capacity and probably good aeration the amount of extracted as in different depth levels has a certain correlation with the type of sediment material the second 1 5 2 5 m and the third 2 5 3 2 m level which are composed of finer materials sandy clay loam this would reflect the greater weathering of fine sediments due to their greater reactive surface area gustafsson et al 2006 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 since most of the as is found in the residual fraction f4 84 in the sediments of the central region of the plain the role of refractory primary minerals fe al is essential although the as has reduced mobility in the sediments its high concentration indicates that in the long term they could be a very important source of as contamination for the environment being able to develop the dissolution of minerals with high as content high ph values together with the oxic characteristic of the terrain are conducive to the increase in as concentrations smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 due to the decrease in as adsorption to the oxides and hydroxides of fe and al which vary according to the ph appelo and postma 2005 that is why even a small increase in ph could generate a significant increase in as concentration in gw this is evidenced in the ph values in the northern plain rase mean ph 7 3 drse mean ph 7 9 the adsorption of as to oxides and hydroxides of fe and al decreases under oxidizing condition in addition to high ph values with a reduction in adsorption and stability of aso4 3 stollenwerk et al 2002 the importance of carbonates in as levels in gw is not entirely clear since in the geochemical modeling the si found reveal that gw is unsaturated or in equilibrium with respect to calcite in some wells since it is known that the adsorption of as in calcite or clay minerals could be one of the most important as immobilization processes in areas with a ph range 7 9 stollenwerk et al 2002 romero et al 2004 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 another study indicates that carbonates have a negative effect on the adsorption of as to fe oxides claesson and fagerberg 2003 stollenwerk et al 2002 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 ahmad et al 2019 the interchangeable fraction f1 5 in the region of the central and southern plains could indicate that the as in sediments can be better mobilized at higher ph however being low only 5 in relation to the other fractions suggests that the ph has a low impact on the release of as in this region the adsorption of as due to the oxides and hydroxides of fe al and mn which is one of the most studied processes regarding the mobility of as in natural waters bhattacharya et al 2006 van genuchten and ahmad 2020 ahmad et al 2019 represents the second most important fraction of the study f2 9 the insignificant correlation was exhibited between as and fe concentrations in gw samples throughout the region r2 0 27 0 52 except in the northern plain region r2 0 93 0 94 the lack of a correlation between these two elements indicates that the reducing dissolution is not important in the region corroborated with the values of eh slightly oxidizing medium under reducing conditions the oxides of fe iii with adsorbed as are dissolved fe and releases as gustafsson et al 2006 and this reductive dissolution is a common cause of the high concentration of as bhattacharya et al 2006 this process explains the good correlation between as and fe r2 0 93 0 94 in the northern plain region geochemical modeling indicates the probable precipitation of oxides and hydroxides of fe and al in the study area with the exception of the north and northeast region which confirms the as adsorbents there are several minerals that according to the si would be responsible for the low as values such as hematite fe2o3 goethite α feooh gibbsite al oh 3 k mica kal3si3o10 oh 2 and kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 possible evaporation conditions could be an important factor for the high concentration of as in gw bhattacharya et al 2006 considering that the gw levels are shallow in the northern region 0 6 0 8 m and northeast 1 1 0 9 of the study area the si is an important element that could be competing for adsorption spaces in minerals because it has significant concentrations in the north 8 4 8 mg l and northwest 13 1 12 5 mg l regions where as concentrations are also high it is known that high si values 10 mg l and an elevated ph could decrease as adsorption stollenwerk et al 2002 davis et al 2001 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 6 conclusions the lack of good quality water according to nb 512 and who guidelines for consumption in the northwest north east and the right side of katari river in the plain area is due to the low rainfall semi arid climate and high salinity salt evaporation the water bodies in lkb are affected by the elevated presence of as b mn and no3 this problem remains despite the fact that the sw presents dilution in its salt and mineral contents after the confluence of pallina and katari rivers the sw does not represent a possible source of drinking water due to the negative effect of wastewater pallina river and its entire load solids and liquids along the katari river the large temporal variation in the amounts of water causes a direct action on gw and a larger scale on sw the drag material coming from the wastewater represents a significant negative health impact for lkb and in particular for the populations of the lower part wilajahuira lacaya pampa cohana the general trend in the direction of gw flow is from southeast to northwest showing sectors with probable interaction between sw and gw the highest concentrations of as in gw are found downstream of the basin northwest area and could be associated with alluvial sediments enriched with as it was observed that due to the low slope 3 8 the gw would have a slow movement and along with the large surface area of fine grained sediments would be facilitating the release of as in rase there is a decrease in as concentrations because as the flow of water increases the contact time between water and sediment is reduced the sw with somewhat higher concentrations of as is found downstream of the basin which is enriched the concentration of as due to evaporation possibly the geological characteristics of lkb generate a great spatial variability of as due to the presence of evaporites that are distributed unevenly in the sediments in the region where volcanic formations exist although the concentrations are lower compared to the northern plain it is still harmful to health another important phenomenon considers the as b and li present in the sw that would be accumulating in the gw and the interchangeable as in the lowlands could be mobilized to the gw due to the increase in salinity semi arid climate and evaporation of salts especially in the plain region sequential extraction of sediments and geochemical modeling indicates that as is associated with the oxides and hydroxides of fe and al which are probably the most important adsorbents of as in the sediments the low mobility of as in the central and southern region of the basin would be due to calcium carbonates e g calcite although the mobility of as in the sediments of these areas is reduced its high concentration indicates that in the long term it could become a great source of water contamination for future studies in the area it is recommended to model surface water flows and quality by applying qual2kw or other surface water modeling software the sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 was established by the united nations general assembly in 2015 which fundamentally deals with ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all this study promotes technological empowerment of people rural populations of the study area to implement the sdgs as a consequence of this study a monitoring network of water bodies and sediments was established which is very useful to evaluate the quality and quantity of the water in the shallow aquifers and the surrounding rivers the knowledge generated now serves to suggest possible mitigation options that can be adopted by local communities as well as other interesting parties in mitigation of water pollution decision makers in water management policies such as the ministry of water municipal governments and water committees the identification of the problem as contamination and other trace metals the current deteriorated state of drinking water in some regions of the basin was evidenced areas with major suitability for use as a source of drinking water are proposed

4873,infiltration trenches are popular green stormwater infrastructure gsi systems in dense urban areas primarily due to their small footprints that cope with the limited available space and subsurface utility conditions to investigate the dynamic seasonal performance of urban infiltration trench systems more than three years of continuous rainfall and water level data from an infiltration trench in philadelphia pennsylvania were analyzed the recession rates in the infiltration trench showed a seasonality higher recession rates in warmer months and lower recession rates in colder months and a head dependency higher recession rates in higher water levels to incorporate this dynamic performance into a simple modeling approach that can be used in practical applications both event based and continuous simulation models were developed using storage units in swmm and calibrated validated against observed data the most important conclusions for dynamic modeling of infiltration trench systems were the introduction of monthly adjustment factors for saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and a head dependent component for infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil in the model both of which were determined by calibration benefits of the presented dynamic modeling approach were demonstrated by comparing the dynamic and static modeling results indicating the

expansion and upsizing of traditional stormwater systems to address this problem is often difficult because of the existence of technical environmental traffic utility and space limitations in urban areas ebrahimian et al 2015 2018 bonneau et al 2017 the movement from conventional stormwater management to low impact development lid during the last few decades has incorporated green stormwater infrastructure gsi systems such as infiltration trenches and bioretention systems green stormwater infrastructure is a water soil plant climate system that controls stormwater runoff quantity and or quality onsite by utilizing components of the hydrologic cycle and increases water sustainability and community resilience by providing environmental ecological social and economical benefits us epa 2020 traver and ebrahimian 2017 two main hydrologic input approaches for rainfall runoff models and gsi design are single event and continuous rainfall the event based model considers only one individual storm event from the hydrologic record or a single synthetic rainfall event with a predetermined duration temporal distribution and frequency that produces the most severe hydrologic loading and hence the most conservative design this approach is simple and only utilizes a constant time interval usually ranging from 2 to 72 hr however it neglects the gsi initial conditions e g soil moisture and storage levels at the beginning of simulation and assumes an equal return frequency for the utilized single event i e design storm and the simulated runoff peak and volume which is usually not true urbonas 1979 ormsbee 1989 knapp et al 1991 in the context of gsi design the single event approach lacks dynamic aspects of infiltration and resembles a static design for stormwater control continuous rainfall runoff simulation models use long term usually at least a year to address the effect of initial conditions and seasonal variations to multiple decades rainfall time series as the input data to produce corresponding long term time series for the runoff knapp et al 1991 yang et al 2004 the continuous approach gives a more accurate estimation for the runoff volume by accounting for both rainfall events and inter storm conditions and considering seasonal variation and dynamics of infiltration which is especially important for dynamic modeling and design of gsi systems green stormwater infrastructure systems behave dynamically over seasons and under variable rainfall conditions for example ponding times for the same size event are different throughout the year emerson and traver 2008 ahmed and borst 2019 due to several factors such as soil type initial moisture conditions temperature vegetation condition soil biological activities and level of soil compaction ebrahimian et al 2020 however traditional runoff reduction design of gsi systems neglects their dynamic nature and mostly relies on static storage surface storage plus porosity of soil media this design approach does not include infiltration from the gsi to the surrounding in situ soil during storm events and evapotranspiration et after storm events to restore soil storage capacity traver and ebrahimian 2017 the static event based design concepts target a capture volume and assume the gsi system has full storage capacity at the beginning of a storm event which may not be true as back to back rainfall events can affect gsi performance by diminishing the storage capacity for the second rain event wadzuk et al 2017 how water infiltrates from a gsi system s storage media e g through the bottom or lateral sides can affect system performance duchene et al 1994 sokolovskaya et al 2021 over longer time horizons et can play a role in a gsi system s storage capacity recovery ebrahimian et al 2019 hess et al 2019 delvecchio et al 2020 as our knowledge and experience with gsi grows it is clear that to enhance the sustainability and unveil the resiliency of these systems against extreme rainfall conditions and climate change impacts we need to understand the dynamics and interdependencies of multiple gsi processes one approach for achieving this understanding is to develop continuous simulation models using the full hydrologic cycle and a larger time horizon than traditional static and event based models and verify the continuous models against observations in this approach the incorporation of regional climate et and infiltration in the soil media capacity recovery during and between storm events is the most important issue that needs further research traver and ebrahimian 2017 infiltration trenches are becoming popular gsi systems in dense urban areas primarily due to their small footprints that cope with the limited available space and subsurface utility conditions warnaars et al 1999 bonneau et al 2017 tu and traver 2019 urban infiltration trench systems are usually long and narrow subsurface storage zones that are filled with stone or gravel that rely primarily on infiltration for runoff reduction runoff from the drainage area is stored in the voids of the trench and infiltrates to the surrounding in situ soil duchene et al 1994 warnaars et al 1999 and in some cases exits through an underdrain pipe tree pits may be embedded into these systems also known as tree trench systems to expand the urban forest and improve the aesthetic and environmental functions of these gsi systems caplan et al 2019 szota et al 2019 grey et al 2018 most of the available studies about infiltration trenches are based on field measurements emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 field measurements with conceptual models for estimating infiltration rates warnaars et al 1999 bergman et al 2011 or laboratory experiments siriwardene et al 2007 sobotkova et al 2018 although one dimensional 1 d models could be useful at least as a first approximation in modeling infiltration in infiltration trenches at least a two dimensional 2 d model is needed to accurately simulate infiltration through both the bottom and the side walls of an infiltration trench browne et al 2013 naghedifar et al 2019 however sophisticated physically based unsaturated soil water flow models such as swap kroes and van dam 2003 and hydrus simunek et al 1999 are rarely used in real world gsi applications because of their complexity data boundary condition user expertise requirements and run times the existing models in the literature for simulating infiltration trenches including 2 d models e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2013 and 1 d models e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2008 freni et al 2009 have not been validated against observations from real infiltration trench systems evaluation of these models has been based on a comparison with other models duchene et al 1994 freni et al 2009 or observations from laboratory experiments browne et al 2008 2013 farahi et al 2017 the lid module of the publicly available united states environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 has been widely used for modeling and design of gsi systems in the united states and other countries niazi et al 2017 however this module is unable to accurately simulate infiltration trench systems primarily because of the 1 d vertical flow condition that limits modeling of lateral infiltration to the in situ soil platz et al 2020 there is a need for a modeling approach that is accurate enough to consider the dynamic performance of infiltration trench systems throughout the year and yet simple enough to be used in practical modeling and design applications the objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic performance of urban infiltration trench systems through a real case study and to incorporate this dynamic performance into a simple modeling approach in swmm that can be used in practical applications an infiltration trench in philadelphia pennsylvania pa is used as the case study thirty seven months of field monitoring data from the infiltration trench of study were analyzed and event based and continuous simulation models using the internal capabilities of swmm were developed calibrated and validated using the observed data benefits of the presented dynamic modeling approach were demonstrated by comparing the dynamic and static modeling results 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the infiltration trench of study fig 1 is a stone trench with embedded tree pits i e tree trench underneath a sidewalk on north 7th street in philadelphia pa by the john hartranft school the infiltration trench was constructed by the philadelphia water department and is called hartranft 1 1 1 the plan view area of the infiltration trench is 29 6 m 97 ft l 3 0 m 10 ft w and includes three tree pits of 1 2 m 4 ft w 3 0 m 10 ft l 0 9 m 3 ft d each as the infiltration trench is underneath a sidewalk rather than infiltrating from the top runoff enters a green inlet a 1 2 m 4 ft wide inlet with a flexstorm filter bag flexstorm inlet filters and a sump that acts as pretreatment for entering runoff and is distributed into the stone trench through a 0 46 m 18 in perforated hdpe pipe fig 1 if the street runoff bypasses the green inlet it will flow into a regular street inlet that is connected to the city sewer system city inlet stored runoff in the infiltration trench infiltrates into the in situ soil overflow from the infiltration trench also happens through the green inlet grate and flows into the city inlet a 0 20 m 8 in perforated hdpe underdrain leading to the city sewer system is capped but a hole can be drilled in the cap to allow a controlled release if infiltration is too slow the groundwater level is about 3 6 m 10 20 ft below ground usgs 2020 the drainage area to the infiltration trench is 100 impervious streets and sidewalks and equals 1743 m2 18 761 sq ft which is about 20 times the infiltration trench area i e loading ratio of 20 1 varying catchment parameters that can change the time of concentration e g width roughness and initial abstraction within a physically feasible range did not have a notable effect on the inflow hydrograph to the infiltration trench the infiltration trench was designed to capture a 23 mm 0 9 in design storm over the drainage area 2 2 monitoring data continuous rainfall and water level data were used for performance analysis and model calibration validation rainfall data was taken from the nearest rain gauge philadelphia water department s rain gauge 26 tr 525usw texas electronics inc that is approximately 450 m away from the infiltration trench and records rainfall at 15 minute intervals continuous water level data in 5 minute intervals were recorded in an observation well in the middle of the infiltration trench using a water level sensor pressure transducer hobo u20 001 04 onset observed water level data from december 2012 to march 2016 were analyzed but only data from december 2012 to december 2015 37 months were used in calibration and validation because of some unreliable data in 2016 based on the infiltration trench s geometry and configuration the overflow elevation elevation at which overflow occurs was set at 1 2 m 4 ft in the simulation models this elevation 1 2 m corresponds to the stone bed s effective depth the lowest elevation in the longitudinal profile of the top of stone bed and is the same as the green inlet grate elevation the rainfall and water level data were analyzed to separate overflow events i e the storm events that generate overflow from no overflow events i e the storm events that do not generate overflow storm events were defined by a minimum total depth of 2 5 mm 0 1 in and a minimum of 6 hr no rainfall period between events 2 3 modeling methods swmm 5 1 012 rossman and huber 2016 a well established and widely used niazi et al 2017 model for simulating the rainfall runoff process primarily from urban areas was used to create both event based and continuous simulation models for the infiltration trench of study the modeling goal was to incorporate the annual variability of infiltration into a simple modeling approach that matches observed dynamic system performance and is appropriate in practical applications to model the infiltration trench a storage unit su in swmm was used to allow for explicit control over the storage volume available at each depth and outflow and inflow hydraulics storage units are node objects in swmm that provide water storage and their volumetric properties are described by a surface area depth relationship the water level and volume within each su can be tracked during flow routing also evaporation from su surface and infiltration into the surrounding native soil from su bottom and sides can be allowed for the stored water in sus see rossman 2017 for more details using the kinematic wave method for flow routing in swmm with a dry wet and routing time step of 5 min 1 min and 30 s respectively the runoff from selected rainfall over the drainage area was routed to the su the stage storage curve for the su reflected available pore space in the trench at each depth based on the gsi geometry and an assumed 40 porosity for stone bed 20 porosity for tree pits and 92 porosity for pipes according to the guideline infiltration trench specifications pwd 2018 the maximum depth of the su was set to the overflow elevation 1 2 m to match the grate inlet height any water in excess of the overflow elevation was classified as node flooding infiltration out of the su expressed as seepage from the sides and bottom of the su and et from the surface of the su to represent the et from the tree pits were allowed to occur continuously during and between rainfall events this feature also enables swmm to portray non empty trench conditions at the beginning of simulation resulting from a previous storm and when the trench can empty given sufficient time the estimation of surface runoff over subcatchments in swmm is performed by a nonlinear reservoir model based on a continuity equation eq 1 rossman and huber 2016 1 d t i e f q where d water depth on the land surface l t time t i rainfall rate plus the rate of runoff from upstream catchments lt 1 e evapotranspiration rate lt 1 f infiltration rate lt 1 and q runoff rate lt 1 the green ampt g a method green and ampt 1911 modified by mein and larson 1973 and chu 1978 eq 2 was used in swmm to represent infiltration into the in situ soil it assumes a vertically downward movement of infiltrated water based on darcy s law in a saturated layer below which there is an unsaturated layer separated by a sharp wetting front from the saturated layer equation 2 applies only after a saturated layer develops prior to this time the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity 2 f k sat 1 ψ s θ d f where f infiltration rate lt 1 k sat saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ψ s capillary suction head along the wetting front l θ d maximum soil moisture deficit dimensionless volume volume and f cumulative infiltration l three soil parameters that need to be estimated for determining the g a infiltration are k sat ψ s and θ d the preliminary estimation of ksat for different soil types can be performed using available references such as rawls et al 1983 1998 or the usda soil survey database soils usda gov survey however rawls tables present a typical range for ksat based on the studied undisturbed samples urban soils are usually disturbed and compacted due to construction processes and traffic loads rossman and huber 2016 therefore the published ranges for ksat while useful as preliminary estimates do not suffice as accurate ksat values at urban gsi sites determining an effective ksat by conducting multiple field measurements was recommended by weiss and gulliver 2015 for g a infiltration modeling in gsi systems a comparison of appropriate techniques for measuring field ksat in gsi systems can be found in ebrahimian et al 2020 maximum moisture deficit θ d is the available fillable porosity defined as effective porosity e minus initial soil moisture content at the start of the simulation where e is the total porosity minus residual soil moisture content θ r or the remaining moisture content after the saturated soil drains thoroughly ignoring the entrapped air at saturation θ d is represented by e for dry antecedent conditions rossman and huber 2016 typical values of e for different soil types can be found in references such as rawls et al 1983 although these values exhibit high variability similar to what discussed for ksat another way for estimating θ d for the soils in the u s can be using available moisture capacity data from the usda soil survey database however these data provide the difference between field capacity and wilting point underestimating θ d rossman and huber 2016 the suction head ψ s can be determined from capillary pressure hydraulic conductivity relationship but such detailed data are rare for most soils brakensiek 1977 presents ψ s as a function of bubbling pressure and the pore size distribution index approximate ψ s values for different soil types can be found from published tables such as rawls et al 1983 or nonlinear regression equations based on ksat rossman and huber 2016 while the published values for ψ s vary notably the g a infiltration is not highly sensitive to the estimates of ψ s brakensiek and onstad 1977 swmm uses an empirical method for the recovery of soil infiltration capacity during the dry time no rain and no ponded water that is not dependent on subsurface drainage and et for the g a method this empirical infiltration capacity recovery depends on ksat only rossman and huber 2016 daily et rates for the drainage area were computed by the model from the input temperature file using hargreaves equation rossman and huber 2016 evapotranspiration from the trench was set to occur at the same rate as for the drainage area daily temperatures from the philadelphia international airport in year 1999 were used for all years of simulation choosing other years for temperature data does not have a considerable effect on modeling results as the simulated et from the su is very low e g 0 4 of the total inflow to su during the 2013 2015 period recession rates in infiltration trenches have been observed to be dependent on water depth in the trench emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 sokolovskaya et al 2021 also the g a method only considers the vertically downward infiltration from the infiltration trench s bottom to address the head dependency of the recession rate higher recession rates at higher water levels and account for the lateral infiltration from the infiltration trench side walls see sokolovskaya et al 2021 for a detailed discussion a virtual outlet eq 3 was added to the su at the height of 0 15 m 0 5 ft from the trench bottom 3 q a h b where q is the outlet flow l3t 1 h is the water height above the outlet l and a l2t 1 and b dimensionless are coefficients that were determined by calibration coefficient b was set to 1 to represent a first order dependence of infiltration on the depth and coefficient a was determined by fitting eq 3 to the observed data coefficient a was incorporated into the outlet flow as monthly multipliers via control rules in swmm it should be noted that the virtual outlet is an empirical model construction to account for the observed infiltration behavior and does not represent a physical feature in the infiltration trench a seasonality in ksat i e higher ksat in warmer months and lower ksat in colder months has been reported in different infiltration based gsi systems also soil hydraulic conductivity in gsi systems can change with several other natural and human related factors see ebrahimian et al 2020 for a review of potential factors and available studies to capture the temporal variation of ksat monthly adjustment factors were applied to ksat using the climatology editor in swmm these factors were considered as lumped adjustment factors related to potential causes of ksat variability in gsi and were determined by the calibration process calibration of the swmm model consisted of two steps first considering ksat and coefficient a from eq 3 as calibration parameters the event based model was calibrated using five storm events the base values of these two parameters were determined as the maximum calibrated ksat value for the five events in table 1 that also worked for other storm events in warm months and its associated a value 24 4 mm hr and 0 00201 m2 sec respectively then twenty five months of data december 2012 2013 and 2015 were used for calibrating the continuous model monthly adjustment factors a fraction between zero and one for each month were applied to the base values of the calibration parameters ksat and a using swmm s climatology editor and control rules respectively same adjustment factor for both parameters in each month the adjustment factors were varied until the optimal model fit was achieved for each month as determined by the analysis of three statistical performance measures coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and percent bias pbias validation of the model was performed using 12 months of data 2014 aberrant events in january through march of each year related to snow events or rainfall events with the presence of snow cover on the ground were removed from calibration and validation by using a nearby weather station data overall curve fit was used as the performance metric for model calibration and validation the curve fit included the time to zero water depth i e intersection of the recession limb with the horizontal time axis in the modeled hydrographs as it is important in recession performance and recoverability of the gsi system overflow volume and duration are mandatory regulatory metrics related to cso combined sewer overflow that need to be met in gsi design since the infiltration trench of study is located in a combined sewer area and the overflow volumes were not able to be measured at this site the overflow duration time with continuous water level recordings at or above 1 2 m was used as another metric of system performance in model calibration and validation this regulatory metric is considered by minimizing the difference between modeled and observed overflow durations i e percent error in overflow duration as defined in eq 4 other metrics such as requiring the model to overflow for the observed overflow events and the peak difference i e the difference between maximum observed and modeled water depth for no overflow events were also used in calibration 4 e r r o r i n o v e r f l o w d u r a t i o n overflow d u r a t i o n obs o v e r f l o w d u r a t i o n sim overflow d u r a t i o n obs 100 where the subscripts obs and sim denote observed and simulated values respectively three performance measures r2 nse and pbias in addition to visual inspections were used for evaluating the model performance in this study r2 describes the proportion of the total variance of the observed data that the model can explain legates and mccabe jr 1999 and nse shows how well the observed and modeled data fit a perfect agreement 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 the values of r2 and nse range from 0 to 1 and to 1 respectively pbias shows the average tendency of the modeled data to be smaller or larger than their associated observed values gupta et al 1999 the optimal pbias value is 0 and positive and negative pbias values indicate underestimation and overestimation bias in the model respectively in general it is desired to have a high r2 and nse and low absolute pbias 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of observed data the designed storage volume of the infiltration trench was 23 mm 0 9 in however storm events with a total depth up to 36 mm 1 4 in never generated overflow fig 2 demonstrating that the infiltration trench is performing better than the design this is primarily explained by the infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil during storm events that was not considered in the design the infiltration trench was designed solely based on available pore space in the stone trench both overflow and non overflow events were observed between 36 mm 1 4 in and 66 mm 2 6 in storm depths area between the dashed lines in fig 2 which can be explained by temperature related variability of infiltration rates in different months i e lower infiltration in cold months and higher infiltration in warm months and intensity of storm events ebrahimian et al 2020 overflow was always observed for events with a total depth greater than 66 mm 2 6 in back to back storm events can cause the infiltration trench to be non empty at the beginning of the second event no overflow was observed for the storm events starting with a non empty trench and none of the overflow events were back to back indicating that the occurrence of overflow in this study was not because of back to back storms the better than design performance of the infiltration trench is because of the dynamic processes during and after storm events especially the infiltration during storm events the observed infiltration trench water level recession limbs for different overflow events demonstrated a head water depth in the trench dependency where higher recession rates larger slope of the recession limb occur when the trench is full and lower recession rates occur as the trench empties e g 8 16 fold change for the storm events in fig 3 and table 1 this change in recession rates is due to the head pressure driving the infiltration the head dependency of recession rates higher recession rates in higher water levels is confirmed in other studies such as emerson et al 2010 and lewellyn et al 2016 for infiltration trenches in villanova pa and ahmed and borst 2020 for tree boxes infiltration based gsi including soil media and gravel bed in louisville kentucky the declining slope of the recession limbs indicates that the head dependency of the infiltration rate of water to the surrounding in situ soil should be considered in modeling and design sokolovskaya et al 2021 the difference in the rising limb of the hydrographs in fig 3 relates to storm event characteristics and initial conditions in the infiltration trench a seasonal variation of the recession limb of the trench water level was observed with higher recession rates in warmer months for example the average recession rate average of recession rates at the water levels specified in table 1 for the 7 14 2014 8 13 2013 2 23 2016 and 1 18 2015 events were 116 3 99 9 76 7 and 48 2 mm hr respectively fig 4 infiltration rates that vary with season higher infiltration rates in summer and lower infiltration rates in winter were observed in other studies e g ahmed and borst 2019 emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 emerson and traver 2008 braga et al 2007 lin et al 2003 clancy and alba 2011 and cerda 1997 1999 the temperature dependency of infiltration can be explained by a number of temperature induced changes in both soil and water such as a decreased soil water viscosity with increasing temperature lin et al 2003 jaynes 1990 b decreased surface tension due to increased temperature constantz 1982 c soil particles thermal expansion with increasing temperature gao and shao 2015 and d reduced entrapped air with increasing temperature hopmans and dane 1986 these changes result in increased infiltration rate with increasing temperature a comprehensive discussion on the interdependencies of different causes for temporal variation of infiltration in gsi systems can be found in ebrahimian et al 2020 the seasonal variability of infiltration can potentially be incorporated into gsi design 3 2 simulation 3 2 1 event based model the event based model was run with five storm events table 2 the ksat of the surrounding in situ soil drove changes to model results and hence was used as the calibration parameter while the exact overflow duration was achieved in three out of four storm events with overflow in table 2 the best fit for the overflow duration did not result in an acceptable and consistent fit for the time to zero water depth and the curve shape r2 nse and pbias varied between 0 41 0 66 2 75 0 41 and 198 180 respectively examples of the underestimation and overestimation of the time to zero water depth are presented in fig 5 a and 5b for the 9 2 2013 and 1 18 2015 events respectively accurate simulation of trench recession limbs is particularly important because it determines the time to zero water depth different design manuals usually require the gsi to become empty within 2 4 days after a storm event to be ready to capture the next storm event asleson et al 2009 carpenter hallam 2010 hence capturing the time to zero water depth is critically important in design regulatory compliance and resiliency assessment of gsi systems to improve the calibration results in table 2 a virtual outlet eq 3 was added to the model a substantial decrease in the slope of the observed recession limbs was seen at the elevation of about 0 15 m 0 5 ft above the trench bottom for all the storm events figs 3 and 4 and table 1 this indicated that a constant infiltration rate is not able to accurately simulate the recession limb of the hydrograph and consequently the time to zero water depth and extra infiltration needs to be considered when the water level in the infiltration trench is higher than 0 15 m hence the virtual outlet elevation was set at 0 15 m the lack of need for additional infiltration at the depth below 0 15 m could be explained by such factors as differential clogging due to differential compaction and sedimentation emerson et al 2010 or nonhomogeneous soil properties however these factors were not investigated in this paper an analysis about the effect of gsi s geometric shape in head dependency of infiltration can be found in sokolovskaya et al 2021 coefficient a was calibrated together with ksat to result in a good curve fit while requiring that the model produces overflow for all events with observed overflow adding the virtual outlet improved the statistical performance measures for all events in table 2 e g r2 increased from 0 66 to 0 92 nse increased from 0 41 to 0 91 and pbias decreased from 54 to 0 0 for the 9 2 2013 storm event the percent error in overflow duration did increase and may look high 33 to 67 for the model setups resulting in the best curve fit but it is amplified because the observed overflow duration is relatively short for example the 8 13 2013 event with the maximum error of 67 has an observed and simulated overflow duration of 0 83 hr and 1 39 hr respectively the modeled peak depth was 2 5 cm 1 in smaller than the observed peak depth for the 7 15 2015 non overflow event table 2 the results demonstrate an offset between the modeled and observed rising limbs of hydrographs i e the trench fills up faster than what the models simulate for example see fig 5b for the 1 18 2015 event potential reasons are the spatial variation of rainfall rain gauge is 450 m away the model s inability to simulate the complex effects of the inlet sump and perforated distribution pipe or the water level sensor s error the inaccuracies in modeled rising limbs do not have a considerable impact on the goal of this analysis that focuses on runoff reduction and system emptying 3 2 2 continuous model similar to the event based calibration the ksat of the surrounding soil was used as the primary parameter for calibration the constant infiltration through the trench bottom at a rate equal to ksat resulted in overestimated values for time to zero water depth and not capturing the curve shape of the recession limb to address this issue similar to the event based calibrations a virtual outlet eq 3 at 0 15 m above the trench bottom was used to allow for the head dependent component of infiltration the monthly ksat adjustment factors ksat values and the virtual outlet coefficient a all resulting from the monthly calibrations using 25 months of observed data are presented in table 3 two field infiltration tests using a modified borehole percolation testing method falling head test in unlined open boreholes based on pa dep 2006 before construction of the infiltration trench august 20 2009 resulted in stabilized infiltration rates of 12 2 and 4 3 mm hr to compare the ksat values from calibration to the field measured values the ksat values in table 3 need to be multiplied by the stone bed porosity here 0 4 sokolovskaya et al 2021 this shows that the calibrated ksat values in table 3 were within the range observed by field tests while swmm uses ksat in the g a equation rossman and huber 2016 there is an extensive literature for agricultural and natural landscapes recommending the use of effective hydraulic conductivity k e in the g a equation e g risse et al 1995 zhang et al 1995a 1995b kidwell et al 1997 bouwer 1969 considers k e in the g a equation as one half of ksat where ksat is estimated from brutsaert 1967 as a function of effective porosity bubbling pressure and the pore size distribution index risse et al 1995 present three groups of factors related to 1 soil crusting e g porosity and bulk density of the infiltration zone and number of freeze thaw cycles 2 storm events characteristics e g depth duration and peak intensity and 3 antecedent moisture conditions e g rainfall in certain number of preceding days that are significantly correlated to k e in fallow lands and recommend that the g a infiltration parameters should be adjusted for each storm event in continuous simulation models also zhang et al 1995a b adds vegetative cover and canopy conditions to the above factors for cropped lands it should be noted that the variability of k e in the g a method is expected to be more important in large scale modeling applications due to spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties land surface cover and rainfall govindaraju et al 2001 corradini et al 2002 van den putte et al 2013 in contrast to infiltration related research in natural and agricultural systems the existing literature related to infiltration in urban gsi systems is limited a review of causes for temporal and spatial variation of soil hydraulic conductivity in gsi sites is presented by ebrahimian et al 2020 clogging due to the accumulation of fine particles from the catchment in the void spaces of the infiltration trench can negatively impact the performance of infiltration trenches over time however adequate maintenance proper siting that results in reasonable loadings of sediment inflow and appropriate design of infiltration trenches can substantially reduce clogging effects in these systems bergman et al 2011 ebrahimian et al 2020 while some existing studies consider clogging in modeling infiltration trenches e g duchene et al 1994 freni et al 2009 bergman et al 2011 sobotkova et al 2018 clogging is not considered in the proposed approach and is planned for future research groundwater is another factor that can potentially affect soil hydraulic conductivity through changing soil moisture and surface water flux e g evaporation especially in regions with a high groundwater table chen and hu 2004 also groundwater table fluctuations introduce entrapped air into soil pore spaces in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zone capillary fringe resulting in the variation of hydraulic conductivity over time and depth near the groundwater table faybishenko 1995 marinas et al 2013 it was assumed that groundwater table fluctuations do not affect ksat in this study because the groundwater table is much lower than the infiltration trench bottom 3 6 m vs 1 2 m also the two boring logs in the gsi site and several others in the area did not indicate shallow groundwater as expected in table 3 colder months have a smaller ksat adjustment factor than the warmer months with the maximum and minimum adjustment factors in september 1 00 and february 0 42 respectively the only exception is november with an unexpectedly high adjustment factor of 0 95 the calibration in november was mostly affected by two larger events on november 26 27 2013 and november 19 2015 the daily average temperature during both events was higher than the historic average temperature 8 9 c 48 f vs 6 7 c 44 f for 11 27 2013 and 17 8 c 64 f vs 8 3 c 47 f for 11 19 2015 resulting in higher recession rates and higher calibrated ksat values in the infiltration trench this agrees with the findings of jaynes 1990 and clancy and alba 2011 where they observed variable soil hydraulic conductivity values throughout the day because of diurnal temperature changes it should be noted that while the adjustment factors in this study are explained with temperature soil hydraulic conductivity can also potentially change with other factors such as rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions the significance of factors other than temperature and clogging in temporal variation of soil hydraulic conductivity for gsi modeling should be further investigated in future research using more robust datasets the calibrated monthly models table 4 showed a good performance in fitting the observed data except for march with an r2 nse and pbias of 0 57 0 53 and 0 9 respectively the r2 nse and pbias varied between 0 79 0 94 0 72 0 94 and 36 2 7 1 respectively the lower r2 and nse in march compared with the other calibration months was attributed to the non empty trench because of snow at the beginning of the 3 11 2015 event that was not captured by the model as well as the presence of snowmelt event on 3 21 2015 that was not identified by using the nearby station data fig 6 a the overall r2 nse and pbias values using all calibration data were calculated as 0 87 0 87 and 0 8 which are considered good moriasi et al 2015 alamdari et al 2017 for overflow events the maximum difference in overflow duration was 2 33 hr in january and less than 0 75 hr in other months this can be attributed to the offset associated with the rising limb as mentioned earlier for the event based calibration results peak depth difference observed peak depth minus modeled peak depth was calculated for no overflow events the absolute value of peak depth difference was always less than or equal to 0 11 m larger events were able to match peaks better than the smaller events e g fig 6b for the goal of runoff removal while the smaller events play a role in soil capacity recovery larger events are of most importance to be captured by the model as those are the events that generate overflow to validate the model the 2014 rainfall was applied to the model using the ksat and monthly adjustment factors from table 3 and compared against the observed water level data table 5 while some months such as march april may july and november showed good validation statistics r2 nse and pbias of 0 78 to 0 98 0 78 to 0 98 and 21 0 to 21 2 respectively and a maximum of 3 hr difference between observed and modeled overflow durations other months such as february september and october had poorer fits e g fig 7 a for may vs fig 7b for september this was because some months in the validation year 2014 had only a few and small rainfall events e g september with three events between 3 and 16 mm and october with five events between 9 and 19 mm or were heavily influenced by snowfall e g the only event in february was a snowmelt event that was not detected by the nearby station data longer term observed data is needed to address this issue in addition continuous temperature dependence of ksat e g ksat changes due to diurnal temperature changes jaynes 1990 clancy and alba 2011 is not always captured by discrete monthly adjustment factors because of the presence of colder or warmer than usual days in some months for example while the mean monthly temperature in april 2014 21 7 c was close to that in april 2015 20 c december 2014 was notably colder than december 2015 mean monthly temperature of 11 1 c vs 19 4 c overall the performance measure statistics for a full year of validation 2014 were acceptable r2 0 79 nse 0 79 and pbias 6 2 overflow duration was underpredicted by 29 in the validation year although the difference between observed and modeled overflow durations was relatively small i e 3 3 hr total over the course of 2014 the following assumptions and simplifications that were made during both the event based and continuous simulations could potentially be sources of uncertainty in the results the utilized rain gauge was about 450 m away from the infiltration trench it was assumed that rainfall spatial variation has no effect on modeling results it was assumed that the distribution pipe makes no restriction to the inflow water it was assumed that the measured water level in the observation well is representative of water level in the infiltration trench system it was assumed that overflow from the system occurs when the measured water level in the observation well exceeds the top of stone bed inlet grate elevation it was assumed that the measured water levels by the pressure transducer sensor and rainfall depths by the rain gauge are accurate 3 3 dynamic vs static model a static model was simulated as a baseline to represent the commonly used approach in the regulatory and design contexts where gsi design is only based on the available storage volume surface storage plus void space in the media the static model results were obtained by running all rainfall events through a su model with no infiltration or et during storm events and starting empty at each storm event all rainfall volume exceeding the available storage in the gsi during a storm event becomes runoff in the static model annually the dynamic model was able to adequately simulate the number of observed overflows table 6 the two dynamic model overflow events in 2013 and 2014 that were not observed were either very short 5 min of modeled overflow in 2013 or during an apparent snowmelt february 2014 figs 8 and 9 show observed and modeled duration and modeled volume for overflow events at the infiltration trench the dynamic model matched observed data better than the static model the difference between number of modeled and observed overflow events in the dynamic and static models for the period of december 2012 december 2015 was 15 4 and 184 6 respectively absolute difference of 2 events vs 23 events in table 6 modeled overflow duration for the monitoring period was found 24 7 and 656 8 different than the observed values in the dynamic and static models respectively absolute difference of 6 3 hr vs 168 6 hr in fig 8 4 summary and conclusions to understand the dynamic performance of urban infiltration trench systems and incorporate this understanding into simple modeling approaches that can be used in practical applications an infiltration trench in philadelphia pa was modeled both event based and continuous simulations using sus in swmm 5 1 012 the soil moisture recovery from the previous events may influence the performance of gsi systems modeling analysis based on observations showed that specified initial conditions alter event based simulations and that a continuous simulation captures the initial conditions for all modeled events as future research computed monthly ksat values can be used to compare the results of the utilized modeling approach to those from coupled saturated unsaturated models that work based on the numerical solutions of the richards equation e g casulli 2017 or sophisticated proprietary models e g hydrus 2d simunek et al 1999 the most important conclusions for dynamic modeling and design of infiltration trench systems were to use an appropriate monthly variable ksat value and to consider the head dependency of infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil these were addressed by introducing monthly adjustment factors for ksat and a head dependent component for infiltration in the presented model both of which were determined by calibration other conclusions based on the analysis of observed data and performed simulations in this research include 1 model calibration hinges on the availability and reliability of the observed dataset and the gsi performance goals minimizing overflow is an important goal in cso areas the available observed datasets in this research were rainfall and water level in the infiltration trench therefore two metrics were used for calibration a overall curve fit this results in an accurate simulation of the falling limb of hydrograph that is necessary to capture the time to zero water depth when the system becomes empty is important in soil moisture recovery between storm events and in making the system ready for the next storm event b overflow duration this provides a simple regulatory measure of system performance without requiring difficult to obtain outflow data 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for the surrounding in situ soil drove changes to model results and was used as the calibration parameter 3 the calibrated ksat values showed a reduced ksat in colder months and an increased ksat in warmer months confirming the seasonal temperature dependent variability of field ksat that has been observed in the literature however the effect of factors other than temperature e g rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions in seasonal variation of ksat and their significance in gsi modeling and design should be investigated in future research 4 the presented monthly adjustment factors for ksat are based on the 25 months of calibration data at the infiltration trench of study and cannot be applied to other infiltration trench systems however the presented methodology can be utilized to investigate a further generalized set of monthly adjustment factors for different conditions using more observed data from the infiltration trench of study and other different infiltration trench systems longer term observed data can improve the accuracy of the results 5 the presented equation for virtual outlets is based on calibration with the observed data from infiltration trench of study and is not formulated in terms of dimensions or physical properties of the gsi longer term monitoring at the study site in addition to monitoring data from more and different types of infiltration trench systems are needed to develop a more generic formulation for virtual

4873,infiltration trenches are popular green stormwater infrastructure gsi systems in dense urban areas primarily due to their small footprints that cope with the limited available space and subsurface utility conditions to investigate the dynamic seasonal performance of urban infiltration trench systems more than three years of continuous rainfall and water level data from an infiltration trench in philadelphia pennsylvania were analyzed the recession rates in the infiltration trench showed a seasonality higher recession rates in warmer months and lower recession rates in colder months and a head dependency higher recession rates in higher water levels to incorporate this dynamic performance into a simple modeling approach that can be used in practical applications both event based and continuous simulation models were developed using storage units in swmm and calibrated validated against observed data the most important conclusions for dynamic modeling of infiltration trench systems were the introduction of monthly adjustment factors for saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and a head dependent component for infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil in the model both of which were determined by calibration benefits of the presented dynamic modeling approach were demonstrated by comparing the dynamic and static modeling results indicating the capability of the dynamic approach to promote sustainable and resilient design of infiltration trench systems keywords stormwater saturated hydraulic conductivity swmm runoff green infrastructure low impact development stormwater control measure 1 introduction substantially increased runoff due to increased impervious land cover is a common consequence of urbanization throughout the world the expansion and upsizing of traditional stormwater systems to address this problem is often difficult because of the existence of technical environmental traffic utility and space limitations in urban areas ebrahimian et al 2015 2018 bonneau et al 2017 the movement from conventional stormwater management to low impact development lid during the last few decades has incorporated green stormwater infrastructure gsi systems such as infiltration trenches and bioretention systems green stormwater infrastructure is a water soil plant climate system that controls stormwater runoff quantity and or quality onsite by utilizing components of the hydrologic cycle and increases water sustainability and community resilience by providing environmental ecological social and economical benefits us epa 2020 traver and ebrahimian 2017 two main hydrologic input approaches for rainfall runoff models and gsi design are single event and continuous rainfall the event based model considers only one individual storm event from the hydrologic record or a single synthetic rainfall event with a predetermined duration temporal distribution and frequency that produces the most severe hydrologic loading and hence the most conservative design this approach is simple and only utilizes a constant time interval usually ranging from 2 to 72 hr however it neglects the gsi initial conditions e g soil moisture and storage levels at the beginning of simulation and assumes an equal return frequency for the utilized single event i e design storm and the simulated runoff peak and volume which is usually not true urbonas 1979 ormsbee 1989 knapp et al 1991 in the context of gsi design the single event approach lacks dynamic aspects of infiltration and resembles a static design for stormwater control continuous rainfall runoff simulation models use long term usually at least a year to address the effect of initial conditions and seasonal variations to multiple decades rainfall time series as the input data to produce corresponding long term time series for the runoff knapp et al 1991 yang et al 2004 the continuous approach gives a more accurate estimation for the runoff volume by accounting for both rainfall events and inter storm conditions and considering seasonal variation and dynamics of infiltration which is especially important for dynamic modeling and design of gsi systems green stormwater infrastructure systems behave dynamically over seasons and under variable rainfall conditions for example ponding times for the same size event are different throughout the year emerson and traver 2008 ahmed and borst 2019 due to several factors such as soil type initial moisture conditions temperature vegetation condition soil biological activities and level of soil compaction ebrahimian et al 2020 however traditional runoff reduction design of gsi systems neglects their dynamic nature and mostly relies on static storage surface storage plus porosity of soil media this design approach does not include infiltration from the gsi to the surrounding in situ soil during storm events and evapotranspiration et after storm events to restore soil storage capacity traver and ebrahimian 2017 the static event based design concepts target a capture volume and assume the gsi system has full storage capacity at the beginning of a storm event which may not be true as back to back rainfall events can affect gsi performance by diminishing the storage capacity for the second rain event wadzuk et al 2017 how water infiltrates from a gsi system s storage media e g through the bottom or lateral sides can affect system performance duchene et al 1994 sokolovskaya et al 2021 over longer time horizons et can play a role in a gsi system s storage capacity recovery ebrahimian et al 2019 hess et al 2019 delvecchio et al 2020 as our knowledge and experience with gsi grows it is clear that to enhance the sustainability and unveil the resiliency of these systems against extreme rainfall conditions and climate change impacts we need to understand the dynamics and interdependencies of multiple gsi processes one approach for achieving this understanding is to develop continuous simulation models using the full hydrologic cycle and a larger time horizon than traditional static and event based models and verify the continuous models against observations in this approach the incorporation of regional climate et and infiltration in the soil media capacity recovery during and between storm events is the most important issue that needs further research traver and ebrahimian 2017 infiltration trenches are becoming popular gsi systems in dense urban areas primarily due to their small footprints that cope with the limited available space and subsurface utility conditions warnaars et al 1999 bonneau et al 2017 tu and traver 2019 urban infiltration trench systems are usually long and narrow subsurface storage zones that are filled with stone or gravel that rely primarily on infiltration for runoff reduction runoff from the drainage area is stored in the voids of the trench and infiltrates to the surrounding in situ soil duchene et al 1994 warnaars et al 1999 and in some cases exits through an underdrain pipe tree pits may be embedded into these systems also known as tree trench systems to expand the urban forest and improve the aesthetic and environmental functions of these gsi systems caplan et al 2019 szota et al 2019 grey et al 2018 most of the available studies about infiltration trenches are based on field measurements emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 field measurements with conceptual models for estimating infiltration rates warnaars et al 1999 bergman et al 2011 or laboratory experiments siriwardene et al 2007 sobotkova et al 2018 although one dimensional 1 d models could be useful at least as a first approximation in modeling infiltration in infiltration trenches at least a two dimensional 2 d model is needed to accurately simulate infiltration through both the bottom and the side walls of an infiltration trench browne et al 2013 naghedifar et al 2019 however sophisticated physically based unsaturated soil water flow models such as swap kroes and van dam 2003 and hydrus simunek et al 1999 are rarely used in real world gsi applications because of their complexity data boundary condition user expertise requirements and run times the existing models in the literature for simulating infiltration trenches including 2 d models e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2013 and 1 d models e g duchene et al 1994 browne et al 2008 freni et al 2009 have not been validated against observations from real infiltration trench systems evaluation of these models has been based on a comparison with other models duchene et al 1994 freni et al 2009 or observations from laboratory experiments browne et al 2008 2013 farahi et al 2017 the lid module of the publicly available united states environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 has been widely used for modeling and design of gsi systems in the united states and other countries niazi et al 2017 however this module is unable to accurately simulate infiltration trench systems primarily because of the 1 d vertical flow condition that limits modeling of lateral infiltration to the in situ soil platz et al 2020 there is a need for a modeling approach that is accurate enough to consider the dynamic performance of infiltration trench systems throughout the year and yet simple enough to be used in practical modeling and design applications the objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic performance of urban infiltration trench systems through a real case study and to incorporate this dynamic performance into a simple modeling approach in swmm that can be used in practical applications an infiltration trench in philadelphia pennsylvania pa is used as the case study thirty seven months of field monitoring data from the infiltration trench of study were analyzed and event based and continuous simulation models using the internal capabilities of swmm were developed calibrated and validated using the observed data benefits of the presented dynamic modeling approach were demonstrated by comparing the dynamic and static modeling results 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the infiltration trench of study fig 1 is a stone trench with embedded tree pits i e tree trench underneath a sidewalk on north 7th street in philadelphia pa by the john hartranft school the infiltration trench was constructed by the philadelphia water department and is called hartranft 1 1 1 the plan view area of the infiltration trench is 29 6 m 97 ft l 3 0 m 10 ft w and includes three tree pits of 1 2 m 4 ft w 3 0 m 10 ft l 0 9 m 3 ft d each as the infiltration trench is underneath a sidewalk rather than infiltrating from the top runoff enters a green inlet a 1 2 m 4 ft wide inlet with a flexstorm filter bag flexstorm inlet filters and a sump that acts as pretreatment for entering runoff and is distributed into the stone trench through a 0 46 m 18 in perforated hdpe pipe fig 1 if the street runoff bypasses the green inlet it will flow into a regular street inlet that is connected to the city sewer system city inlet stored runoff in the infiltration trench infiltrates into the in situ soil overflow from the infiltration trench also happens through the green inlet grate and flows into the city inlet a 0 20 m 8 in perforated hdpe underdrain leading to the city sewer system is capped but a hole can be drilled in the cap to allow a controlled release if infiltration is too slow the groundwater level is about 3 6 m 10 20 ft below ground usgs 2020 the drainage area to the infiltration trench is 100 impervious streets and sidewalks and equals 1743 m2 18 761 sq ft which is about 20 times the infiltration trench area i e loading ratio of 20 1 varying catchment parameters that can change the time of concentration e g width roughness and initial abstraction within a physically feasible range did not have a notable effect on the inflow hydrograph to the infiltration trench the infiltration trench was designed to capture a 23 mm 0 9 in design storm over the drainage area 2 2 monitoring data continuous rainfall and water level data were used for performance analysis and model calibration validation rainfall data was taken from the nearest rain gauge philadelphia water department s rain gauge 26 tr 525usw texas electronics inc that is approximately 450 m away from the infiltration trench and records rainfall at 15 minute intervals continuous water level data in 5 minute intervals were recorded in an observation well in the middle of the infiltration trench using a water level sensor pressure transducer hobo u20 001 04 onset observed water level data from december 2012 to march 2016 were analyzed but only data from december 2012 to december 2015 37 months were used in calibration and validation because of some unreliable data in 2016 based on the infiltration trench s geometry and configuration the overflow elevation elevation at which overflow occurs was set at 1 2 m 4 ft in the simulation models this elevation 1 2 m corresponds to the stone bed s effective depth the lowest elevation in the longitudinal profile of the top of stone bed and is the same as the green inlet grate elevation the rainfall and water level data were analyzed to separate overflow events i e the storm events that generate overflow from no overflow events i e the storm events that do not generate overflow storm events were defined by a minimum total depth of 2 5 mm 0 1 in and a minimum of 6 hr no rainfall period between events 2 3 modeling methods swmm 5 1 012 rossman and huber 2016 a well established and widely used niazi et al 2017 model for simulating the rainfall runoff process primarily from urban areas was used to create both event based and continuous simulation models for the infiltration trench of study the modeling goal was to incorporate the annual variability of infiltration into a simple modeling approach that matches observed dynamic system performance and is appropriate in practical applications to model the infiltration trench a storage unit su in swmm was used to allow for explicit control over the storage volume available at each depth and outflow and inflow hydraulics storage units are node objects in swmm that provide water storage and their volumetric properties are described by a surface area depth relationship the water level and volume within each su can be tracked during flow routing also evaporation from su surface and infiltration into the surrounding native soil from su bottom and sides can be allowed for the stored water in sus see rossman 2017 for more details using the kinematic wave method for flow routing in swmm with a dry wet and routing time step of 5 min 1 min and 30 s respectively the runoff from selected rainfall over the drainage area was routed to the su the stage storage curve for the su reflected available pore space in the trench at each depth based on the gsi geometry and an assumed 40 porosity for stone bed 20 porosity for tree pits and 92 porosity for pipes according to the guideline infiltration trench specifications pwd 2018 the maximum depth of the su was set to the overflow elevation 1 2 m to match the grate inlet height any water in excess of the overflow elevation was classified as node flooding infiltration out of the su expressed as seepage from the sides and bottom of the su and et from the surface of the su to represent the et from the tree pits were allowed to occur continuously during and between rainfall events this feature also enables swmm to portray non empty trench conditions at the beginning of simulation resulting from a previous storm and when the trench can empty given sufficient time the estimation of surface runoff over subcatchments in swmm is performed by a nonlinear reservoir model based on a continuity equation eq 1 rossman and huber 2016 1 d t i e f q where d water depth on the land surface l t time t i rainfall rate plus the rate of runoff from upstream catchments lt 1 e evapotranspiration rate lt 1 f infiltration rate lt 1 and q runoff rate lt 1 the green ampt g a method green and ampt 1911 modified by mein and larson 1973 and chu 1978 eq 2 was used in swmm to represent infiltration into the in situ soil it assumes a vertically downward movement of infiltrated water based on darcy s law in a saturated layer below which there is an unsaturated layer separated by a sharp wetting front from the saturated layer equation 2 applies only after a saturated layer develops prior to this time the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity 2 f k sat 1 ψ s θ d f where f infiltration rate lt 1 k sat saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ψ s capillary suction head along the wetting front l θ d maximum soil moisture deficit dimensionless volume volume and f cumulative infiltration l three soil parameters that need to be estimated for determining the g a infiltration are k sat ψ s and θ d the preliminary estimation of ksat for different soil types can be performed using available references such as rawls et al 1983 1998 or the usda soil survey database soils usda gov survey however rawls tables present a typical range for ksat based on the studied undisturbed samples urban soils are usually disturbed and compacted due to construction processes and traffic loads rossman and huber 2016 therefore the published ranges for ksat while useful as preliminary estimates do not suffice as accurate ksat values at urban gsi sites determining an effective ksat by conducting multiple field measurements was recommended by weiss and gulliver 2015 for g a infiltration modeling in gsi systems a comparison of appropriate techniques for measuring field ksat in gsi systems can be found in ebrahimian et al 2020 maximum moisture deficit θ d is the available fillable porosity defined as effective porosity e minus initial soil moisture content at the start of the simulation where e is the total porosity minus residual soil moisture content θ r or the remaining moisture content after the saturated soil drains thoroughly ignoring the entrapped air at saturation θ d is represented by e for dry antecedent conditions rossman and huber 2016 typical values of e for different soil types can be found in references such as rawls et al 1983 although these values exhibit high variability similar to what discussed for ksat another way for estimating θ d for the soils in the u s can be using available moisture capacity data from the usda soil survey database however these data provide the difference between field capacity and wilting point underestimating θ d rossman and huber 2016 the suction head ψ s can be determined from capillary pressure hydraulic conductivity relationship but such detailed data are rare for most soils brakensiek 1977 presents ψ s as a function of bubbling pressure and the pore size distribution index approximate ψ s values for different soil types can be found from published tables such as rawls et al 1983 or nonlinear regression equations based on ksat rossman and huber 2016 while the published values for ψ s vary notably the g a infiltration is not highly sensitive to the estimates of ψ s brakensiek and onstad 1977 swmm uses an empirical method for the recovery of soil infiltration capacity during the dry time no rain and no ponded water that is not dependent on subsurface drainage and et for the g a method this empirical infiltration capacity recovery depends on ksat only rossman and huber 2016 daily et rates for the drainage area were computed by the model from the input temperature file using hargreaves equation rossman and huber 2016 evapotranspiration from the trench was set to occur at the same rate as for the drainage area daily temperatures from the philadelphia international airport in year 1999 were used for all years of simulation choosing other years for temperature data does not have a considerable effect on modeling results as the simulated et from the su is very low e g 0 4 of the total inflow to su during the 2013 2015 period recession rates in infiltration trenches have been observed to be dependent on water depth in the trench emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 sokolovskaya et al 2021 also the g a method only considers the vertically downward infiltration from the infiltration trench s bottom to address the head dependency of the recession rate higher recession rates at higher water levels and account for the lateral infiltration from the infiltration trench side walls see sokolovskaya et al 2021 for a detailed discussion a virtual outlet eq 3 was added to the su at the height of 0 15 m 0 5 ft from the trench bottom 3 q a h b where q is the outlet flow l3t 1 h is the water height above the outlet l and a l2t 1 and b dimensionless are coefficients that were determined by calibration coefficient b was set to 1 to represent a first order dependence of infiltration on the depth and coefficient a was determined by fitting eq 3 to the observed data coefficient a was incorporated into the outlet flow as monthly multipliers via control rules in swmm it should be noted that the virtual outlet is an empirical model construction to account for the observed infiltration behavior and does not represent a physical feature in the infiltration trench a seasonality in ksat i e higher ksat in warmer months and lower ksat in colder months has been reported in different infiltration based gsi systems also soil hydraulic conductivity in gsi systems can change with several other natural and human related factors see ebrahimian et al 2020 for a review of potential factors and available studies to capture the temporal variation of ksat monthly adjustment factors were applied to ksat using the climatology editor in swmm these factors were considered as lumped adjustment factors related to potential causes of ksat variability in gsi and were determined by the calibration process calibration of the swmm model consisted of two steps first considering ksat and coefficient a from eq 3 as calibration parameters the event based model was calibrated using five storm events the base values of these two parameters were determined as the maximum calibrated ksat value for the five events in table 1 that also worked for other storm events in warm months and its associated a value 24 4 mm hr and 0 00201 m2 sec respectively then twenty five months of data december 2012 2013 and 2015 were used for calibrating the continuous model monthly adjustment factors a fraction between zero and one for each month were applied to the base values of the calibration parameters ksat and a using swmm s climatology editor and control rules respectively same adjustment factor for both parameters in each month the adjustment factors were varied until the optimal model fit was achieved for each month as determined by the analysis of three statistical performance measures coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and percent bias pbias validation of the model was performed using 12 months of data 2014 aberrant events in january through march of each year related to snow events or rainfall events with the presence of snow cover on the ground were removed from calibration and validation by using a nearby weather station data overall curve fit was used as the performance metric for model calibration and validation the curve fit included the time to zero water depth i e intersection of the recession limb with the horizontal time axis in the modeled hydrographs as it is important in recession performance and recoverability of the gsi system overflow volume and duration are mandatory regulatory metrics related to cso combined sewer overflow that need to be met in gsi design since the infiltration trench of study is located in a combined sewer area and the overflow volumes were not able to be measured at this site the overflow duration time with continuous water level recordings at or above 1 2 m was used as another metric of system performance in model calibration and validation this regulatory metric is considered by minimizing the difference between modeled and observed overflow durations i e percent error in overflow duration as defined in eq 4 other metrics such as requiring the model to overflow for the observed overflow events and the peak difference i e the difference between maximum observed and modeled water depth for no overflow events were also used in calibration 4 e r r o r i n o v e

respectively three performance measures r2 nse and pbias in addition to visual inspections were used for evaluating the model performance in this study r2 describes the proportion of the total variance of the observed data that the model can explain legates and mccabe jr 1999 and nse shows how well the observed and modeled data fit a perfect agreement 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 the values of r2 and nse range from 0 to 1 and to 1 respectively pbias shows the average tendency of the modeled data to be smaller or larger than their associated observed values gupta et al 1999 the optimal pbias value is 0 and positive and negative pbias values indicate underestimation and overestimation bias in the model respectively in general it is desired to have a high r2 and nse and low absolute pbias 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of observed data the designed storage volume of the infiltration trench was 23 mm 0 9 in however storm events with a total depth up to 36 mm 1 4 in never generated overflow fig 2 demonstrating that the infiltration trench is performing better than the design this is primarily explained by the infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil during storm events that was not considered in the design the infiltration trench was designed solely based on available pore space in the stone trench both overflow and non overflow events were observed between 36 mm 1 4 in and 66 mm 2 6 in storm depths area between the dashed lines in fig 2 which can be explained by temperature related variability of infiltration rates in different months i e lower infiltration in cold months and higher infiltration in warm months and intensity of storm events ebrahimian et al 2020 overflow was always observed for events with a total depth greater than 66 mm 2 6 in back to back storm events can cause the infiltration trench to be non empty at the beginning of the second event no overflow was observed for the storm events starting with a non empty trench and none of the overflow events were back to back indicating that the occurrence of overflow in this study was not because of back to back storms the better than design performance of the infiltration trench is because of the dynamic processes during and after storm events especially the infiltration during storm events the observed infiltration trench water level recession limbs for different overflow events demonstrated a head water depth in the trench dependency where higher recession rates larger slope of the recession limb occur when the trench is full and lower recession rates occur as the trench empties e g 8 16 fold change for the storm events in fig 3 and table 1 this change in recession rates is due to the head pressure driving the infiltration the head dependency of recession rates higher recession rates in higher water levels is confirmed in other studies such as emerson et al 2010 and lewellyn et al 2016 for infiltration trenches in villanova pa and ahmed and borst 2020 for tree boxes infiltration based gsi including soil media and gravel bed in louisville kentucky the declining slope of the recession limbs indicates that the head dependency of the infiltration rate of water to the surrounding in situ soil should be considered in modeling and design sokolovskaya et al 2021 the difference in the rising limb of the hydrographs in fig 3 relates to storm event characteristics and initial conditions in the infiltration trench a seasonal variation of the recession limb of the trench water level was observed with higher recession rates in warmer months for example the average recession rate average of recession rates at the water levels specified in table 1 for the 7 14 2014 8 13 2013 2 23 2016 and 1 18 2015 events were 116 3 99 9 76 7 and 48 2 mm hr respectively fig 4 infiltration rates that vary with season higher infiltration rates in summer and lower infiltration rates in winter were observed in other studies e g ahmed and borst 2019 emerson et al 2010 lewellyn et al 2016 emerson and traver 2008 braga et al 2007 lin et al 2003 clancy and alba 2011 and cerda 1997 1999 the temperature dependency of infiltration can be explained by a number of temperature induced changes in both soil and water such as a decreased soil water viscosity with increasing temperature lin et al 2003 jaynes 1990 b decreased surface tension due to increased temperature constantz 1982 c soil particles thermal expansion with increasing temperature gao and shao 2015 and d reduced entrapped air with increasing temperature hopmans and dane 1986 these changes result in increased infiltration rate with increasing temperature a comprehensive discussion on the interdependencies of different causes for temporal variation of infiltration in gsi systems can be found in ebrahimian et al 2020 the seasonal variability of infiltration can potentially be incorporated into gsi design 3 2 simulation 3 2 1 event based model the event based model was run with five storm events table 2 the ksat of the surrounding in situ soil drove changes to model results and hence was used as the calibration parameter while the exact overflow duration was achieved in three out of four storm events with overflow in table 2 the best fit for the overflow duration did not result in an acceptable and consistent fit for the time to zero water depth and the curve shape r2 nse and pbias varied between 0 41 0 66 2 75 0 41 and 198 180 respectively examples of the underestimation and overestimation of the time to zero water depth are presented in fig 5 a and 5b for the 9 2 2013 and 1 18 2015 events respectively accurate simulation of trench recession limbs is particularly important because it determines the time to zero water depth different design manuals usually require the gsi to become empty within 2 4 days after a storm event to be ready to capture the next storm event asleson et al 2009 carpenter hallam 2010 hence capturing the time to zero water depth is critically important in design regulatory compliance and resiliency assessment of gsi systems to improve the calibration results in table 2 a virtual outlet eq 3 was added to the model a substantial decrease in the slope of the observed recession limbs was seen at the elevation of about 0 15 m 0 5 ft above the trench bottom for all the storm events figs 3 and 4 and table 1 this indicated that a constant infiltration rate is not able to accurately simulate the recession limb of the hydrograph and consequently the time to zero water depth and extra infiltration needs to be considered when the water level in the infiltration trench is higher than 0 15 m hence the virtual outlet elevation was set at 0 15 m the lack of need for additional infiltration at the depth below 0 15 m could be explained by such factors as differential clogging due to differential compaction and sedimentation emerson et al 2010 or nonhomogeneous soil properties however these factors were not investigated in this paper an analysis about the effect of gsi s geometric shape in head dependency of infiltration can be found in sokolovskaya et al 2021 coefficient a was calibrated together with ksat to result in a good curve fit while requiring that the model produces overflow for all events with observed overflow adding the virtual outlet improved the statistical performance measures for all events in table 2 e g r2 increased from 0 66 to 0 92 nse increased from 0 41 to 0 91 and pbias decreased from 54 to 0 0 for the 9 2 2013 storm event the percent error in overflow duration did increase and may look high 33 to 67 for the model setups resulting in the best curve fit but it is amplified because the observed overflow duration is relatively short for example the 8 13 2013 event with the maximum error of 67 has an observed and simulated overflow duration of 0 83 hr and 1 39 hr respectively the modeled peak depth was 2 5 cm 1 in smaller than the observed peak depth for the 7 15 2015 non overflow event table 2 the results demonstrate an offset between the modeled and observed rising limbs of hydrographs i e the trench fills up faster than what the models simulate for example see fig 5b for the 1 18 2015 event potential reasons are the spatial variation of rainfall rain gauge is 450 m away the model s inability to simulate the complex effects of the inlet sump and perforated distribution pipe or the water level sensor s error the inaccuracies in modeled rising limbs do not have a considerable impact on the goal of this analysis that focuses on runoff reduction and system emptying 3 2 2 continuous model similar to the event based calibration the ksat of the surrounding soil was used as the primary parameter for calibration the constant infiltration through the trench bottom at a rate equal to ksat resulted in overestimated values for time to zero water depth and not capturing the curve shape of the recession limb to address this issue similar to the event based calibrations a virtual outlet eq 3 at 0 15 m above the trench bottom was used to allow for the head dependent component of infiltration the monthly ksat adjustment factors ksat values and the virtual outlet coefficient a all resulting from the monthly calibrations using 25 months of observed data are presented in table 3 two field infiltration tests using a modified borehole percolation testing method falling head test in unlined open boreholes based on pa dep 2006 before construction of the infiltration trench august 20 2009 resulted in stabilized infiltration rates of 12 2 and 4 3 mm hr to compare the ksat values from calibration to the field measured values the ksat values in table 3 need to be multiplied by the stone bed porosity here 0 4 sokolovskaya et al 2021 this shows that the calibrated ksat values in table 3 were within the range observed by field tests while swmm uses ksat in the g a equation rossman and huber 2016 there is an extensive literature for agricultural and natural landscapes recommending the use of effective hydraulic conductivity k e in the g a equation e g risse et al 1995 zhang et al 1995a 1995b kidwell et al 1997 bouwer 1969 considers k e in the g a equation as one half of ksat where ksat is estimated from brutsaert 1967 as a function of effective porosity bubbling pressure and the pore size distribution index risse et al 1995 present three groups of factors related to 1 soil crusting e g porosity and bulk density of the infiltration zone and number of freeze thaw cycles 2 storm events characteristics e g depth duration and peak intensity and 3 antecedent moisture conditions e g rainfall in certain number of preceding days that are significantly correlated to k e in fallow lands and recommend that the g a infiltration parameters should be adjusted for each storm event in continuous simulation models also zhang et al 1995a b adds vegetative cover and canopy conditions to the above factors for cropped lands it should be noted that the variability of k e in the g a method is expected to be more important in large scale modeling applications due to spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties land surface cover and rainfall govindaraju et al 2001 corradini et al 2002 van den putte et al 2013 in contrast to infiltration related research in natural and agricultural systems the existing literature related to infiltration in urban gsi systems is limited a review of causes for temporal and spatial variation of soil hydraulic conductivity in gsi sites is presented by ebrahimian et al 2020 clogging due to the accumulation of fine particles from the catchment in the void spaces of the infiltration trench can negatively impact the performance of infiltration trenches over time however adequate maintenance proper siting that results in reasonable loadings of sediment inflow and appropriate design of infiltration trenches can substantially reduce clogging effects in these systems bergman et al 2011 ebrahimian et al 2020 while some existing studies consider clogging in modeling infiltration trenches e g duchene et al 1994 freni et al 2009 bergman et al 2011 sobotkova et al 2018 clogging is not considered in the proposed approach and is planned for future research groundwater is another factor that can potentially affect soil hydraulic conductivity through changing soil moisture and surface water flux e g evaporation especially in regions with a high groundwater table chen and hu 2004 also groundwater table fluctuations introduce entrapped air into soil pore spaces in the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zone capillary fringe resulting in the variation of hydraulic conductivity over time and depth near the groundwater table faybishenko 1995 marinas et al 2013 it was assumed that groundwater table fluctuations do not affect ksat in this study because the groundwater table is much lower than the infiltration trench bottom 3 6 m vs 1 2 m also the two boring logs in the gsi site and several others in the area did not indicate shallow groundwater as expected in table 3 colder months have a smaller ksat adjustment factor than the warmer months with the maximum and minimum adjustment factors in september 1 00 and february 0 42 respectively the only exception is november with an unexpectedly high adjustment factor of 0 95 the calibration in november was mostly affected by two larger events on november 26 27 2013 and november 19 2015 the daily average temperature during both events was higher than the historic average temperature 8 9 c 48 f vs 6 7 c 44 f for 11 27 2013 and 17 8 c 64 f vs 8 3 c 47 f for 11 19 2015 resulting in higher recession rates and higher calibrated ksat values in the infiltration trench this agrees with the findings of jaynes 1990 and clancy and alba 2011 where they observed variable soil hydraulic conductivity values throughout the day because of diurnal temperature changes it should be noted that while the adjustment factors in this study are explained with temperature soil hydraulic conductivity can also potentially change with other factors such as rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions the significance of factors other than temperature and clogging in temporal variation of soil hydraulic conductivity for gsi modeling should be further investigated in future research using more robust datasets the calibrated monthly models table 4 showed a good performance in fitting the observed data except for march with an r2 nse and pbias of 0 57 0 53 and 0 9 respectively the r2 nse and pbias varied between 0 79 0 94 0 72 0 94 and 36 2 7 1 respectively the lower r2 and nse in march compared with the other calibration months was attributed to the non empty trench because of snow at the beginning of the 3 11 2015 event that was not captured by the model as well as the presence of snowmelt event on 3 21 2015 that was not identified by using the nearby station data fig 6 a the overall r2 nse and pbias values using all calibration data were calculated as 0 87 0 87 and 0 8 which are considered good moriasi et al 2015 alamdari et al 2017 for overflow events the maximum difference in overflow duration was 2 33 hr in january and less than 0 75 hr in other months this can be attributed to the offset associated with the rising limb as mentioned earlier for the event based calibration results peak depth difference observed peak depth minus modeled peak depth was calculated for no overflow events the absolute value of peak depth difference was always less than or equal to 0 11 m larger events were able to match peaks better than the smaller events e g fig 6b for the goal of runoff removal while the smaller events play a role in soil capacity recovery larger events are of most importance to be captured by the model as those are the events that generate overflow to validate the model the 2014 rainfall was applied to the model using the ksat and monthly adjustment factors from table 3 and compared against the observed water level data table 5 while some months such as march april may july and november showed good validation statistics r2 nse and pbias of 0 78 to 0 98 0 78 to 0 98 and 21 0 to 21 2 respectively and a maximum of 3 hr difference between observed and modeled overflow durations other months such as february september and october had poorer fits e g fig 7 a for may vs fig 7b for september this was because some months in the validation year 2014 had only a few and small rainfall events e g september with three events between 3 and 16 mm and october with five events between 9 and 19 mm or were heavily influenced by snowfall e g the only event in february was a snowmelt event that was not detected by the nearby station data longer term observed data is needed to address this issue in addition continuous temperature dependence of ksat e g ksat changes due to diurnal temperature changes jaynes 1990 clancy and alba 2011 is not always captured by discrete monthly adjustment factors because of the presence of colder or warmer than usual days in some months for example while the mean monthly temperature in april 2014 21 7 c was close to that in april 2015 20 c december 2014 was notably colder than december 2015 mean monthly temperature of 11 1 c vs 19 4 c overall the performance measure statistics for a full year of validation 2014 were acceptable r2 0 79 nse 0 79 and pbias 6 2 overflow duration was underpredicted by 29 in the validation year although the difference between observed and modeled overflow durations was relatively small i e 3 3 hr total over the course of 2014 the following assumptions and simplifications that were made during both the event based and continuous simulations could potentially be sources of uncertainty in the results the utilized rain gauge was about 450 m away from the infiltration trench it was assumed that rainfall spatial variation has no effect on modeling results it was assumed that the distribution pipe makes no restriction to the inflow water it was assumed that the measured water level in the observation well is representative of water level in the infiltration trench system it was assumed that overflow from the system occurs when the measured water level in the observation well exceeds the top of stone bed inlet grate elevation it was assumed that the measured water levels by the pressure transducer sensor and rainfall depths by the rain gauge are accurate 3 3 dynamic vs static model a static model was simulated as a baseline to represent the commonly used approach in the regulatory and design contexts where gsi design is only based on the available storage volume surface storage plus void space in the media the static model results were obtained by running all rainfall events through a su model with no infiltration or et during storm events and starting empty at each storm event all rainfall volume exceeding the available storage in the gsi during a storm event becomes runoff in the static model annually the dynamic model was able to adequately simulate the number of observed overflows table 6 the two dynamic model overflow events in 2013 and 2014 that were not observed were either very short 5 min of modeled overflow in 2013 or during an apparent snowmelt february 2014 figs 8 and 9 show observed and modeled duration and modeled volume for overflow events at the infiltration trench the dynamic model matched observed data better than the static model the difference between number of modeled and observed overflow events in the dynamic and static models for the period of december 2012 december 2015 was 15 4 and 184 6 respectively absolute difference of 2 events vs 23 events in table 6 modeled overflow duration for the monitoring period was found 24 7 and 656 8 different than the observed values in the dynamic and static models respectively absolute difference of 6 3 hr vs 168 6 hr in fig 8 4 summary and conclusions to understand the dynamic performance of urban infiltration trench systems and incorporate this understanding into simple modeling approaches that can be used in practical applications an infiltration trench in philadelphia pa was modeled both event based and continuous simulations using sus in swmm 5 1 012 the soil moisture recovery from the previous events may influence the performance of gsi systems modeling analysis based on observations showed that specified initial conditions alter event based simulations and that a continuous simulation captures the initial conditions for all modeled events as future research computed monthly ksat values can be used to compare the results of the utilized modeling approach to those from coupled saturated unsaturated models that work based on the numerical solutions of the richards equation e g casulli 2017 or sophisticated proprietary models e g hydrus 2d simunek et al 1999 the most important conclusions for dynamic modeling and design of infiltration trench systems were to use an appropriate monthly variable ksat value and to consider the head dependency of infiltration to the surrounding in situ soil these were addressed by introducing monthly adjustment factors for ksat and a head dependent component for infiltration in the presented model both of which were determined by calibration other conclusions based on the analysis of observed data and performed simulations in this research include 1 model calibration hinges on the availability and reliability of the observed dataset and the gsi performance goals minimizing overflow is an important goal in cso areas the available observed datasets in this research were rainfall and water level in the infiltration trench therefore two metrics were used for calibration a overall curve fit this results in an accurate simulation of the falling limb of hydrograph that is necessary to capture the time to zero water depth when the system becomes empty is important in soil moisture recovery between storm events and in making the system ready for the next storm event b overflow duration this provides a simple regulatory measure of system performance without requiring difficult to obtain outflow data 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for the surrounding in situ soil drove changes to model results and was used as the calibration parameter 3 the calibrated ksat values showed a reduced ksat in colder months and an increased ksat in warmer months confirming the seasonal temperature dependent variability of field ksat that has been observed in the literature however the effect of factors other than temperature e g rainfall characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions in seasonal variation of ksat and their significance in gsi modeling and design should be investigated in future research 4 the presented monthly adjustment factors for ksat are based on the 25 months of calibration data at the infiltration trench of study and cannot be applied to other infiltration trench systems however the presented methodology can be utilized to investigate a further generalized set of monthly adjustment factors for different conditions using more observed data from the infiltration trench of study and other different infiltration trench systems longer term observed data can improve the accuracy of the results 5 the presented equation for virtual outlets is based on calibration with the observed data from infiltration trench of study and is not formulated in terms of dimensions or physical properties of the gsi longer term monitoring at the study site in addition to monitoring data from more and different types of infiltration trench systems are needed to develop a more generic formulation for virtual

4874,peatlands dominate the landscape 50 of total area in the athabasca oil sands region aosr in northern alberta and as such are susceptible to hydrological disturbance from oil sands mining and exploration in this study we explore the hydrochemical response of a disturbed fen firebag fen in the aosr following the removal of a temporary access road that was operational from 2007 to 2013 prior to road removal flow was impeded at firebag fen evidenced by inundation on the up gradient side and a lower water table on the down gradient side of the road reclamation included the road removal of the 0 5 m thick road including 0 15 m of clay 0 3 m of mud and organics and 0 05 m of gravel which left a surficial depression following removal peat samples n 139 collected immediately following road removal demonstrated significantly greater bulk densities on the down gradient side relative to the up gradient side of the fen and in the road removed area relative to up and down gradient areas these combined changes decreased the average hydraulic conductivity of the fen by 79 which reduced water discharge across the site another peat sampling campaign in 2016 n 48 three years after removal showed a significant decrease in bulk density where the road was removed to within the range of values observed at areas up and down gradient of the road these changes increased the average hydraulic conductivity of the entire system by 64 compared to that which was measured in 2013 with water discharge 9 and 12 higher than in 2013 during characteristically dry and wet periods respectively some changes to the water chemistry n 24 28 for each sampling date of the fen were also detected but patterns were different among parameters measured for example median concentrations on the down gradient side of the road were 1651 no3 280 so4 2 and 135 cl higher relative to the up gradient side of the road over time following road removal differences were reduced to 100 for nitrate 192 for sulphate 108 for chloride while other parameters remained relatively unchanged ca2 mg2 k continued peat rebound thus increasing hydraulic conductivity may occur over time however elucidating this would require long term monitoring it is concluded that despite the impacts that were caused to the site the natural hydrologic regime of the fen was able to operate following removal removal and reclamation should be considered as a worthwhile venture for roads that extend through fens and are no longer in use keywords peatland hydrology oil sands linear disturbance western boreal plain fen reclamation 1 introduction northern peatlands are globally significant ecosystems which serve several ecohydrological functions including carbon sequestration and storage 1 3 of the global soil carbon pool gorham 1991 hosting rich communities of flora and fauna warner and asada 2006 and water conveyance and flood attenuation bullock and acreman 2003 holden 2005 however these systems are vulnerable to a wide range of industrial disturbances e g oil and mineral extraction and peat extraction that have the potential to modify their hydrology thus influencing their ecosystem function turetsky et al 2002 the hydrophysical soil properties within a peat column can be highly variable with depth with trends controlled by pore structure the degree of humification and botanical composition boelter 1969 levesque and dinel 1977 a peat column develops over multiple centuries to millennia with the level of decomposition increasing with depth below surface zoltai and vitt 1990 halsey et al 1998 glaser et al 2004 this slowly alters the pore structure establishing a trend of increasing bulk density ρb and decreasing specific yield sy active porosity na and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with depth below the peat surface cf hoag and price 1997 mccarter et al 2020 these trends can also result in the facilitation of certain autogenic processes that are unique to peatlands for example during dry periods deeper water tables intersect with peat layers with low ksat reducing subsurface water flow across the peatland and limiting water loss bishop 1991 price 2003 mccarter and price 2017 elmes and price 2019 while capillary spaces within the peat continue to facilitate upward unsaturated water flow to the moss capitula hedenäs 2001 in contrast this feedback can result in higher discharge during wetter periods by up to several orders of magnitude when peatland water tables intersect shallower peat layers with higher ksat price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 balliston et al 2018 mccarter and price 2017 elmes and price 2019 this transmissivity feedback thus represents an important water conservation mechanism during periods of low water availability but is also an important water conveyance and drainage mechanism when moisture availability is sufficiently high this is relevant to the productivity of mosses which are nonvascular and rely on specific moisture regimes for photosynthesis and optimal productivity rydin and mcdonald 1985a 1985b rochefort et al 2002 the natural subsurface flow characteristics of a peatland are highly susceptible to modification by human disturbance linear disturbances including roads seismic lines and pipelines are common across the northern boreal regions of canada totaling 600 000 km based on 2008 2010 landsat imagery with roads and seismic lines accounting for 80 of the total disturbance length pasher et al 2013 linear disturbances built through peatlands can alter the hydrophysical properties of the peat typical changes due to clearance with machinery and or placement of non native soil include an increase in ρb and decrease in ksat trombulak and frissell 2000 petrone et al 2008 strack et al 2018 davidson et al 2020 as well as changes in thermal properties williams and quinton 2013 williams et al 2013 such changes can alter subsurface flow pathways along and among peatland systems subsequently changing fluxes of water and nutrients waddington et al 2014 in the athabasca oil sands region aosr of western canada peatlands can occupy more than 50 of the landscape vitt et al 1996 these peatlands provide key drainage routes within the athabasca river watershed accounting for 45 81 of annual streamflow in several tributaries clearwater mackay and ells rivers gibson et al 2016 oil sands development has created a large patchwork of disturbances including but not limited to open pit mining in situ mining processing facilities work camps log piles seismic exploration lines pipelines and access roads winter only temporary and permanent that can alter the hydrology of peatland systems pilon 2015 volik et al 2020 however due to a paucity of data on the topic combined with an incomplete understanding of the variability in the form and function of peatlands in the region the impacts that these artificial features have on subsurface flow are not fully understood elucidating the impacts of these disturbances are critical for predicting the fate of fens in the region and understanding the long term impacts of industry on the larger landscape given that the impacts of disturbances are not necessarily immediate and may occur over longer time scales in response to autogenic feedbacks waddington et al 2014 longer term studies are necessary furthermore peatland reclamation has become a regulatory requirement for private and crown lands in the aosr where companies are required to return lands to a state of equivalent capability environment and parks 2017 therefore studies on the responses of peatlands following the removal of a disturbance are necessary for developing and improving best management practices the purpose of this study is to examine the hydrological hydrophysical and biogeochemical impacts of a temporary access road on a boreal fen following its removal to assess the potential for the recovery of peatlands post disturbance the specific objectives are to 1 characterize and compare peat physical characteristics e g bulk density hydraulic conductivity at up gradient down gradient and beneath the former road immediately following road removal and to characterize changes in peat properties over time following road removal and 2 characterize how the hydrology and water quality of the peatland change over time following road removal these objectives are necessary to determine the footprint of road construction on a fen system beyond the road itself 2 site description the study was conducted on a treed fen firebag fen 57 13 n 110 53 w located within a steam assisted gravity drainage sagd operation located 55 km northeast of fort mcmurray alberta fig 1 a the development recovers deeper bitumen deposits and the operation comprises plant facilities well pads gathering corridors and pipelines and linear access infrastructure linking these operational components the sagd operation is situated within a sub humid climate bothe and abraham 1993 devito et al 2012 where the annual potential evapotranspiration pet often exceeds precipitation p with these typically dry conditions interrupted by infrequent wet periods occurring over a roughly decadal cycle marshall et al 1999 in 2007 a temporary access road was constructed through a fen see appendix b1 within the operation fig 1b to provide access to a well pad the road measured approximately 230 m in length 20 m in width and had an average depth of 0 5 m of construction materials the road was constructed by laying a geotextile liner capped with gravel clay fill over the peat column due to access requirements the road was installed perpendicular to the subsurface flow direction of the fen to facilitate flow across the peatland a drainage culvert was constructed in the northwest corner of the road intersection with no additional cross drainage works implemented prior to the installation of the road other linear disturbances were already present which had altered the boundaries of the fen including two larger roads to the north and south of the fen extending southwest and northwest respectively fig 1a due to the subsequent construction of a bisecting gathering corridor and pipeline the road was unable to provide continued access to the well pad and was no longer needed removal of the road occurred between june 18 and july 4 2013 a total of 0 15 m of clay 0 3 m of mud and organics and 0 05 m of gravel were excavated see appendix b2 3 methodology 3 1 hydrometeorological analyses a meteorological tower was installed within the footprint of the removed road

transects perpendicular to the removed road in the spring of 2013 fig 1b within each transect three wells wells 1 through 3 were located on the up gradient side of the road in an area not directly impacted by ground disturbance hereafter referred to as up gradient one well 4 was located within the footprint of the removed road and three wells wells 5 through 7 were located on the down gradient

each location the thickness of the peat column and depth to underlying mineral substrate was noted the wells were constructed of perforated screened 1 5 inch inner diameter pvc piping water table

conductivity of the peat with values obtained from soil cores sampled from the field and analyzed in the laboratory see below for methodology h m is the hydraulic head change between two wells and l m is the distance separating said well locations the daily average hydraulic gradient dh dl was calculated by taking an arithmetic mean of all gradients measured across the site for a given day to effectively estimate changes in transmissivity between periods of varying water table positions kh was calculated individually for the up gradient removed road and down gradient areas using depth weighted arithmetic means the weighted arithmetic mean is typically used for calculating flux rates for flow parallel to layering freeze and cherry 1979 final kh values for up gradient road removed and down gradient locations were calculated each sampling day using kh data that were averaged by depth using a weighted arithmetic mean the calculation relies on an average water table position for each location for example if the average water table position at the downgradient side of the fen was 15 cm below ground surface kh values measured at 0 10 cm depth were excluded from the calculation and only 5 cm weighting was given to the kh values for 10 20 cm depth once arithmetic means were calculated for each of the three areas a weighted harmonic mean was taken between the three values

the level of disturbance to the road and potential rebound over time and was also used in determining ksat across the site in 2013 kh was only measured on the six cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 using a constant head method freeze and cherry 1979 to estimate kh for peat samples obtained in 2013 we established a function between ρb and kh from the cores obtained in 2016 this approach has been applied in prior studies including liu and lennartz 2019 who compiled 256 peat samples from 15 studies and formed a best fit relationship between measured ρb and ksat for all data and for individual peat types sedge woody sphagnum in this study we fit a function with a sample size of 48 and applied this function to ρb data measured from soil cores obtained from road removed and up and down gradient areas in 2013 data from liu and lennartz 2019 were also obtained and plotted alongside the data from firebag fen to aid in interpreting differences and exploring the necessity for prescribing a unique function explicitly for this dataset 3 3 geochemical sampling water samples were collected from groundwater wells five times throughout the summer of 2013 on 17 june sample size n

and again in 2015 on may 25 and august 18 n 28 for all dates in 2014 and 2015 wells were purged prior to sampling and all water samples were filtered within 24 h using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters samples were stored in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles and kept frozen until analyses all analyses were performed in the biogeochemistry lab at the university of waterloo major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 k were measured with a dionex ics 3000 whereas nh4 no3 and soluble reactive phosphorus srp were determined using colorimetric analyses bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical

species were tested individually for normality with shapiro wilk tests no chemicals were found to be normally distributed to explore potential differences in geochemistry between varying locations data for each chemical were grouped by date and location road removed n 4 upgradient n 12 down gradient n 12 for the first sampling data in june 2013 prior to road removal t tests were performed for each chemical between up gradient and down gradient locations for all other dates kruskal wallace tests were conducted followed by a dunn post hoc test a p value 0 05 was considered to indicate a significant difference 3 4 vegetation surveying in the summers of 2013 year of reclamation and 2015 two years post reclamation vegetation surveys were conducted adjacent to all twenty eight well locations a 1 m2 quadrat was chosen randomly for the survey percent cover of each species including mosses lichens forbs graminoids and shrubs trees was determined visually within each quadrant due to the three dimensional vegetation cover percent cover often exceeded 100 and as a result percent cover of each species was expressed as a relative proportion note that in 2013 surveys were not conducted on well locations within the road removed area as they were composed of bare peat two additional locations located upgradient of the road removed area 1 1 and 2 2 were also not surveyed in 2013 due to localized flooding following a vegetation survey a tree survey was conducted in 2013 noting the species and height of all trees within a 5 m radius of each well location trees were arranged by species and divided into increments of height 4 results 4 1 weather cumulative precipitation measured 297 mm from june 3 sept 30 2013 and 254 mm from may 27 sept 30 2014 cumulative eteq over the same time period in 2013 and 2014 were 205 and 206 mm respectively fig 2 the 30 year 1981 2010 climate normal from the fort mcmurray airport located 70 km sw of firebag fen was 250 mm for the same june sept period environment canada 2019 from june 6 9 2013 the region experienced several large rain events totaling 111 mm with the single largest event on june 9 contributing 47 mm fig 2 this storm event resulted in water table positions above ground surface which required the meteorological station to be decommissioned from june 9 25 2013 in 2014 cumulative precipitation measured 4 mm higher than the 30 year climate normal for the same period fig 2 during 2014 the largest precipitation event 29 mm occurred on may 29 2014 peak daily average summer temperature july 1 30 was 15 4 c fig 2 in 2013 which was 2 c cooler than the 30 year climate normal of 17 1 c for the same time period daily average summer temperatures july 1 30 was 18 3 c in 2014 the cooler temperatures observed in the 2013 growing season were coincident with above average summer precipitation fig 2 4 2 peat characteristics and hydrophysical properties peat thickness generally decreased southwestward across the site fig 3 within the road removed area a depression in the peat profile was observed particularly at transects 2 and 4 fig 3 peat thickness outside of the road removed area averaged 1 03 m and averaged 0 93 m within peat thickness along the road removed area followed a general trend decreasing southeastward from transect 1 t1 4 towards transect 4 t4 4 between t1 4 and t2 4 peat thickness averaged 1 17 m while average peat depth between t3 4 and t4 4 averaged 0 68 m fig 3 laboratory results showed a general trend of increasing ρb with depth at all areas located within and outside of the road removed area fig 4 a for peat cores sampled in 2013 immediately following road removal significantly higher ρb t test p 0 05 was measured for the road removed area compared to up and down gradient areas ρb measured from cores extracted from the road removed area ranged from 0 12 to 0 24 g cm 3 at the peat surface with over 77 of the samples n 17 measuring above 0 15 g cm 3 at the up and down gradient locations 62 of the samples n 122 measured ρb of 0 15 g cm 3 moreover large differences in ρb were measured in cores obtained from up gradient and down gradient locations fig 4a for example at all depths ρb was significantly t test p 0 05 lower at the upgradient side of the fen compared to the road removed area whereas with the downgradient side of the fen only depths 0 5 and 10 20 were significantly lower than those measured at the road removed area between the two areas not directly impacted by ground disturbance the up gradient side had lower average ρb at all depths 1 2 3 2 times lower fig 4a with significant differences t test p 0 05 detected at all depths except for the 0 5 cm interval in 2016 the road removed area demonstrated considerably lower average ρb at all depths relative to values measured in 2013 fig 4a although only the 10 20 cm layer was significantly different ρb values for the 2016 samples were more similar to those measured from samples obtained from the downgradient area of the fen in 2013 fig 4a however ρb values for all depths except 50 60 cm from the road removed area in 2016 remained significantly higher than values measured from the upgradient side of the fen area in 2013 in contrast with the exception of the top 5 cm no significant differences were detected between ρb measured at the road removed area in 2016 and the downgradient area of the fen in 2013 kh measured from peat cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 decreased by two orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 10 6 m s 1 from the surface to the base 70 cm b g s of the peat fig 4 the depth weighted arithmetic mean kh for these cores was 2 8 10 5 m s 1 the samples converted to log kh in cm hr 1 were plotted against ρb alongside results presented in liu and lennartz 2019 fig 5 with best model regression fits r2 reported in table 1 samples obtained from the road removed area at firebag fen in 2016 plotted within the range reported by liu and lennartz 2019 albeit within the upper range of kh for a given value of ρb the best model fit between measured ρb and kh from the road removed area in 2016 is summarized in table 1 this function was used to predict kh for all peat cores obtained in the road removed area in 2013 using available ρb data results exhibited a general decrease in kh with depth in locations sampled in 2013 albeit less uniform at the road removed area fig 4b depth weighted arithmetic mean kh for cores obtained from road removed and up and down gradient sites in 2013 were 8 6 10 6 1 1 10 4 and 2 6 10 5 m s 1 respectively 4 3 hydrology prior to and following road removal there was no quantitative water level or subsurface flow data for firebag fen over the period of time when the road was operational as data collection was initiated during the removal of the road in june 2013 however visual observations made by field personnel reported that the road had interrupted subsurface flow causing inundation and flooding on the up gradient side of the road and lower water levels and dryer conditions on the down gradient side over the 2013 14 study period the general flow direction at firebag fen was from the northeast to the southwest perpendicular to the road position fig 6 b the average site wide hydraulic gradient i over this period ranged between 0 006 and 0 008 locally hydraulic gradients were weakest from up gradient east to the road averaging 0 004 and were strongest from the east to west side of the road 0 009 and from the road to the down gradient west side of the fen 0 008 water levels were slightly higher within the southern portion of the fen compared to the north generating a lower hydraulic gradient parallel to the road towards the culvert refer to fig 1 and averaging 0 004 average water table positions at firebag fen were similar in 2013 and 2014 3 0 cm b g s refer to fig 6a and 7 water levels within the up gradient areas remained near or above the ground surface for most of the study period see fig 6a with relatively low variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 06 m for logged wells in contrast water levels within the west portion down gradient remained well below the ground surface for all of the 2013 and 2014 study period with values 14 and 19 5 cm lower on average than up gradient and road removed areas respectively fig 6a and with greater variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 13 m for logged wells along the road removed area water levels averaged 4 7 cm above ground surface a g s remained above for the majority of the study period fig 6a and had the least water table variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 04 m for logged wells of the three sites post road removal flow calculations across the peatland were made during relatively wet and dry conditions in 2013 and 2014 respectively and in 2016 three years after road removal additional information is summarized in table 2 including kh and transmissivity values as well as hydraulic gradients which were similar to those reported in 2013 and 2014 on july 30 2013 wet and august 09 2014 dry specific discharge was 11 and 7 mm d 1 respectively two years following in 2016 on july 11 2016 wet and august 25 dry specific discharge was 12 and 8 mm d 1 respectively 4 4 water chemistry over the 2013 sampling period ph levels averaged 4 88 and electrical conductivity averaged 93 7 μs cm 1 in june 2013 prior to removal and immediately following removal down gradient locations were characterized by higher nutrients srp no3 nh4 and so4 2 and inorganic ions cl ca2 mg2 k and na with significant differences detected for no3 so4 2 and cl excluding july 30 for cl fig 8 relative to up gradient locations road removed areas in 2013 were characterized by higher inorganic ions srp and nh4 indeed when compared to road removed areas up gradient locations displayed more significant differences in concentrations of variables relative to down gradient locations fig 8 later in the season august and october and in subsequent years 2014 and 2015 the differences in srp and no3 were less apparent between the three location groups as evidenced by the statistics and values of srp no3 and nh4 generally decreased over time fig 8 concentrations of so4 2 remained variable across the study period however significant differences were only detected in 2013 in contrast the differences in inorganic ions between locations persisted into 2015 with no apparent trends of decreasing concentrations at the site fig 8 4 5 vegetation across the study site the dominant tree cover includes picea mariana black spruce larix laricina tamarack and betula papyifera paper birch along with patches of other betula and salix willow species ericaceous species such as labrador tea rhododendron groenlandicum leather leaf chamaedaphne calyculata small cranberry oxycoccus microcarpus and cloudberry rubus chamaemorus dominate the shrub profile throughout the study site as is characteristic of boreal peatlands sphagnum mosses are the dominant peat forming genus onsite the complete vegetation surveys can be found in appendices a1 and a2 spatial disparities in vegetation communities were observed between up and down gradient sides of the road vegetation survey results from 2013 appendix a1 indicate that the southwest down gradient side of the road was characterized by a higher abundance of p mariana black spruce and l laricina tamarack mean tree density 32 per 100 m2 relative to the northeast up gradient side of the road mean tree density 11 per 100 m2 in addition the down gradient side of the road had a less abundant understory of c calyculata leatherleaf and sedge species such as e angustifolium common cottongrass relative to the upgradient side of the road while r groenlandicum was present on the upgradient side of the road mean 7 it was less abundant relative to the downgradient side of the road mean 21 as there was no vegetation establishment immediately following road removal the road was not surveyed for vegetation in 2013 by 2015 vascular vegetation primarily carex spp had begun to establish however large portions of the road remained bare while clusters of vegetation had begun to develop these clusters were most established up to 90 coverage in the southeast t4 4 and t3 4 and declined to 70 coverage in the northwest t1 4 appendix a2 the areas of highest coverage are coincident with areas that experienced less persistent flood conditions it is important to note that while the water table was not always at or above the surface in these locations it was always near the surface 5 discussion 5 1 climatic context for the period at which the bulk of hydrological monitoring was conducted 2013 and 2014 both years experienced below average total annual precipitation compared to the 1981 2010 climate normal both falling within the bottom 30th percentile therefore the removal of the road and subsequent monitoring was conducted in a hydrological period that is typical of the sub humid regional climate 5 2 road induced changes to the ecology and hydrology of firebag fen during the six years in which the road was operational 2007 2013 differing water table positions and variability figs 6a 7 likely contributed to the establishment of contrasting indicator species upgradient and downgradient the downgradient side of the fen was characterized by a higher abundance of trees black spruce and tamarack and shrubs labrador tea these findings are consistent with peatlands that have experienced drainage lohila et al 2011 munir et al 2014 the denser tree and shrub canopy results in a more shaded ground surface relative to the upgradient side of the fen which may also explain the less abundant sedge species e g e angustifolium observed on the downgradient side of the fen as suboptimal light levels can suppress sedge species limpens et al 2014 such differences in woody cover can also reduce radiation transmission air and soil temperature and wind speed all of which can influence the ratio of p to evapotranspiration et kettridge et al 2013 by 2015 vascular vegetation had begun to establish in the road removed area since this recovery was still in its early phases large portions of the road removed site remained bare where vegetation was present the dominant species were c aquatilus 44 78 of total vegetation at road removed locations and salix spp 6 24 of total vegetation at road removed locationsat this represents a noticeable shift in communities establishing on the road removed area relative to community composition in areas not directly affected by ground disturbance where these species are present but considerably less dominant such disparities in vegetation over short distances are promoted by persistently inundated conditions observed over the road which favour flood tolerant plant species borkenhagen et al 2018 following the removal of the road in june 2013 the underlying peat surface was depressed fig 3 in this area ρb was significantly higher than up and down gradient areas at all depths fig 4a showing evidence of compression of the peat compression can induce permanent changes to the hydrophysical properties of the peat including its hydraulic conductivity silins and rothwell 1998 peat soils are capable of compressing and swelling i e mire breathing lindsay 2010 price 2003 over a growing season in response to changes in water table position as moisture content and thus porewater pressure decreases within a volume of peat the effective stress acting on the peat volume increases this is caused by the weight of the overlying material which transfers to the underlying peat volume and results in compression since the water pressure no longer counteracts the downwards force of the overlying peat caron et al 2015 kennedy and price 2005 price 2003 price schlotzhauer 1999 a proportion of this volume change is reversible however when consolidation exceeds the material pre consolidation pressure volume changes are not entirely reversible kennedy and price 2005 such changes have been noted in peatlands that experience large drops in water table position over long time periods i e drainage silins and rothwell 1998 lang 2002 kennedy and price 2004 hooijer et al 2012 pronger et al 2014 and in the event of mechanical compression at the field and laboratory scale gauthier et al 2018 gauthier 2019 it is however unclear as to the proportion of reversible and irreversible consolidation that had occurred in the road removed area investigations into the relationship between ρb and kh from cores obtained at firebag fen in 2016 provided a means of predicting kh for peat cores previously obtained at the site in 2013 fig 5 table 1 a linear regression between ρb and log kh from samples obtained in 2016 yielded a strong relationship r2 0 71 relative to the majority of functions reported by liu and lennartz 2019 samples from firebag fen plotted within the global range reported by liu and lennartz 2019 however they were within the higher range of log kh for a given ρb value fig 5 here we argue that these differences highlighted the need for prescribing a unique function for predicting kh at firebag fen rather than using those that were previously developed we do however acknowledge that our function was formed on disturbed peat only and this relationship was therefore derived from peat that has a high ρb relative to peat located up and down gradient fig 4a therefore the linear fit may not estimate kh for low ρb near surface peat within the same degree of certainty soil cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 three years post removal showed lower average ρb and thus higher kh at all measured depths compared to cores from 2013 fig 4 showing a 223 increase in transmissivity in this area significant differences in ρb were only detected at depth interval 10 20 cm however this may have been due to the low sample size n 4 obtained at the removed road in 2013 in addition the road was removed in a typical dry year relative to the 30 yr mean for annual p and was subsequently followed by drought conditions in late summer 2015 to early spring 2016 elmes et al 2018 it is likely that higher pore water pressures during wetter periods will reverse a proportion of the consolidation and it may require a complete decadal climate cycle to elucidate the full extent of rebound marshall et al 1999 down gradient locations had significantly higher bulk density and lower kh at all measured peat depths fig 4a with transmissivity of the peat column 76 lower than the up gradient locations this may be explained by impeded flow that was observed during the period when the road was operational lower water tables down gradient of the road prior to road removal that reduce porewater pressures promote peat consolidation wösten et al 1997 this combined with enhanced decomposition from peat oxidation further degrades the peat structure clymo 1983 compression increases ρb price and schlotzhauer 1999 and decreases kh brandyk et al 2002 price 2003 conversely up gradient of the road higher water tables and porewater pressures that causes swelling of the peat volume reduce ρb and increase kh the results presented here suggest that the relatively short period of time over which the road was operational 6 years was sufficient to establish differences in the hydrophysical properties of peat up gradient and down gradient of the road in addition to that beneath the road these changes were detected over a similar time period by silins and rothwell 1998 who measured a 71 decrease in ksat of near surface peat within seven years of drainage at a forested peatland in alberta the changes detected at firebag fen were also likely exacerbated by the road orientation fig 1b the perpendicular orientation of the road inhibited subsurface flow despite facilitation efforts from a culvert in the northwest portion of the road in contrast saraswati et al 2020 found minimal impediment of flow across a peatland due to a road that was built parallel to the direction of flow it is worth noting that additional linear disturbances were present prior to 2007 which may present difficulties in isolating changes solely attributed to the road that was removed in 2013 for example two larger roads were already in place which had likely altered the boundaries of the fen thus influencing the hydrology these roads extended northwest and southwest respectively reducing the width of firebag fen to 80 m on the down gradient side of the fen beyond the boundaries of the monitoring network for this study such disturbances reduced the cross sectional area of the saturated layer perpendicular to the direction of flow thus likely increasing the hydraulic gradient and specific discharge to accommodate the requisite flow rate however given that lower water tables were observed on the down gradient side of the road it is therefore likely that the changes detected in this study were indeed from the removed road 5 3 changes to the hydrology of firebag fen following road removal hydraulic gradients across the peatland averaged 0 007 between 2013 and 2014 considerably large relative to other fens studied throughout the wbp for example elmes and price 2019 measured an average hydraulic gradient of 0 003 at a moderate rich treed fen from 2011 2015 wells et al 2017 measured an average hydraulic gradient of 0 002 at a poor fen in the stony mountain uplands from 2011 to 2015 the hydraulic gradients measured at firebag fen were more similar to those measured at a saline fen 0 004 0 007 wells and price 2015a situated at the terminus of the cretaceous grand rapids formation 20 km south of fort mcmurray wells and price 2015b indeed gradients were lowest in the up gradient area of firebag fen and highest near the removed road suggesting that despite its removal the road removed area and associated changes to its physical properties still have a measurable effect on the subsurface flow regime at the site level subsurface water fluxes across the fen varied considerably between characteristically wet and dry periods in 2013 2014 and 2016 with fluxes 49 82 higher during wetter periods this was primarily due to the increase in transmissivity where a high water table position exploits the much higher kh of the upper peat layers see fig 4b furthermore lower mean kh at the road removed site by two orders of magnitude and down gradient of the road removed site by an order of magnitude relative to the up gradient side of the road reduced the bulk transmissivity of the peat at firebag fen assuming pre disturbance transmissivity was equal to the up gradient weighted mean kh 1 1 10 4 m s 1 and a fully saturated peat column at all locations changes to the road and down gradient side of the fen reduced the transmissivity of the system to 2 9 10 5 m s 1 reducing it by 279 in 2016 subsurface water discharge estimated at firebag fen on a characteristically wet july day was 12 greater than that estimated for july 2013 table 2 reductions in ρb and thus the increases in kh at the road over this time fig 4b promoted a higher water flux we postulate a gradual return towards pre disturbance hydrological conditions including a decrease in flooding in response to peat rebound we cannot however determine the extent of this return without estimations of reversible and irreversible consolidation of the disturbed peat 5 4 implications of geochemical enrichment on firebag fen poor fens in the aosr are generally low in dissolved ions and comprise vegetation that is adapted to such environments e g sphagnum mosses vitt and chee 1990 roads can change the hydrological regime of a wetland by creating a barrier to surface and or groundwater flow thus modify the hydrochemical processes and consequently the system ecohydrology turchenek 1990 clymo and hayward 1982 turetsky and st louis 2006 due to the placement of road fill firebag fen experienced an enrichment of major cations na ca2 and k and anions no3 and so4 2 and srp in road removed and or down gradient locations fig 8 furthermore ion concentrations may also be elevated due to the use of road stabilizers or dust prevention cacl during road maintenance it is plausible that some of the ions from the road were transported hydrologically from the road to the down gradient side notably there were elevated concentrations of no3 nh4 and so4 2 at the down gradient side relative to the up gradient side of the road fig 8 which coincided with wetter conditions on the up gradient side of the road and drier conditions on the down gradient side of the road fig 6 wetter conditions on the up gradient side of the road would have more anaerobic conditions leading to lower redox potential and a greater reduction of no3 and so4 2 rückauf et al 2004 in contrast impeded flow across the peatland and subsequent water table drawdown on the down gradient side of the road would have led to drier conditions with greater redox potential thereby inhibiting the reduction of no3 and so4 2 and possibly increasing the mineralization of the organic matter macrae et al 2013 the release of previously retained so4 2 has also been noted for peatlands that have undergone water table decline wieder 1985 bayley et al 1986 and increases in net mineralization of n have been shown in peatlands that have undergone drying macrae et al 2013 although these differences were apparent prior to road removal and immediately following removal these differences were dampened over time and differences between the up and down gradient sides of the road became less apparent these gradual shifts in concentrations of nitrogen and so4 2 between 2013 and 2015 coincide with our hydrological results that demonstrate that differences in moisture conditions also became less apparent over time post road removal indeed an increase in subsurface flow across firebag fen would raise the water table in the down gradient side of the fen thus reducing its redox potential and also making conditions less favourable for mineralization on the up gradient side with water flow less impeded water tables declined likely increasing the redox potential of the peat and lessening the likelihood that the nitrogen would be reduced however the lack of reduction in so4 2 concentrations across the three year record suggests that redox potential has not been modified sufficiently to allow for efficient so4 2 reduction given that the overburden was recovered and removed in 2013 further enrichment of peat porewaters is not expected and it was hypothesized that the site would experience a dilution effect over time however at the road removed and down gradient locations in the firebag fen a dilution of na ca2 and k was not observed by august 2014 and differences in these ions between the up and down gradient sides of the road persisted it is presumed that insufficient flushing had occurred by 2014 however the steady decline in average cl concentrations in road removed and up gradient locations from summer 2013 to august 2015 is consistent with our hydrological data indicating dilution consequently due to a lack of cation data in 2015 and no water chemistry data in 2016 we are unable to provide an estimate for how long it will take for ion concentrations to return to pre road concentrations the fact that biologically mediated water quality parameters such as srp no3 and nh4 became more consistent between the sides of the road over time is promising this combined with the observed reduction in cl concentrations two years post removal and peat rebound three years post removal suggests that removal efforts can eventually restore the hydrology and water chemistry at the site to pre disturbance levels however the full extent of restoration potential will depend on the potential for peat rebound on the road removed area and eventual flushing of the down gradient side of the fen which is still unknown at this time 5 5 recommendations for monitoring and reclamation there has been recent acknowledgement regarding the necessity for long term monitoring of fen peatlands in the aosr wells and price 2015b volik et al 2020 such monitoring efforts focus on understanding the variability in fen hydrology in the region and how these systems respond to disturbance the results presented in this study highlight how the impacts from linear disturbances might not necessarily be immediate and may operate on daily and seasonal time scales e g interruption of flow and water table decline but can also operate on annual and decadal time scales e g peat oxidation secondary compression and decomposition monitoring efforts should therefore focus on the progression of disturbance related impacts on fen systems over multiple time scales following usage oil sands mining companies are required to reclaim disturbed lands to a state of equivalent land capability with this regulatory requirement extending to well sites pipelines access roads and associated facilities environment and parks 2017 the results presented in this study suggest that road removal can be a useful means of establishing pre disturbance conditions at fens with minimal intervention when left alone disturbed and compressed peat will rebound to a certain albeit unknown degree road reclamation therefore presents an opportunity for enhancing flow across peatlands further restoring their roles in the aosr as conveyors of fresh water to the athabasca river and its tributaries 6 conclusions the relatively short period of time over which the road was operational at firebag fen 2007 2013 was sufficient to cause physical hydrological and geochemical changes to the fen at the site level the placement of road overburden and usage by heavy machinery between 2007 and 2013 not only changed the hydrophysical properties of the underlying peat but also influenced the hydrology of the site enough to cause changes to the properties of the peat and vegetation composition of the down gradient side of the road repeated sampling of the hydrophysical properties of the peat three years after the removal of the road suggest that some rebound of the peat has occurred this when combined with less pronounced surface flooding and higher subsurface water discharge across the fen during wet periods suggests a return to more natural hydrological conditions as peat may continue to rebound to an equilibrium point beyond that which was observed in three years post removal hydraulic gradients may continue to decrease and standing water conditions may therefore become even less frequent this study has also shown that the road influenced the water chemistry of the fen within close proximity to the road removed area and on up gradient and down gradient locations both biologically mediated i e nutrients and hydrologically mediated i e inorganic ions biogeochemical parameters were greater on the down gradient side of the road at the time of road removal over time differences in nutrients between the up and down gradient sides of the road became less apparent whereas the differences in inorganic ion concentrations persisted this suggests that the peatland is returning to pre disturbance conditions but has not yet achieved this providing that the hydrology is restored it is anticipated that the altered geochemical regime will likely be temporary the removal of the road at firebag fen preceded a dry period of the 10 year western boreal plain climate cycle the rebound of the road might have occurred sooner had it been removed during a wetter period of the climate cycle continued monitoring as well as additional studies on other removed roads in the region will help in elucidating the full potential for recovery of reclaimed road disturbed fens 7 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this

4874,peatlands dominate the landscape 50 of total area in the athabasca oil sands region aosr in northern alberta and as such are susceptible to hydrological disturbance from oil sands mining and exploration in this study we explore the hydrochemical response of a disturbed fen firebag fen in the aosr following the removal of a temporary access road that was operational from 2007 to 2013 prior to road removal flow was impeded at firebag fen evidenced by inundation on the up gradient side and a lower water table on the down gradient side of the road reclamation included the road removal of the 0 5 m thick road including 0 15 m of clay 0 3 m of mud and organics and 0 05 m of gravel which left a surficial depression following removal peat samples n 139 collected immediately following road removal demonstrated significantly greater bulk densities on the down gradient side relative to the up gradient side of the fen and in the road removed area relative to up and down gradient areas these combined changes decreased the average hydraulic conductivity of the fen by 79 which reduced water discharge across the site another peat sampling campaign in 2016 n 48 three years after removal showed a significant decrease in bulk density where the road was removed to within the range of values observed at areas up and down gradient of the road these changes increased the average hydraulic conductivity of the entire system by 64 compared to that which was measured in 2013 with water discharge 9 and 12 higher than in 2013 during characteristically dry and wet periods respectively some changes to the water chemistry n 24 28 for each sampling date of the fen were also detected but patterns were different among parameters measured for example median concentrations on the down gradient side of the road were 1651 no3 280 so4 2 and 135 cl higher relative to the up gradient side of the road over time following road removal differences were reduced to 100 for nitrate 192 for sulphate 108 for chloride while other parameters remained relatively unchanged ca2 mg2 k continued peat rebound thus increasing hydraulic conductivity may occur over time however elucidating this would require long term monitoring it is concluded that despite the impacts that were caused to the site the natural hydrologic regime of the fen was able to operate following removal removal and reclamation should be considered as a worthwhile venture for roads that extend through fens and are no longer in use keywords peatland hydrology oil sands linear disturbance western boreal plain fen reclamation 1 introduction northern peatlands are globally significant ecosystems which serve several ecohydrological functions including carbon sequestration and storage 1 3 of the global soil carbon pool gorham 1991 hosting rich communities of flora and fauna warner and asada 2006 and water conveyance and flood attenuation bullock and acreman 2003 holden 2005 however these systems are vulnerable to a wide range of industrial disturbances e g oil and mineral extraction and peat extraction that have the potential to modify their hydrology thus influencing their ecosystem function turetsky et al 2002 the hydrophysical soil properties within a peat column can be highly variable with depth with trends controlled by pore structure the degree of humification and botanical composition boelter 1969 levesque and dinel 1977 a peat column develops over multiple centuries to millennia with the level of decomposition increasing with depth below surface zoltai and vitt 1990 halsey et al 1998 glaser et al 2004 this slowly alters the pore structure establishing a trend of increasing bulk density ρb and decreasing specific yield sy active porosity na and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with depth below the peat surface cf hoag and price 1997 mccarter et al 2020 these trends can also result in the facilitation of certain autogenic processes that are unique to peatlands for example during dry periods deeper water tables intersect with peat layers with low ksat reducing subsurface water flow across the peatland and limiting water loss bishop 1991 price 2003 mccarter and price 2017 elmes and price 2019 while capillary spaces within the peat continue to facilitate upward unsaturated water flow to the moss capitula hedenäs 2001 in contrast this feedback can result in higher discharge during wetter periods by up to several orders of magnitude when peatland water tables intersect shallower peat layers with higher ksat price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 balliston et al 2018 mccarter and price 2017 elmes and price 2019 this transmissivity feedback thus represents an important water conservation mechanism during periods of low water availability but is also an important water conveyance and drainage mechanism when moisture availability is sufficiently high this is relevant to the productivity of mosses which are nonvascular and rely on specific moisture regimes for photosynthesis and optimal productivity rydin and mcdonald 1985a 1985b rochefort et al 2002 the natural subsurface flow characteristics of a peatland are highly susceptible to modification by human disturbance linear disturbances including roads seismic lines and pipelines are common across the northern boreal regions of canada totaling 600 000 km based on 2008 2010 landsat imagery with roads and seismic lines accounting for 80 of the total disturbance length pasher et al 2013 linear disturbances built through peatlands can alter the hydrophysical properties of the peat typical changes due to clearance with machinery and or placement of non native soil include an increase in ρb and decrease in ksat trombulak and frissell 2000 petrone et al 2008 strack et al 2018 davidson et al 2020 as well as changes in thermal properties williams and quinton 2013 williams et al 2013 such changes can alter subsurface flow pathways along and among peatland systems subsequently changing fluxes of water and nutrients waddington et al 2014 in the athabasca oil sands region aosr of western canada peatlands can occupy more than 50 of the landscape vitt et al 1996 these peatlands provide key drainage routes within the athabasca river watershed accounting for 45 81 of annual streamflow in several tributaries clearwater mackay and ells rivers gibson et al 2016 oil sands development has created a large patchwork of disturbances including but not limited to open pit mining in situ mining processing facilities work camps log piles seismic exploration lines pipelines and access roads winter only temporary and permanent that can alter the hydrology of peatland systems pilon 2015 volik et al 2020 however due to a paucity of data on the topic combined with an incomplete understanding of the variability in the form and function of peatlands in the region the impacts that these artificial features have on subsurface flow are not fully understood elucidating the impacts of these disturbances are critical for predicting the fate of fens in the region and understanding the long term impacts of industry on the larger landscape given that the impacts of disturbances are not necessarily immediate and may occur over longer time scales in response to autogenic feedbacks waddington et al 2014 longer term studies are necessary furthermore peatland reclamation has become a regulatory requirement for private and crown lands in the aosr where companies are required to return lands to a state of equivalent capability environment and parks 2017 therefore studies on the responses of peatlands following the removal of a disturbance are necessary for developing and improving best management practices the purpose of this study is to examine the hydrological hydrophysical and biogeochemical impacts of a temporary access road on a boreal fen following its removal to assess the potential for the recovery of peatlands post disturbance the specific objectives are to 1 characterize and compare peat physical characteristics e g bulk density hydraulic conductivity at up gradient down gradient and beneath the former road immediately following road removal and to characterize changes in peat properties over time following road removal and 2 characterize how the hydrology and water quality of the peatland change over time following road removal these objectives are necessary to determine the footprint of road construction on a fen system beyond the road itself 2 site description the study was conducted on a treed fen firebag fen 57 13 n 110 53 w located within a steam assisted gravity drainage sagd operation located 55 km northeast of fort mcmurray alberta fig 1 a the development recovers deeper bitumen deposits and the operation comprises plant facilities well pads gathering corridors and pipelines and linear access infrastructure linking these operational components the sagd operation is situated within a sub humid climate bothe and abraham 1993 devito et al 2012 where the annual potential evapotranspiration pet often exceeds precipitation p with these typically dry conditions interrupted by infrequent wet periods occurring over a roughly decadal cycle marshall et al 1999 in 2007 a temporary access road was constructed through a fen see appendix b1 within the operation fig 1b to provide access to a well pad the road measured approximately 230 m in length 20 m in width and had an average depth of 0 5 m of construction materials the road was constructed by laying a geotextile liner capped with gravel clay fill over the peat column due to access requirements the road was installed perpendicular to the subsurface flow direction of the fen to facilitate flow across the peatland a drainage culvert was constructed in the northwest corner of the road intersection with no additional cross drainage works implemented prior to the installation of the road other linear disturbances were already present which had altered the boundaries of the fen including two larger roads to the north and south of the fen extending southwest and northwest respectively fig 1a due to the subsequent construction of a bisecting gathering corridor and pipeline the road was unable to provide continued access to the well pad and was no longer needed removal of the road occurred between june 18 and july 4 2013 a total of 0 15 m of clay 0 3 m of mud and organics and 0 05 m of gravel were excavated see appendix b2 3 methodology 3 1 hydrometeorological analyses a meteorological tower was installed within the footprint of the removed road

vapour pressure curve γ pa k 1 is the psychrometric constant q w m 2 is net radiation and qg w m 2 is the soil heat flux twenty eight shallow groundwater wells were installed along four primary transects perpendicular to the removed road in the spring of 2013 fig 1b within each transect three wells wells 1 through 3 were located on the up gradient side of the road in an area not directly impacted by ground disturbance hereafter referred to as up gradient one well 4 was located within the footprint of the removed road and three wells wells 5 through 7 were located on the down gradient side in an area not directly impacted by ground disturbance hereafter referred to as down gradient fig 1 well depths ranged between 1 and 2 5 m b g s depending on peat thickness during installation at each location the thickness of the peat column and depth to underlying mineral substrate was noted the wells were constructed of perforated screened 1 5 inch inner diameter pvc piping water table measurements were made four times throughout the summer of 2013 and five times throughout the summer of 2014 within a subset of monitoring wells fig 1b continuous measurements of water table position were logged using data loggers onset hobo u20 set to collect the depth to water table at 30 minute intervals throughout 2013 2014 and 2016 the absolute elevation of the water table meters above sea level masl was calculated by applying the absolute elevations of the ground at each monitoring well taken using a dgps leica geosystems viva gs14 gnss rtk gps system to the depth to water table measurements lateral groundwater flow through the fen was calculated using darcy s law freeze and cherry 1979 2 q k h dh dl where q m s 1 is the specific discharge which is the volumetric discharge q

conductivity of the peat with values obtained from soil cores sampled from the field and analyzed in the laboratory see below for methodology h m is the hydraulic head change between two wells and l m is the distance separating said well locations the daily average hydraulic gradient dh dl was calculated by taking an arithmetic mean of all gradients measured across the site for a given day to effectively estimate changes in transmissivity between periods of varying water table positions kh was calculated individually for the up gradient removed road and down gradient areas using depth weighted arithmetic means the weighted arithmetic mean is typically used for calculating flux rates for flow parallel to layering freeze and cherry 1979 final kh values for up gradient road removed and down gradient locations were calculated each sampling day using kh data that were averaged by depth using a weighted arithmetic mean the calculation relies on an average water table position for each location for example if the average water table position at the downgradient side of the fen was 15 cm below ground surface kh values measured at 0 10 cm depth were excluded from the calculation and only 5 cm weighting was given to the kh values for 10 20 cm depth once arithmetic means were calculated for each of the three areas a weighted harmonic mean was taken between the three values based on proportional cover upgradient 59 removed road 15 downgradient 26 to obtain a spatially averaged kh value for the entire site 3 2 soil core sampling and processing soil cores were extracted at all well locations in the summer of 2013 year of road removal n 28 using a wardenaar peat coring device eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek the netherlands cores were subdivided into 10 cm stratigraphic intervals yielding 139 samples total frozen and delivered to the laboratory for processing at the university of waterloo strategically targeted coring was also conducted in the autumn of 2016 n 6 yielding 48 samples total to provide additional detail on potential peat rebound along the removed road in all years soil cores ranged from 0 45 m to 1 0 m in length depending on the depth to mineral at each respective location dry bulk density ρb was determined using standard laboratory methods freeze and cherry 1979 3 ρ b dry m a s s g sample v o l u m e cm 3 ρb served as a proxy for determining the level of disturbance to the road and potential rebound over time and was also used in determining ksat across the site in 2013 kh was only measured on the six cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 using a constant head method freeze and cherry 1979 to estimate kh for peat samples obtained in 2013 we established a function between ρb and kh from the cores obtained in 2016 this approach has been applied in prior studies including liu and lennartz 2019 who compiled 256 peat samples from 15 studies and formed a best fit relationship between measured ρb and ksat for all data and for individual peat types sedge woody sphagnum in this study we fit a function with a sample size of 48 and applied this function to ρb data measured from soil cores obtained from road removed and up and down gradient areas in 2013 data from liu and lennartz 2019 were also obtained and plotted alongside the data from firebag fen to aid in interpreting differences and exploring the necessity for prescribing a unique function explicitly for this dataset 3 3 geochemical sampling water samples were collected from groundwater wells five times throughout the summer of 2013 on 17 june sample size n 24 30 july n 28 8 august n 28 17 august n 28 and 29 october n 28 with the first of those times june 17 occurring prior to the removal of the road sampling was repeated in 2014 on may 31 and august 01 and again in 2015 on may 25 and august 18 n 28 for all dates in 2014 and 2015 wells were purged prior to sampling and all water samples were filtered within 24 h using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters samples were stored in 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles and kept frozen until analyses all analyses were performed in the biogeochemistry lab at the university of waterloo major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 k were measured with a dionex ics 3000 whereas nh4 no3 and soluble reactive phosphorus srp were determined using colorimetric analyses bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical seattle usa g 102 93 nh4 g 109 94 no3 g 103 9 3 srp ca2 and na were not measured on may 31 2014 and only anions and srp were measured in 2015 excluding so4 2 and cl on july 09 all ion and nutrient species were tested individually for normality with shapiro wilk tests no chemicals were found to be normally distributed to explore potential differences in geochemistry between varying locations data for each chemical were grouped by date and location road removed n 4 upgradient n 12 down gradient n 12 for the first sampling data in june 2013 prior to road removal t tests were performed for each chemical between up gradient and down gradient locations for all other dates kruskal wallace tests were conducted followed by a dunn post hoc test a p value 0 05 was considered to indicate a significant difference 3 4 vegetation surveying in the summers of 2013 year of reclamation and 2015 two years post reclamation vegetation surveys were conducted adjacent to all twenty eight well locations a 1 m2 quadrat was chosen randomly for the survey percent cover of each species including mosses lichens forbs graminoids and shrubs trees was determined visually within each quadrant due to the three dimensional vegetation cover percent cover often exceeded 100 and as a result percent cover of each species was expressed as a relative proportion note that in 2013 surveys were not conducted on well locations within the road removed area as they were composed of bare peat two additional locations located upgradient of the road removed area 1 1 and 2 2 were also not surveyed in 2013 due to localized flooding following a vegetation survey a tree survey was conducted in 2013 noting the species and height of all trees within a 5 m radius of each well location trees were arranged by species and divided into increments of height 4 results 4 1 weather cumulative precipitation measured 297 mm from june 3 sept 30 2013 and 254 mm from may 27 sept 30 2014 cumulative eteq over the same time period in 2013 and 2014 were 205 and 206 mm respectively fig 2 the 30 year 1981 2010 climate normal from the fort mcmurray airport located 70 km sw of firebag fen was 250 mm for the same june sept period environment canada 2019 from june 6 9 2013 the region experienced several large rain events totaling 111 mm with the single largest event on june 9 contributing 47 mm fig 2 this storm event resulted in water table positions above ground surface which required the meteorological station to be decommissioned from june 9 25 2013 in 2014 cumulative precipitation measured 4 mm higher than the 30 year climate normal for the same period fig 2 during 2014 the largest precipitation event 29 mm occurred on may 29 2014 peak daily average summer temperature july 1 30 was 15 4 c fig 2 in 2013 which was 2 c cooler than the 30 year climate normal of 17 1 c for the same time period daily average summer temperatures july 1 30 was 18 3 c in 2014 the cooler temperatures observed in the 2013 growing season were coincident with above average summer precipitation fig 2 4 2 peat characteristics and hydrophysical properties peat thickness generally decreased southwestward across the site fig 3 within the road removed area a depression in the peat profile was observed particularly at transects 2 and 4 fig 3 peat thickness outside of the road removed area averaged 1 03 m and averaged 0 93 m within peat thickness along the road removed area followed a general trend decreasing southeastward from transect 1 t1 4 towards transect 4 t4 4 between t1 4 and t2 4 peat thickness averaged 1 17 m while average peat depth between t3 4 and t4 4 averaged 0 68 m fig 3 laboratory results showed a general trend of increasing ρb with depth at all areas located within and outside of the road removed area fig 4 a for peat cores sampled in 2013 immediately following road removal significantly higher ρb t test p 0 05 was measured for the road removed area compared to up and down gradient areas ρb measured from cores extracted from the road removed area ranged from 0 12 to 0 24 g cm 3 at the peat surface with over 77 of the samples n 17 measuring above 0 15 g cm 3 at the up and down gradient locations 62 of the samples n 122 measured ρb of 0 15 g cm 3 moreover large differences in ρb were measured in cores obtained from up gradient and down gradient locations fig 4a for example at all depths ρb was significantly t test p 0 05 lower at the upgradient side of the fen compared to the road removed area whereas with the downgradient side of the fen only depths 0 5 and 10 20 were significantly lower than those measured at the road removed area between the two areas not directly impacted by ground disturbance the up gradient side had lower average ρb at all depths 1 2 3 2 times lower fig 4a with significant differences t test p 0 05 detected at all depths except for the 0 5 cm interval in 2016 the road removed area demonstrated considerably lower average ρb at all depths relative to values measured in 2013 fig 4a although only the 10 20 cm layer was significantly different ρb values for the 2016 samples were more similar to those measured from samples obtained from the downgradient area of the fen in 2013 fig 4a however ρb values for all depths except 50 60 cm from the road removed area in 2016 remained significantly higher than values measured from the upgradient side of the fen area in 2013 in contrast with the exception of the top 5 cm no significant differences were detected between ρb measured at the road removed area in 2016 and the downgradient area of the fen in 2013 kh measured from peat cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 decreased by two orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 10 6 m s 1 from the surface to the base 70 cm b g s of the peat fig 4 the depth weighted arithmetic mean kh for these cores was 2 8 10 5 m s 1 the samples converted to log kh in cm hr 1 were plotted against ρb alongside results presented in liu and lennartz 2019 fig 5 with best model regression fits r2 reported in table 1 samples obtained from the road removed area at firebag fen in 2016 plotted within the range reported by liu and lennartz 2019 albeit within the upper range of kh for a given value of ρb the best model fit between measured ρb and kh from the road removed area in 2016 is summarized in table 1 this function was used to predict kh for all peat cores obtained in the road removed area in 2013 using available ρb data results exhibited a general decrease in kh with depth in locations sampled in 2013 albeit less uniform at the road removed area fig 4b depth weighted arithmetic mean kh for cores obtained from road removed and up and down gradient sites in 2013 were 8 6 10 6 1 1 10 4 and 2 6 10 5 m s 1 respectively 4 3 hydrology prior to and following road removal there was no quantitative water level or subsurface flow data for firebag fen over the period of time when the road was operational as data collection was initiated during the removal of the road in june 2013 however visual observations made by field personnel reported that the road had interrupted subsurface flow causing inundation and flooding on the up gradient side of the road and lower water levels and dryer conditions on the down gradient side over the 2013 14 study period the general flow direction at firebag fen was from the northeast to the southwest perpendicular to the road position fig 6 b the average site wide hydraulic gradient i over this period ranged between 0 006 and 0 008 locally hydraulic gradients were weakest from up gradient east to the road averaging 0 004 and were strongest from the east to west side of the road 0 009 and from the road to the down gradient west side of the fen 0 008 water levels were slightly higher within the southern portion of the fen compared to the north generating a lower hydraulic gradient parallel to the road towards the culvert refer to fig 1 and averaging 0 004 average water table positions at firebag fen were similar in 2013 and 2014 3 0 cm b g s refer to fig 6a and 7 water levels within the up gradient areas remained near or above the ground surface for most of the study period see fig 6a with relatively low variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 06 m for logged wells in contrast water levels within the west portion down gradient remained well below the ground surface for all of the 2013 and 2014 study period with values 14 and 19 5 cm lower on average than up gradient and road removed areas respectively fig 6a and with greater variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 13 m for logged wells along the road removed area water levels averaged 4 7 cm above ground surface a g s remained above for the majority of the study period fig 6a and had the least water table variability see fig 7 mean sd 0 04 m for logged wells of the three sites post road removal flow calculations across the peatland were made during relatively wet and dry conditions in 2013 and 2014 respectively and in 2016 three years after road removal additional information is summarized in table 2 including kh and transmissivity values as well as hydraulic gradients which were similar to those reported in 2013 and 2014 on july 30 2013 wet and august 09 2014 dry specific discharge was 11 and 7 mm d 1 respectively two years following in 2016 on july 11 2016 wet and august 25 dry specific discharge was 12 and 8 mm d 1 respectively 4 4 water chemistry over the 2013 sampling period ph levels averaged 4 88 and electrical conductivity averaged 93 7 μs cm 1 in june 2013 prior to removal and immediately following removal down gradient locations were characterized by higher nutrients srp no3 nh4 and so4 2 and inorganic ions cl ca2 mg2 k and na with significant differences detected for no3 so4 2 and cl excluding july 30 for cl fig 8 relative to up gradient locations road removed areas in 2013 were characterized by higher inorganic ions srp and nh4 indeed when compared to road removed areas up gradient locations displayed more significant differences in concentrations of variables relative to down gradient locations fig 8 later in the season august and october and in subsequent years 2014 and 2015 the differences in srp and no3 were less apparent between the three location groups as evidenced by the statistics and values of srp no3 and nh4 generally decreased over time fig 8 concentrations of so4 2 remained variable across the study period however significant differences were only detected in 2013 in contrast the differences in inorganic ions between locations persisted into 2015 with no apparent trends of decreasing concentrations at the site fig 8 4 5 vegetation across the study site the dominant tree cover includes picea mariana black spruce larix laricina tamarack and betula papyifera paper birch along with patches of other betula and salix willow species ericaceous species such as labrador tea rhododendron groenlandicum leather leaf chamaedaphne calyculata small cranberry oxycoccus microcarpus and cloudberry rubus chamaemorus dominate the shrub profile throughout the study site as is characteristic of boreal peatlands sphagnum mosses are the dominant peat forming genus onsite the complete vegetation surveys can be found in appendices a1 and a2 spatial disparities in vegetation communities were observed between up and down gradient sides of the road vegetation survey results from 2013 appendix a1 indicate that the southwest down gradient side of the road was characterized by a higher abundance of p mariana black spruce and l laricina tamarack mean tree density 32 per 100 m2 relative to the northeast up gradient side of the road mean tree density 11 per 100 m2 in addition the down gradient side of the road had a less abundant understory of c calyculata leatherleaf and sedge species such as e angustifolium common cottongrass relative to the upgradient side of the road while r groenlandicum was present on the upgradient side of the road mean 7 it was less abundant relative to the downgradient side of the road mean 21 as there was no vegetation establishment immediately following road removal the road was not surveyed for vegetation in 2013 by 2015 vascular vegetation primarily carex spp had begun to establish however large portions of the road remained bare while clusters of vegetation had begun to develop these clusters were most established up to 90 coverage in the southeast t4 4 and t3 4 and declined to 70 coverage in the northwest t1 4 appendix a2 the areas of highest coverage are coincident with areas that experienced less persistent flood conditions it is important to note that while the water table was not always at or above the surface in these locations it was always near the surface 5 discussion 5 1 climatic context for the period at which the bulk of hydrological monitoring was conducted 2013 and 2014 both years experienced below average total annual precipitation compared to the 1981 2010 climate normal both falling within the bottom 30th percentile therefore the removal of the road and subsequent monitoring was conducted in a hydrological period that is typical of the sub humid regional climate 5 2 road induced changes to the ecology and hydrology of firebag fen during the six years in which the road was operational 2007 2013 differing water table positions and variability figs 6a 7 likely contributed to the establishment of contrasting indicator species upgradient and downgradient the downgradient side of the fen was characterized by a higher abundance of trees black spruce and tamarack and shrubs labrador tea these findings are consistent with peatlands that have experienced drainage lohila et al 2011 munir et al 2014 the denser tree and shrub canopy results in a more shaded ground surface relative to the upgradient side of the fen which may also explain the less abundant sedge species e g e angustifolium observed on the downgradient side of the fen as suboptimal light levels can suppress sedge species limpens et al 2014 such differences in woody cover can also reduce radiation transmission air and soil temperature and wind speed all of which can influence the ratio of p to evapotranspiration et kettridge et al 2013 by 2015 vascular vegetation had begun to establish in the road removed area since this recovery was still in its early phases large portions of the road removed site remained bare where vegetation was present the dominant species were c aquatilus 44 78 of total vegetation at road removed locations and salix spp 6 24 of total vegetation at road removed locationsat this represents a noticeable shift in communities establishing on the road removed area relative to community composition in areas not directly affected by ground disturbance where these species are present but considerably less dominant such disparities in vegetation over short distances are promoted by persistently inundated conditions observed over the road which favour flood tolerant plant species borkenhagen et al 2018 following the removal of the road in june 2013 the underlying peat surface was depressed fig 3 in this area ρb was significantly higher than up and down gradient areas at all depths fig 4a showing evidence of compression of the peat compression can induce permanent changes to the hydrophysical properties of the peat including its hydraulic conductivity silins and rothwell 1998 peat soils are capable of compressing and swelling i e mire breathing lindsay 2010 price 2003 over a growing season in response to changes in water table position as moisture content and thus porewater pressure decreases within a volume of peat the effective stress acting on the peat volume increases this is caused by the weight of the overlying material which transfers to the underlying peat volume and results in compression since the water pressure no longer counteracts the downwards force of the overlying peat caron et al 2015 kennedy and price 2005 price 2003 price schlotzhauer 1999 a proportion of this volume change is reversible however when consolidation exceeds the material pre consolidation pressure volume changes are not entirely reversible kennedy and price 2005 such changes have been noted in peatlands that experience large drops in water table position over long time periods i e drainage silins and rothwell 1998 lang 2002 kennedy and price 2004 hooijer et al 2012 pronger et al 2014 and in the event of mechanical compression at the field and laboratory scale gauthier et al 2018 gauthier 2019 it is however unclear as to the proportion of reversible and irreversible consolidation that had occurred in the road removed area investigations into the relationship between ρb and kh from cores obtained at firebag fen in 2016 provided a means of predicting kh for peat cores previously obtained at the site in 2013 fig 5 table 1 a linear regression between ρb and log kh from samples obtained in 2016 yielded a strong relationship r2 0 71 relative to the majority of functions reported by liu and lennartz 2019 samples from firebag fen plotted within the global range reported by liu and lennartz 2019 however they were within the higher range of log kh for a given ρb value fig 5 here we argue that these differences highlighted the need for prescribing a unique function for predicting kh at firebag fen rather than using those that were previously developed we do however acknowledge that our function was formed on disturbed peat only and this relationship was therefore derived from peat that has a high ρb relative to peat located up and down gradient fig 4a therefore the linear fit may not estimate kh for low ρb near surface peat within the same degree of certainty soil cores obtained from the road removed area in 2016 three years post removal showed lower average ρb and thus higher kh at all measured depths compared to cores from 2013 fig 4 showing a 223 increase in transmissivity in this area significant differences in ρb were only detected at depth interval 10 20 cm however this may have been due to the low sample size n 4 obtained at the removed road in 2013 in addition the road was removed in a typical dry year relative to the 30 yr mean for annual p and was subsequently followed by drought conditions in late summer 2015 to early spring 2016 elmes et al 2018 it is likely that higher pore water pressures during wetter periods will reverse a proportion of the consolidation and it may require a complete decadal climate cycle to elucidate the full extent of rebound marshall et al 1999 down gradient locations had significantly higher bulk density and lower kh at all measured peat depths fig 4a with transmissivity of the peat column 76 lower than the up gradient locations this may be explained by impeded flow that was observed during the period when the road was operational lower water tables down gradient of the road prior to road removal that reduce porewater pressures promote peat consolidation wösten et al 1997 this combined with enhanced decomposition from peat oxidation further degrades the peat structure clymo 1983 compression increases ρb price and schlotzhauer 1999 and decreases kh brandyk et al 2002 price 2003 conversely up gradient of the road higher water tables and porewater pressures that causes swelling of the peat volume reduce ρb and increase kh the results presented here suggest that the relatively short period of time over which the road was operational 6 years was sufficient to establish differences in the hydrophysical properties of peat up gradient and down gradient of the road in addition to that beneath the road these changes were detected over a similar time period by silins and rothwell 1998 who measured a 71 decrease in ksat of near surface peat within seven years of drainage at a forested peatland in alberta the changes detected at firebag fen were also likely exacerbated by the road orientation fig 1b the perpendicular orientation of the road inhibited subsurface flow despite facilitation efforts from a culvert in the northwest portion of the road in contrast saraswati et al 2020 found minimal impediment of flow across a peatland due to a road that was built parallel to the direction of flow it is worth noting that additional linear disturbances were present prior to 2007 which may present difficulties in isolating changes solely attributed to the road that was removed in 2013 for example two larger roads were already in place which had likely altered the boundaries of the fen thus influencing the hydrology these roads extended northwest and southwest respectively reducing the width of firebag fen to 80 m on the down gradient side of the fen beyond the boundaries of the monitoring network for this study such disturbances reduced the cross sectional area of the saturated layer perpendicular to the direction of flow thus likely increasing the hydraulic gradient and specific discharge to accommodate the requisite flow rate however given that lower water tables were observed on the down gradient side of the road it is therefore likely that the changes detected in this study were indeed from the removed road 5 3 changes to the hydrology of firebag fen following road removal hydraulic gradients across the peatland averaged 0 007 between 2013 and 2014 considerably large relative to other fens studied throughout the wbp for example elmes and price 2019 measured an average hydraulic gradient of 0 003 at a moderate rich treed fen from 2011 2015 wells et al 2017 measured an average hydraulic gradient of 0 002 at a poor fen in the stony mountain uplands from 2011 to 2015 the hydraulic gradients measured at firebag fen were more similar to those measured at a saline fen 0 004 0 007 wells and price 2015a situated at the terminus of the cretaceous grand rapids formation 20 km south of fort mcmurray wells and price 2015b indeed gradients were lowest in the up gradient area of firebag fen and highest near the removed road suggesting that despite its removal the road removed area and associated changes to its physical properties still have a measurable effect on the subsurface flow regime at the site level subsurface water fluxes across the fen varied considerably between characteristically wet and dry periods in 2013 2014 and 2016 with fluxes 49 82 higher during wetter periods this was primarily due to the increase in transmissivity where a high water table position exploits the much higher kh of the upper peat layers see fig 4b furthermore lower mean kh at the road removed site by two orders of magnitude and down gradient of the road removed site by an order of magnitude relative to the up gradient side of the road reduced the bulk transmissivity of the peat at firebag fen assuming pre disturbance transmissivity was equal to the up gradient weighted mean kh 1 1 10 4 m s 1 and a fully saturated peat column at all locations changes to the road and down gradient side of the fen reduced the transmissivity of the system to 2 9 10 5 m s 1 reducing it by 279 in 2016 subsurface water discharge estimated at firebag fen on a characteristically wet july day was 12 greater than that estimated for july 2013 table 2 reductions in ρb and thus the increases in kh at the road over this time fig 4b promoted a higher water flux we postulate a gradual return towards pre disturbance hydrological conditions including a decrease in flooding in response to peat rebound we cannot however determine the extent of this return without estimations of reversible and irreversible consolidation of the disturbed peat 5 4 implications of geochemical enrichment on firebag fen poor fens in the aosr are generally low in dissolved ions and comprise vegetation that is adapted to such environments e g sphagnum mosses vitt and chee 1990 roads can change the hydrological regime of a wetland by creating a barrier to surface and or groundwater flow thus modify the hydrochemical processes and consequently the system ecohydrology turchenek 1990 clymo and hayward 1982 turetsky and st louis 2006 due to the placement of road fill firebag fen experienced an enrichment of major cations na ca2 and k and anions no3 and so4 2 and srp in road removed and or down gradient locations fig 8 furthermore ion concentrations may also be elevated due to the use of road stabilizers or dust prevention cacl during road maintenance it is plausible that some of the ions from the road were transported hydrologically from the road to the down gradient side notably there were elevated concentrations of no3 nh4 and so4 2 at the down gradient side relative to the up gradient side of the road fig 8 which coincided with wetter conditions on the up gradient side of the road and drier conditions on the down gradient side of the road fig 6 wetter conditions on the up gradient side of the road would have more anaerobic conditions leading to lower redox potential and a greater reduction of no3 and so4 2 rückauf et al 2004 in contrast impeded flow across the peatland and subsequent water table drawdown on the down gradient side of the road would have led to drier conditions with greater redox potential thereby inhibiting the reduction of no3 and so4 2 and possibly increasing the mineralization of the organic matter macrae et al 2013 the release of previously retained so4 2 has also been noted for peatlands that have undergone water table decline wieder 1985 bayley et al 1986 and increases in net mineralization of n have been shown in peatlands that have undergone drying macrae et al 2013 although these differences were apparent prior to road removal and immediately following removal these differences were dampened over time and differences between the up and down gradient sides of the road became less apparent these gradual shifts in concentrations of nitrogen and so4 2 between 2013 and 2015 coincide with our hydrological results that demonstrate that differences in moisture conditions also became less apparent over time post road removal indeed an increase in subsurface flow across firebag fen would raise the water table in the down gradient side of the fen thus reducing its redox potential and also making conditions less favourable for mineralization on the up gradient side with water flow less impeded water tables declined likely increasing the redox potential of the peat and lessening the likelihood that the nitrogen would be reduced however the lack of reduction in so4 2 concentrations across the three year record suggests that redox potential has not been modified sufficiently to allow for efficient so4 2 reduction given that the overburden was recovered and removed in 2013 further enrichment of peat porewaters is not expected and it was hypothesized that the site would experience a dilution effect over time however at the road removed and down gradient locations in the firebag fen a dilution of na ca2 and k was not observed by august 2014 and differences in these ions between the up and down gradient sides of the road persisted it is presumed that insufficient flushing had occurred by 2014 however the steady decline in average cl concentrations in road removed and up gradient locations from summer 2013 to august 2015 is consistent with our hydrological data indicating dilution consequently due to a lack of cation data in 2015 and no water chemistry data in 2016 we are unable to provide an estimate for how long it will take for ion concentrations to return to pre road concentrations the fact that biologically mediated water quality parameters such as srp no3 and nh4 became more consistent between the sides of the road over time is promising this combined with the observed reduction in cl concentrations two years post removal and peat rebound three years post removal suggests that removal efforts can eventually restore the hydrology and water chemistry at the site to pre disturbance levels however the full extent of restoration potential will depend on the potential for peat rebound on the road removed area and eventual flushing of the down gradient side of the fen which is still unknown at this time 5 5 recommendations for monitoring and reclamation there has been recent acknowledgement regarding the necessity for long term monitoring of fen peatlands in the aosr wells and price 2015b volik et al 2020 such monitoring efforts focus on understanding the variability in fen hydrology in the region and how these systems respond to disturbance the results presented in this study highlight how the impacts from linear disturbances might not necessarily be immediate and may operate on daily and seasonal time scales e g interruption of flow and water table decline but can also operate on annual and decadal time scales e g peat oxidation secondary compression and decomposition monitoring efforts should therefore focus on the progression of disturbance related impacts on fen systems over multiple time scales following usage oil sands mining companies are required to reclaim disturbed lands to a state of equivalent land capability with this regulatory requirement extending to well sites pipelines access roads and associated facilities environment and parks 2017 the results presented in this study suggest that road removal can be a useful means of establishing pre disturbance conditions at fens with minimal intervention when left alone disturbed and compressed peat will rebound to a certain albeit unknown degree road reclamation therefore presents an opportunity for enhancing flow across peatlands further restoring their roles in the aosr as conveyors of fresh water to the athabasca river and its tributaries 6 conclusions the relatively short period of time over which the road was operational at firebag fen 2007 2013 was sufficient to cause physical hydrological and geochemical changes to the fen at the site level the placement of road overburden and usage by heavy machinery between 2007 and 2013 not only changed the hydrophysical properties of the underlying peat but also influenced the hydrology of the site enough to cause changes to the properties of the peat and vegetation composition of the down gradient side of the road repeated sampling of the hydrophysical properties of the peat three years after the removal of the road suggest that some rebound of the peat has occurred this when combined with less pronounced surface flooding and higher subsurface water discharge across the fen during wet periods suggests a return to more natural hydrological conditions as peat may continue to rebound to an equilibrium point beyond that which was observed in three years post removal hydraulic gradients may continue to decrease and standing water conditions may therefore become even less frequent this study has also shown that the road influenced the water chemistry of the fen within close proximity to the road removed area and on up gradient and down gradient locations both biologically mediated i e nutrients and hydrologically mediated i e inorganic ions biogeochemical parameters were greater on the down gradient side of the road at the time of road removal over time differences in nutrients between the up and down gradient sides of the road became less apparent whereas the differences in inorganic ion concentrations persisted this suggests that the peatland is returning to pre disturbance conditions but has not yet achieved this providing that the hydrology is restored it is anticipated that the altered geochemical regime will likely be temporary the removal of the road at firebag fen preceded a dry period of the 10 year western boreal plain climate cycle the rebound of the road might have occurred sooner had it been removed during a wetter period of the climate cycle continued monitoring as well as additional studies on other removed roads in the region will help in elucidating the full potential for recovery of reclaimed road disturbed fens 7 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this
