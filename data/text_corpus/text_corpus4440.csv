compared against the full order model solution keywords naca0015 airfoil finite volume method reduced order models 1 introduction to determine a rapid and reliable estimation of the aerodynamic loading on the wind turbine structure highly efficient tools are required sarmast et al 2016 zahle et al 2014 bazilevs et al 2011 traditional designs have extensively relied on the analytical methods to study the parametric dependence of the geometrical parameters on loads of the structure yang et al 2014 siddiqui et al 2015b in this regard initial estimations were based on blade element momentum bem theory abbott and doenhoff 1959 because of their computational efficiency researchers have also developed numerous tools based on simpler analytical methods xfoil morgado et al 2016 etc more sophisticated designs have utilized computational fluid dynamics cfd methods siddiqui et al 2015a 2019 versteeg and malalasekerah 2007 spentzos et al 2005 bai et al 2012 although the approach gives a better insight into the flow characteristics associated with the flow around wind turbine components due to their exceptionally high computational cost it has not been utilized by designers to perform the parametric studies siddiqui et al 2015a bazilevs et al 2011 recently researchers have started developing computationally efficient models employing reduced order modeling rom based on proper orthogonal decomposition pod heggelund et al 2012 2015 solari et al 2007 oliveira and patera 2007 greedy methods parish and duraisamy 2016 a combination of advanced deep neural network tompson et al 2016 lee et al 1997 ling et al 2016 and turbulence modeling ling 2015 coupled with traditional navier stokes solvers xiao et al 2015 which are seen as major steps towards developing numerical models approaches for parametric design among various methods for the development of rom phenomenological bai et al 2005 based rom employ ordinary differential equation ode to model the parameters in a physical system self excited oscillators are important example in this category nayfeh 1993 skop and balasubramanian 1997 xu et al 2017 such roms require accurate input data sets either from cfd simulations or experiments these were previously developed in the study nayfeh et al 2003a where the time history of the aerodynamic coefficients was modeled using the self excited oscillators the nonlinear application of such rom was identified in the study qin 2003 where forced van der pol oscillator was employed to model lift around circular cylinders at low reynolds number re the steady state and transient modeling for lift and drag using van der pol duffing models were found in the study akhtar 2008 where the model has been manifested for accurate prediction ability of non linear phenomenon on bluff bodies the modeling of vortex induced vibrations on the cylindrical riser for offshore applications is performed in stabile et al 2018 and the van der pol based rom models are developed for the prediction of lift and drag in the context of airfoil design the cfd methods were previously employed in the study ghias et al 2005 to identify the turbulent flow structures around the blades more recent work on such computations based on isogeometric finite element methods cottrell et al 2009 with sa and variational multiscale vms turbulence models can be found in nordanger et al 2015a b likewise several experiments tang and dowell 1995 shur et al 2008 piziali 1993 were conducted to quantify the performance of airfoils under different flow conditions all the experiments were conducted in the wind tunnels and the aerodynamic coefficients c l c d c p were monitored the main idea of the tests was to identify the stall on airfoils and determine the region in which sudden drop in the lift is experienced with an increase in the angle of attack causing the flow to separate thus the studies focused on the unsteady boundary layer separation at higher re over the airfoil surface and demonstrated the vortex shedding spectrum in the wake both in 2d and 3d spatial dimensions to standardize the numerical modeling for airfoils the present manuscript is aimed towards examining the extent of turbulence models at higher re of 1 0 6 the tests are conducted on the naca0015 airfoil owing to its availability of extensive experimental data and simplified rom models are proposed the numerical setup is benchmarked against the published data available in the studies piziali 1993 wernert et al 1996 schreck and hellin 1994 in 2d 3d spatial dimensions for k ϵ k ω shear stress transport sst spalart allmaras sa models the resolution of the flow field inside the transient boundary layer is analyzed and the strength of the turbulence model is tested on the ability to capture the separation point α c r i t i c a l spectral analysis is performed on the time history of aerodynamic coefficients to identify dominant frequency components perturbations methods such as the method of multiple scales are adapted and coefficients of the proposed rom model based on van der pol equation are computed in the end the models are tested in a predictive setting and their ability as a stand alone forecasting tool is highlighted 2 theory 2 1 symmetric 4 digit naca airfoils standard 4 digit naca airfoil is employed for the study bai et al 2012 the four numbers have a standard terminology as defined by the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca for airfoils the first second and third fourth numerals illustrate the maximum camber the distance of maximum camber from the leading edge and the most significant thickness respectively all the quantities are represented as a percentage of the chord length fig 1 b exhibits relevant design parameters of the naca airfoil the first two zero numerals represent the symmetric airfoils as illustrated in fig 1 a the schematics of the symmetric airfoils can be generated using the following formula 1 y t 5 t c 0 2969 x c 0 1260 x c 0 3516 x c 2 0 2843 x c 3 0 1015 x c 4 here y t t c and x exhibits the width of airfoil thickness measured from the center largest thickness chord length and the distance between the leading to trailing edge respectively however eq 1 does not provide a close curve at the trailing edge of the airfoil hence the equation is modified to get a closed geometry given by 2 y t 5 t c 0 2969 x c 0 1260 x c 0 3516 x c 2 0 2843 x c 3 0 1036 x c 4 the eq 2 has been used to develop the cad model of the naca0015 airfoil profile in the simulations of the present manuscript 2 2 turbulence

non linear stress terms ρ v i v i durbin 2002 which are related to the mean flow by the use of boussinesq approximation it has produced a constant term ν t eddy viscosity versteeg and malalasekerah 2007 to describe the small scale turbulent stress each turbulence modeled have solved additional equations to model the eddy viscosity the detail of each model is outlined in the following subsection

for external flow problems related to aviation and aerospace industry spalart and allmaras 1992 due to similar reynolds number regime 1 0 6 in mega watt size wind turbines applications it is expected to produce good results the governing equations of eddy viscosity is described in eq 5 for detailed explanation of the model and the constants terms employed in the design as originally established by spalart the reader is referred to spalart and allmaras 1992 see also nordanger et al 2015a and references therein for recent advances 5 ν t u ν q ν c b 2 c b 3 ν ν 1 c b 3 ν ν ν where ν is the fluid

turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent dissipation ϵ these two equations associate the mean flow quantities to internal turbulent stresses eqs 6 7 in the literature this model has been found to perform well away from the wall in the free shear regions because of its in discrepancy to model the viscous sublayer accurately wall functions are used to avoid the concentration of mesh near the surface to allow the first cell node to be placed in the log law region the eq 6 for turbulence kinetic energy k and eq 7 for turbulent dissipation is employed for further explanation of the model the

to the nearest wall and ν is the local kinematic viscosity of the fluid has been maintained in the log law region between 30 y 100 such that the wall functions calculate the correct values of the field variables for the neighboring cells adjacent to the wall to avoid generation of stagnation points limiters introduced by kato and launder 1993 are used who consider that the stagnation points are irrotational with minimal vorticity ω thus the limiter terms becomes g k μ t s q where ω is the magnitude of vorticity ω 2 ω i j ω i j 2 3 3 k ω sst turbulence model to model eddy viscosity it solves k ω in the inner part of the boundary layer and transition to k ϵ in the free stream region the sst formulation regulates the transition between the models menter 1994 introduced a blending function that controls the switching between ω and ϵ equations turbulent kinetic energy and rate of dissipation of eddies are given by eqs 8 and 9 for a detailed explanation of the model and constant

k at the wall for each first cell the excessive generation of the turbulence energy in the vicinity of stagnation points is controlled by using the limiters as introduced by mentor g k m i n g k c l i m ρ ω where the c l i m has a default value the use of limiters avoids stagnation points to appear in the aerodynamic simulation without altering the shear layer performance 2 4 aerodynamic

simulation setup in this section a full description of the simulation set up is provided regarding the choice of domain size mesh resolution selection of initial boundary conditions time step size and solver settings 3 1 domain size and meshing strategy a multiblock approach has been adapted to allow more control over the generation of computational mesh see fig 2 it has provided flexibility near the sharp corners and also to conformed well to the underlying geometry eq 2 is employed to construct a smooth naca 0015 profile the computational domain is subjected to a body fitted c type mesh quality orthogonal cells are clustered due to the presence of sharp gradients arising from the rapid changes in the flow physics on the surface and the wake region of the airfoil it also enabled a smooth transition from the airfoil surface towards the outer flow field with quality hexahedral elements three sets of mesh grading are generated g 1 g 2 g 3 to perform the mesh independence study g 2 grading factor has adequately captured the dynamics of flow and provided accurate values of aerodynamic coefficient value with the least computational time see fig 3 the extent of the computational domain is selected by a domain sensitivity study details of which can be found in the previously published article by the authors nordanger et al 2015a based on the study a domain size of 20 c in the downstream direction 8c in the upwind direction and a circular arc of radius 8c connecting the upper and lower surface are employed the 2d mesh is extruded with the same underlying mesh topology to obtain the 3d computational domain mesh information of both the spatial dimensions can be found in table 1 3 2 time step selection of u grid δ x and time step size δ t is done such that the overall numerical stability of the solution remains intact to keep track of stability the courant number c u δ t δ x is monitored and designed to remain less than one openfoam 4 0 of 4 0 has a unique feature of self adjusting the time step size based on the courant number constraints which has been used to bound the solution an initial accurate time step estimation is still required for maintaining the overall accuracy of the solution therefore a time independence study has provided an accurate estimate of the initial time step a time step size of 0 0001 s is observed to produce time independent results for lift and drag coefficients thus it is selected as the initial time step size for the simulations in the manuscript 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the simulation has been first validated against the experimental test of piziali 1993 therefore the numerical framework and boundary conditions are selected to match consistently with the experimental setup of the authors the flow constants are based on a reference fluid density ρ 1 225 kg m3 dynamic viscosity of μ 1 82 1 0 5 kg m s constant flow velocity of u 20 m s and the r e 1 96 1 0 6 the flow field is assumed fully turbulent and the transition from laminar to turbulent regime inside the boundary layer is not explicitly modeled on the upper and lower surface of the airfoil velocity inlet boundary condition is employed at the inlet with the fixed value of velocity u 20 0 0 outflow condition is imposed on the opposite side of the domain and assigned a constant value of zero pressure drop upper and lower walls are subjected to slip boundary conditions the computational domain is extended to a unit length in the third dimension as of 4 0 required a unit dimension in the normal direction for computing the solution the two new boundaries in 2d front and back are subjected to symmetry boundary conditions no slip condition is employed for the airfoil upper and lower surface with zero pressure gradients specialized wall functions in openfoam has been used i e epsilonwallfunction omegawallfunction kqrwallfunction liu 2016 are utilized to relax the concentration of mesh resolution near the airfoil surface to provide an accurate estimate of the initial flow field an analytical solver is run first which has improved convergence and reduced the overall simulation time the schematic of different boundary conditions imposed on the computational setup is shown in fig 3 3 4 solver setting the present solver within the of 4 0 jasak 1996 2008 framework is utilized to impose the continuity constraints an elliptic equation of pressure is employed by imposing the divergence constraints on the momentum equation this procedure forms a pressure modified equation which is solved in a segregated manner with the turbulence equations a pimple combination of piso simple algorithm is employed which has allowed taking bigger steps in the temporal direction the equations are discretized in a finite volume technique and integrated over control volumes cv using the green gauss divergence theorem thus volume integrals are transformed into surface integrals of the cv second order linear discretization is employed for all the equations except k and turbulence equations which used upwind convection the gradient term is divided by a sum coming from orthogonal and non orthogonal parts full non orthogonal correction is realized for all equations as solver stability is not trivial owing to the utilization of particular computational mesh to solve the systems of governing equations geometric agglomerated algebraic multigrid gamg solver is employed the solution time is reduced by applying dic gauss seidel as a smoother which damp the oscillations in the solution and enhances convergence broeckhoven et al 2004 the convection terms are discretized with bounded gauss upwind since it is known to be less dissipative and highly stable broeckhoven et al 2004 for the solution of diffusion term in the ns equation gauss linear corrected is employed the first order implicit scheme is used for the solution of time marching term the magnitudes of density and pressure are by extrapolating the data from the centers of the neighboring points 3 5 simulation length convergence is achieved for the flow field variables using the time step size obtained from the independence study δ 0 0001 seconds accurate estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients is obtained in connection with the experimental results simulations results for low α required approximately three thousand time iteration to reach convergence see fig 4 a however simulations at higher α required approximately ten thousand time levels to meet the convergence criteria residuals 1 0 6 cumulative lift and drag values are monitored in parallel to determine if the steady state values are achieved 3 6 definition of test cases first the numerical setup is validated at α 0 then multiple test cases are run for two dimensional analysis simulations are performed over range of α i e α 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 using all the three turbulence models to conduct 3d simulations 2d cases are extruded in the third direction with a fixed mesh topology sixty cases are numerically investigated in this entire study and the performance parameters c l c d c p are carefully monitored 4 results and discussion the results are presented for each turbulence model over the range of α by monitoring the flow behavior over the airfoil surface three flow regimes are recognized the first regime is identified as the attached flow regime 0 α 11 inside which the streamlines remain attached to the airfoil s upper and lower surfaces a mild separation starts to appear inside secondary flow regime 11 α 13 and the flow streamlines begin to separate from the airfoils trailing edge the detachment in the flow is not enough at this stage to cause oscillations to appear in the lift and drag values in the stall flow regime 13 α 17 the airfoil experiences a dramatic loss in the lift coefficient and vortex shedding starts to appear in the form of leading and trailing edge vortices these intermittent rotational vortices get combined in the wake and generate a von karman vortex street liao et al 2004 tabib et al 2017 a sudden rise is the magnitudes of drag coefficients are also observed at this point because of vortex shedding the magnitudes of the aerodynamic coefficient keep oscillating about a mean value 4 1 time history and convergence rapid convergence rates are observed for the simulations conducted in the attached flow regime the first few hundred time steps manifested initial instabilities in the coefficient values however all the solutions for the attached flow achieved convergence within 1000 times step iterations among the models faster convergence rates are observed for the sa model which is mainly due to the solution of only one additional transport equation for the prediction of small scale turbulence no oscillations in the aerodynamic coefficients are reported for α 11 for any turbulence model which is a manifestation of the attached flow around over the airfoil oscillations started to appear for k ϵ and k ω sst inside mild separation regime even at this point the sa model predicted constant values of coefficients with no sign of vortex shedding in terms of the convergence rates k ω sst have shown superior performance as compared to k ϵ which has taken approximately 20 000 iterations to reach the desired residuals 10 6 vortex shedding of various sizes and strength is observed from the time history of aerodynamic coefficients for k ω sst and k ϵ turbulence models k ω sst models dominated the vortex frequency and strength as compared to the k ϵ fig 5 provides a quantitative comparison further explanation using spectral analysis will be outlined in section 4 5 4 2 drag lift and pressure coefficients in general k ω sst and k ϵ have shown a good comparison with the experimental data unlike the sa model which failed altogether to capture the stagnation point and the flow separation for the k ω sst and k ϵ smaller differences in the magnitudes of surface pressure distributions have produced substantial variations in the lift and drag values prediction by each model the monitored values of the aerodynamic coefficients are presented in the subsequent section 4 2 1 lift c l the lift coefficients for the k ω sst k ϵ and sa turbulence models are in good agreement with experiments at most incidence angles in particular k ω sst model has shown the good estimates at all incidence angles the sa model has performed well at lower α but shows unsatisfactory behavior at α in the stall regime the k ϵ model has shown discrepancies in predicting the transition between flow regimes however k ϵ are better than k ω sst for α 15 and 17 4 2 2 drag c d for the prediction of the drag coefficient only k ω sst model has shown a good match against the experimental data whereas the k ϵ model has only shown a reasonable estimate of drag coefficients inside the attached flow regime for the mildly separated and stall regions it has produced higher values sa model on the other hand over predicts the values throughout the band of numerical simulations under all regimes 4 2 3 pressure coefficient c p comparison of the pressure coefficient at α 17 is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that all models match consistently well with the c p predicted by the experiments sa model reports higher values of c p at the bottom surface of the airfoil whereas on the top surface it exhibits lower value unlike the other models a similar trend of c p is observed on the top and bottom surface of the airfoil for k ϵ and k ω sst model the magnitude of c p at the lower surface is less for k ϵ in comparison to the k ω sst in general k ω sst model compares well against the experimental data consistently this manifests the ability of k ω sst model to predict accurate pressure distribution around the airfoil surface which is also paramount for the accurate prediction of lift and drag magnitudes similar results were also identified by tachos et al 2010 4 3 prediction of the stall and flow structure characterization the sa model is not able to capture the flow detachment point α c r i t i c a l for the airfoil see fig 6 a even though it predicts the magnitude of lift coefficient in the vicinity of the experimental data the overall trend for the lift profile is observed to increase with the rise of incidence angles this is believed to happen since sa model adds only a single additional variable for an undamped kinematic eddy viscosity and is effective model at low reynolds number regime in its original form it does not accurately compute fields that exhibit shear flow separated flow or decaying turbulence wilcox 1993 at higher reynolds number for the present investigations wall functions liu 2016 are employed to improve its prediction capability towards the flow around naca0015 airfoil the k ϵ and k ω sst models accurately represent the flow separation point α c r i t i c a l 13 which is found to be in agreement with the behavior of the aerodynamic coefficients observed in the experiments an increase in the angle of attack from 15 to 17 implies a sudden loss of lift and a dramatic rise in drag see figs 6 a 6 b the obtained results from each model is summarized in table 2 corresponding to the experimental data to study the qualitative behavior snapshots of velocity magnitude are plotted at α 13 15 17 to highlight qualitative differences between the turbulence models each model has captured a certain amount of separation along with vortex shedding of variable size and strength the examination of contours in fig 8 highlights the position of flow reversal point the sa model produced the least amount of reverse flow at higher α no oscillations are reported in the time history of aerodynamic coefficients for both c l and c d as observed in section 4 2 whereas the k ω sst model gives the largest reverse flow behind the wake of the airfoil this unsteadiness in the flow is explicitly visible in fig 6 a a similar flow pattern is identified for k ω sst and k ϵ at α 15 the flow characteristics of the stall regime have shown sharp intermittent trailing and leading edge flow separation this causes highly non linear behavior which is characterized by the shedding of circular eddies developed into a von karman vortex street to better understand the evolution of vortex shedding snapshots of streamline over the airfoil are plotted in fig 7 the development of flow reversal points portrays the evolution of stall vortex and the phenomenon of flow separation initially the flow starts to separate from the trailing edge region then move towards the leading edge until the flow reversal point is reached stall vortex thus first develops peak in size before moving away from the surface the point of flow reversal also moves away from the leading edge with the shedding of the vortex 4 4 2d versus 3d simulations the baseline mesh of 2d is extended a unit dimension in the third direction z with underlying mesh parameters untouched the boundary condition is switched from two dimensions z 0 to three dimensions z 0 on the upper and lower surface of the domain such that a three dimensional solution can be calculated the present numerical setup is motivated by the studies conducted in sagmo et al 2016 which has adopted a similar configuration to study the three dimensional characteristics for asymmetrical s826 airfoil a significant increase in the simulation time is experienced for 3d simulation in comparison to the 2d approximately five times more vorticity along the spanwise direction is plotted in fig 9 a which depicts a consistent flow pattern throughout the blade length in the z direction no transverse flow distribution is observed which is considered a prime reason for a similar flow pattern in the third spatial dimension the contours of the flow spectrum superimposed with the streamlines positioned at 0 3z and 0 8z are illustrated in fig 10 vortex stretching is visible in the wake structure behind the airfoil in both dimensions the extent of flow separation distinctly indicates the stall regime of the airfoil over the entire span of α three dimensional results consistently matched well with the two dimensional predictions it is concluded that stand alone two dimensional simulations can determine the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil with sufficient accuracy due to the limitation of space only partial results at α 15 are presented in the present article 4 5 frequency spectrum of vortex shedding fig 11 depicts the oscillations in the aerodynamic coefficient for angle of attack greater than the stall angle α 13 regular von karman vortex street is recognized with the instability in the values of flow variables inside the boundary layer for the two turbulence models the vortex separation mechanism roll up and detachment from the surface affects the pressure distribution to cause intermittent fluctuation in the values of aerodynamic coefficients the magnitude of these oscillations is similar for the two models spectral analysis was performed on the time series of the aerodynamic list coefficient to extract the dominant frequencies the time history of the cfd simulations constituted approximately 10 s of the simulation length which corresponds to the periodic behavior over 20 complete cycles of vortex shedding fig 12 represents the power spectra of the lift fluctuations at α 17 for k ω sst and k ϵ turbulence models these fluctuations are comparable to the one obtained from the flows around circular cylinders nayfeh et al 2005 a strong quadratic and cubic couplings are observed in the frequency harmonics unlike to cylinder where only fundamental and odd coupling are observed nayfeh et al 2003a the magnitude of the fundamental frequency at α 17 is 0 9 and 1 5 for k ϵ and k ω sst models respectively the second harmonic is exhibited at the quadratic frequency of 1 8 and 3 0 f s f s 2 f s whereas cubic coupling of the frequency is seen at 3 f s both models have shown distinct magnitudes and peaks for the fundamental frequency and its quadratic and cubic couplings the coupling of the rest of the frequencies diminishes at higher α due to larger separation and less interaction with the airfoil surface 4 6 the simplified reduced order model based on the high fidelity solution and spectral decomposition of the time history of coefficients a rom is developed to model lift the proposed rom is based on the van der pol model nayfeh et al 2003b the developed equation for the rom is given by eq 10 10 c l ϖ 2 c l υ c l γ c l c l ϱ c l 2 c l where the parameters υ ϱ ϖ γ are all positive real numbers presence of term c l c l in eq 10 implies phase difference of around π 2 among the

magnitudes of the nonlinear damping coefficients the oscillator equation is solved employing the multiple scales method nayfeh 1993 2000 the coefficients of the oscillator which are related to the damping are considered weak such that υ o κ ϱ o κ and γ o κ the κ represents an artificial parameter using which we perform the expansion kevorkian and cole 1996 the proposed model thus becomes 11 c l

10 is developed into an ode and integrated using runge kutta numerical routine the obtained result of c l from rom is compared with fom in fig 13 the geometry parameter α is developed such that it can vary without altering the original rom equation the model parameters obtained for the k ω sst and k ϵ model at α 15 17 are summarized in table 3 vortex shedding frequency increases with α and we obtain significantly higher magnitudes for k ω sst model as compared to k ϵ the rom compares well with fom regarding the overall trend of the time history of c l it can be seen that rom slightly underestimates the extremal values however the overall quantification of error shows a deviation of less than 4 in addition to the time domain the main strength of the proposed rom is its ability to capture well spectral domains the strong first three harmonics are represented with reasonable accuracy for the k ω sst and k ϵ model at α 15 17 as shown in fig 14 this manifests that aerodynamic characteristics can be accurately represented using proposed rom in terms of aerodynamic lift coefficient with significantly less computational constraints for instance present fom simulation takes approximately twenty minutes of simulation time to provide temporal lift coefficient running in parallel on four cores intel xeon e5 2680 v2 while rom corresponding to the reduced degree of freedom predicted similar estimated values in less than two seconds running in serial on a desktop computer with intel i7 9700te cpu 4 7 rom model in predictive settings the proposed rom model has shown remarkable improvements in terms of computational time and determining correct estimates of the aerodynamic loading of the lift coefficients compared against the fom herein the rom capability is tested further in a predictive setting to access its validity for a wide range of operating conditions c l is computed at α 16 using both high fidelity simulation models and rom approach the model parameters are calculated through cubic interpolation from the data obtained for α 15 17 listed in table 3 we obtained positive values of our damping parameters which are reflective of the limit cycle at the same time magnitudes obtained at two different geometric parameters showed similar trends for the linear quadratic and cubic damping coefficients which further highlights the accuracy of present rom we also notice a decreasing trend for damping parameter values at higher geometric incidence α which is considered because of the drop in the c l in the stall regime the time histories for the c l obtained by using fom and rom are displayed in fig 15 it can be observed that present rom not only satisfies prediction in the time domain but also in the spectral domain in order to effectively test quantification of error percentage errors are compared from fom and the rom solution in terms of the fundamental frequency in the spectra the reported error is found to be around 5 which we consider acceptable given the significantly reduced computation time overall the proposed model performed extremely well in a predictive setting and able to capture very well the overall trend of the lifting behavior computed by the fom 5 conclusions traditionally oscillator models were proposed for determining the vortex induce vibrations around cylindrical structures the current work presented the van der pol based oscillator model for a study involving turbulent flow around the naca0015 airfoil the flow was simulated in two and three dimensions using three different rans turbulence models spalart allmaras k ϵ and k ω sst model the numerical results were analyzed in both the time and frequency domains the existence of both even and odd harmonics in the spectral analysis is reported for the airfoil unlike the harmonics appearing in the cylindrical structures which normally show odd couplings herein a simplified rom based on the van der pol equation was proposed for the airfoil operation in the stall regime with an additional term introduced to cater for the quadratic couplings and its results were compared against the high fidelity simulations major findings of the work are enumerated below inside the attached 0 α 11 and mildly separated 11 α 13 regimes all the three turbulence models illustrated a reasonable comparison especially for the prediction of the aerodynamic lift in the stall regime 13 α 17 k ω sst and k ϵ to certain extent successfully captured the vortex shedding phenomena sa model altogether failed to demonstrate the adverse pressure gradients around the airfoil insignificant differences between the 2d and 3d simulation results showed that the flow was not dominated by three dimensional flow structures significant enough to affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the blade thus it can be concluded that in the absence of any tapering of the blade geometry along its length 2d simulations suffices when comparing the results across different turbulence models k ω sst turbulence model demonstrated superior performance strong quadratic and cubic non linearities were identified in the temporal history of the lift coefficient a rom based on the van der pol oscillator was proposed to model the aerodynamic lift coefficient at a higher angle of attacks the model coefficients were computed using the results from high fidelity simulations the addition of a quadratic nonlinearity to the rom equation further improved its accuracy the results obtained from the rom compared well with the cfd result in the time domain the model was then integrated to test the aerodynamic lift coefficient in a predictive setting which correlated well with the high fidelity simulation results the peaks were only observed to be 5 apart a turbine blade can be divided into an inner segment and an outer segment while the former is designed with the structural integrity of the turbines in mind the later is designed to maximize torque generation it has been found in the past studies that flow around the outer sections of a blade remains attached to the surface in such a situation the rom model proposed in this work can be useful however when it comes to the segment closer to the hub where massive flow separation takes place the current rom model will fail for such a situation we are in the process of developing a rom

22200,the ability to accurately predict vortex shedding around wind turbine blades is paramount particularly at high reynolds number turbulence models employed in the numerical studies strongly

compared against the full order model solution keywords naca0015 airfoil finite volume method reduced order models 1 introduction to determine a rapid and reliable estimation of the aerodynamic loading on the wind turbine structure highly efficient tools are required sarmast et al 2016 zahle et al 2014 bazilevs et al 2011 traditional designs have extensively relied on the analytical methods to study the parametric dependence of the geometrical parameters on loads of the structure yang et al 2014 siddiqui et al 2015b in this regard initial estimations were based on blade element momentum bem theory abbott and doenhoff 1959 because of their computational efficiency researchers have also developed numerous tools based on simpler analytical methods xfoil morgado et al 2016 etc more sophisticated designs have utilized computational fluid dynamics cfd methods siddiqui et al 2015a 2019 versteeg and malalasekerah 2007 spentzos et al 2005 bai et al 2012 although the approach gives a better insight into the flow characteristics associated with the flow around wind turbine components due to their exceptionally high computational cost it has not been utilized by designers to perform the parametric studies siddiqui et al 2015a bazilevs et al 2011 recently researchers have started developing computationally efficient models employing reduced order modeling rom based on proper orthogonal decomposition pod heggelund et al 2012 2015 solari et al 2007 oliveira and patera 2007 greedy methods parish and duraisamy 2016 a combination of advanced deep neural network tompson et al 2016 lee et al 1997 ling et al 2016 and turbulence modeling ling 2015 coupled with traditional navier stokes solvers xiao et al 2015 which are seen as major steps towards developing numerical models approaches for parametric design among various methods for the development of rom phenomenological bai et al 2005 based rom employ ordinary differential equation ode to model the parameters in a physical system self excited oscillators are important example in this category nayfeh 1993 skop and balasubramanian 1997 xu et al 2017 such roms require accurate input data sets either from cfd simulations or experiments these were previously developed in the study nayfeh et al 2003a where the time history of the aerodynamic coefficients was modeled using the self excited oscillators the nonlinear application of such rom was identified in the study qin 2003 where forced van der pol oscillator was employed to model lift around circular cylinders at low reynolds number re the steady state and transient modeling for lift and drag using van der pol duffing models were found in the study akhtar 2008 where the model has been manifested for accurate prediction ability of non linear phenomenon on bluff bodies the modeling of vortex induced vibrations on the cylindrical riser for offshore applications is performed in stabile et al 2018 and the van der pol based rom models are developed for the prediction of lift and drag in the context of airfoil design the cfd methods were previously employed in the study ghias et al 2005 to identify the turbulent flow structures around the blades more recent work on such computations based on isogeometric finite element methods cottrell et al 2009 with sa and variational multiscale vms turbulence models can be found in nordanger et al 2015a b likewise several experiments tang and dowell 1995 shur et al 2008 piziali 1993 were conducted to quantify the performance of airfoils under different flow conditions all the experiments were conducted in the wind tunnels and the aerodynamic coefficients c l c d c p were monitored the main idea of the tests was to identify the stall on airfoils and determine the region in which sudden drop in the lift is experienced with an increase in the angle of attack causing the flow to separate thus the studies focused on the unsteady boundary layer separation at higher re over the airfoil surface and demonstrated the vortex shedding spectrum in the wake both in 2d and 3d spatial dimensions to standardize the numerical modeling for airfoils the present manuscript is aimed towards examining the extent of turbulence models at higher re of 1 0 6 the tests are conducted on the naca0015 airfoil owing to its availability of extensive experimental data and simplified rom models are proposed the numerical setup is benchmarked against the published data available in the studies piziali 1993 wernert et al 1996 schreck and hellin 1994 in 2d 3d spatial dimensions for k ϵ k ω shear stress transport sst spalart allmaras sa models the resolution of the flow field inside the transient boundary layer is analyzed and the strength of the turbulence model is tested on the ability to capture the separation point α c r i t i c a l spectral analysis is performed on the time history of aerodynamic coefficients to identify dominant frequency components perturbations methods such as the method of multiple scales are adapted and coefficients of the proposed rom model based on van der pol equation are computed in the end the models are tested in a predictive setting and their ability as a stand alone forecasting tool is highlighted 2 theory 2 1 symmetric 4 digit naca airfoils standard 4 digit naca airfoil is employed for the study bai et al 2012 the four numbers have a standard terminology as defined by the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca for airfoils the first second and third fourth numerals illustrate the maximum camber the distance of maximum

the leading to trailing edge respectively however eq 1 does not provide a close curve at the trailing edge of the airfoil hence the equation is modified to get a closed geometry given by 2 y t 5 t c 0 2969 x c 0 1260 x c 0 3516 x c 2 0 2843 x c 3 0 1036 x c 4 the eq 2 has been used to develop the cad model of the naca0015 airfoil profile in the simulations of the present manuscript 2 2 turbulence

turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent dissipation ϵ these two equations associate the mean flow quantities to internal turbulent stresses eqs 6 7 in the literature this model has been found to perform well away from the wall in the free shear regions because of its in discrepancy to model the viscous sublayer accurately wall functions are used to avoid the concentration of mesh near the surface to allow the first cell node to be placed in the log law region the eq 6 for turbulence kinetic energy k and eq 7 for turbulent dissipation is employed for further explanation of the model the

field variables for the neighboring cells adjacent to the wall to avoid generation of stagnation points limiters introduced by kato and launder 1993 are used who consider that the stagnation points

simulation setup in this section a full description of the simulation set up is provided regarding the choice of domain size mesh resolution selection of initial boundary conditions time step size and solver settings 3 1 domain size and meshing strategy a multiblock approach has been adapted to allow more control over the generation of computational mesh see fig 2 it has provided flexibility near the sharp corners and also to conformed well to the underlying geometry eq 2 is employed to construct a smooth naca 0015 profile the computational domain is subjected to a body fitted c type mesh quality orthogonal cells are clustered due to the presence of sharp gradients arising from the rapid changes in the flow physics on the surface and the wake region of the airfoil it also enabled a smooth transition from the airfoil surface towards the outer flow field with quality hexahedral elements three sets of mesh grading are generated g 1 g 2 g 3 to perform the mesh independence study g 2 grading factor has adequately captured the dynamics of flow and provided accurate values of aerodynamic coefficient value with the least computational time see fig 3 the extent of the computational domain is selected by a domain sensitivity study details of which can be found in the previously published article by the authors nordanger et al 2015a based on the study a domain size of 20 c in the downstream direction 8c in the upwind direction and a circular arc of radius 8c connecting the upper and lower surface are employed the 2d mesh is extruded with the same underlying mesh topology to obtain the 3d computational domain mesh information of both the spatial dimensions can be found in table 1 3 2 time step selection of u grid δ x and time step size δ t is done such that the overall numerical stability of the solution remains intact to keep track of stability the courant number c u δ t δ x is monitored and designed to remain less than one openfoam 4 0 of 4 0 has a unique feature of self adjusting the time step size based on the courant number constraints which has been used to bound the solution an initial accurate time step estimation is still required for maintaining the overall accuracy of the solution therefore a time independence study has provided an accurate estimate of the initial time step a time step size of 0 0001 s is observed to produce time independent results for lift and drag coefficients thus it is selected as the initial time step size for the simulations in the manuscript 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the simulation has been first validated against the experimental test of piziali 1993 therefore the numerical framework and boundary conditions are selected to match consistently with the experimental setup of the authors the flow constants are based on a reference fluid density ρ 1 225 kg m3 dynamic viscosity of μ 1 82 1 0 5 kg m s constant flow velocity of u 20 m s and the r e 1 96 1 0 6 the flow field is assumed fully turbulent and the transition from laminar to turbulent regime inside the boundary layer is not explicitly modeled on the upper and lower surface of the airfoil velocity inlet boundary condition is employed at the inlet with the fixed value of velocity u 20 0 0 outflow condition is imposed on the opposite side of the domain and assigned a constant value of zero pressure drop upper and lower walls are subjected to slip boundary conditions the computational domain is extended to a unit length in the third dimension as of 4 0 required a unit dimension in the normal direction for computing the solution the two new boundaries in 2d front and back are subjected to symmetry boundary conditions no slip condition is employed for the airfoil upper and lower surface with zero pressure gradients specialized wall functions in openfoam has been used i e epsilonwallfunction omegawallfunction kqrwallfunction liu 2016 are utilized to relax the concentration of mesh resolution near the airfoil surface to provide an accurate estimate of the initial flow field an analytical solver is run first which has improved convergence and reduced the overall simulation time the schematic of different boundary conditions imposed on the computational setup is shown in fig 3 3 4 solver setting the present solver within the of 4 0 jasak 1996 2008 framework is utilized to impose the continuity constraints an elliptic equation of pressure is employed by imposing the divergence constraints on the momentum equation this procedure forms a pressure modified equation which is solved in a segregated manner with the turbulence equations a pimple combination of piso simple algorithm is employed which has allowed taking bigger steps in the temporal direction the equations are discretized in a finite volume technique and integrated over control volumes cv using the green gauss divergence theorem thus volume integrals are transformed into surface integrals of the cv second order linear discretization is employed for all the equations except k and turbulence equations which used upwind convection the gradient term is divided by a sum coming from orthogonal and non orthogonal parts full non orthogonal correction is realized for all equations as solver stability is not trivial owing to the utilization of particular computational mesh to solve the systems of governing equations geometric agglomerated algebraic multigrid gamg solver is employed the solution time is reduced by applying dic gauss seidel as a smoother which damp the oscillations in the solution and enhances convergence broeckhoven et al 2004 the convection terms are discretized with bounded gauss upwind since it is known to be less dissipative and highly stable broeckhoven et al 2004 for the solution of diffusion term in the ns equation gauss linear corrected is employed the first order implicit scheme is used for the solution of time marching term the magnitudes of density and pressure are by extrapolating the data from the centers of the neighboring points 3 5 simulation length convergence is achieved for the flow field variables using the time step size obtained from the independence study δ 0 0001 seconds accurate estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients is obtained in connection with the experimental results simulations results for low α required approximately three thousand time iteration to reach convergence see fig 4 a however simulations at higher α required approximately ten thousand time levels to meet the convergence criteria residuals 1 0 6 cumulative lift and drag values are monitored in parallel to determine if the steady state values are achieved 3 6 definition of test cases first the numerical setup is validated at α 0 then multiple test cases are run for two dimensional analysis simulations are performed over range of α i e α 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 using all the three turbulence models to conduct 3d simulations 2d cases are extruded in the third direction with a fixed mesh topology sixty cases are numerically investigated in this entire study and the performance parameters c l c d c p are carefully monitored 4 results and discussion the results are presented for each turbulence model over the range of α by monitoring the flow behavior over the airfoil surface three flow regimes are recognized the first regime is identified as the attached flow regime 0 α 11 inside which the streamlines remain attached to the airfoil s upper and lower surfaces a mild separation starts to appear inside secondary flow regime 11 α 13 and the flow streamlines begin to separate from the airfoils trailing edge the detachment in the flow is not enough at this stage to cause oscillations to appear in the lift and drag values in the stall flow regime 13 α 17 the airfoil experiences a dramatic loss in the lift coefficient and vortex shedding starts to appear in the form of leading and trailing edge vortices these intermittent rotational vortices get combined in the wake and generate a von karman vortex street liao et al 2004 tabib et al 2017 a sudden rise is the magnitudes of drag coefficients are also observed at this point because of vortex shedding the magnitudes of the aerodynamic coefficient keep oscillating about a mean value 4 1 time history and convergence rapid convergence rates are observed for the simulations conducted in the attached flow regime the first few hundred time steps manifested initial instabilities in the coefficient values however all the solutions for the attached flow achieved convergence within 1000 times step iterations among the models faster convergence rates are observed for the sa model which is mainly due to the solution of only one additional transport equation for the prediction of small scale turbulence no oscillations in the aerodynamic coefficients are reported for α 11 for any turbulence model which is a manifestation of the attached flow around over the airfoil oscillations started to appear for k ϵ and k ω sst inside mild separation regime even at this point the sa model predicted constant values of coefficients with no sign of vortex shedding in terms of the convergence rates k ω sst have shown superior performance as compared to k ϵ which has taken approximately 20 000 iterations to reach the desired residuals 10 6 vortex shedding of various sizes and strength is observed from the time history of aerodynamic coefficients for k ω sst and k ϵ turbulence models k ω sst models dominated the vortex frequency and strength as compared to the k ϵ fig 5 provides a quantitative comparison further explanation using spectral analysis will be outlined in section 4 5 4 2 drag lift and pressure coefficients in general k ω sst and k ϵ have shown a good comparison with the experimental data unlike the sa model which failed altogether to capture the stagnation point and the flow separation for the k ω sst and k ϵ smaller differences in the magnitudes of surface pressure distributions have produced substantial variations in the lift and drag values prediction by each model the monitored values of the aerodynamic coefficients are presented in the subsequent section 4 2 1 lift c l the lift coefficients for the k ω sst k ϵ and sa turbulence models are in good agreement with experiments at most incidence angles in particular k ω sst model has shown the good estimates at all incidence angles the sa model has performed well at lower α but shows unsatisfactory behavior at α in the stall regime the k ϵ model has shown discrepancies in predicting the transition between flow regimes however k ϵ are better than k ω sst for α 15 and 17 4 2 2 drag c d for the prediction of the drag coefficient only k ω sst model has shown a good match against the experimental data whereas the k ϵ model has only shown a reasonable estimate of drag coefficients inside the attached flow regime for the mildly separated and stall regions it has produced higher values sa model on the other hand over predicts the values throughout the band of numerical simulations under all regimes 4 2 3 pressure coefficient c p comparison of the pressure coefficient at α 17 is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that all models match consistently well with the c p predicted by the experiments sa model reports higher values of c p at the bottom surface of the airfoil whereas on the top surface it exhibits lower value unlike the other models a similar trend of c p is observed on the top and bottom surface of the airfoil for k ϵ and k ω sst model the magnitude of c p at the lower surface is less for k ϵ in comparison to the k ω sst in general k ω sst model compares well against the experimental data consistently this manifests the ability of k ω sst model to predict accurate pressure distribution around the airfoil surface which is also paramount for the accurate prediction of lift and drag magnitudes similar results were also identified by tachos et al 2010 4 3 prediction of the stall and flow structure characterization the sa model is not able to capture the flow detachment point α c r i t i c a l for the airfoil see fig 6 a even though it predicts the magnitude of lift coefficient in the vicinity of the experimental data the overall trend for the lift profile is observed to increase with the rise of incidence angles this is believed to happen since sa model adds only a single additional variable for an undamped kinematic eddy viscosity and is effective model at low reynolds number regime in its original form it does not accurately compute fields that exhibit shear flow separated flow or decaying turbulence wilcox 1993 at higher reynolds number for the present investigations wall functions liu 2016 are employed to improve its prediction capability towards the flow around naca0015 airfoil the k ϵ and k ω sst models accurately represent the flow separation point α c r i t i c a l 13 which is found to be in agreement with the behavior of the aerodynamic coefficients observed in the experiments an increase in the angle of attack from 15 to 17 implies a sudden loss of lift and a dramatic rise in drag see figs 6 a 6 b the obtained results from each model is summarized in table 2 corresponding to the experimental data to study the qualitative behavior snapshots of velocity magnitude are plotted at α 13 15 17 to highlight qualitative differences between the turbulence models each model has captured a certain amount of separation along with vortex shedding of variable size and strength the examination of contours in fig 8 highlights the position of flow reversal point the sa model produced the least amount of reverse flow at higher α no oscillations are reported in the time history of aerodynamic coefficients for both c l and c d as observed in section 4 2 whereas the k ω sst model gives the largest reverse flow behind the wake of the airfoil this unsteadiness in the flow is explicitly visible in fig 6 a a similar flow pattern is identified for k ω sst and k ϵ at α 15 the flow characteristics of the stall regime have shown sharp intermittent trailing and leading edge flow separation this causes highly non linear behavior which is characterized by the shedding of circular eddies developed into a von karman vortex street to better understand the evolution of vortex shedding snapshots of streamline over the airfoil are plotted in fig 7 the development of flow reversal points portrays the evolution of stall vortex and the phenomenon of flow separation initially the flow starts to separate from the trailing edge region then move towards the leading edge until the flow reversal point is reached stall vortex thus first develops peak in size before moving away from the surface the point of flow reversal also moves away from the leading edge with the shedding of the vortex 4 4 2d versus 3d simulations the baseline mesh of 2d is extended a unit dimension in the third direction z with underlying mesh parameters untouched the boundary condition is switched from two dimensions z 0 to three dimensions z 0 on the upper and lower surface of the domain such that a three dimensional solution can be calculated the present numerical setup is motivated by the studies conducted in sagmo et al 2016 which has adopted a similar configuration to study the three dimensional characteristics for asymmetrical s826 airfoil a significant increase in the simulation time is experienced for 3d simulation in comparison to the 2d approximately five times more vorticity along the spanwise direction is plotted in fig 9 a which depicts a consistent flow pattern throughout the blade length in the z direction no transverse flow distribution is observed which is considered a prime reason for a similar flow pattern in the third spatial dimension the contours of the flow spectrum superimposed with the streamlines positioned at 0 3z and 0 8z are illustrated in fig 10 vortex stretching is visible in the wake structure behind the airfoil in both dimensions the extent of flow separation distinctly indicates the stall regime of the airfoil over the entire span of α three dimensional results consistently matched well with the two dimensional predictions it is concluded that stand alone two dimensional simulations can determine the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil with sufficient accuracy due to the limitation of space only partial results at α 15 are presented in the present article 4 5 frequency spectrum of vortex shedding fig 11 depicts the oscillations in the aerodynamic coefficient for angle of attack greater than the stall angle α 13 regular von karman vortex street is recognized with the instability in the values of flow variables inside the boundary layer for the two turbulence models the vortex separation mechanism roll up and detachment from the surface affects the pressure distribution to cause intermittent fluctuation in the values of aerodynamic coefficients the magnitude of these oscillations is similar for the two models spectral analysis was performed on the time series of the aerodynamic list coefficient to extract the dominant frequencies the time history of the cfd simulations constituted approximately 10 s of the simulation length which corresponds to the periodic behavior over 20 complete cycles of vortex shedding fig 12 represents the power spectra of the lift fluctuations at α 17 for k ω sst and k ϵ turbulence models these fluctuations are comparable to the one obtained from the flows around circular cylinders nayfeh et al 2005 a strong quadratic and cubic couplings are observed in the frequency harmonics unlike to cylinder where only fundamental and odd coupling are observed nayfeh et al 2003a the magnitude of the fundamental frequency at α 17 is 0 9 and 1 5 for k ϵ and k ω sst models respectively the second harmonic is exhibited at the quadratic frequency of 1 8 and 3 0 f s f s 2 f s whereas cubic coupling of the frequency is seen at 3 f s both models have shown distinct magnitudes and peaks for the fundamental frequency and its quadratic and cubic couplings the coupling of the rest of the frequencies diminishes at higher α due to larger separation and less interaction with the airfoil surface 4 6 the simplified reduced order model based on the high fidelity solution and spectral decomposition of the time history of coefficients a rom is developed to model lift the proposed rom is based on the van der pol model nayfeh et al 2003b the developed equation for the rom is given by eq 10 10 c l ϖ 2 c l υ c l γ c l c l ϱ c l 2 c l where the parameters υ ϱ ϖ γ are all positive real numbers presence of term c l c l in eq 10 implies phase difference of around π 2 among the fundamental frequency and its first even harmonic in eq 10 the angular frequency ϖ is related to the actual shedding frequency ϖ s 2 π f s here υ accounts for the linear damping ϱ and γ represents the magnitudes of the nonlinear damping coefficients the oscillator equation is solved employing the multiple scales method nayfeh 1993 2000 the coefficients of the oscillator which are related to the

2 the model parameters ϖ υ ϱ γ are calculated using the magnitudes of first second and third harmonics computed from the spectral analysis see fig 12 after determining all the required parameters eq 10 is developed into an ode and integrated using runge kutta numerical routine the obtained result of c l from rom is compared with fom in fig 13 the geometry parameter α is developed such that it can vary without altering the original rom equation the model parameters obtained for the k ω sst and k ϵ model at α 15 17 are summarized in table 3 vortex shedding frequency increases with α and we obtain significantly higher magnitudes for k ω sst model as compared to k ϵ the rom compares well with fom regarding the overall trend of the time history of c l it can be seen that rom slightly underestimates the extremal values however the overall quantification of error shows a deviation of less than 4 in addition to the time domain the main strength of the proposed rom is its ability to capture well spectral domains the strong first three harmonics are represented with reasonable accuracy for the k ω sst and k ϵ model at α 15 17 as shown in fig 14 this manifests that aerodynamic characteristics can be accurately represented using proposed rom in terms of aerodynamic lift coefficient with significantly less computational constraints for instance present fom simulation takes approximately twenty minutes of simulation time to provide temporal lift coefficient running in parallel on four cores intel xeon e5 2680 v2 while rom corresponding to the reduced degree of freedom predicted similar estimated values in less than two seconds running in serial on a desktop computer with intel i7 9700te cpu 4 7 rom model in predictive settings the proposed rom model has shown remarkable improvements in terms of computational time and determining correct estimates of the aerodynamic loading of the lift coefficients compared against the fom herein the rom capability is tested further in a predictive setting to access its validity for a wide range of operating conditions c l is computed at α 16 using both high fidelity simulation models and rom approach the model parameters are calculated through cubic interpolation from the data obtained for α 15 17 listed in table 3 we obtained positive values of our damping parameters which are reflective of the limit cycle at the same time magnitudes obtained at two different geometric parameters showed similar trends for the linear quadratic and cubic damping coefficients which further highlights the accuracy of present rom we also notice a decreasing trend for damping parameter values at higher geometric incidence α which is considered because of the drop in the c l in the stall regime the time histories for the c l obtained by using fom and rom are displayed in fig 15 it can be observed that present rom not only satisfies prediction in the time domain but also in the spectral domain in order to effectively test quantification of error percentage errors are compared from fom and the rom solution in terms of the fundamental frequency in the spectra the reported error is found to be around 5 which we consider acceptable given the significantly reduced computation time overall the proposed model performed extremely well in a predictive setting and able to capture very well the overall trend of the lifting behavior computed by the fom 5 conclusions traditionally oscillator models were proposed for determining the vortex induce vibrations around cylindrical structures the current work presented the van der pol based oscillator model for a study involving turbulent flow around the naca0015 airfoil the flow was simulated in two and three dimensions using three different rans turbulence models spalart allmaras k ϵ and k ω sst model the numerical results were analyzed in both the time and frequency domains the existence of both even and odd harmonics in the spectral analysis is reported for the airfoil unlike the harmonics appearing in the cylindrical structures which normally show odd couplings herein a simplified rom based on the van der pol equation was proposed for the airfoil operation in the stall regime with an additional term introduced to cater for the quadratic couplings and its results were compared against the high fidelity simulations major findings of the work are enumerated below inside the attached 0 α 11 and mildly separated 11 α 13 regimes all the three turbulence models illustrated a reasonable comparison especially for the prediction of the aerodynamic lift in the stall regime 13 α 17 k ω sst and k ϵ to certain extent successfully captured the vortex shedding phenomena sa model altogether failed to demonstrate the adverse pressure gradients around the airfoil insignificant differences between the 2d and 3d simulation results showed that the flow was not dominated by three dimensional flow structures significant enough to affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the blade thus it can be concluded that in the absence of any tapering of the blade geometry along its length 2d simulations suffices when comparing the results across different turbulence models k ω sst turbulence model demonstrated superior performance strong quadratic and cubic non linearities were identified in the temporal history of the lift coefficient a rom based on the van der pol oscillator was proposed to model the aerodynamic lift coefficient at a higher angle of attacks the model coefficients were computed using the results from high fidelity simulations the addition of a quadratic nonlinearity to the rom equation further improved its accuracy the results obtained from the rom compared well with the cfd result in the time domain the model was then integrated to test the aerodynamic lift coefficient in a predictive setting which correlated well with the high fidelity simulation results the peaks were only observed to be 5 apart a turbine blade can be divided into an inner segment and an outer segment while the former is designed with the structural integrity of the turbines in mind the later is designed to maximize torque generation it has been found in the past studies that flow around the outer sections of a blade remains attached to the surface in such a situation the rom model proposed in this work can be useful however when it comes to the segment closer to the hub where massive flow separation takes place the current rom model will fail for such a situation we are in the process of developing a rom

22201,offshore net cages are aquaculture facilities that can provide satisfactory volumes of stocked fish the safety of these structures is of great importance to aquaculture companies typhoons are considered to be the main cause of damage to offshore net cages in this study an artificial neural network ann model was developed to predict the structural failure of high density polyethylene offshore net cages in typhoon waves a case study was conducted where the ann model was used to predict the structural failure of the offshore net cages around nanji island wenzhou china during typhoon maria field survey was performed to study the hydrodynamics of the offshore net cages in different wave conditions and the results were used as the training data for the ann model by classifying the structural failure the damage levels of offshore net cages can be predicted and used with wave forecasting before typhoon landing field survey was carried out immediately after the typhoon the prediction and field survey results showed that the proposed ann model can accurately predict the damage levels of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoon waves keywords prediction model structural failure offshore net cage artificial neural network field survey 1 introduction typhoons are powerful cyclonic vortices that form on tropical and subtropical oceans these weather phenomena are usually accompanied by violent winds storm surges and extreme waves typhoons are one of the major natural disasters in coastal areas and are harmful to coastal engineering structures especially floating offshore net cages in the east china sea for example marine aquaculture may be hit by several typhoons annually the destruction mechanism of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoon waves is highly complex for this reason it is crucial to consider the vulnerability of offshore net cages in the marine environment it is also crucial to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages during typhoons and storm surges in order to evaluate the risk of damage to these structures and the results may provide insight on how to improve aquaculture insurance and risk management offshore net cages fig 1 are flexible floating structures consisting of mooring lines a floating collar a net chamber and a sinker system these structures are typically exposed to normal operating sea conditions fatigue failure of the offshore net cage components may occur owing to accumulation of fatigue damage in natural disasters such as typhoons or storm surges the failure modes of offshore net cages are breakage of the mooring lines breakage of the floating collar and damage to the net system which may cause fish to die or escape fig 2 the dynamic response of offshore net cages under the action of waves and currents forms the basis for structural design and integrity of these structures previous studies were primarily focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore net cages for instance lader and enerhaug 2005 found that the forces and deformation of a flexible net structure were mutually and highly dependent on each other huang et al 2006 proposed a numerical model based on the lump mass method to analyze the dynamic characteristics of a net cage system exposed in open sea moe et al 2010 computed the load distributions of a net cage subjected to currents and weights using a commercial explicit finite element software tsukrov et al 2011 conducted experimental studies of the drag forces on copper alloy net panels and they proposed empirical normal drag coefficients for various types of copper netting kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 analyzed the effects of the mooring line loads on the aquaculture net cage using physical model tests and numerical simulations huang et al 2016 investigated the dynamic deformation of the floating collar of a net cage under a combination of waves and currents bi et al 2017 carried out a numerical study on wave attenuation inside and around a square array of net cages taking into account net biofouling gansel et al 2018 used full scale towing tests to analyze the drag forces and deformations of the fish cage in the field in general the ability of an offshore net cage to withstand currents and waves is directly related to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cage however it is also essential to analyze the structural strength and failure of offshore net cages kim et al 2014 performed structural analysis of a submersible abalone aquaculture cage for deployment in exposed marine environments liu et al 2019 computed the structural strength and failure of a floating collar of a single point mooring fish cage using the finite element method the structural analysis can be integrated into the design framework to prevent catastrophic failures of the net cage system because structural modeling is generally time consuming predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages cannot be carried out in a quick efficient manner to a certain extent the appropriate preventive measures will ensure the safety of offshore net cages and reduce disaster related losses during a typhoon therefore it is crucial to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages before typhoon landing however at present there are only typhoon warning systems and wave forecasting available to date there are no systems developed to forecast the damage levels of offshore net cages however there is substantial research on the prediction of potential marine disasters for example sztobryn 2003 constructed and verified a model of sea level changes during a storm surge the model was constructed based on artificial neural network ann and the model was used for hydrological forecasting in a tideless sea zhou and zhao 2003 performed active control of an offshore platform under random waves by combining classical optimal control with ann french et al 2017 predicted the tidal surge inundation at estuarine ports using machine learning and computational hydrodynamics doong et al 2018 developed an ann with backpropagation algorithm to build an early warning model for coastal freak wave forecasting although ann has been applied for hydrological forecasting active control of offshore structures prediction of tidal surge inundation and freak wave forecasting there are limited studies on predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages during a typhoon in general the destruction of an offshore net cage consists of three parts 1 breakage of the floating collar 2 failure of the mooring system and 3 damage of the net chamber the damage or failure of these components can be described by their corresponding ultimate strength such as maximum stress of the floating collar maximum tension of the mooring lines and minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber the structural failure of the offshore net cage can be determined when one of the damage factors reaches or exceeds the threshold value of the structure offshore net cages installed in open seas are exposed to random waves however in this study failure is considered to occur when the ultimate bearing capacity of the offshore net cage is exceeded therefore the maximum wave height is considered to be the dominant disaster causing factor however in an irregular wave train the maximum wave height is random and difficult to determine therefore it is challenging to establish the relationship between the maximum wave height and the damage factors of the offshore net cage hence in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of regular waves are used as the training data of the ann model instead of those of irregular waves the hydrodynamics of the offshore net cage can usually be obtained by numerical simulations or physical model experiments however both of these approaches are rather time consuming and therefore it is difficult to issue rapid warnings of offshore net cage damage before a typhoon thus in this study ann is combined with the hydrodynamic characteristics obtained from numerical simulations to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages 2 methodology in this study ann was used to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages in typhoon waves the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages obtained from numerical simulations were used as the training data for the ann model the damage levels of the offshore net cages can be classified by setting a reasonable threshold value for each damage factor with early warnings of typhoon waves it is possible to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in a target sea area the prediction accuracy of the ann model was verified by comparing the prediction results with those from field survey after a typhoon attack fig 3 shows the flow chart of the methodology adopted in this study to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages 2 1 development of the ann model ann is a new technology that has developed rapidly in recent years ann is a complex network composed of many simple units connected with each other ann is inspired from biological neural networks in the human brain and shares some of the operational characteristics ann has its own unique advantages in solving problems especially those that involve large scale parallel computing and nonlinear fitting as mentioned in section 1 an offshore net cage consists of mooring lines a floating collar a net chamber and a sinker system the failure of the offshore net cage in typhoon waves is a complex nonlinear process if one of the main components of the offshore net cage fails the entire structure will fail as long as the data used to train the ann model are sufficient and accurate the structural failure of the offshore net cage can be analyzed quickly and accurately in this study feedforward neural network combined with error backpropagation algorithm was used to discern the complex relationship between the hazard factors input layer and the damage factors output layer this method is known as backpropagation neural network bpnn which is a variant of ann in this model the input values are transformed inside each neuron where the input values interact with the assigned weights and biases using the activation function the values are then aggregated into a single value and the weights of the neural network are fine tuned based on the error rate in the previous iteration in this study the gradient descent method was employed to reset the weights in the neural network a neural network typically consists of three types of layers 1 input layer 2 hidden layer and 3 output layer the shallow machine learning algorithm was adopted owing to the relatively small amount of data and low processing difficulty in general it is not desirable to increase the number of hidden layers in the neural network because this may reduce the learning efficiency therefore the conventional three layer ann architecture was chosen in this study with only one hidden layer fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a is the input layer and b is the output layer the input and output layers are connected by weights and so are the hidden and output layers a bias is provided for each neuron in the hidden and output layers before training the system automatically sets the initial values for the weights and biases in the ann model after training all of the weights and biases are reset the ann model uses a large number of input and output data to conduct the training process and determine the optimum set of weights and biases finally the unknown parameters are fed to the input layer and the corresponding output value is obtained automatically 2 2 verification of the ann model typhoons which are a major threat to the safety of offshore net cages occur frequently in the southeast coastal area of china based on historical data on the conditions of offshore net cages after typhoon attacks the structural failure of offshore net cages is characterized by broken mooring lines broken floating collar and reduced effective volume ratio the offshore net cage will drift away with the currents if the mooring lines are broken all of the reared fish will escape if the floating collar and net chamber collapse the effective volume of the offshore net cage periodically changes depending on the wave conditions which may culminate in death of farmed fish if there is severe reduction in the net cage volume therefore the maximum tension of the mooring lines the maximum stress of the floating collar and the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber were the three main indexes chosen to measure the structural failure of the offshore net cages in this study the input parameters of the ann model consisted of geographical parameter water depth hydrological parameters wave height and wave period and structural parameters specifications of the offshore net cage all of these parameters were obtained from field survey according to previous studies zhao et al 2007 water currents affect the load distribution and motion of offshore net cages the influence of water currents on the dynamic characteristics of offshore net cages can also be considered for the ann model however based on gray correlation analysis on the historical data of the damages of offshore net cages around nanji island waves were found to be the dominant factor causing structural failure of offshore net cages in addition before a typhoon the department of marine monitoring and forecasting forecasts the wave parameters and the officers are incapable of forecasting the water currents hence the water current velocity was not taken as one of the input parameters of the ann model the output parameters of the ann model consisted of the maximum tension of the mooring lines the maximum stress of the floating collar and the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber by classifying the damage levels and setting the threshold values for the output parameters used to indicate the structural response the damage levels of the offshore net cages in typhoon waves can be determined the middle layer of the ann model was the hidden layer empirical approach is the most common method used to determine the number of hidden nodes and several rules have been proposed for this purpose doong et al 2018 in this study the number of neurons in the hidden layer n was determined by model training fitting precision and the number of iterations in the authors previous study zhao et al 2019a the number of hidden neurons used to predict the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar were set as 4 4 and 5 respectively to assess the reliability of the ann model an error function is defined as follows 1 e 1 n k 1 k t k p k p k 100 where t k is the target value and p k is the predicted value the differences between the predicted and target values were checked for the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar the maximum relative errors for these parameters were found to be within 5 when the number of hidden neurons were set as 4 4 and 5 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages in different wave conditions were obtained using the dut flexsim software developed at dalian university of technology china zhao et al 2015a the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model had been validated by comparing the numerical simulation results with those from physical model experiments bi et al 2014 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2007 the tension of the mooring lines and deformation of the net chamber can be simulated using the lumped mass method coded in dut flexsim in addition the stress distribution of the floating collar can be determined by combining the finite element model with the lumped mass method which has been described in detail in the authors previous studies zhao et al 2015b zhao et al 2019a both the lumped mass method and the finite element model had been validated against the results from physical model experiments and thus validation of the hydrodynamic model is not presented herein to verify the accuracy of the ann model the prediction results were compared with the numerical simulation results obtained in the authors previous study zhao et al 2019b the maximum relative errors were 3 8 3 3 and 5 4 for the maximum stress of the floating collar minimum effective volume of the net chamber and maximum tension of the mooring lines respectively the corresponding maximum standard deviations for these parameters were 0 12 mpa 1 8 and 1 59 kn respectively 2 3 classification of the damage levels of the offshore net cages predicting the structural failure of the offshore net cages is based on a large number of hydrological data and the specifications of the offshore net cages these data were supplied to the hydrodynamic model to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages which were then used to train the ann model the ann model was used to establish the relationship between the input and output vectors the input data wave height wave period water depth and specifications of offshore net cage were supplied to the input layer the output data maximum tension of the mooring lines minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and maximum stress of the floating collar were simultaneously sent to the output layer the effective volume ratio is defined as v c v 0 where v c is the minimum value of the varying volume of the net chamber in the waves and v 0 is the original volume of the net chamber in china the warnings for most natural disasters e g typhoons cold air and snowstorms are classified into four levels blue yellow orange and red indicating the severity of the phenomenon blue mild red extreme therefore in this study the warnings for the structural failure of the offshore net cages were also divided into four levels based on the results of many field surveys on typhoons the structural failure of offshore net cages can be classified as level i level ii level iii and level iv indicating severe damage serious damage moderate damage and slight damage respectively table 1 shows the general description of these damage levels systematic questionnaire surveys were carried out to quantitatively classify the damage levels of the offshore net cages based on a comprehensive evaluation of the structural damage repairability and economic loss the damage levels of offshore net cages can be quantified as follows for damage level i the main floating pipe is obviously broken the floating collar is partially submerged in water and more than half of the handrails collapse in the floating collar system in addition more than half of the mooring lines are broken which causes the offshore net cage to drag and crash more than half of the connections between the net and floating collar are also broken for damage level ii the main floating pipe is severely bent and more than half of the handrails have largely deformed the number of failed mooring lines is not more than half of the total number of mooring lines the offshore net cage has an obvious horizontal displacement nearly half of the connections between the floating collar and net are broken for damage level iii many local slight bends and deformations occur in the main floating pipe and handrails respectively dragging does not occur in the mooring lines because of the partially broken strands there are a few disconnections between the floating collar and net finally for damage level iv some creases occur in the main floating pipe there are slightly broken strands in the mooring lines in addition there are no disconnections between the floating collar and net the damage of the offshore net cage components is closely related to the ultimate strength of the respective materials thus in this study the percentage of the ultimate strength of various components was used as the criterion to define the boundaries of the damage levels the structural responses of the offshore net cage induced by external environmental loads stress of the floating collar effective volume ratio of net chamber and tension of the mooring lines were classified based on the preset boundaries which had been verified and corrected after many typhoon disasters the fatigue damage and material aging of the offshore net cage components were accounted for by reducing the threshold value for each classification this is also why the structural strength threshold is less than 100 even for damage level i owing to the depreciation of the offshore net cage structure the bearing capacities of the components cannot reach the initial values of the designed strength table 2 shows the criteria used to define the boundaries for the damage levels of the offshore net cages the relationship between the structural response of the offshore net cage and damage level was established based on these criteria 3 training data for the ann model a case study was conducted for the offshore net cages around nanji island which is located 55 km away from wenzhou china the high density polyethylene hdpe offshore net cages are mainly distributed in three areas guosheng ao mazu ao and zhuyu fig 5 two mariculture companies companies a and b are located at guosheng ao and zhuyu respectively whereas four mariculture companies companies c d e and f are located at mazu ao there is only one company company f that owns offshore net cages with a circumference of 60 m whereas the other offshore net cages have a circumference of 40 m fig 6 shows the distribution map of the offshore net cages in mazu ao the tidal feature in this area is regular semidiurnal tides tropical cyclone is the most disastrous weather phenomenon in this area with a maximum surge reaching 2 m the waves in this area are mainly influenced by monsoon winds and tropical cyclones the strong waves move in the east direction in this study all of the offshore net cages are moored in a four point configuration other geometric parameters of the offshore net cages are listed in table 3 based on the historical data provided by the zhejiang marine motoring and forecasting center the maximum significant wave height nearly reached 10 2 m during typhoon senlaku on september 7 2002 the significant wave height reached 8 6 m during typhoon haitang on july 19 2005 the monthly average minimum wave period was 5 49 s whereas the monthly average maximum wave period was 19 4 s based on these data the hydrodynamic characteristics of regular waves were used to train the ann model as shown in table 4 in reality offshore net cages installed in an open sea are exposed to irregular waves however in this study failure is considered to occur when the ultimate bearing capacity of the offshore net cage is exceeded therefore the maximum wave height is considered to be the dominant disaster causing factor however in an irregular wave train the maximum wave height is random and difficult to determine therefore it is challenging to establish the relationship between the maximum wave height and damage factors of the offshore net cage dong et al 2010 confirmed that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cage in irregular waves were the same as those of the offshore net cage in regular waves with a wave height equal to the average of the highest one tenth wave height of the corresponding irregular wave hence in this study regular waves were chosen to train the ann model the average water depth of the aquaculture area where the offshore net cages were deployed was 20 m considering a 3 m surge of the sea level the water depths used for the computations were 20 22 and 23 m by using the in house dut flexsim software the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar in typhoon waves can be determined figs 7 9 show the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference based on the material properties the permissible limit for the maximum tension of the mooring lines was 90 kn and the permissible limit for the maximum stress of the floating collar was 6 mpa for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference however for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference the permissible limit for the maximum tension of the mooring lines was 120 kn and the permissible limit for the maximum stress of the floating collar was 25 mpa because of the larger thickness and diameter of the floating collar 4 case study using the ann model 4 1 hydrological data during typhoon maria typhoon maria no 1808 formed on july 4 2018 in the western pacific ocean east of the philippines and the typhoon landed at the huangqi peninsula lianjiang fujian province on july 11 2018 when typhoon maria was landing the maximum wind speed near the center of the typhoon was 42 m s and the minimum central pressure was 96 kpa which weakened rapidly after landing fig 10 shows the path of typhoon maria nanji island was affected by typhoon maria because it is located within level 10 wind circles based on the data provided by the marine buoy station east of nanji island a maximum significant wave height of 7 5 m was observed on july 11 2018 and the maximum wave height simultaneously reached 9 9 m according to another marine buoy station west of nanji island the maximum significant wave height reached 4 2 m and a maximum wave height of 7 3 m was also observed according to the early warning issued by the zhejiang marine monitoring and forecasting center waves with a maximum wave height of 6 8 m occurred on july 10 2018 at 14 00 in the offshore areas around nanji island during typhoon maria waves with a maximum wave height of 6 m appeared in mazu ao whereas waves with a maximum wave height of 7 m occurred in zhuyu however the maximum wave height was only 4 m in guosheng ao the average wave period varied from 4 5 s to 6 0 s in mazu ao the offshore net cages were distributed in an area with an average water depth of 20 22 m in zhuyu and guosheng ao the offshore net cages were distributed in an area with an average water depth of 22 and 20 m respectively the hydrological parameters wave height wave period and water depth used to predict the damage levels of the offshore net cages in mazu ao zhuyu and guosheng ao are summarized in tables 5 7 respectively it shall be noted that the wave heights given in these tables are the one tenth wave heights of the random waves monitored during typhoon maria 4 2 prediction results the hydrological parameters and specifications of the offshore net cages were inputted into the trained ann model and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages were predicted rapidly the structural failure of the offshore net cages in mazu ao zhuyu and guosheng ao was predicted based on the hydrodynamic characteristics and the damage level classification provided in section 2 3 fig 11 shows the maximum tension of the mooring lines for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao in general the values were slightly higher for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference compared with those for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference the maximum tension of the mooring lines for all offshore net cages in mazu ao nearly exceeded 36 kn the maximum tension of the mooring lines of the offshore net cages in zhuyu and guosheng ao were 37 and 20 kn respectively therefore the damage level of the mooring lines was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in mazu ao and zhuyu in contrast the damage level of the mooring lines was level iv for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference in mazu ao because of the different permissible limits for the mooring lines however there was no damage to the mooring lines for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao next the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber for the offshore net cages was predicted using the ann model offshore net cages are flexible structures and thus the effective volume ratio of the net chamber varies depending on the wave conditions fig 12 shows the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao the minimum effective volume ratio reached 0 58 indicating that the damage level of the net system was level ii in addition the minimum effective volume ratios were lower for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference compared with those for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference the minimum effective volume ratio was 0 61 for the offshore net cages in zhuyu based on the damage level classification of the offshore net cages in section 2 3 the damage level of the net system was level iii for the offshore net cages in this area the minimum effective volume ratio was 0 65 for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao and therefore the corresponding damage level of the net system was level iii finally the maximum stress of the floating collar for the offshore net cages in the three areas was predicted using the ann model in general the floating collar withstands loads imposed by the net mooring lines and waves the loads imposed by the net will increase with an increase in the circumference of the offshore net cage hence the maximum stress of the floating collar will be higher for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference than that for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference fig 13 shows the maximum stress of the floating collar for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao the maximum stress of floating collar was 3 66 mpa for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference whereas the value exceeded 6 mpa for the other offshore net cages according to the forecasted wave parameters the maximum stress of the floating collar of the offshore net cages in zhuyu was 3 0 mpa in contrast the maximum stress of the floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao was only 1 8 mpa the damage levels of the floating collars were different owing to the different permissible limits for the maximum stress of the floating collar the damage level of the floating collar was level ii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in zhuyu and mazu ao in contrast the damage level of the floating collar was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference there was no damage to the floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao in summary the damage levels of the different components of the offshore net cages in mazu ao guosheng ao and zhuyu were considered in this study if either one of the offshore net cage components i e the mooring lines netting system or floating collar fail then the entire structure will fail therefore the predicted damage level was level ii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in mazu ao and zhuyu however the predicted damage level was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference owing to the reduction in the offshore net cage volume likewise the predicted damage level was level iii for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao for the same reason 4 3 field survey after typhoon attack to identify the damage conditions of the offshore net cages owned by companies a f around nanji island during typhoon maria a field survey was conducted on july 13 2018 in the aftermath of the typhoon attack the details of the damage conditions of the offshore net cages are summarized in table 8 the damage levels were determined by comparing specific parts of each damaged offshore net cage with the criteria presented in section 2 3 the total number of damaged offshore net cages around nanji island was 22 there were 11 offshore net cages in mazu ao with damage level ii fig 14 and the remaining offshore net cages were classified as damage level iii fig 15 all of the offshore cages in zhuyu were classified as damage level ii 5 discussion based on the field survey around nanji island most of the offshore net cages that survived typhoon maria were damaged the damaged components of the offshore net cages comprise breakage of the main floating pipe disconnections between the floating collar and net and partial failure of the mooring lines in general the damage levels of the offshore net cages installed in different areas were different in addition the damage level of the offshore net cages varied depending on their specifications even if the offshore net cages were installed in the same area this is likely because of the complex geographical environment around nanji island resulting in different hydrological parameters in different sea areas especially in the inner bay sheltered by the surrounding mountains where there the wave height will be attenuated the damage levels of the offshore net cages in the inner bay were generally lower than those of the offshore net cages in the open sea which was consistent with the results predicted by the ann model the predicted damage level was level ii for the offshore net cages in zhuyu which is the most exposed fish farm around nanji island the predicted damage levels were levels ii and iii for the offshore net cages in mazu ao which are sheltered by the main island even for offshore net cages with different specifications it was predicted that there were no damaged offshore net cages in the inner bay of guosheng ao in general the predicted results showed good agreement with the field survey results table 9 based on the predicted results there was no damage to the mooring lines and floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao however the offshore net cages in this area were classified as damage level iii owing to the reduction in the offshore net cage volume in the field survey the minimum effective volume ratios of the offshore net cages were not available thus the damage levels of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao obtained from the ann model and field survey were inconsistent overall the proposed method where ann is combined with the hydrodynamic characteristics obtained from numerical simulations gives a more reliable prediction accuracy the criteria used to classify the damage levels of the offshore net cages with the different permissible limits for the maximum tension or stress of the components are considered to be reasonable based on the field survey results after the typhoon attack the main damage modes were 1 deformations of the main floating pipe or handrails 2 breakage or collapse of the floating collar 3 disconnections between the floating collar and net and 4 dragging of the mooring lines these damage modes were basically consistent with the predefined damage modes in this study because the effective volume ratio cannot be measured during the typhoon attack and the threshold is relatively subjective the effective volume ratio is not a suitable indicator to quantify the structural failure of offshore net cages in this study it is considered that the effective volume ratio of the net chamber is related to the survival rate of the farmed fish based on the field survey results the connection strings between the floating collar and net were found to be the fragile components that withstand loads from the net system the maximum tension of the connection strings should be considered as a damage factor in predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages in future work in addition to external environmental factors there are some structures and human factors that may affect the damage level of offshore net cages for example the materials used for some floating pipes may have antiultraviolet and antiaging agents whereas others do not as shown in fig 16 there were many marine organisms attached to the net of some offshore net cages such as barnacles hydras and oysters the accumulation of these organisms i e biofouling increased the weights and loads imposed on the offshore net cages which reduced the ability of these structures to withstand typhoon waves consequently different damage levels were observed for the offshore net cages therefore the risk of damage can be effectively reduced by cleaning the net system at regular intervals in general the proposed model used to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages was established based on a large number of hydrological data and specifications of the offshore net cages numerous series of numerical simulations were carried out to create the hydrodynamic database for model training ann was then used to develop an efficient hydrodynamic prediction model when the wave height wave period water depth and specifications of the offshore net cages were supplied to the ann model the hydrodynamic characteristics were computed in a quick efficient manner next the damage levels of the offshore net cages were determined based on the threshold values used to classify the damage levels with this model warnings on the risk of damage to offshore net cages can be issued concurrently with high wave warnings before typhoon landing besides predicting the damage levels of offshore net cages at a certain location the proposed ann model can predict the spatial distribution of the damage levels of offshore net cages in a large sea area in a quick efficient manner fig 17 the spatial distribution can be obtained by measuring or predicting the wave heights at various positions and these data are then inputted into the ann model therefore the ann model is not only suitable to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoons but also under the influence of other extreme weather phenomena if the fish farmers swiftly implement effective disaster prevention and mitigation measures after being issued warnings of offshore net cage damage the wave resistance capability of these structures can be significantly improved which will reduce economic losses these measures include 1 relaxing the length of the mooring lines to reduce tension caused by the increasing water levels 2 increasing the number of mooring lines to improve the antiwave capacity of the offshore net cages 3 strengthening the connection strings between the floating collar and net to minimize the risk of the net system from collapsing under the action of huge waves 4 eliminating biofouling on the net or replacing the biofouled net with a clean one in a timely fashion to reduce the weights and loads imposed on the offshore net cages 5 reinforcing the connections between the floating collar and mooring lines to enhance the strength of the floating collar and 6 checking and repairing creases and cracks in the main floating pipe in a timely fashion to prevent stress concentration considering the data volume and model complexity the bpnn algorithm with one hidden layer was adopted in this study this was the first attempt to use ann to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages under typhoon in the future the authors intend to build a model to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages with multiple disaster factors in various sea areas it is hoped that the ann model can effectively guarantee the safety of offshore aquaculture facilities to a certain extent as the number of disaster factors increase the relationship between the disaster factors and damage indexes becomes more complicated therefore it is necessary to introduce deep learning such as convolutional neural network to effectively reduce the complexity of the feedback neural network by locally sensitive and direction selective neurons it is believed that this will improve the efficiency of the prediction model 6 conclusion in this study an efficient ann model was developed to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in typhoon waves a case study was carried out using the ann model that was used to predict the damage levels of the offshore net cages around nanji island wenzhou china during typhoon maria the predicted damage levels of the offshore net cages can be coupled with wave forecasting before typhoon landing field survey was carried out immediately after typhoon maria to verify the prediction results the following conclusions were drawn based on the findings i based on the prediction and field survey results the proposed ann model can efficiently and accurately predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in typhoon waves the predicted damage levels of the offshore net cages can be jointly issued with high wave warnings before typhoon landing in addition based on the forecasted damage levels disaster prevention and mitigation measures can be suggested to fish farmers to minimize economic losses ii based on the case study results the offshore net cages around nanji island mainly experienced damage levels ii and iii during typhoon maria for the hdpe offshore net cages the floating collar was most vulnerable to damage followed by the net system the mooring system was relatively safe where the main damage was displacement of the anchor iii the prediction accuracy of the proposed ann model will be further improved in future studies by considering material depreciation biofouling on the net system and other factors along the weight of each factor contribution statement chun wei bi

22201,offshore net cages are aquaculture facilities that can provide satisfactory volumes of stocked fish the safety of these structures is of great importance to aquaculture companies typhoons are considered to be the main cause of damage to offshore net cages in this study an artificial neural network ann model was developed to predict the structural failure of high density polyethylene offshore net cages in typhoon waves a case study was conducted where the ann model was used to predict the structural failure of the offshore net cages around nanji island wenzhou china during typhoon maria field survey was performed to study the hydrodynamics of the offshore net cages in different wave conditions and the results were used as the training data for the ann model by classifying the structural failure the damage levels of offshore net cages can be predicted and used with wave forecasting before typhoon landing field survey was carried out immediately after the typhoon the prediction and field survey results showed that the proposed ann model can accurately predict the damage levels of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoon waves keywords prediction model structural failure offshore net cage artificial neural network field survey 1 introduction typhoons are powerful cyclonic vortices that form on tropical and subtropical oceans these weather phenomena are usually accompanied by violent winds storm surges and extreme waves typhoons are one of the major natural disasters in coastal areas and are harmful to coastal engineering structures especially floating offshore net cages in the east china sea for example marine aquaculture may be hit by several typhoons annually the destruction mechanism of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoon waves is highly complex for this reason it is crucial to consider the vulnerability of offshore net cages in the marine environment it is also crucial to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages during typhoons and storm surges in order to evaluate the risk of damage to these structures and the results may provide insight on how to improve aquaculture insurance and risk management offshore net cages fig 1 are flexible floating structures consisting of mooring lines a floating collar a net chamber and a sinker system these structures are typically exposed to normal operating sea conditions fatigue failure of the offshore net cage components may occur owing to accumulation of fatigue damage in natural disasters such as typhoons or storm surges the failure modes of offshore net cages are breakage of the mooring lines breakage of the floating collar and damage to the net system which may cause fish to die or escape fig 2 the dynamic response of offshore net cages under the action of waves and currents forms the basis for structural design and integrity of these structures previous studies were primarily focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics of offshore net cages for instance lader and enerhaug 2005 found that the forces and deformation of a flexible net structure were mutually and highly dependent on each other huang et al 2006 proposed a numerical model based on the lump mass method to analyze the dynamic characteristics of a net cage system exposed in open sea moe et al 2010 computed the load distributions of a net cage subjected to currents and weights using a commercial explicit finite element software tsukrov et al 2011 conducted experimental studies of the drag forces on copper alloy net panels and they proposed empirical normal drag coefficients for various types of copper netting kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 analyzed the effects of the mooring line loads on the aquaculture net cage using physical model tests and numerical simulations huang et al 2016 investigated the dynamic deformation of the floating collar of a net cage under a combination of waves and currents bi et al 2017 carried out a numerical study on wave attenuation inside and around a square array of net cages taking into account net biofouling gansel et al 2018 used full scale towing tests to analyze the drag forces and deformations of the fish cage in the field in general the ability of an offshore net cage to withstand currents and waves is directly related to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cage however it is also essential to analyze the structural strength and failure of offshore net cages kim et al 2014 performed structural analysis of a submersible abalone aquaculture cage for deployment in exposed marine environments liu et al 2019 computed the structural strength and failure of a floating collar of a single point mooring fish cage using the finite element method the structural analysis can be integrated into the design framework to prevent catastrophic failures of the net cage system because structural modeling is generally time consuming predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages cannot be carried out in a quick efficient manner to a certain extent the appropriate preventive measures will ensure the safety of offshore net cages and reduce disaster related losses during a typhoon therefore it is crucial to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages before typhoon landing however at present there are only typhoon warning systems and wave forecasting available to date there are no systems developed to forecast the damage levels of offshore net cages however there is substantial research on the prediction of potential marine disasters for example sztobryn 2003 constructed and verified a model of sea level changes during a storm surge the model was constructed based on artificial neural network ann and the model was used for hydrological forecasting in a tideless sea zhou and zhao 2003 performed active control of an offshore platform under random waves by combining classical optimal control with ann french et al 2017 predicted the tidal surge inundation at estuarine ports using machine learning and computational hydrodynamics doong et al 2018 developed an ann with backpropagation algorithm to build an early warning model for coastal freak wave forecasting although ann has been applied for hydrological forecasting active control of offshore structures prediction of tidal surge inundation and freak wave forecasting there are limited studies on predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages during a typhoon in general the destruction of an offshore net cage consists of three parts 1 breakage of the floating collar 2 failure of the mooring system and 3 damage of the net chamber the damage or failure of these components can be described by their corresponding ultimate strength such as maximum stress of the floating collar maximum tension of the mooring lines and minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber the structural failure of the offshore net cage can be determined when one of the damage factors reaches or exceeds the threshold value of the structure offshore net cages installed in open seas are exposed to random waves however in this study failure is considered to occur when the ultimate bearing capacity of the offshore net cage is exceeded therefore the maximum wave height is considered to be the dominant disaster causing factor however in an irregular wave train the maximum wave height is random and difficult to determine therefore it is challenging to establish the relationship between the maximum wave height and the damage factors of the offshore net cage hence in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of regular waves are used as the training data of the ann model instead of those of irregular waves the hydrodynamics of the offshore net cage can usually be obtained by numerical simulations or physical model experiments however both of these approaches are rather time consuming and therefore it is difficult to issue rapid warnings of offshore net cage damage before a typhoon thus in this study ann is combined with the hydrodynamic characteristics obtained from numerical simulations to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages 2 methodology in this study ann was used to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages in typhoon waves the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages obtained from numerical simulations were used as the training data for the ann model the damage levels of the offshore net cages can be classified by setting a reasonable threshold value for each damage factor with early warnings of typhoon waves it is possible to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in a target sea area the prediction accuracy of the ann model was verified by comparing the prediction results with those from field survey after a typhoon attack fig 3 shows the flow chart of the methodology adopted in this study to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages 2 1 development of the ann model ann is a new technology that has developed rapidly in recent years ann is a complex network composed of many simple units connected with each other ann is inspired from biological neural networks in the human brain and shares some of the operational characteristics ann has its own unique advantages in solving problems especially those that involve large scale parallel computing and nonlinear fitting as mentioned in section 1 an offshore net cage consists of mooring lines a floating collar a net chamber and a sinker system the failure of the offshore net cage in typhoon waves is a complex nonlinear process if one of the main components of the offshore net cage fails the entire structure will fail as long as the data used to train the ann model are sufficient and accurate the structural failure of the offshore net cage can be analyzed quickly and accurately in this study feedforward neural network combined with error backpropagation algorithm was used to discern the complex relationship between the hazard factors input layer and the damage factors output layer this method is known as backpropagation neural network bpnn which is a variant of ann in this model the input values are transformed inside each neuron where the input values interact with the assigned weights and biases using the activation function the values are then aggregated into a single value and the weights of the neural network are fine tuned based on the error rate in the previous iteration in this study the gradient descent method was employed to reset the weights in the neural network a neural network typically consists of three types of layers 1 input layer 2 hidden layer and 3 output layer the shallow machine learning algorithm was adopted owing to the relatively small amount of data and low processing difficulty in general it is not desirable to increase the number of hidden layers in the neural network because this may reduce the learning efficiency therefore the conventional three layer ann architecture was chosen in this study with only one hidden layer fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a is the input layer and b is the output layer the input and output layers are connected by weights and so are the hidden and output layers a bias is provided for each neuron in the hidden and output layers before training the system automatically sets the initial values for the weights and biases in the ann model after training all of the weights and biases are reset the ann model uses a large number of input and output data to conduct the training process and determine the optimum set of weights and biases finally the unknown parameters are fed to the input layer and the corresponding output value is obtained automatically 2 2 verification of the ann model typhoons which are a major threat to the safety of offshore net cages occur frequently in the southeast coastal area of china based on historical data on the conditions of offshore net cages after typhoon attacks the structural failure of offshore net cages is characterized by broken mooring lines broken floating collar and reduced effective volume ratio the offshore net cage will drift away with the currents if the mooring lines are broken all of the reared fish will escape if the floating collar and net chamber collapse the effective volume of the offshore net cage periodically changes depending on the wave conditions which may culminate in death of farmed fish if there is severe reduction in the net cage volume therefore the maximum tension of the mooring lines the maximum stress of the floating collar and the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber were the three main indexes chosen to measure the structural failure of the offshore net cages in this study the input parameters of the ann model consisted of geographical parameter water depth hydrological parameters wave height and wave period and structural parameters specifications of the offshore net cage all of these parameters were obtained from field survey according to previous studies zhao et al 2007 water currents affect the load distribution and motion of offshore net cages the influence of water currents on the dynamic characteristics of offshore net cages can also be considered for the ann model however based on gray correlation analysis on the historical data of the damages of offshore net cages around nanji island waves were found to be the dominant factor causing structural failure of offshore net cages in addition before a typhoon the department of marine monitoring and forecasting forecasts the wave parameters and the officers are incapable of forecasting the water currents hence the water current velocity was not taken as one of the input parameters of the ann model the output parameters of the ann model consisted of the maximum tension of the mooring lines the maximum stress of the floating collar and the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber by classifying the damage levels and setting the threshold values for the output parameters used to indicate the structural response the damage levels of the offshore net cages in typhoon waves can be determined the middle layer of the ann model was the hidden layer empirical approach is the most common method used to determine the number of hidden nodes and several rules have been proposed for this purpose doong et al 2018 in this study the number of neurons in the hidden layer n was determined by model training fitting precision and the number of iterations in the authors previous study zhao et al 2019a the number of hidden neurons used to predict the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar were set as 4 4 and 5 respectively to assess the reliability of the ann model an error function is defined as follows 1 e 1 n k 1 k t k p k p k 100 where t k is the target value and p k is the predicted value the differences between the predicted and target values were checked for the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar the maximum relative errors for these parameters were found to be within 5 when the number of hidden neurons were set as 4 4 and 5 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages in different wave conditions were obtained using the dut flexsim software developed at dalian university of technology china zhao et al 2015a the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model had been validated by comparing the numerical simulation results with those from physical model experiments bi et al 2014 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2007 the tension of the mooring lines and deformation of the net chamber can be simulated using the lumped mass method coded in dut flexsim in addition the stress distribution of the floating collar can be determined by combining the finite element model with the lumped mass method which has been described in detail in the authors previous studies zhao et al 2015b zhao et al 2019a both the lumped mass method and the finite element model had been validated against the results from physical model experiments and thus validation of the hydrodynamic model is not presented herein to verify the accuracy of the ann model the prediction results were compared with the numerical simulation results obtained in the authors previous study zhao et al 2019b the maximum relative errors were 3 8 3 3 and 5 4 for the maximum stress of the floating collar minimum effective volume of the net chamber and maximum tension of the mooring lines respectively the corresponding maximum standard deviations for these parameters were 0 12 mpa 1 8 and 1 59 kn respectively 2 3 classification of the damage levels of the offshore net cages predicting the structural failure of the offshore net cages is based on a large number of hydrological data and the specifications of the offshore net cages these data were supplied to the hydrodynamic model to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages which were then used to train the ann model the ann model was used to establish the relationship between the input and output vectors the input data wave height wave period water depth and specifications of offshore net cage were supplied to the input layer the output data maximum tension of the mooring lines minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and maximum stress of the floating collar were simultaneously sent to the output layer the effective volume ratio is defined as v c v 0 where v c is the minimum value of the varying volume of the net chamber in the waves and v 0 is the original volume of the net chamber in china the warnings for most natural disasters e g typhoons cold air and snowstorms are classified into four levels blue yellow orange and red indicating the severity of the phenomenon blue mild red extreme therefore in this study the warnings for the structural failure of the offshore net cages were also divided into four levels based on the results of many field surveys on typhoons the structural failure of offshore net cages can be classified as level i level ii level iii and level iv indicating severe damage serious damage moderate damage and slight damage respectively table 1 shows the general description of these damage levels systematic questionnaire surveys were carried out to quantitatively classify the damage levels of the offshore net cages based on a comprehensive evaluation of the structural damage repairability and economic loss the damage levels of offshore net cages can be quantified as follows for damage level i the main floating pipe is obviously broken the floating collar is partially submerged in water and more than half of the handrails collapse in the floating collar system in addition more than half of the mooring lines are broken which causes the offshore net cage to drag and crash more than half of the connections between the net and floating collar are also broken for damage level ii the main floating pipe is severely bent and more than half of the handrails have largely deformed the number of failed mooring lines is not more than half of the total number of mooring lines the offshore net cage has an obvious horizontal displacement nearly half of the connections between the floating collar and net are broken for damage level iii many local slight bends and deformations occur in the main floating pipe and handrails respectively dragging does not occur in the mooring lines because of the partially broken strands there are a few disconnections between the floating collar and net finally for damage level iv some creases occur in the main floating pipe there are slightly broken strands in the mooring lines in addition there are no disconnections between the floating collar and net the damage of the offshore net cage components is closely related to the ultimate strength of the respective materials thus in this study the percentage of the ultimate strength of various components was used as the criterion to define the boundaries of the damage levels the structural responses of the offshore net cage induced by external environmental loads stress of the floating collar effective volume ratio of net chamber and tension of the mooring lines were classified based on the preset boundaries which had been verified and corrected after many typhoon disasters the fatigue damage and material aging of the offshore net cage components were accounted for by reducing the threshold value for each classification this is also why the structural strength threshold is less than 100 even for damage level i owing to the depreciation of the offshore net cage structure the bearing capacities of the components cannot reach the initial values of the designed strength table 2 shows the criteria used to define the boundaries for the damage levels of the offshore net cages the relationship between the structural response of the offshore net cage and damage level was established based on these criteria 3 training data for the ann model a case study was conducted for the offshore net cages around nanji island which is located 55 km away from wenzhou china the high density polyethylene hdpe offshore net cages are mainly distributed in three areas guosheng ao mazu ao and zhuyu fig 5 two mariculture companies companies a and b are located at guosheng ao and zhuyu respectively whereas four mariculture companies companies c d e and f are located at mazu ao there is only one company company f that owns offshore net cages with a circumference of 60 m whereas the other offshore net cages have a circumference of 40 m fig 6 shows the distribution map of the offshore net cages in mazu ao the tidal feature in this area is regular semidiurnal tides tropical cyclone is the most disastrous weather phenomenon in this area with a maximum surge reaching 2 m the waves in this area are mainly influenced by monsoon winds and tropical cyclones the strong waves move in the east direction in this study all of the offshore net cages are moored in a four point configuration other geometric parameters of the offshore net cages are listed in table 3 based on the historical data provided by the zhejiang marine motoring and forecasting center the maximum significant wave height nearly reached 10 2 m during typhoon senlaku on september 7 2002 the significant wave height reached 8 6 m during typhoon haitang on july 19 2005 the monthly average minimum wave period was 5 49 s whereas the monthly average maximum wave period was 19 4 s based on these data the hydrodynamic characteristics of regular waves were used to train the ann model as shown in table 4 in reality offshore net cages installed in an open sea are exposed to irregular waves however in this study failure is considered to occur when the ultimate bearing capacity of the offshore net cage is exceeded therefore the maximum wave height is considered to be the dominant disaster causing factor however in an irregular wave train the maximum wave height is random and difficult to determine therefore it is challenging to establish the relationship between the maximum wave height and damage factors of the offshore net cage dong et al 2010 confirmed that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cage in irregular waves were the same as those of the offshore net cage in regular waves with a wave height equal to the average of the highest one tenth wave height of the corresponding irregular wave hence in this study regular waves were chosen to train the ann model the average water depth of the aquaculture area where the offshore net cages were deployed was 20 m considering a 3 m surge of the sea level the water depths used for the computations were 20 22 and 23 m by using the in house dut flexsim software the maximum tension of the mooring lines the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber and the maximum stress of the floating collar in typhoon waves can be determined figs 7 9 show the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference based on the material properties the permissible limit for the maximum tension of the mooring lines was 90 kn and the permissible limit for the maximum stress of the floating collar was 6 mpa for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference however for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference the permissible limit for the maximum tension of the mooring lines was 120 kn and the permissible limit for the maximum stress of the floating collar was 25 mpa because of the larger thickness and diameter of the floating collar 4 case study using the ann model 4 1 hydrological data during typhoon maria typhoon maria no 1808 formed on july 4 2018 in the western pacific ocean east of the philippines and the typhoon landed at the huangqi peninsula lianjiang fujian province on july 11 2018 when typhoon maria was landing the maximum wind speed near the center of the typhoon was 42 m s and the minimum central pressure was 96 kpa which weakened rapidly after landing fig 10 shows the path of typhoon maria nanji island was affected by typhoon maria because it is located within level 10 wind circles based on the data provided by the marine buoy station east of nanji island a maximum significant wave height of 7 5 m was observed on july 11 2018 and the maximum wave height simultaneously reached 9 9 m according to another marine buoy station west of nanji island the maximum significant wave height reached 4 2 m and a maximum wave height of 7 3 m was also observed according to the early warning issued by the zhejiang marine monitoring and forecasting center waves with a maximum wave height of 6 8 m occurred on july 10 2018 at 14 00 in the offshore areas around nanji island during typhoon maria waves with a maximum wave height of 6 m appeared in mazu ao whereas waves with a maximum wave height of 7 m occurred in zhuyu however the maximum wave height was only 4 m in guosheng ao the average wave period varied from 4 5 s to 6 0 s in mazu ao the offshore net cages were distributed in an area with an average water depth of 20 22 m in zhuyu and guosheng ao the offshore net cages were distributed in an area with an average water depth of 22 and 20 m respectively the hydrological parameters wave height wave period and water depth used to predict the damage levels of the offshore net cages in mazu ao zhuyu and guosheng ao are summarized in tables 5 7 respectively it shall be noted that the wave heights given in these tables are the one tenth wave heights of the random waves monitored during typhoon maria 4 2 prediction results the hydrological parameters and specifications of the offshore net cages were inputted into the trained ann model and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the offshore net cages were predicted rapidly the structural failure of the offshore net cages in mazu ao zhuyu and guosheng ao was predicted based on the hydrodynamic characteristics and the damage level classification provided in section 2 3 fig 11 shows the maximum tension of the mooring lines for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao in general the values were slightly higher for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference compared with those for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference the maximum tension of the mooring lines for all offshore net cages in mazu ao nearly exceeded 36 kn the maximum tension of the mooring lines of the offshore net cages in zhuyu and guosheng ao were 37 and 20 kn respectively therefore the damage level of the mooring lines was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in mazu ao and zhuyu in contrast the damage level of the mooring lines was level iv for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference in mazu ao because of the different permissible limits for the mooring lines however there was no damage to the mooring lines for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao next the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber for the offshore net cages was predicted using the ann model offshore net cages are flexible structures and thus the effective volume ratio of the net chamber varies depending on the wave conditions fig 12 shows the minimum effective volume ratio of the net chamber for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao the minimum effective volume ratio reached 0 58 indicating that the damage level of the net system was level ii in addition the minimum effective volume ratios were lower for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference compared with those for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference the minimum effective volume ratio was 0 61 for the offshore net cages in zhuyu based on the damage level classification of the offshore net cages in section 2 3 the damage level of the net system was level iii for the offshore net cages in this area the minimum effective volume ratio was 0 65 for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao and therefore the corresponding damage level of the net system was level iii finally the maximum stress of the floating collar for the offshore net cages in the three areas was predicted using the ann model in general the floating collar withstands loads imposed by the net mooring lines and waves the loads imposed by the net will increase with an increase in the circumference of the offshore net cage hence the maximum stress of the floating collar will be higher for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference than that for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference fig 13 shows the maximum stress of the floating collar for the offshore net cages with a circumference of 40 and 60 m in mazu ao the maximum stress of floating collar was 3 66 mpa for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference whereas the value exceeded 6 mpa for the other offshore net cages according to the forecasted wave parameters the maximum stress of the floating collar of the offshore net cages in zhuyu was 3 0 mpa in contrast the maximum stress of the floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao was only 1 8 mpa the damage levels of the floating collars were different owing to the different permissible limits for the maximum stress of the floating collar the damage level of the floating collar was level ii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in zhuyu and mazu ao in contrast the damage level of the floating collar was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference there was no damage to the floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao in summary the damage levels of the different components of the offshore net cages in mazu ao guosheng ao and zhuyu were considered in this study if either one of the offshore net cage components i e the mooring lines netting system or floating collar fail then the entire structure will fail therefore the predicted damage level was level ii for the offshore net cages with a 40 m circumference in mazu ao and zhuyu however the predicted damage level was level iii for the offshore net cages with a 60 m circumference owing to the reduction in the offshore net cage volume likewise the predicted damage level was level iii for the offshore net cages in guosheng ao for the same reason 4 3 field survey after typhoon attack to identify the damage conditions of the offshore net cages owned by companies a f around nanji island during typhoon maria a field survey was conducted on july 13 2018 in the aftermath of the typhoon attack the details of the damage conditions of the offshore net cages are summarized in table 8 the damage levels were determined by comparing specific parts of each damaged offshore net cage with the criteria presented in section 2 3 the total number of damaged offshore net cages around nanji island was 22 there were 11 offshore net cages in mazu ao with damage level ii fig 14 and the remaining offshore net cages were classified as damage level iii fig 15 all of the offshore cages in zhuyu were classified as damage level ii 5 discussion based on the field survey around nanji island most of the offshore net cages that survived typhoon maria were damaged the damaged components of the offshore net cages comprise breakage of the main floating pipe disconnections between the floating collar and net and partial failure of the mooring lines in general the damage levels of the offshore net cages installed in different areas were different in addition the damage level of the offshore net cages varied depending on their specifications even if the offshore net cages were installed in the same area this is likely because of the complex geographical environment around nanji island resulting in different hydrological parameters in different sea areas especially in the inner bay sheltered by the surrounding mountains where there the wave height will be attenuated the damage levels of the offshore net cages in the inner bay were generally lower than those of the offshore net cages in the open sea which was consistent with the results predicted by the ann model the predicted damage level was level ii for the offshore net cages in zhuyu which is the most exposed fish farm around nanji island the predicted damage levels were levels ii and iii for the offshore net cages in mazu ao which are sheltered by the main island even for offshore net cages with different specifications it was predicted that there were no damaged offshore net cages in the inner bay of guosheng ao in general the predicted results showed good agreement with the field survey results table 9 based on the predicted results there was no damage to the mooring lines and floating collar of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao however the offshore net cages in this area were classified as damage level iii owing to the reduction in the offshore net cage volume in the field survey the minimum effective volume ratios of the offshore net cages were not available thus the damage levels of the offshore net cages in guosheng ao obtained from the ann model and field survey were inconsistent overall the proposed method where ann is combined with the hydrodynamic characteristics obtained from numerical simulations gives a more reliable prediction accuracy the criteria used to classify the damage levels of the offshore net cages with the different permissible limits for the maximum tension or stress of the components are considered to be reasonable based on the field survey results after the typhoon attack the main damage modes were 1 deformations of the main floating pipe or handrails 2 breakage or collapse of the floating collar 3 disconnections between the floating collar and net and 4 dragging of the mooring lines these damage modes were basically consistent with the predefined damage modes in this study because the effective volume ratio cannot be measured during the typhoon attack and the threshold is relatively subjective the effective volume ratio is not a suitable indicator to quantify the structural failure of offshore net cages in this study it is considered that the effective volume ratio of the net chamber is related to the survival rate of the farmed fish based on the field survey results the connection strings between the floating collar and net were found to be the fragile components that withstand loads from the net system the maximum tension of the connection strings should be considered as a damage factor in predicting the structural failure of offshore net cages in future work in addition to external environmental factors there are some structures and human factors that may affect the damage level of offshore net cages for example the materials used for some floating pipes may have antiultraviolet and antiaging agents whereas others do not as shown in fig 16 there were many marine organisms attached to the net of some offshore net cages such as barnacles hydras and oysters the accumulation of these organisms i e biofouling increased the weights and loads imposed on the offshore net cages which reduced the ability of these structures to withstand typhoon waves consequently different damage levels were observed for the offshore net cages therefore the risk of damage can be effectively reduced by cleaning the net system at regular intervals in general the proposed model used to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages was established based on a large number of hydrological data and specifications of the offshore net cages numerous series of numerical simulations were carried out to create the hydrodynamic database for model training ann was then used to develop an efficient hydrodynamic prediction model when the wave height wave period water depth and specifications of the offshore net cages were supplied to the ann model the hydrodynamic characteristics were computed in a quick efficient manner next the damage levels of the offshore net cages were determined based on the threshold values used to classify the damage levels with this model warnings on the risk of damage to offshore net cages can be issued concurrently with high wave warnings before typhoon landing besides predicting the damage levels of offshore net cages at a certain location the proposed ann model can predict the spatial distribution of the damage levels of offshore net cages in a large sea area in a quick efficient manner fig 17 the spatial distribution can be obtained by measuring or predicting the wave heights at various positions and these data are then inputted into the ann model therefore the ann model is not only suitable to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages under the influence of typhoons but also under the influence of other extreme weather phenomena if the fish farmers swiftly implement effective disaster prevention and mitigation measures after being issued warnings of offshore net cage damage the wave resistance capability of these structures can be significantly improved which will reduce economic losses these measures include 1 relaxing the length of the mooring lines to reduce tension caused by the increasing water levels 2 increasing the number of mooring lines to improve the antiwave capacity of the offshore net cages 3 strengthening the connection strings between the floating collar and net to minimize the risk of the net system from collapsing under the action of huge waves 4 eliminating biofouling on the net or replacing the biofouled net with a clean one in a timely fashion to reduce the weights and loads imposed on the offshore net cages 5 reinforcing the connections between the floating collar and mooring lines to enhance the strength of the floating collar and 6 checking and repairing creases and cracks in the main floating pipe in a timely fashion to prevent stress concentration considering the data volume and model complexity the bpnn algorithm with one hidden layer was adopted in this study this was the first attempt to use ann to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages under typhoon in the future the authors intend to build a model to predict the structural failure of offshore net cages with multiple disaster factors in various sea areas it is hoped that the ann model can effectively guarantee the safety of offshore aquaculture facilities to a certain extent as the number of disaster factors increase the relationship between the disaster factors and damage indexes becomes more complicated therefore it is necessary to introduce deep learning such as convolutional neural network to effectively reduce the complexity of the feedback neural network by locally sensitive and direction selective neurons it is believed that this will improve the efficiency of the prediction model 6 conclusion in this study an efficient ann model was developed to predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in typhoon waves a case study was carried out using the ann model that was used to predict the damage levels of the offshore net cages around nanji island wenzhou china during typhoon maria the predicted damage levels of the offshore net cages can be coupled with wave forecasting before typhoon landing field survey was carried out immediately after typhoon maria to verify the prediction results the following conclusions were drawn based on the findings i based on the prediction and field survey results the proposed ann model can efficiently and accurately predict the damage levels of offshore net cages in typhoon waves the predicted damage levels of the offshore net cages can be jointly issued with high wave warnings before typhoon landing in addition based on the forecasted damage levels disaster prevention and mitigation measures can be suggested to fish farmers to minimize economic losses ii based on the case study results the offshore net cages around nanji island mainly experienced damage levels ii and iii during typhoon maria for the hdpe offshore net cages the floating collar was most vulnerable to damage followed by the net system the mooring system was relatively safe where the main damage was displacement of the anchor iii the prediction accuracy of the proposed ann model will be further improved in future studies by considering material depreciation biofouling on the net system and other factors along the weight of each factor contribution statement chun wei bi

22202,maneuvering motion is a critical off design condition experienced by the propeller during realistic operations failures of the propulsive system loss of efficiency and modification of the propeller side effects propeller hull induced pressure and noise are the undesired consequences of these working conditions free running model tests still representing the primary approach for a reliable performance assessment requires facilities and devices that are not commonly affordable alternatively rectilinear towing tank can be used for maneuvering investigations by static or dynamic tests and can be a valid alternative to investigate propeller performance in off design on these basis in this paper the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions is investigated by means of oblique towing tests in case of a twin screw model equipped with a novel set up for single blade loads measurements in the experiments the drift angle and the advance speed of the model varied systematically to focus on the relation between propeller operating conditions and loads moreover the averaged and periodic blade loads are compared in terms of the equivalent drift angle to the measurements obtained by free running model tests in order to demonstrate the reliability of pure oblique flow tests for the preliminary quantification of the off design loads developed by the propeller keywords captive model tests off design propeller performance pure oblique flow single blade loads 1 introduction modern trends in ship design aim to maximize the overall performance of a marine vehicle in realistic operating conditions and environment in order to guarantee safety and preservation of human life at sea and abatement of the environmental pollution for example c o 2 and noise in this context marine propeller plays a pivotal role because it is strictly related to propulsive efficiency vibrations and noise structural strength of the hull and components of the propulsion systems bearings a ship during realistic operations experiences low and high amplitude motions due to control actions and environmental disturbances waves and wind that alter the flow around the hull and the inflow to the propeller in these conditions the hydrodynamics of the blade is different from the design point traditionally established by the nominal wake field in calm water at the target speed with consequent alteration of the loads and pressure field generated by the propeller as a result both the steady and the fluctuating character of the blades and propeller loads are modified for example investigation by free running maneuvering model tests and c f d analysis highlighted that in the case of twin screw configuration the asymmetric behavior of the loads has to be ascribed to different mechanisms associated to the complex interactions with coherent structures and separated flow and relevant cross flow velocity for the leeward and windward propeller respectively ortolani et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 propeller thrust and torque for the more loaded shaft can increase up to 100 with respect to the straight ahead and be almost doubled compared to the other one more importantly relevant in plane forces and moments are generated that can be of the order of 30 and 80 of the thrust and torque these loads critically affect the structural strength of the propulsive shaft and are responsible of one of the most frequent accident of seagoing ships vartdal et al 2009 they furthermore provide a non negligible contribution to the dynamic response of the ship r broglia et al 2013 an important step into this topic has been recently tackled by captive model tests on isolated unit of pod orientable propulsion unit devices and free running maneuvering test on ship model with conventional propulsion in facts pod units owing to their peculiar working conditions could develop large time variable loads that can be further amplified by dynamic effects during transients amini and steen 2011 a detailed assessment of azimuthal thrusters and pod performance needed the development of advanced experimental techniques koushan 2006 and amini and steen 2012 developed an hub mounted blade and propeller transducer to deeply investigate these problems and obtain high quality experimental data for the validation of viscous flow solvers krasilinov et al 2009 berchiche et al 2018 the free running maneuvering tests were performed on a twin screw model equipped with an innovative experimental set up dedicated to the measure of the single blade loads resolved during the period of revolution of the propeller ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in particular this study highlighted that the fluctuation of the load during the cycle can be of the order of 100 of the mean and these fluctuations are not necessarily related to the severity of the maneuver i e rudder angle but are mostly due to complex interaction of blade with vortical structures or separated flow as a result off design conditions can anyhow be experienced either at low and high rudder angles depending on the flow features that characterize the propeller inflow in particular the case at small rudder angle is very interesting from a practical perspective because this sailing condition is easily met in realistic operations by ships whenever the autopilot is active or to achieve route optimization for low fuel consumption motion in waves is also critical for the overall behavior of the marine propeller because modifications to the inflow are usually associated to marked axial and tangential velocities gradients which have a detrimental effect for the development of cavitation patterns and related side effects i e pressure pulses and radiated noise taskar and steen 2016 taskar et al 2017 advanced ship model testing is still a reliable mean for analyzing the propeller behavior during off design conditions since the earlier design stages although c f d allows the simulation of the complete geometry and rotating propeller carrica et al 2012 mofidi and carrica 2014 muscari et al 2011 a complete validation specified for the case of propeller and single blade loads is not provided due to the lack of experimental data abbas and kornev 2016 sun et al 2018 moreover the required computational resources are prohibitive for day by day application for these kind of simulations since the temporal resolution and the spatial discretization is constrained to resolution of blade flow in this work the behavior of the propeller in off design conditions is systematically investigated by means of pure drift test in the c n r i n m towing tank the model is a unit of a twin screw naval ship the same used for extensive free running maneuvering tests documented in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the propeller performance is gathered by single blade loads measurements obtained by means of a 6 component load cell located inside the propeller hub in the experiments drift angle was changed up to 30 and towing speeds was reduced up to 70 of the reference speed correspondent to froude number f n 0 26 these values were set in order to obtain nominal kinematic conditions representative of the free running model tests at the same reference speed this kind of investigation is not a standard in ship model testing according to the authors knowledge a similar experiment was attempted in blaurock 1975 for a single screw merchant ship towed in pure oblique flow using a custom cantilever beam transducer however this transducer measured only two blade bending moments at different points of the beam from which the blade thrust and side force were obtained assuming a linear distribution of the moments and moreover the drift angles were limited to 10 the analysis is centred on the single blade loads and the cause effect relation with respect to the nominal wake features strengthened by preliminary cfd simulation and p i v measurements carried out for this model at intermediate drift angles capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 the blade loads obtained in towing tests are further compared to the free running results for the most similar kinematic conditions in terms of both mean and cyclic load this assessment is useful to prove the reliability of pure oblique test to accurately reproduce off design behavior of the propellers in order to identify possible critical conditions at least for similar twin screw configurations with respect to free running self propelled model tests this is the most realistic approach to simulate accurately ship operating conditions although this kind of test requires specific indoor oceanic tank or outdoor lakes with low disturbances facilities that are not commonly affordable on the other hand the data obtained with this experiment are attractive for numerical validation given the absence of undesired environmental disturbance that inevitably affect the free running experiment in an outdoor basin 2 test case and experimental set up the selected test case is a 1 25 scaled model about 6 m of a fast twin screw twin rudder unit the main features of the model and the propeller are reported in table 1 where l b t c b are respectively the length between perpendiculars the overall breadth the draught and the block coefficient the ship and propeller model are depicted in fig 1 the model is equipped with two couples of stabilizer fins bilge keels horn rudders and the typical configuration of propulsive shaft supported by brackets the five blade propellers rotate counterclockwise inward rotating from top these experiments were carried out with the same set up adopted in the velocimetry campaign described in capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 that consisted of the fully appended model with rudders removed this choice was preferable for the measure of the nominal wake at incidence angle because it would have been affected by a non representative perturbation from the rudder it being not affected by the propeller wake moreover this allows to synthesize the cause and effect relation between the nominal wake and propeller loads univocally the novel set up for measuring the single blade loads is implemented on the starboard propeller the complete system of loads 3 forces and 3 moments acting on a single blade fig 2 is measured by a 6 components off the shelf transducer housed inside the propeller supporting one of the blades the calibrated ranges and measurement uncertainties of forces t x y z and moments q x y z provided by the manufacturer of the transducer are reported in table 2 power supply and signal from transducer channels are transmitted to the acquisition system through high quality low noise and low resistance slip rings the isolated and hull mounted propeller are shown in fig 2 tests are carried out in the cnr inm towing tank facility the towing tank features a 475 m long 13 5 m wide and 6 5 m deep basin four electric main motors 92 kw and two secondary motors 45 kw can drive the tank carriage up to 15 m s with an accuracy of 1 mm s and speed fluctuations within 3 the carriage has been equipped with a planar motion mechanism p m m this device allows to impose to the model a prescribed trajectory combining sway and yaw motions if the purpose is the investigation of dynamic forces during complex manoeuvres during the test subject of this paper pmm has been just used to easily change and measure the drift angle within the desired range the drift angle β between the model axis and the direction of motion of the carriage can be set with an accuracy of 0 1 a schematics of the towing tank set up is shown in fig 3 the positive sign of β corresponds to rotation of the bow to starboard and the instrumented propeller is on the leeward internal side the complete test matrix of the experimental campaign is summarized in table 3 at least five runs were repeated for each test condition the oblique towing tests were executed at different drift angle β and towing speed with roll motion constrained to the neutral position the nominal advance speed corresponds to f n 0 26 and reynolds number r e 1 053 e 7 propeller angular speed is set at the model self propulsion point in straight ahead motion β 0 in order to mimic the propeller functioning during free running model tests propeller r p s are kept constant during all tests the nominal advance coefficient of the propeller j at β 0 evaluated with the speed of the model is 1 05 3 data analysis the procedure at the basis of the analysis of the single blade loads signals is schematized in fig 4 for a generic run at fixed speed and drift angle at first the full acquisition is re sampled at steps of 1 per blade revolution this process allows to perform a consistent statistical analysis of the data at same blade angle positions for the set of cycles after slicing the record into single cycles in particular the mean x and standard deviation σ of the generic load for the collection of cycles were calculated at each blade position in order to obtain the representative mean trend of the generic load and uncertainty during the period the same analysis was performed on the averaged values over each period each record consisted of more than 200 cycles in this work the results of single runs per condition are discussed and therefore this process corresponds to the first step of the generalized procedure described in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a fig 5 describes the reference systems used in the analysis and the correspondent definition of forces t x y z and moments q x y z exerted on the single blade the loads are measured with respect to the rotating frame centred at the blade root and the axis green colored in the figure on the left are identified with t superscripts the frame is defined with x pointing forward z radially outward y determined by right hand rule the data were converted to the frame rotating with the blade and centred at the propeller axis i e the blade frame identified by blue colored axes and b superscript the angular position θ of the b frame with respect to the hub frame fixed with respect to the rotating blade identifies the position of the blade during the cycle θ is positive oriented with the sense of rotation and is zero for the blade at 12 o clock position note that the propeller on the left inset of the figure is the starboard one and it is seen from behind moreover the measured loads match the inertial and the hydrodynamic components in this work the analysis is focused on the hydrodynamic component derived by subtracting the inertial component from the measured one the complete procedure is detailed in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b and is not repeated here for the sake of brevity in the following discussion the period of revolution of the propeller is divided in four sectors the first one defined for 0 θ 90 and so on the loads are presented in the usual non dimensional form i e the forces k t x y z and moments k q x y z are made non dimensional by factors ρ n 2 d 4 and ρ n 2 d 5 respectively where d is the diameter n is the propeller rate of revolution rps and ρ is water density in this work the analysis of the loads is carried out for the single blade in the b frame 3 1 comparison with free running model tests the comparison of the loads in pure drift towing with the stabilized phase of the turning circle obtained during free running test should be ideally compared at equal inflow conditions at the propellers the terms that identify the operating condition of the propeller are the advance coefficient j or the speed drop since propeller rate of revolution is set equal to the free running tests and the nominal drift angle in correspondence to the propeller plane in case of a free running maneuver the drift angle β p in correspondence to the propeller plane must account for the contribution of the yaw speed of the model ψ see fig 6 b 1 β p β h t a n 1 ψ x p u h t a n 1 v h u h t a n 1 ψ x p u h where β h is the drift angle of the hull u h and v h are the longitudinal and lateral components of the speed of the hull and x p is the longitudinal position of the propeller with respect to pivot point the reduction of speed adopted in the captive model tests is in the range monitored for this model in the stabilized phase of the turn from moderate to high rudder angles ortolani and dubbioso 2019a the equivalence of the drift angle in correspondence to the two maneuvers obviously does not guarantee the identical inflow because during turning and pure oblique towing the distribution of the drift angle is different and hence discrepancies can be expected for the wake evolving past the hull in fact see bottom half of fig 6b the coupled sway yaw motion during the free running maneuver causes the longitudinal sections of the hull to experience a linear variation of the drift angle and the drift angle to switch from negative to positive values on the other hand during oblique towing the longitudinal distribution of the drift angle is constant obviously a further source of discrepancies of the inflow to the propeller and hence loads is caused by the absence of roll motion and rudders during the towing tests 4 results the single blade loads are presented referring to the rotating frame b frame in terms of their average and complete time history during the period of rotation of the propeller the discussion of the results systematically highlights the effect of propeller loading different j at fixed β and the effect of drift angle at constant loading different β at fixed j for the sake of conciseness the focus is paid to blade thrust k t x side force k t y and spindle moment k q z since blade torque k q x and bending moment k q y are proportional to the previous two components the origin of the blade loads is discussed referring to the characteristics of the nominal wake i e the inflow to the propeller by applying 2 dimensional airfoil theory see fig 7 the loads are directly proportional to the incidence angle α of the propeller sections that results from the combination of the axial velocity u a and the tangential velocity v t relative to the blade foil introducing the velocity components of the flow u v and w at the generic section the propeller angular speed ω 2 π n where n are r p s and the geometric pitch angle of the section θ the total tangential velocity v t a n the relative inflow angle φ and the incidence angle can be easily determined 2 axial velocity u a u tang velocity wake v t v c o s θ w s i n θ tang velocity total v t a n ω r v t inflow angle φ a t a n u a v t a n incidence α θ φ introducing the section hydrodynamic lift and drag coefficients c l and c d and the distance sectional centre of pressure of the loads from the spindle axis d c p of generic section position r along the blade span the forces and moments developed by the blades result from the cumulative contribution of the loads generated by the different blade sections from the hub r h to the tip r t without loss of generality equation 3 define blade thrust and spindle torque q z 3

in tables 4 6 the error of the measures is in general less than 10 and is comparable to the free running results ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in case of the spindle torque the percentage error is very high given the very small magnitude of the mean the establishment at least qualitative of the relation between the inlet velocity of the propeller given by the wake evolution past the hull and the blade loads is propaedeutic to understand the variation of propeller loading during the turn the characteristics of the nominal wake are briefly surmised for the representative conditions in straight ahead small and high drift angle correspondent to β 15 and 30 respectively in fig 8 obtained by preliminary c f d computations with a coarse grid that are currently in progress for a detailed numerical validation calcagni et al 2019 these features are also comparable to c f d computations for a similar twin screw model ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in the representation in drift the starboard propeller is on the leeward side and the cross flow is directed from left to right it has to be noted that the lee windward sides are inverted with respect to the reference adopted in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a while it is consistent with the analysis proposed in capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 this preliminary analysis is focused on the tests performed at the nominal towing speed f n 0 26 i e v 1 for both the mean and cyclic blade loads showed in fig 9 grey bars and fig 10 the internal and external propeller experience a marked asymmetric behavior caused by the different character of the inflow on the two sides qualitatively the trends of blade thrust and side force are similar given their direct proportionality with the angle of incidence see eq 2 therefore considerations for thrust apply to both components in general k t x k t y on the windward side increases monotonically up to 90 70 at β 30 with respect to the nominal value in rectilinear motion this behavior is attributable to the fact that the inflow to the propeller is similar to a pure oblique flow and hence its incidence is approximately equal to the drift of the hull details are provided studying the load variation during the period reported on the left of fig 10a and its relation with the wake sketched in fig 8 in straight ahead motion k t x is characterized by two peaks in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants see red colored line that are both associated to the reduction of the axial velocity the first at θ 45 is the weaker one and is related to the perturbation past the inner bracket conversely the velocity defect at θ 120 is associated to the wake shed past the hull in particular both the velocity defect and the tangential velocity act to increase the flow incidence of the blade sections it is interesting to observe that the tangential flow is upwards oriented and is non negligible only in the outward half of the disk on the inner half it is much smaller probably due to the v shaped lines of the stern that weaken the vertical momentum of the flow and deflect it longitudinally it is worth noticing that in case of the model characterized by a pram stern studied in muscari et al 2017 the thrust and side force evolved with a similar trend in that case the second peak of the blade loads was associated to the increase of the angle of attack caused by the increase of the tangential velocity relative to the blade foils in fact due to the rectangular shape of transverse sections of the stern the tangential velocity was upwards oriented and uniformly distributed over the disk while the axial velocity was mainly disturbed by the wake of the brackets the load diminishes up to θ 270 because the nominal wake is not perturbed and the tangential flow is concordant to blade rotation and then it rises again due to the increase of the velocity defect past the outer bracket and blockage of the hull in drift motion the signal completely changes and it is qualitatively similar for all drift angles the blade develops the higher load in the lower half of the disk because the cross flow is opposite to blade rotation in the upper half of the disk the cross flow plays the opposite effect and the blade loading reduces however in the 1 s t quadrant a smaller fluctuation approximately at θ 80 is visible that is caused by the axial velocity defect caused by flow separation past the shaft see fig 8b it is interesting to observe that the magnitude of the peaks at θ 200 are more than doubled with respect to the average one for β higher than 15 and almost triplicated with respect to the mean value in straight ahead sailing with reference to fig 9a b on the leeward side the trend of k t x k t y is almost constant with the exception of a weak drop at β 20 as a matter of fact this is due to the fact that during the cycle sector of load increase are almost equally balanced by sector the load decreases a better insight is provided by the periodic signals reported on the right of fig 10 in drift motion the thrust varies with a similar trend for drift angle up to β 20 in particular the signal is characterized by a single peak in the 1 s t quadrant that gradually increases up to 30 of the maximum value in straight ahead this is caused by the interaction of the blade with coherent structures detached from the appendages and bilges that increase the tangential velocity relative to the blade then the load abruptly drops approximately in the 2 n d quadrant because the cross flow induced by the drift motion is concordant with the blade rotation and the tangential velocity relative to the foil the incidence angle and loads are reduced consequently during the upstroke motion of the blade the load starts again to increase as a consequence of the reduction of the axial speed caused by flow separation past the shaft bracket and deflected wake of the hull at the highest drift angle the flow is massively separated see fig 8c in the 1 s t quadrant the increase of the load is associated to both velocity defect past the bracket and hull and the cross flow in the second half of the period the almost constant trend of the load in the 3 r d quadrant is related to the concurrent contribution of axial and tangential speed on one side the axial velocity is reduced by the wake of the hull and in particular the flow separated from the shaft on the other side the cross flow induces a tangential flow that is concordant to blade rotation and acts to reduce the load finally in the 4 t h the load again increases as a consequence of the combined effect of tangential velocity downwards oriented induced by the big vortical structure shed past the hull and the axial velocity defect the spindle torque demands a dedicated analysis since its link with the inflow is not immediate in fact as observed in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in the case of a skewed blade k q z is strictly related to the span wise variation of the hydrodynamic centre and propeller loading at v 1 in terms of averaged values fig 9c on the leeward propeller this couple is always positive i e it acts to reduce the pitch of the blade gradually diminishing by half its value at β 30 except for a small increase at β 20 on the windward side its behavior is completely different k q z is very small neutral for intermediate angle and then drops abruptly to a negative value having the same magnitude of β 0 these different trends are better explained by means of the periodic evolution reported in fig 10c in general it can be observed that the overall trend of k q z follows the behavior of k t x and k t y but the sign is markedly dependent on blade loading the spindle torque values are positive for light loads as in case of β 0 while change sign and reach the highest absolute values under heavy conditions for example referring to the evolution of blade thrust on the windward side left panel in fig 10a for non zero drift angle the blade loading both k t x and k t y in absolute value increases during the descending motion of the blade i e in the 1 s t half of the period and diminishes after β 220 as a consequence of the concordant orientation of the cross flow with blade rotation evidently the evolution of the spindle torque is concordant with this evolution in terms of development and plot similarity k q z starting from positive values diminishes to negative during the most critical conditions this can be ascribed to the evolution of the center of pressure on a skewed blade it can be inferred that during the cycle the centre of pressure moves from larger to smaller radial positions when the blade loading increases and vice versa due to the skew the centre of pressure starts behind the spindle axis to yield a positive couple and gradually moves forward to cross over it to reduce and yield a negative spindle arm ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the trends reported in fig 10c are influenced by this behavior in terms of unbalances between higher and lighter load occurrences which determine the mean value during the entire period of revolution the smaller variation of the couple on the lee side is explained with the fact that gains in the upper half of the disk caused by wake blade interaction mechanisms are canceled during the blade passage in the lower half of the disk on the contrary on the windward side the blade loading is completely imbalanced the increase of load in the lower half of the disk due to cross flow being higher with respect to the upper half where axial and tangential velocity provide opposite contribution 4 2 effect of propeller loading on single blade loads the effect of propeller loading is shown in fig 9 at lower towing speeds that are representative of speed drop recorded during free running turning circle maneuvers performed at different rudder angles the reduction of the towing speed causes k t x and k t y to increase principally because the reduction of the axial speed to the propeller causes the incidence angle to raise in general the maximum increase of the load is progressively reduced with the increase of the drift angle the thrust and side force and related moments on the windward side always increase with the drift angle at fixed speed conversely on the leeward side the forces diminish with β differently from the previously discussed case at v 1 0 these aspects can be related to the progressive alteration of the incoming flow nominal wake by the self induced velocity field that is stronger with the increase of propeller loading in more details this mechanism is driven by the memory effect associated to the temporal variation of the circulation shed in the wake of the propeller this leads to a temporal delay on the establishment of the effective angle of attack and hence the loads that is stronger the more spatially variable is the incoming flow as a result of these effects the fluctuations of the load can be weakened blaurock 1975 misztal 1933 as in the present case for the internal propeller whose inflow is affected by stronger velocity gradients due to the wake detached from the hull the increase of propeller loading in general causes the reduction of the mean value of the spindle torque at fixed drift angle the total variation of k q z drops with β both on the leeward and windward side although the trend at intermediate propeller loading is not well defined as observed for the forces probably because the strict relation with the geometric characteristics of the blade the reduction of the spindle torque is consistent with the explanation of the periodic variation of this couple during the cycle i e the hydrodynamic centre moves towards inner blade radii with the increase of angle of attack and hence blade loading the periodic variation of the loads reported for the thrust and spindle moment in figs 11 and 12 provide further insight on the aspects observed for the mean values in particular it can be easily evidenced that the global fluctuation of the load is weakened with speed reduction the percentage variation increase in case of k t x and decrease in case of k q z of the loads is smaller in correspondence to higher blade loads this fact can be clearly observed for blade thrust at β 0 β 15 leeward side and at β 30 windward side in fig 11c and 11d respectively specifically at β 0 fig 11a the peak at θ 50 associated to the velocity defect past the shaft is gradually weakened and disappears at v 0 7 on the internal side at β 15 fig 11c the load is gradually weakened in correspondence to the peak in the first quadrant caused by the interaction of the blade with the vortex conversely on the external propeller k t x collapses during the passage in the lower half of the disk fig 11d this aspect can be also caused by localized flow separations due to the excessive increase of incidence angle as it seems to be confirmed by trend of spindle torque shown in fig 12d in fact the evolution of the negative peak at θ 180 matches with the outward shift of the hydrodynamic centre instead of an inward shift as expected by previous analysis in section 4 1 finally at β 30 during the second half of the cycle the growth rate of k t x diminishes with speed drop in this region see fig 8c on the leeward side the blade is impinged by a tangential flow that acts to increase the incidence angle it is plausible that the reduction of the towing speed causes the premature separation of past the hull or appendages the reynolds number is lower and thus the vortical structure would be convected farther from the propeller with the consequent reduction of the downward tangential flow this trend inversion is also confirmed by spindle torque in the 4 t h quadrant see fig 12e its variation being consistent with the outward shift of the hydrodynamic centre that happens with the unloading of the blade at this drift angle the trend of the loads on both windward and leeward side can be affected by the free surface because it can modify the evolution of the wake past the hull at stern at the different speeds 4 3 comparison with free running model tests the comparison with free running model tests is shown in figs 13 18 for the averaged and cyclic loads the propeller revolution are set equal to the self propulsion condition at the nominal froude number 0 26 obtained during the free running experiments and are kept constant for all the drift conditions in case of the mean loads the comparison is performed in terms of the equivalent drift angle β e f f on the other hand the comparison of the periodic loads is performed considering for towing tests the loads obtained at speed drops closer to the free running test in order to have a global overview on the two key parameters of this systematic analysis in table 7 the equivalent drift angle and speed drop correspondent to the turning circles obtained at different rudder angles are summarized the values of the speed drop for the free running tests are reported as labels in the figs 13 15 and 17 to synthesize exhaustively the comparison of the two different kind of tests the comparison of the mean value of blade thrust and side force are shown in fig 13 and torque and bending moment are represented in fig 15 the loads are presented in terms of ratio with respect to the mean value in straight ahead motion the correspondence of the free running results with oblique towing is very satisfactory both on the windward and on the leeward side for both forces and moments in fact at increasing equivalent drift angle free running loads matches well with oblique towing o t results at diminishing speed higher propeller loading this trend reproduces correctly the physics since during a turning circle manoeuvre the increase of rudder angle here conceptually replaced by the equivalent drift angle corresponds to a stronger reduction of the absolute velocity to the propeller ortolani and dubbioso 2019a the agreement between free running and oblique towing is worse on the internal propeller in case of k t y and k q x at β e f f 7 5 moreover the torque seems to be overestimated by towing tests for the intermediate equivalent drift angle β e f f 15 and 22 5 the comparison of the periodic loads is provided for blade thrust and torque in figs 14 and 16 specifically in case of k t x the agreement of the loads is satisfactory although discrepancies are evident on both propellers the fluctuation and the magnitude of the peak matches well on the leeward side the comparison is worse in case of the lower drift angle because the loads are affected by the passage of vortical structures close or through the propeller disk in fact in the first half of the cycle the thrust is phase shifted then the matching improves in the last interval of the cycle 250 θ 360 in the 3 r d quadrant the thrust has a clear minima and is not constant as in case of the oblique towing at higher drift right panel in fig 14b the error of the phase position of the peak and its magnitude is limited in the 1 s t quadrant moreover in case of the free running tests in the lowest half of the disk the variation of k t x is smoother with respect to the oblique towing finally it has to be noticed that in case of the oblique towing the maximum value is experienced at β 15 whereas the peak slightly increases for tightest maneuver in case of the free running on the windward side the agreement is better than the leeward side the signals are correctly phased and the most evident error is experienced for the peak value at the maximum drift angle that is overestimated by towing tests moreover the fluctuation in the 1 s t quadrant ascribed to the interaction of the blade with the wake past the shaft is smoother in case of the free running the comparison of the blade torque k q x is shown in fig 16 on the left panel the comparison is proposed for lower drift angle on the leeward side in order to highlight the source of the discrepancy observed for the mean loads qualitatively the trend of the signals is similar to blade thrust the agreement being satisfactory only in the last quarter of the cycle in this case the blade loads and distribution are strongly affected by magnitude and phase of the inflow velocity gradients and hence alteration caused by the different attitude roll and wake evolution on the external side right panel the accordance is very satisfactory since the inflow essentially a pure oblique flow with the exception of limited portions of the disk affected by the wake past the shaft or hull is better reproduced by towing in drift finally the comparison of the spindle torque is provided in fig 17 in terms of mean value and in fig 18 for the cyclic load in this case the comparison is worse than the previous cases probably due to the higher sensitivity to differences of the inflow however the trend of the free running is qualitatively captured by the towing tests associated to the equivalent drift and speed drop loading in terms of periodic loads the error is almost equivalent for the leeward and windward propellers although the trends and the local maxima and phase of the signals are well captured the fluctuation of the loads is markedly overestimated by the towing tests in particular in the intervals of the period the blade overloads namely 1 s t quadrant for the internal propeller and first half cycle for the external one in general the representation of the loads in terms of ratio highlights that the fluctuation of the loads and the maximum peak during the cycle can be of the order of 150 and 400 of the mean value in straight ahead condition respectively 5 conclusions and future works in this work a systematic experimental investigation on the loads generated by the blade of a marine propeller in behind hull was carried out in pure oblique towing this work is complementary to the free running maneuvering tests presented in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a carried out on the same model of a twin screw naval unit the test conditions were designed to study the effect of propeller loading for a wide range of drift angles representative of weak to tight manoeuvres propeller performance is assessed by measuring the single blade loads with a novel set up developed at cnr inm the experimental data are synthesized by two different analysis and with the aid of preliminary c f d computation of nominal wake in order to highlight the cause and effect relation between the loads and the propeller inflow in the first one the averaged and fluctuating blade loads are systematically discussed in terms of drift angle and propeller loading the behavior of the propellers in drift condition is markedly distinct due to completely different characteristics of their inflow on the windward side the mean blade forces thrust and side force and related moments torque and bending moment always increase monotonically with drift angle at the different towing speed on the contrary this trend is not confirmed on the leeward side in fact increasing the propeller loading i e reduction of the towing speed the rate varies from being almost neutral to negative in general at every fixed drift angle the loads increases with speed reduction at a diminishing rate with the increase of drift angle the spindle torque showed a non linear trend with drift angle for both propellers and its variation with propeller loading observed also for the periodic load was consistent with the movement of the point of action of hydrodynamic forces to inner blade radii the weaker variation of the averaged loads on the leeward propeller with the increase of drift angle is ascribed to the effect of the cross flow in the lower half of the disk that acts to reduce the incidence angle of blade sections this effects cancels out the overloading associated to blade wake interactions occurring in the first half of the cycle on the contrary on the windward side the cross flow provides the opposite effect in the lower half of the disk that is not counter balanced by a comparable load reduction in the upper half of the disk associated to the concurrent contribution of the axial and tangential components of the inflow the increase of propeller loading causes the fluctuation of the signals to be reduced in fact the percentage increase of the cyclic blade loads is lower in the intervals of the cycle the blade develops higher loading this behavior can be ascribed to unsteady development of the self induced velocity field that acts to smooth and shift in phase the gradients of the nominal inflow and are stronger the higher the unsteady content i e spatial non uniformity of the incoming flow other effects on the generation of the loads have to be obviously ascribed to localized alteration of the wake caused by modification of reynolds number on the leeward propeller and froude number free surface with reduction of the towing speed and in general to the pre stall or stall regimes experienced by the blade sections for example in lower half of the windward propeller and blade vortex interactions for the opposite side the other focus of the study consisted of the comparison of the single blade loads obtained with towing test with the free running results of the same reference speed correspondent to f n 0 26 ortolani and dubbioso 2019a in order to assess the reliability of towing tank tests to investigate the off design performance of the propeller and highlight critical conditions in general both the averaged and cycle resolved loads obtained with the towing tests compared satisfactorily with the free running for close equivalent drift angle and propeller loading specifically better accuracy was obtained for the windward propeller given the simpler nature of the unperturbed flow on the leeward propeller the source of discrepancies arose in the first half of the cycle characterized by the propeller wake interactions these are associated to alterations of the inflow caused by removing roll and yaw motion during the oblique towing tests on the other hand the quantitative comparison was poorer for the spindle torque in particular the fluctuations were always overpredicted in case of oblique towing the error being higher in the sectors blade loading increased due to the effects of cross flow on the windward side in the lower half of the disk and wake on the leeward side in the first half cycle the present study will be complemented with the analysis in the hub frame of reference also to obtain the resulting propeller loads the issues raised by the present discussion on the cause and effect relation between the inflow and the resulting partially and qualitatively explained on the basis of preliminary numerical computations deserve a dedicated effort by means of accurate highly resolved with discretized or modeled propeller numerical computations also to achieve further progress for the validation of these tools in this regard experimental data obtained in a controlled environment reduce the uncertainties of operational conditions that arise during free running experiments in an outdoor basin moreover following a validation procedure at increasing level of difficulty the static drift motion is a simpler condition that can be

22202,maneuvering motion is a critical off design condition experienced by the propeller during realistic operations failures of the propulsive system loss of efficiency and modification of the propeller side effects propeller hull induced pressure and noise are the undesired consequences of these working conditions free running model tests still representing the primary approach for a reliable performance assessment requires facilities and devices that are not commonly affordable alternatively rectilinear towing tank can be used for maneuvering investigations by static or dynamic tests and can be a valid alternative to investigate propeller performance in off design on these basis in this paper the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions is investigated by means of oblique towing tests in case of a twin screw model equipped with a novel set up for single blade loads measurements in the experiments the drift angle and the advance speed of the model varied systematically to focus on the relation between propeller operating conditions and loads moreover the averaged and periodic blade loads are compared in terms of the equivalent drift angle to the measurements obtained by free running model tests in order to demonstrate the reliability of pure oblique flow tests for the preliminary quantification of the off design loads developed by the propeller keywords captive model tests off design propeller performance pure oblique flow single blade loads 1 introduction modern trends in ship design aim to maximize the overall performance of a marine vehicle in realistic operating conditions and environment in order to guarantee safety and preservation of human life at sea and abatement of the environmental pollution for example c o 2 and noise in this context marine propeller plays a pivotal role because it is strictly related to propulsive efficiency vibrations and noise structural strength of the hull and components of the propulsion systems bearings a ship during realistic operations experiences low and high amplitude motions due to control actions and environmental disturbances waves and wind that alter the flow around the hull and the inflow to the propeller in these conditions the hydrodynamics of the blade is different from the design point traditionally established by the nominal wake field in calm water at the target speed with consequent alteration of the loads and pressure field generated by the propeller as a result both the steady and the fluctuating character of the blades and propeller loads are modified for example investigation by free running maneuvering model tests and c f d analysis highlighted that in the case of twin screw configuration the asymmetric behavior of the loads has to be ascribed to different mechanisms associated to the complex interactions with coherent structures and separated flow and relevant cross flow velocity for the leeward and windward propeller respectively ortolani et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 propeller thrust and torque for the more loaded shaft can increase up to 100 with respect to the straight ahead and be almost doubled compared to the other one more importantly relevant in plane forces and moments are generated that can be of the order of 30 and 80 of the thrust and torque these loads critically affect the structural strength of the propulsive shaft and are responsible of one of the most frequent accident of seagoing ships vartdal et al 2009 they furthermore provide a non negligible contribution to the dynamic response of the ship r broglia et al 2013 an important step into this topic has been recently tackled by captive model tests on isolated unit of pod orientable propulsion unit devices and free running maneuvering test on ship model with conventional propulsion in facts pod units owing to their peculiar working conditions could develop large time variable loads that can be further amplified by dynamic effects during transients amini and steen 2011 a detailed assessment of azimuthal thrusters and pod performance needed the development of advanced experimental techniques koushan 2006 and amini and steen 2012 developed an hub mounted blade and propeller transducer to deeply investigate these problems and obtain high quality experimental data for the validation of viscous flow solvers krasilinov et al 2009 berchiche et al 2018 the free running maneuvering tests were performed on a twin screw model equipped with an innovative experimental set up dedicated to the measure of the single blade loads resolved during the period of revolution of the propeller ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in particular this study highlighted that the fluctuation of the load during the cycle can be of the order of 100 of the mean and these fluctuations are not necessarily related to the severity of the maneuver i e rudder angle but are mostly due to complex interaction of blade with vortical structures or separated flow as a result off design conditions can anyhow be experienced either at low and high rudder angles depending on the flow features that characterize the propeller inflow in particular the case at small rudder angle is very interesting from a practical perspective because this sailing condition is easily met in realistic operations by ships whenever the autopilot is active or to achieve route optimization for low fuel consumption motion in waves is also critical for the overall behavior of the marine propeller because modifications to the inflow are usually associated to marked axial and tangential velocities gradients which have a detrimental effect for the development of cavitation patterns and related side effects i e pressure pulses and radiated noise taskar and steen 2016 taskar et al 2017 advanced ship model testing is still a reliable mean for analyzing the propeller behavior during off design conditions since the earlier design stages although c f d allows the simulation of the complete geometry and rotating propeller carrica et al 2012 mofidi and carrica 2014 muscari et al 2011 a complete validation specified for the case of propeller and single blade loads is not provided due to the lack of experimental data abbas and kornev 2016 sun et al 2018 moreover the required computational resources are prohibitive for day by day application for these kind of simulations since the temporal resolution and the spatial discretization is constrained to resolution of blade flow in this work the behavior of the propeller in off design conditions is systematically investigated by means of pure drift test in the c n r i n m towing tank the model is a unit of a twin screw naval ship the same used for extensive free running maneuvering tests documented in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the propeller performance is gathered by single blade loads measurements obtained by means of a 6 component load cell located inside the propeller hub in the experiments drift angle was changed up to 30 and towing speeds was reduced up to 70 of the reference speed correspondent to froude number f n 0 26 these values were set in order to obtain nominal kinematic conditions representative of the free running model tests at the same reference speed this kind of investigation is not a standard in ship model testing according to the authors knowledge a similar experiment was attempted in blaurock 1975 for a single screw merchant ship towed in pure oblique flow using a custom cantilever beam transducer however this transducer measured only two blade bending moments at different points of the beam from which the blade thrust and side force were obtained assuming a linear distribution of the moments and moreover the drift angles were limited to 10 the analysis is centred on the single blade loads and the cause effect relation with respect to the nominal wake features strengthened by preliminary cfd simulation and p i v measurements carried out for this model at intermediate drift angles capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 the blade loads obtained in towing tests are further compared to the free running results for the most similar kinematic conditions in terms of both mean and cyclic load this assessment is useful to prove the reliability of pure oblique test to accurately reproduce off design behavior of the propellers in order to identify possible critical conditions at least for similar twin screw configurations with respect to free running self propelled model tests this is the most realistic approach to simulate accurately ship operating conditions although this kind of test requires specific indoor oceanic tank or outdoor lakes with low disturbances facilities that are not commonly affordable on the other hand the data obtained with this experiment are attractive for numerical validation given the absence of undesired environmental disturbance that inevitably affect the free running experiment in an outdoor basin 2 test case and experimental set up the selected test case is a 1 25 scaled model about 6 m of a fast twin screw twin rudder unit the main features of the model and the propeller are reported in table 1 where l b t c b are respectively the length between perpendiculars the overall breadth the draught and the block coefficient the ship and propeller model are depicted in fig 1 the model is equipped with two couples of stabilizer fins bilge keels horn rudders and the typical configuration of propulsive shaft supported by brackets the five blade propellers rotate counterclockwise inward rotating from top these experiments were carried out with the same set up adopted in the velocimetry campaign described in capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 that consisted of the fully appended model with rudders removed this choice was preferable for the measure of the nominal wake at incidence angle because it would have been affected by a non representative perturbation from the rudder it being not affected by the propeller wake moreover this allows to synthesize the cause and effect relation between the nominal wake and propeller loads univocally the novel set up for measuring the single blade loads is implemented on the starboard propeller the complete system of loads 3 forces and 3 moments acting on a single blade fig 2 is measured by a 6 components off the shelf transducer housed inside the propeller supporting one of the blades the calibrated ranges and measurement uncertainties of forces t x y z and moments q x y z provided by the manufacturer of the transducer are reported in table 2 power supply and signal from transducer channels are transmitted to the acquisition system through high quality low noise and low resistance slip rings the isolated and hull mounted propeller are shown in fig 2 tests are carried out in the cnr inm towing tank facility the towing tank features a 475 m long 13 5 m wide and 6 5 m deep basin four electric main motors 92 kw and two secondary motors 45 kw can drive the tank carriage up to 15 m s with an accuracy of 1 mm s and speed fluctuations within 3 the carriage has been equipped with a planar motion mechanism p m m this device allows to impose to the model a prescribed trajectory combining sway and yaw motions if the purpose is the investigation of dynamic forces during complex manoeuvres during the test subject of this paper pmm has been just used to easily change and measure the drift angle within the desired range the drift angle β between the model axis and the direction of motion of the carriage can be set with an accuracy of 0 1 a schematics of the towing tank set up is shown in fig 3 the positive sign of β corresponds to rotation of the bow to starboard and the instrumented propeller is on the leeward internal side the complete test matrix of the experimental campaign is summarized in table 3 at least five runs were repeated for each test condition the oblique towing tests were executed at different drift angle β and towing speed with roll motion constrained to the neutral position the nominal advance speed corresponds to f n 0 26 and reynolds number r e 1 053 e 7 propeller angular speed is set at the model self propulsion point in straight ahead motion β 0 in order to mimic the propeller functioning during free running model tests propeller r p s are kept constant during all tests the nominal advance coefficient of the propeller j at β 0 evaluated with the speed of the model is 1 05 3 data analysis the procedure at the basis of the analysis of the single blade loads signals is schematized in fig 4 for a generic run at fixed speed and drift angle at first the full acquisition is re sampled at steps of 1 per blade revolution this process allows to perform a consistent statistical analysis of the data at same blade angle positions for the set of cycles after slicing the record into single cycles in particular the mean x and standard deviation σ of the generic load for the collection of cycles were calculated at each blade position in order to obtain the representative mean trend of the generic load and uncertainty during the period the same analysis was performed on the averaged values over each period each record consisted of more than 200 cycles in this work the results of single runs per condition are discussed and therefore this process corresponds to the first step of the generalized procedure described in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a fig 5 describes the reference systems used in the analysis and the correspondent definition of forces t x y z and moments q x y z exerted on the single blade the loads are measured with respect to the rotating frame centred at the blade root and the axis green colored in the figure on the left are identified with t superscripts the frame is defined with x pointing forward z radially outward y determined by right hand rule the data were converted to the frame rotating with the blade and centred at the propeller axis i e the blade frame identified by blue colored axes and b superscript the angular position θ of the b frame with respect to the hub frame fixed with respect to the rotating blade identifies the position of the blade during the cycle θ is positive oriented with the sense of rotation and is zero for the blade at 12 o clock position note that the propeller on the left inset of the figure is the starboard one and it is seen from behind moreover the measured loads match the inertial and the hydrodynamic components in this work the analysis is focused on the hydrodynamic component derived by subtracting the inertial component from the measured one the complete procedure is detailed in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b and is not repeated here for the sake of brevity in the following discussion the period of revolution of the propeller is divided in four sectors the first one defined for 0 θ 90 and so on the loads are presented in the usual non dimensional form i e the forces k t x y z and moments k q x y z are made non dimensional by factors ρ n 2 d 4 and ρ n 2 d 5 respectively where d is the diameter n is the propeller rate of revolution rps and ρ is water density in this work the analysis of the loads is carried out for the single blade in the b frame 3 1 comparison with free running model tests the comparison of the loads in pure drift towing with the stabilized phase of the turning circle obtained during free running test should be ideally compared at equal inflow conditions at the propellers the terms that identify the operating condition of the propeller are the advance coefficient j or the speed drop since propeller rate of revolution is set equal to the free running tests and the nominal drift angle in correspondence to the propeller plane in case of a free running maneuver the drift angle β p in correspondence to the propeller plane must account for the contribution of the yaw speed of the model ψ see fig 6 b 1 β p β h t a n 1 ψ x p u h t a n 1 v h u h t a n 1 ψ x p u h where β h is the drift angle of the hull u h and v h are the longitudinal and lateral components of the speed of the hull and x p is the longitudinal position of the propeller with respect to pivot point the reduction of speed adopted in the captive model tests is in the range monitored for this model in the stabilized phase of the turn from moderate to high rudder angles ortolani and dubbioso 2019a the equivalence of the drift angle in correspondence to the two maneuvers obviously does not guarantee the identical inflow because during turning and pure oblique towing the distribution of the drift angle is different and hence discrepancies can be expected for the wake evolving past the hull in fact see bottom half of fig 6b the coupled sway yaw motion during the free running maneuver causes the longitudinal sections of the hull to experience a linear variation of the drift angle and the drift angle to switch from negative to positive values on the other hand during oblique towing the longitudinal distribution of the drift angle is constant obviously a further source of discrepancies of the inflow to the propeller and hence loads is caused by the absence of roll motion and rudders during the towing tests 4 results the single blade loads are presented referring to the rotating frame b frame in terms of their average and complete time history during the period of rotation of the propeller the discussion of the results systematically highlights the effect of propeller loading different j at fixed β and the effect of drift angle at constant loading different β at fixed j for the sake of conciseness the focus is paid to blade thrust k t x side force k t y and spindle moment k q z since blade torque k q x and bending moment k q y are proportional to the previous two components the origin of the blade loads is discussed referring to the characteristics of the nominal wake i e the inflow to the propeller by applying 2 dimensional airfoil theory see fig 7 the loads are directly proportional to the incidence angle α of the propeller sections that results from the combination of the axial velocity u a and the tangential velocity v t relative to the blade foil introducing the velocity components of the flow u v and w at the generic section the propeller angular speed ω 2 π n where n are r p s and the geometric pitch angle of the section θ the total tangential velocity v t a n the relative inflow angle φ and the incidence angle can be easily determined 2 axial velocity u a u tang

and the distance sectional centre of pressure of the loads from the spindle axis d c p of generic section position r along the blade span the forces and moments developed by the blades result from the

in tables 4 6 the error of the measures is in general less than 10 and is comparable to the free running results ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in case of the spindle torque the percentage error is very high given the very small magnitude of the mean the establishment at least qualitative of the relation between the inlet velocity of the propeller given by the wake evolution past the hull and the blade loads is propaedeutic to understand the variation of propeller loading during the turn the characteristics of the nominal wake are briefly surmised for the representative conditions in straight ahead small and high drift angle correspondent to β 15 and 30 respectively in fig 8 obtained by preliminary c f d computations with a coarse grid that are currently in progress for a detailed numerical validation calcagni et al 2019 these features are also comparable to c f d computations for a similar twin screw model ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in the representation in drift the starboard propeller is on the leeward side and the cross flow is directed from left to right it has to be noted that the lee windward sides are inverted with respect to the reference adopted in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a while it is consistent with the analysis proposed in capone et al 2019 ortolani et al 2019 this preliminary analysis is focused on the tests performed at the nominal towing speed f n 0 26 i e v 1 for both the mean and cyclic blade loads showed in fig 9 grey bars and fig 10 the internal and external propeller experience a marked asymmetric behavior caused by the different character of the inflow on the two sides qualitatively the trends of blade thrust and side force are similar given their direct proportionality with the angle of incidence see eq 2 therefore considerations for thrust apply to both components in general k t x k t y on the windward side increases monotonically up to 90 70 at β 30 with respect to the nominal value in rectilinear motion this behavior is attributable to the fact that the inflow to the propeller is similar to a pure oblique flow and hence its incidence is approximately equal to the drift of the hull details are provided studying the load variation during the period reported on the left of fig 10a and its relation with the wake sketched in fig 8 in straight ahead motion k t x is characterized by two peaks in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants see red colored line that are both associated to the reduction of the axial velocity the first at θ 45 is the weaker one and is related to the perturbation past the inner bracket conversely the velocity defect at θ 120 is associated to the wake shed past the hull in particular both the velocity defect and the tangential velocity act to increase the flow incidence of the blade sections it is interesting to observe that the tangential flow is upwards oriented and is non negligible only in the outward half of the disk on the inner half it is much smaller probably due to the v shaped lines of the stern that weaken the vertical momentum of the flow and deflect it longitudinally it is worth noticing that in case of the model characterized by a pram stern studied in muscari et al 2017 the thrust and side force evolved with a similar trend in that case the second peak of the blade loads was associated to the increase of the angle of attack caused by the increase of the tangential velocity relative to the blade foils in fact due to the rectangular shape of transverse sections of the stern the tangential velocity was upwards oriented and uniformly distributed over the disk while the axial velocity was mainly disturbed by the wake of the brackets the load diminishes up to θ 270 because the nominal wake is not perturbed and the tangential flow is concordant to blade rotation and then it rises again due to the increase of the velocity defect past the outer bracket and blockage of the hull in drift motion the signal completely changes and it is qualitatively similar for all drift angles the blade develops the higher load in the lower half of the disk because the cross flow is opposite to blade rotation in the upper half of the disk the cross flow plays the opposite effect and the blade loading reduces however in the 1 s t quadrant a smaller fluctuation approximately at θ 80 is visible that is caused by the axial velocity defect caused by flow separation past the shaft see fig 8b it is interesting to observe that the magnitude of the peaks at θ 200 are more than doubled with respect to the average one for β higher than 15 and almost triplicated with respect to the mean value in straight ahead sailing with reference to fig 9a b on the leeward side the trend of k t x k t y is almost constant with the exception of a weak drop at β 20 as a matter of fact this is due to the fact that during the cycle sector of load increase are almost equally balanced by sector the load decreases a better insight is provided by the periodic signals reported on the right of fig 10 in drift motion the thrust varies with a similar trend for drift angle up to β 20 in particular the signal is characterized by a single peak in the 1 s t quadrant that gradually increases up to 30 of the maximum value in straight ahead this is caused by the interaction of the blade with coherent structures detached from the appendages and bilges that increase the tangential velocity relative to the blade then the load abruptly drops approximately in the 2 n d quadrant because the cross flow induced by the drift motion is concordant with the blade rotation and the tangential velocity relative to the foil the incidence angle and loads are reduced consequently during the upstroke motion of the blade the load starts again to increase as a consequence of the reduction of the axial speed caused by flow separation past the shaft bracket and deflected wake of the hull at the highest drift angle the flow is massively separated see fig 8c in the 1 s t quadrant the increase of the load is associated to both velocity defect past the bracket and hull and the cross flow in the second half of the period the almost constant trend of the load in the 3 r d quadrant is related to the concurrent contribution of axial and tangential speed on one side the axial velocity is reduced by the wake of the hull and in particular the flow separated from the shaft on the other side the cross flow induces a tangential flow that is concordant to blade rotation and acts to reduce the load finally in the 4 t h the load again increases as a consequence of the combined effect of tangential velocity downwards oriented induced by the big vortical structure shed past the hull and the axial velocity defect the spindle torque demands a dedicated analysis since its link with the inflow is not immediate in fact as observed in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a in the case of a skewed blade k q z is strictly related to the span wise variation of the hydrodynamic centre and propeller loading at v 1 in terms of averaged values fig 9c on the leeward propeller this couple is always positive i e it acts to reduce the pitch of the blade gradually diminishing by half its value at β 30 except for a small increase at β 20 on the windward side its behavior is completely different k q z is very small neutral for intermediate angle and then drops abruptly to a negative value having the same magnitude of β 0 these different trends are better explained by means of the periodic evolution reported in fig 10c in general it can be observed that the overall trend of k q z follows the behavior of k t x and k t y but the sign is markedly dependent on blade loading the spindle torque values are positive for light loads as in case of β 0 while change sign and reach the highest absolute values under heavy conditions for example referring to the evolution of blade thrust on the windward side left panel in fig 10a for non zero drift angle the blade loading both k t x and k t y in absolute value increases during the descending motion of the blade i e in the 1 s t half of the period and diminishes after β 220 as a consequence of the concordant orientation of the cross flow with blade rotation evidently the evolution of the spindle torque is concordant with this evolution in terms of development and plot similarity k q z starting from positive values diminishes to negative during the most critical conditions this can be ascribed to the evolution of the center of pressure on a skewed blade it can be inferred that during the cycle the centre of pressure moves from larger to smaller radial positions when the blade loading increases and vice versa due to the skew the centre of pressure starts behind the spindle axis to yield a positive couple and gradually moves forward to cross over it to reduce and yield a negative spindle arm ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the trends reported in fig 10c are influenced by this behavior in terms of unbalances between higher and lighter load occurrences which determine the mean value during the entire period of revolution the smaller variation of the couple on the lee side is explained with the fact that gains in the upper half of the disk caused by wake blade interaction mechanisms are canceled during the blade passage in the lower half of the disk on the contrary on the windward side the blade loading is completely imbalanced the increase of load in the lower half of the disk due to cross flow being higher with respect to the upper half where axial and tangential velocity provide opposite contribution 4 2 effect of propeller loading on single blade loads the effect of propeller loading is shown in fig 9 at lower towing speeds that are representative of speed drop recorded during free running turning circle maneuvers performed at different rudder angles the reduction of the towing speed causes k t x and k t y to increase principally because the reduction of the axial speed to the propeller causes the incidence angle to raise in general the maximum increase of the load is progressively reduced with the increase of the drift angle the thrust and side force and related moments on the windward side always increase with the drift angle at fixed speed conversely on the leeward side the forces diminish with β differently from the previously discussed case at v 1 0 these aspects can be related to the progressive alteration of the incoming flow nominal wake by the self induced velocity field that is stronger with the increase of propeller loading in more details this mechanism is driven by the memory effect associated to the temporal variation of the circulation shed in the wake of the propeller this leads to a temporal delay on the establishment of the effective angle of attack and hence the loads that is stronger the more spatially variable is the incoming flow as a result of these effects the fluctuations of the load can be weakened blaurock 1975 misztal 1933 as in the present case for the internal propeller whose inflow is affected by stronger velocity gradients due to the wake detached from the hull the increase of propeller loading in general causes the reduction of the mean value of the spindle torque at fixed drift angle the total variation of k q z drops with β both on the leeward and windward side although the trend at intermediate propeller loading is not well defined as observed for the forces probably because the strict relation with the geometric characteristics of the blade the reduction of the spindle torque is consistent with the explanation of the periodic variation of this couple during the cycle i e the hydrodynamic centre moves towards inner blade radii with the increase of angle of attack and hence blade loading the periodic variation of the loads reported for the thrust and spindle moment in figs 11 and 12 provide further insight on the aspects observed for the mean values in particular it can be easily evidenced that the global fluctuation of the load is weakened with speed reduction the percentage variation increase in case of k t x and decrease in case of k q z of the loads is smaller in correspondence to higher blade loads this fact can be clearly observed for blade thrust at β 0 β 15 leeward side and at β 30 windward side in fig 11c and 11d respectively specifically at β 0 fig 11a the peak at θ 50 associated to the velocity defect past the shaft is gradually weakened and disappears at v 0 7 on the internal side at β 15 fig 11c the load is gradually weakened in correspondence to the peak in the first quadrant caused by the interaction of the blade with the vortex conversely on the external propeller k t x collapses during the passage in the lower half of the disk fig 11d this aspect can be also caused by localized flow separations due to the excessive increase of incidence angle as it seems to be confirmed by trend of spindle torque shown in fig 12d in fact the evolution of the negative peak at θ 180 matches with the outward shift of the hydrodynamic centre instead of an inward shift as expected by previous analysis in section 4 1 finally at β 30 during the second half of the cycle the growth rate of k t x diminishes with speed drop in this region see fig 8c on the leeward side the blade is impinged by a tangential flow that acts to increase the incidence angle it is plausible that the reduction of the towing speed causes the premature separation of past the hull or appendages the reynolds number is lower and thus the vortical structure would be convected farther from the propeller with the consequent reduction of the downward tangential flow this trend inversion is also confirmed by spindle torque in the 4 t h quadrant see fig 12e its variation being consistent with the outward shift of the hydrodynamic centre that happens with the unloading of the blade at this drift angle the trend of the loads on both windward and leeward side can be affected by the free surface because it can modify the evolution of the wake past the hull at stern at the different speeds 4 3 comparison with free running model tests the comparison with free running model tests is shown in figs 13 18 for the averaged and cyclic loads the propeller revolution are set equal to the self propulsion condition at the nominal froude number 0 26 obtained during the free running experiments and are kept constant for all the drift conditions in case of the mean loads the comparison is performed in terms of the equivalent drift angle β e f f on the other hand the comparison of the periodic loads is performed considering for towing tests the loads obtained at speed drops closer to the free running test in order to have a global overview on the two key parameters of this systematic analysis in table 7 the equivalent drift angle and speed drop correspondent to the turning circles obtained at different rudder angles are summarized the values of the speed drop for the free running tests are reported as labels in the figs 13 15 and 17 to synthesize exhaustively the comparison of the two different kind of tests the comparison of the mean value of blade thrust and side force are shown in fig 13 and torque and bending moment are represented in fig 15 the loads are presented in terms of ratio with respect to the mean value in straight ahead motion the correspondence of the free running results with oblique towing is very satisfactory both on the windward and on the leeward side for both forces and moments in fact at increasing equivalent drift angle free running loads matches well with oblique towing o t results at diminishing speed higher propeller loading this trend reproduces correctly the physics since during a turning circle manoeuvre the increase of rudder angle here conceptually replaced by the equivalent drift angle corresponds to a stronger reduction of the absolute velocity to the propeller ortolani and dubbioso 2019a the agreement between free running and oblique towing is worse on the internal propeller in case of k t y and k q x at β e f f 7 5 moreover the torque seems to be overestimated by towing tests for the intermediate equivalent drift angle β e f f 15 and 22 5 the comparison of the periodic loads is provided for blade thrust and torque in figs 14 and 16 specifically in case of k t x the agreement of the loads is satisfactory although discrepancies are evident on both propellers the fluctuation and the magnitude of the peak matches well on the leeward side the comparison is worse in case of the lower drift angle because the loads are affected by the passage of vortical structures close or through the propeller disk in fact in the first half of the cycle the thrust is phase shifted then the matching improves in the last interval of the cycle 250 θ 360 in the 3 r d quadrant the thrust has a clear minima and is not constant as in case of the oblique towing at higher drift right panel in fig 14b the error of the phase position of the peak and its magnitude is limited in the 1 s t quadrant moreover in case of the free running tests in the lowest half of the disk the variation of k t x is smoother with respect to the oblique towing finally it has to be noticed that in case of the oblique towing the maximum value is experienced at β 15 whereas the peak slightly increases for tightest maneuver in case of the free running on the windward side the agreement is better than the leeward side the signals are correctly phased and the most evident error is experienced for the peak value at the maximum drift angle that is overestimated by towing tests moreover the fluctuation in the 1 s t quadrant ascribed to the interaction of the blade with the wake past the shaft is smoother in case of the free running the comparison of the blade torque k q x is shown in fig 16 on the left panel the comparison is proposed for lower drift angle on the leeward side in order to highlight the source of the discrepancy observed for the mean loads qualitatively the trend of the signals is similar to blade thrust the agreement being satisfactory only in the last quarter of the cycle in this case the blade loads and distribution are strongly affected by magnitude and phase of the inflow velocity gradients and hence alteration caused by the different attitude roll and wake evolution on the external side right panel the accordance is very satisfactory since the inflow essentially a pure oblique flow with the exception of limited portions of the disk affected by the wake past the shaft or hull is better reproduced by towing in drift finally the comparison of the spindle torque is provided in fig 17 in terms of mean value and in fig 18 for the cyclic load in this case the comparison is worse than the previous cases probably due to the higher sensitivity to differences of the inflow however the trend of the free running is qualitatively captured by the towing tests associated to the equivalent drift and speed drop loading in terms of periodic loads the error is almost equivalent for the leeward and windward propellers although the trends and the local maxima and phase of the signals are well captured the fluctuation of the loads is markedly overestimated by the towing tests in particular in the intervals of the period the blade overloads namely 1 s t quadrant for the internal propeller and first half cycle for the external one in general the representation of the loads in terms of ratio highlights that the fluctuation of the loads and the maximum peak during the cycle can be of the order of 150 and 400 of the mean value in straight ahead condition respectively 5 conclusions and future works in this work a systematic experimental investigation on the loads generated by the blade of a marine propeller in behind hull was carried out in pure oblique towing this work is complementary to the free running maneuvering tests presented in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a carried out on the same model of a twin screw naval unit the test conditions were designed to study the effect of propeller loading for a wide range of drift angles representative of weak to tight manoeuvres propeller performance is assessed by measuring the single blade loads with a novel set up developed at cnr inm the experimental data are synthesized by two different analysis and with the aid of preliminary c f d computation of nominal wake in order to highlight the cause and effect relation between the loads and the propeller inflow in the first one the averaged and fluctuating blade loads are systematically discussed in terms of drift angle and propeller loading the behavior of the propellers in drift condition is markedly distinct due to completely different characteristics of their inflow on the windward side the mean blade forces thrust and side force and related moments torque and bending moment always increase monotonically with drift angle at the different towing speed on the contrary this trend is not confirmed on the leeward side in fact increasing the propeller loading i e reduction of the towing speed the rate varies from being almost neutral to negative in general at every fixed drift angle the loads increases with speed reduction at a diminishing rate with the increase of drift angle the spindle torque showed a non linear trend with drift angle for both propellers and its variation with propeller loading observed also for the periodic load was consistent with the movement of the point of action of hydrodynamic forces to inner blade radii the weaker variation of the averaged loads on the leeward propeller with the increase of drift angle is ascribed to the effect of the cross flow in the lower half of the disk that acts to reduce the incidence angle of blade sections this effects cancels out the overloading associated to blade wake interactions occurring in the first half of the cycle on the contrary on the windward side the cross flow provides the opposite effect in the lower half of the disk that is not counter balanced by a comparable load reduction in the upper half of the disk associated to the concurrent contribution of the axial and tangential components of the inflow the increase of propeller loading causes the fluctuation of the signals to be reduced in fact the percentage increase of the cyclic blade loads is lower in the intervals of the cycle the blade develops higher loading this behavior can be ascribed to unsteady development of the self induced velocity field that acts to smooth and shift in phase the gradients of the nominal inflow and are stronger the higher the unsteady content i e spatial non uniformity of the incoming flow other effects on the generation of the loads have to be obviously ascribed to localized alteration of the wake caused by modification of reynolds number on the leeward propeller and froude number free surface with reduction of the towing speed and in general to the pre stall or stall regimes experienced by the blade sections for example in lower half of the windward propeller and blade vortex interactions for the opposite side the other focus of the study consisted of the comparison of the single blade loads obtained with towing test with the free running results of the same reference speed correspondent to f n 0 26 ortolani and dubbioso 2019a in order to assess the reliability of towing tank tests to investigate the off design performance of the propeller and highlight critical conditions in general both the averaged and cycle resolved loads obtained with the towing tests compared satisfactorily with the free running for close equivalent drift angle and propeller loading specifically better accuracy was obtained for the windward propeller given the simpler nature of the unperturbed flow on the leeward propeller the source of discrepancies arose in the first half of the cycle characterized by the propeller wake interactions these are associated to alterations of the inflow caused by removing roll and yaw motion during the oblique towing tests on the other hand the quantitative comparison was poorer for the spindle torque in particular the fluctuations were always overpredicted in case of oblique towing the error being higher in the sectors blade loading increased due to the effects of cross flow on the windward side in the lower half of the disk and wake on the leeward side in the first half cycle the present study will be complemented with the analysis in the hub frame of reference also to obtain the resulting propeller loads the issues raised by the present discussion on the cause and effect relation between the inflow and the resulting partially and qualitatively explained on the basis of preliminary numerical computations deserve a dedicated effort by means of accurate highly resolved with discretized or modeled propeller numerical computations also to achieve further progress for the validation of these tools in this regard experimental data obtained in a controlled environment reduce the uncertainties of operational conditions that arise during free running experiments in an outdoor basin moreover following a validation procedure at increasing level of difficulty the static drift motion is a simpler condition that can be

22203,in this study we investigate the kinematic responses of submerged bodies under the motion of internal solitary waves isws with laboratory experiment a two dimensional isw was generated in an isw tank of 15 0 4 0 6 m dimension with a water depth of 0 5 m the velocity field of the isw was measured by the particle image velocimetry and the kinematic responses were recorded using a charged coupled device camera different conditions such as isw amplitude ratio of the thickness of the upper layer to that of the lower layer and depth and shape of the submerged structure were considered the results show that the amplitude of isws significantly affects their heave motion and the relative distances between a model and pycnocline significantly influences the surge motion the amplitude of the heave motion of the model was lower than that of the isw under the corresponding conditions the model in fluid with a thin upper layer which easily causes strong nonlinearity undergoes a more violent motion response an empirical expression of the relationship between the maximum displacement of the surge motion and the velocity of the isws was also proposed keywords kinematic response submerged structure internal solitary wave particle image velocimetry 1 introduction internal solitary waves isws can be generated in stratified fluids with pycnocline when a very sharp density change occurs along an interface the smaller the difference in density the lower the wave frequency and the slower the propagation speed apel 1987 isws travel hundreds of meters along the pycnocline which causes unusually strong underwater currents that may create large loads that deep sea drilling rigs or platforms are subject to cai et al 2003 in addition the internal waves on the continental margins have significant influences on biology engineering military activities and large scale ocean circulations wang et al 2012 garrett 2003a garrett 2003b lamb 2014 mackinnon et al 2017 the exploration of natural resources on the continental shelf where isws occur frequently plays an important role in the development of ocean resources however numerous accidents have damaged floating structures for example the equipment on the liuhua offshore oil platform was damaged by isws during tanker operations and platform installation in the south china sea bole et al 1994 the discoverer 534 platform has provided the measurements of drillship responses to internal wave activities at depths ranging from 1900 to over 3400 ft and the maximum measured current velocity induced by an isw reached 2 6 knots osborne et al 1977 isws are important for various practical reasons they are ubiquitous in areas where strong tides and stratification occur near irregular topography a european remote sensing satellite ers 1 synthetic aperture radar image showed four continental shelf isw packets located northeast of the hudson canyon off new york apel 2000 such phenomena have occurred in the sulu sea in the philippines apel and holbrook 1983 apel et al 1985 liu et al 1985 hsu and liu 2000 in the strait between the luzon strait and taiwan hsu et al 2000 in arcs of the andaman and nicobar islands in the eastern indian ocean apel 1979 osborne and burch 1980 alpers et al 1997 in the semi enclosed east china sea in the western pacific jackson and apel 2004 and in the south china sea huang et al 2016 bai et al 2017 many studies on the effect of isws on marine structures have been conducted and this effect is one of the factors that must be considered when designing marine structures especially in areas where isws occur frequently the shear forces and torques exerted by isws on a supposed rigid pile was calculated in a study by si et al 2012 their results indicate that the shear force and torque of an isw on a rigid pile can reach up to 105 n and 109 nm respectively the motion response of a spar platform subjected to isws was theoretically investigated in a study by song et al 2011 the maximum force induced by an isw is smaller than that of surface waves however the surge motion induced by an isw of the spar platform is three times of that induced by the surface waves thus it should be considered furthermore the motion response of a top tensioned riser under excitation caused by isws surface waves and vessel motion was theoretically and numerically explored in research works by guo et al 2013 and fan et al 2017 the conclusions of their works highlighted that an isw will cause large displacement of drilling risers especially at the location where pycnocline is situated furthermore the forces that isws create on fixed structures i e cylindrical semisubmersible platform or slender bodied structures were experimentally theoretically and numerically studied in research works by chen et al 2017 2018 cai et al 2003 2006 and wei et al 2014 respectively these researches demonstrated that an isw has significant effect on fixed structures furthermore the force and torque induced by an isw vary with the layer thickness ratio and wave amplitude especially in a study of wei et al 2014 they mentioned that characteristics of the internal wave forces depend on the wave amplitude and the model position in depth previous studies on the interactions between isws and floating or submerged structures mainly concentrated on the forces isws created on fixed structures and very few studies have been conducted on the motion responses of structures under the action of isws du et al 2017 used a flexible rope to suspend a submarine model for motion response experiments and their results highlighted that the center of gravity cg tracks of the submarine under isws were irregular ellipticals and the responses of the submarine to heaves surges and pitches were significant however the motion response was affected by the restraints of the flexible rope in our experiments the motion response of free suspended models under the action of isw was investigated the particle image velocimetry piv technology raffel et al 2007 were used to detect the velocity filed by the isws and the motion response of models the experimental results were compared with the theoretical results in this study experiment setup is shown in section 2 in section 3 we compared the experimental results of the isw characteristics with the theoretical values furthermore in section 4 we described the motion response of the models in detail we also considered the effects of amplitude of an isw and the position of the model on motion response in section 5 we analyzed the dimensionless motion response results with the dimensionless isw characteristics finally the paper is summarized in section 6 2 facility and experimental procedure the experiment was conducted in the state key laboratory of physical oceanography ocean university of china the isw tank shown in fig 1 is approximately 15 m long has a cross section of 0 4 0 6 m and the total depth of the fluid is 0 5 m the fluid densities in the upper and lower layers are ρ 1 1030 kg m 3 and ρ 2 1051 kg m 3 respectively the thickness ratios β between the upper and lower layers were set as 1 9 2 8 and 3 7 under different conditions a global coordinate system was set up as shown in fig 1 the isw velocity and heave and surge motions were described in this coordinate system the positive direction of the pitch motion is anticlockwise isws were generated by the lock release method kao et al 1985 sutherland et al 2015 a lock release area with a length of x 0 40 cm was set with a watertight manually movable gate at the upstream end of the tank five height differences η 0 5 25 cm at 5 cm intervals were set to generate the isws with different amplitudes in a previous study it was observed that the amplitudes of isws are linearly correlated with their height differences as shown in fig 2 the results are from cui et al 2019 the shape of a submerged structure is an important factor that influences its motion response thus two different models composed of nylon spherical model with a diameter of d 8 8 cm and a cylindrical model with a diameter of d 8 0 cm and length of l 29 8 cm were tested both models were hollow in the middle to allow their specific gravities to be easily changed by changing their specific gravities the models can be suspended in the water at a specific depth fig 3 a shows images of the submerged models the centers of gravity were set along the middle of the models slightly lower than the center of the shape fig 3b shows the spherical model suspended in the upper layer the experimental area was located in the middle of the tank which ranged from 6 to 9 m the first half of this region is a velocity field tracing area and the piv method was followed to measure the velocity fields of the isw two lasers with a maximum power of 6000 mw and wavelength of 450 2 nm were set 1 5 m above the tank and a ccd camera with a resolution of 1348 2560 and sampling frequency of 40 hz was set in front of the tank to record the particle motion furthermore a polystyrene piv particle material with a surface area of 54 093 μm2 volume of 60 627 μm3 and density of 1 04 kg m3 was used in this experiment the piv images were analyzed with correlation analysis algorithm thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the interface displacement was determined by two different procedures grue et al 1999 by measuring the vertical coordinate where there is a jump in the velocity and by visual determination of the position of the pycnocline the motion response of the model in the two dimensional 2d isw tank was recorded as a 2d motion another ccd camera was set in front of the tank to record the motion responses of the models an led optical screen was placed behind the tank to increase the contrast ratio between the model and background the motion was recorded as a binary file and was post processed as a bitmap image gray level analysis was performed to distinguish the model in the water the cg and response of the model were traced by gray level analysis that provided the motion response results fig 4 furthermore the bottom of the cylindrical model was linear fitted the slope angle of the fitted line was considered as the pitch angle of the model the grayscale of every pixel was reset by gray level analysis pixels with grayscale less than 50 would be reset to 0 and pixels with the gray level more than 50 would be reset to 255 1 g r k x i k z j k 0 g k x i k z j k 50 255 g k x i k z j k 50 all the pixels with a grayscale of 0 x w i k z w i k are identified to form a set

with different layer thickness ratios isw amplitudes and model shapes were tested case 1 3 for the cylindrical model case 10 12 for the spherical model were mainly considered of the influence of different isw amplitudes on motion responses in the pycnocline case 4 6 and 7 9 for the cylindrical model cases 13 15 and 16 18 for the spherical model were focused on to discuss the different characteristics of motion response with different distances between the model and pycnocline with layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 3 isw characteristics 3 1 theoretical description of isws 3 1 1 theories of isws the kdv equation is used to describe the isws with a low amplitude in comparison to the total depth korteweg and de vries 1895 miles 1979 koop and butler 1981 kao et al 1985 the interface displacement was expressed by the analytical solution of the kdv equation 4 ζ x t ζ 0 sech 2 x c k d v t λ k d v where the phase speed c k d v and characteristic length of the isw λ k d v of the two layer model can be expressed as follows 5 c k d v c 0 ζ 0 c 1 3 and 6 λ k d v 12 c 2 ζ 0 c 1 with 7 c 0 2 g h 1 h 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 1 c 1 3 c 0 ρ 1 h 2 2 ρ 2 h 1 2 2 ρ 1 h 1 h 2 2 ρ 2 h

camassa et al 2006 which is widely used in the calculation of velocity of isw e g xie et al 2010 and chen et al 2017 the velocities in the upper and lower layers u 1 and u 2 can be calculated by the

vertical velocities respectively 3 2 comparison of theoretical and experimental results the experimental results show that the ratios of maximum velocities of the upper and lower layers is similar to the ratios of their thickness as shown in table 2 the thickness ratios of each typical working condition the height differences of case 3 4 and 7 are 20 cm in table 1 are as follows 22 η 2 η 1 h 2 ζ 0

7 the horizontal mass transport is conserved thus it can be derived as follows 24 u 1 u 2 η 2 η 1 where u 1 is the average horizontal velocity in the upper layer u 2 is the average horizontal velocity in the lower layer v u is the maximum upward vertical velocity and v d is the maximum downward vertical velocity the experimental and theoretical results are similar fig 5 shows the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity of an isw the velocity was observed at x 8 m in the tank the horizontal velocities of the isws in the upper and lower layers are opposite and their magnitudes differ there is a sudden change in velocity at the depth of the pycnocline a nonlinear coefficient α ζ 0 h 1 is proposed as a way to determine the degree of nonlinearity of an isw a larger value of α would indicate a stronger nonlinearity of isw the nonlinear coefficients shown in fig 5a 5b and 5c are 1 56 0 83 and 0 45 respectively in fig 5a the velocity of the lower layer calculated by the kdv theory failed and the bottom velocity changed from negative to positive as both m kdv and e kdv have third order nonlinear term the two theoretical models are more effective in the event of a strong nonlinearity in fig 5b the nonlinearity is lower and the three theoretical results are reasonable whereas the results of the kdv equation from the experimental results show large biases however the other two theoretical results agreed well with the experimental results in fig 5c the fitting effects of e kdv and m kdv are still in good consistency with the experimental results the nonlinearity coefficient of the working conditions is small and the fitting results of the kdv theory are much better than those of the first two working conditions generally in the situation of our experimental setup α ranges from 0 45 to 1 56 β ranges from 0 11 to 0 43 and m kdv best fits the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity at the laboratory scale and is suitable for various upper and lower layer thickness ratios along with strong nonlinearity the e kdv theory has not been invalidated by this experiment however the predicted results differ from the experimental results in the case of strong nonlinearity with low upper and lower layer thicknesses the kdv theory can only be applied in the event of a high thickness ratio and weak nonlinearity in these cases the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity calculated by eigenfunction is larger than the results of other theories however only the results of eigenfunction shows the continuous change of velocity in the pycnocline fig 6 shows a timeseries of the horizontal velocity in the upper and lower layers of an isw the observation points in the upper and lower layers are located at z 0 03 and 0 2 m respectively the horizontal velocities at the two observation points varied significantly with time the velocity of the upper layer first increased in the positive direction and then restored to a small magnitude with time while that of the lower layer was contrasting to this in fig 6a the e kdv and m kdv theories are in good agreement with the change trend in the velocity of the upper and lower layers in fig 6b the m kdv theory fits well with the timeseries of the velocities in the upper and lower layer among the theoretical results of e kdv and kdv the duration of the velocity change is significantly shorter than that in the experiment in fig 6c the results of the e kdv and m kdv theories are in good agreement with the experimental results however the fitting results of the kdv theory are still unsatisfied in these cases the e kdv theory is consistent with the experimental results for fitting the time series of the velocity of isws in the kdv theory and eigenfunction the duration of the velocity change is shorter than the experimental duration however in the m kdv theory the duration is longer considering both the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity and the fitting results of the horizontal velocity time series the e kdv theory agreed with the experimental results better the results from the theoretical calculation were essential for further research on motion response of submerged structures under the action of isws furthermore a depth time diagram of the velocity field of an isw can be obtained from the piv results as shown in fig 7 the velocity magnitude and the interface displacement are clearly shown in this figure 4 motion response of the submerged structure as mentioned above the motion responses of submerged structures under 2 d isws include heave surge and pitch responses in this section the experimental results are presented from two aspects i e the variations in the kinematic response of the model with the amplitude of isw and the variations with the relative distances between model and pycnocline the variations in the motion response of the submerged structure under the action of isws with these experimental variables are also further explored 4 1 influence of amplitude of isw oceanic isws are frequently observed to have vertical displacements ranging from tens to hundreds of meters in amplitude sutherland 2010 the larger the amplitude the higher the velocity induced by the isw normally isws with a larger amplitude pose a greater threat to submerged bodies wei et al 2014 in this section three different amplitudes of isw about 5 6 4 and 7 8 cm were set in conditions 1 3 and 10 12 to investigate the influence of different amplitudes on the motion response of the submerged bodies the model did not travel particularly far in the x direction in presence of isw as shown in fig 8 a the model was slightly positively displaced along the x axis under the three conditions the maximum displacement was almost 0 09 m fig 8b shows the heave motion results the model sank rose with interface displacement the heave motion response form is similar to the form of interface displacement the amplitude of the heave motion is directly related to that of the isw however it is 10 6 7 8 and 13 6 lower for conditions 1 3 respectively fig 8c shows the pitch motion of the model the pitch motion began increasing in the negative direction after 7 5 s and subsequently reached the maximum value further it increased in the positive direction and reached the maximum value after 15 s the pitch motion was also related to the amplitude of isw the pitch motion became more violent with higher isw amplitudes the maximum pitch angle was almost 2 1 the cg track of the model is shown in fig 8d and the form of the cg track of the submerged structure is a rightward v with a clockwise ellipse in the lower half of the v shape the range of the ellipse was positively correlated with the isw amplitude the results for the spherical model are shown in fig 9 the track of the model s cg was a clockwise irregular ellipse during the action of the isw the surge motion of the model changed slightly in both positive and negative directions along the x axis with a maximum displacement of less than 0 06 m the heave motion exhibited the same trend as that under conditions 1 3 and the maximum displacement was 7 5 cm in the negative direction along the z axis with an increase in the amplitude of the isw the motion amplitude of the submerged structure increased gradually which included the heave and pitch motions when the amplitude of the isw is too high the pitching angle of the model will oscillate because of the wave packet following the leading wave the amplitude of the heave motion of these six conditions were smaller than that of an isw in different magnitudes fig 8c 4 2 influence of relative distances between model and pycnocline the seasonal pycnocline was situated at depths approximately between 50 and 150 m the main pycnocline in the ocean which extended to depths of 1000 m was unaffected by the seasons sutherland 2010 a submerged structure may be influenced by the upper lower or pycnocline layer effects this section explores the forms of motion response of the submerged structure at different relative distances to pycnocline d see fig 1 with layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 and the pycnocline was taken as the reference plane the three distances were d 5 0 and 5 cm which represent that the model was situated 5 cm above at the center and below the pycnocline respectively the isw amplitude was approximately 8 and 6 cm at layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 respectively the accurate amplitudes are presented in table 2 the surge motions significantly differed among conditions 4 6 when the model was in the upper layer fig 10 a d 5 cm it moved in the positive direction along the x axis by 0 7 m the model at the center of the pycnocline d 0 cm also traveled in the positive direction along the x axis by 0 3 m however when the model was in the lower layer d 5 cm it traveled in the negative direction along the x axis by 0 15 m as shown in fig 10b the effect of d on the heave motion amplitude is negligible because d values of these cases are relatively small however according to the isw theory the amplitude of the heave motion should decrease with the increase in d in fig 10c the pitch angle increased negatively first and then significantly increased to positive when d 0 cm this was contrasting to the pitch motion results of the other two cases under the three conditions the pitch amplitude was greater when d 0 cm maximum positive angle was 1 3 and maximum negative angle was 1 1 in fig 10d the model moves forward in the x direction by maximum 0 7 m and in the z direction by maximum 0 07 m the amplitude of the motion response was high especially when d 5 cm it can be seen from fig 11 a the surge motion responses of the submerged structure are higher in the upper and lower layers than those at the center of pycnocline the amplitude of the surge motion in the upper layer was approximately 0 7 m in the positive direction along the x axis and that in the lower layer was approximately 0 35 m in the negative direction along the x axis under condition 8 d 0 cm the surge motion amplitude was 0 1 m fig 11b shows that the heave motion under conditions 7 9 follows the same trend i e it first increases in the negative direction of z axis and then decreases however the amplitudes of the heave motion are not similar the amplitude of heave motion of d 5 cm was maximum and that of d 5 cm as minimum in these three conditions the same trend is also observed in conditions 16 18 in fig 12 b fig 11c shows that the pitch motion response of the model at the center of the pycnocline is much higher than that of the other two conditions and it first increase in the negative direction and then increase in the positive direction the maximum pitch angles in the negative and positive directions were 0 8 and 1 2 respectively the cg tracks of the model shown in fig 11d are similar to those shown in fig 10d the variations in the motion response of the spherical model with different relative distances with pycnocline were also studied figs 12 and 13 the overall trend of the results was similar to those of the results of conditions 4 9 thereby indicating that d greatly influences the surge motion however it has slight influence on the heave motion in these cases moreover it is known that the amplitude of isw will decrease as the increasing of the distance to pycnocline in the real ocean vlasenko and hutter 2001 it can be inferred that d has an effect on the amplitude of the heave motion when it is relatively large and the amplitude of the heave motion will decrease with an increase in d when the submerged structure is suspended near a free surface or at the bottom the amplitude of the heave motion should be extremely small however these are not the most dangerous situations we want to investigate with a layer thickness ratio of 3 7 fig 13 the variations in surge heave and cg track at different depths were very close to those shown in fig 12 the amplitudes of the surge motion at d 5 0 and 5 cm were 0 38 0 07 and 0 27 m respectively and the amplitude of heave motion was 0 07 m shape is also a key factor that affects the motion response amplitude of the model in most cases the amplitudes of the surge motion of the spherical model were smaller than those of the cylindrical model however the heave motion response amplitude of these models did not exhibit a distinct difference comparing figs 10b and 12b and figs 11b and 13b the heave motion response trends of the cylindrical and spherical models with different values of d are similar the surge motion amplitudes of the spherical model shown in fig 12a are 0 35 0 08 and 0 20 m for d 5 0 and 5 cm respectively which are significantly smaller than the results shown in fig 10a the amplitude of the heave motion is approximately 0 078 m that is to say the shape has a great influence on the motion response of the model moreover the size of the model such as the radius and length of the cylinder model and the radius of the spherical model all have the potential to affect the motion response we will study and discuss it in future research under these conditions we experimentally studied the motion responses of submerged models with different relative distances with pycnocline and layer thickness ratios the results showed that when d varies the direction of the surge motion will also change when the submerged structure was located in the upper and lower layers the submerged structures were affected by the flow velocity in a fixed direction therefore the amplitude of the surge motion was higher when the submerged structure was located at the center of the pycnocline the surge motion amplitude was not very distinct however the pitch angle changed greatly because of the influence of the shear effect of the isw velocity field and the density difference of the upper and lower layers for d 0 cm the model was first affected by the density difference and the pitch angle increased in the negative direction when the isw propagated to the model the pitch angle increased in the positive direction because of the strong shear effect for d 5 cm the model was situated in the upper layer and only shear effect affected the pitch motion the bottom of the model was close to the pycnocline and affected by a smooth velocity and the top of the model was in the middle of the upper layer and affected by a strongly velocity the conditions of d 5 cm were contrasting to this as a result the form of pitch motion in these conditions were different from that of conditions of d 0 cm by comparing the corresponding results of the two different model shapes it was observed that the amplitude of the surge motion of the spherical model was 29 8 lower on an average than that of the cylindrical model furthermore the heave motion amplitude of the spherical model was 4 5 greater on an average than that of the cylindrical model 5 discussions to compare all the conditions tested in this experiment a dimensionless position parameter was defined as follows 25 p d h 1 ζ 0 d h by comparing three examples of each group of working conditions shown in figs 14 a and 14b we can intuitively determine a law for the action of isws on the motion of a submerged structure when the layer thickness ratio is 1 9 the variable is the amplitude of the isw and d does not change therefore the horizontal motion of the submerged structure is weak and does not exceed 0 1 m the vertical motion of the model increases with the isw amplitude the variations in amplitude mainly affect the vertical motion of the model however they have little effect on the horizontal motion when the submerged structure is located at the center of the pycnocline for layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 d is the only variable furthermore the surge motion response is significantly influenced by d thus the maximum displacement can reach 15 times that of the minimum displacement however the heave motion is not affected greatly by d in these cases moreover the amplitudes of the motion responses of the cylindrical model are higher than those of the spherical model in most cases for a surge motion in contrast they are lower in the case of a heave motion the response of pitch angle fig 14c shows a good relationship with the layer thickness ratio the higher the layer thickness ratio the smaller the amplitude of the pitch motion response this is because the shear effect in water with a high layer thickness ratio is lower than that in water with a small layer thickness ratio as shown in fig 15 the form of motion response of the submerged structure under an isw was explored from several aspects the experimental results clearly illustrated that ζ 0 β d and the shape of the submerged structure affect the motion response to varying degrees furthermore the first three factors mainly affect the velocity and direction of the motion response according to eq 15 the velocity of the upper layer is positively correlated with the amplitude and negatively correlated with the thickness ratio of the upper and lower layers while the opposite is true for the velocity of the lower layer therefore by comparing the average velocity at the position of the submerged structure to the amplitude of the surge motion under different working conditions the velocity determines the motion amplitude and the direction of the velocity significantly affects that of the surge motion fig 16 an empirical expression for the relationship between the nondimensional maximum displacement of the surge motion and nondimensional isw velocity is proposed 26 x 6 94 v 0 02 where x x d i s p h v u h g x d i s p is the maximum displacement of the surge motion and u is the maximum characteristic velocity at the position of the submerged structure 27 u u u p u u p u d o w n 2 u d o w n d 5 c m d 0 c m d 5 c m the horizontal velocity is the main factor that affect the displacement of the surge motion however the amplitude of isw plays an important role in the displacement of heave motion the relationship between dimensionless amplitude of the heave motion and the dimensionless amplitude of isw is presented in fig 17 and this relationship is expressed as follows 28 z 0 82 a 0 01 where z z d i s p h a ζ 0 h z d i s p is the maximum displacement of the heave motion from eqs 26 and 28 if the dimensionless characteristics of an isw were in the range of this study α ranges from 0 45 to 1 56 and β ranges from 0 11 to 0 43 the direction and distance of the surge and heave motion response of the submerged bodies can be approximated by using the theoretical calculation results of the characteristic velocity and amplitude of isw 6 conclusions in this study we experimentally studied the kinematic responses of a submerged structure under 2d isws the variations in the surge heave pitch and track of cg with the isw amplitudes relative distances between the model and pycnocline thickness ratio of the upper and lower layers and the shape of a submerged structure are studied the experimental results were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and a law of motion of a submerged structure under the action of isws is obtained in different conditions this can guide the construction and operational safety of submerged structures in the future the conclusions of this study are listed as follows 1 the amplitude of an isw is the main factor that affects the amplitude of a submerged structure s motion the higher the amplitude of the isw the higher is the motion amplitude of the submerged structure the influence of amplitude on the heave and pitch motions is more notable than that on the surge motion when the submerged structure is located in the pycnocline the amplitude of the heave motion is lower than the that of the isw 2 the position of the submerged structure in the stratified fluid affects the form of its motion when the submerged structure is located in the upper layer the direction of the surge motion depends on the direction of isw propagation and the surge motion distance is large when the submerged structure is located in the pycnocline the direction of the surge motion depends on both the velocities of the upper and lower layers and the shape of the submerged structure however the amplitude of the motion is low when the submerged structure is in the lower layer the direction of its surge motion is opposite to the direction of the isw propagation and the amplitude of motion is moderate changing the relative distance between the submerged structure and pycnocline had little effect on the heave motion when the structure is close to the pycnocline the pitch motion is opposite to that in the upper and lower layers when the submerged structure is in the pycnocline 3 the shape of the submerged structure also affects its motion response form the motion response amplitude of the spherical submerged structure is notably lower than that of the cylindrical submerged structure the surge motion of the spherical structure is 29 8 lower than that of the cylindrical submerged structure the difference in the heave motions between the two is small as the amplitude of the heave motion of the cylindrical submerged structure is 4 5 larger than that of the spherical submerged structure furthermore when the models are in the pycnocline the form of the track of the cg track of the cylindrical structure is similar to a v shape and that of the spherical structure is similar to an ellipse 4 the surge motion of the submerged structure mainly depends on the magnitude and direction of the flow velocity the relationship between the nondimensional maximum displacement of the surge motion and nondimensional velocity of isw can be concluded as x 6 94 v 0 02 the velocity calculated from the theories could be used to estimate the maximum displacement of the submerged structures the heave motion of the submerged structure mainly depends on the amplitude of isw the relationship between them is concluded as z 0 82 a 0 01 the displacement of heave motion could be estimated from amplitude of isw by using this formula the kinematic response of a submerged structure under the action of an isw is investigated in this study the strong flow in both the horizontal and vertical directions induced by the isw can greatly move

22203,in this study we investigate the kinematic responses of submerged bodies under the motion of internal solitary waves isws with laboratory experiment a two dimensional isw was generated in an isw tank of 15 0 4 0 6 m dimension with a water depth of 0 5 m the velocity field of the isw was measured by the particle image velocimetry and the kinematic responses were recorded using a charged coupled device camera different conditions such as isw amplitude ratio of the thickness of the upper layer to that of the lower layer and depth and shape of the submerged structure were considered the results show that the amplitude of isws significantly affects their heave motion and the relative distances between a model and pycnocline significantly influences the surge motion the amplitude of the heave motion of the model was lower than that of the isw under the corresponding conditions the model in fluid with a thin upper layer which easily causes strong nonlinearity undergoes a more violent motion response an empirical expression of the relationship between the maximum displacement of the surge motion and the velocity of the isws was also proposed keywords kinematic response submerged structure internal solitary wave particle image velocimetry 1 introduction internal solitary waves isws can be generated in stratified fluids with pycnocline when a very sharp density change occurs along an interface the smaller the difference in density the lower the wave frequency and the slower the propagation speed apel 1987 isws travel hundreds of meters along the pycnocline which causes unusually strong underwater currents that may create large loads that deep sea drilling rigs or platforms are subject to cai et al 2003 in addition the internal waves on the continental margins have significant influences on biology engineering military activities and large scale ocean circulations wang et al 2012 garrett 2003a garrett 2003b lamb 2014 mackinnon et al 2017 the exploration of natural resources on the continental shelf where isws occur frequently plays an important role in the development of ocean resources however numerous accidents have damaged floating structures for example the equipment on the liuhua offshore oil platform was damaged by isws during tanker operations and platform installation in the south china sea bole et al 1994 the discoverer 534 platform has provided the measurements of drillship responses to internal wave activities at depths ranging from 1900 to over 3400 ft and the maximum measured current velocity induced by an isw reached 2 6 knots osborne et al 1977 isws are important for various practical reasons they are ubiquitous in areas where strong tides and stratification occur near irregular topography a european remote sensing satellite ers 1 synthetic aperture radar image showed four continental shelf isw packets located northeast of the hudson canyon off new york apel 2000 such phenomena have occurred in the sulu sea in the philippines apel and holbrook 1983 apel et al 1985 liu et al 1985 hsu and liu 2000 in the strait between the luzon strait and taiwan hsu et al 2000 in arcs of the andaman and nicobar islands in the eastern indian ocean apel 1979 osborne and burch 1980 alpers et al 1997 in the semi enclosed east china sea in the western pacific jackson and apel 2004 and in the south china sea huang et al 2016 bai et al 2017 many studies on the effect of isws on marine structures have been conducted and this effect is one of the factors that must be considered when designing marine structures especially in areas where isws occur frequently the shear forces and torques exerted by isws on a supposed rigid pile was calculated in a study by si et al 2012 their results indicate that the shear force and torque of an isw on a rigid pile can reach up to 105 n and 109 nm respectively the motion response of a spar platform subjected to isws was theoretically investigated in a study by song et al 2011 the maximum force induced by an isw is smaller than that of surface waves however the surge motion induced by an isw of the spar platform is three times of that induced by the surface waves thus it should be considered furthermore the motion response of a top tensioned riser under excitation caused by isws surface waves and vessel motion was theoretically and numerically explored in research works by guo et al 2013 and fan et al 2017 the conclusions of their works highlighted that an isw will cause large displacement of drilling risers especially at the location where pycnocline is situated furthermore the forces that isws create on fixed structures i e cylindrical semisubmersible platform or slender bodied structures were experimentally theoretically and numerically studied in research works by chen et al 2017 2018 cai et al 2003 2006 and wei et al 2014 respectively these researches demonstrated that an isw has significant effect on fixed structures furthermore the force and torque induced by an isw vary with the layer thickness ratio and wave amplitude especially in a study of wei et al 2014 they mentioned that characteristics of the internal wave forces depend on the wave amplitude and the model position in depth previous studies on the interactions between isws and floating or submerged structures mainly concentrated on the forces isws created on fixed structures and very few studies have been conducted on the motion responses of structures under the action of isws du et al 2017 used a flexible rope to suspend a submarine model for motion response experiments and their results highlighted that the center of gravity cg tracks of the submarine under isws were irregular ellipticals and the responses of the submarine to heaves surges and pitches were significant however the motion response was affected by the restraints of the flexible rope in our experiments the motion response of free suspended models under the action of isw was investigated the particle image velocimetry piv technology raffel et al 2007 were used to detect the velocity filed by the isws and the motion response of models the experimental results were compared with the theoretical results in this study experiment setup is shown in section 2 in section 3 we compared the experimental results of the isw characteristics with the theoretical values furthermore in section 4 we described the motion response of the models in detail we also considered the effects of amplitude of an isw and the position of the model on motion response in section 5 we analyzed the dimensionless motion response results with the dimensionless isw characteristics finally the paper is summarized in section 6 2 facility and experimental procedure the experiment was conducted in the state key laboratory of physical oceanography ocean university of china the isw tank shown in fig 1 is approximately 15 m long has a cross section of 0 4 0 6 m and the total depth of the fluid is 0 5 m the fluid densities in the upper and lower layers are ρ 1 1030 kg m 3 and ρ 2 1051 kg m 3 respectively the thickness ratios β between the upper and lower layers were set as 1 9 2 8 and 3 7 under different conditions a global coordinate system was set up as shown in fig 1 the isw velocity and heave and surge motions were described in this coordinate system the positive direction of the pitch motion is anticlockwise isws were generated by the lock release method kao et al 1985 sutherland et al 2015 a lock release area with a length of x 0 40 cm was set with a watertight manually movable gate at the upstream end of the tank five height differences η 0 5 25 cm at 5 cm intervals were set to generate the isws with different amplitudes in a previous study it was observed that the amplitudes of isws are linearly correlated with their height differences as shown in fig 2 the results are from cui et al 2019 the shape of a submerged structure is an important factor that influences its motion response thus two different models composed of nylon spherical model with a diameter of d 8 8 cm and a cylindrical model with a diameter of d 8 0 cm and length of l 29 8 cm were tested both models were hollow in the middle to allow their specific gravities to be easily changed by changing their specific gravities the models can be suspended in the water at a specific depth fig 3 a shows images of the submerged models the centers of gravity were set along the middle of the models slightly lower than the center of the shape fig 3b shows the spherical model suspended in the upper layer the experimental area was located in the middle of the tank which ranged from 6 to 9 m the first half of this region is a velocity field tracing area and the piv method was followed to measure the velocity fields of the isw two lasers with a maximum power of 6000 mw and wavelength of 450 2 nm were set 1 5 m above the tank and a ccd camera with a resolution of 1348 2560 and sampling frequency of 40 hz was set in front of the tank to record the particle motion furthermore a polystyrene piv particle material with a surface area of 54 093 μm2 volume of 60 627 μm3 and density of 1 04 kg m3 was used in this experiment the piv images were analyzed with correlation analysis algorithm thielicke and stamhuis 2014 the interface displacement was determined by two different procedures grue et al 1999 by measuring the vertical coordinate where there is a jump in the velocity and by visual determination of the position of the pycnocline the motion response of the model in the two dimensional 2d isw tank was recorded as a 2d motion another ccd camera was set in front of the tank to record the motion responses of the models an led optical screen was placed behind the tank to increase the contrast ratio between the model and background the motion was recorded as a binary file and was post processed as a bitmap image gray level analysis was performed to distinguish the model in the water the cg and response of the model were traced by gray level analysis that provided the motion response results fig 4 furthermore the bottom of the cylindrical model was linear fitted the slope angle of the fitted line was considered as the pitch angle of the model the grayscale of every pixel was reset by gray level analysis pixels with grayscale less than 50 would be reset to 0 and pixels with the gray level more than 50 would be reset to 255 1 g r k x i k z j k 0 g k x i k z j k 50 255 g k x i k z j k 50 all the pixels with a grayscale of 0 x w i k z w i k are identified to form a set

with different layer thickness ratios isw amplitudes and model shapes were tested case 1 3 for the cylindrical model case 10 12 for the spherical model were mainly considered of the influence of different isw amplitudes on motion responses in the pycnocline case 4 6 and 7 9 for the cylindrical model cases 13 15 and 16 18 for the spherical model were focused on to discuss the different characteristics of motion response with different distances between the model and pycnocline with layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 3 isw characteristics 3 1 theoretical description of isws 3 1 1 theories of isws the kdv equation is used to describe the isws with a low amplitude in comparison to the total depth korteweg and de vries 1895 miles 1979 koop and butler 1981 kao et al 1985 the interface displacement was expressed by the analytical solution of the kdv equation 4 ζ x t ζ 0 sech 2 x c k d v t λ k d v where the phase speed c k d v and characteristic length of the isw λ k d v of

kakutani and yamasaki 1978 mitsuaki and masayuki 1986 which predicts the amplitude of an isw from 0 to h where h is the distance between the interface and critical level h c was proposed h h 2 h c an

where c could be any expression of the kdv m kdv and e kdv equations the average velocities in the upper and lower layers are as follows 15 u 1 x c ζ η 1 x 16 u 2 x c ζ η 2 x based on the theory of camassa et al 2006 which is widely used in the calculation of velocity of isw e g xie et al 2010 and chen et al 2017 the velocities in the upper and lower layers u 1 and u 2 can be calculated by the following equations 17 u 1 x z c 1 h 1 η 1 η 1 2 6 h 1 z 2 2 h 1 η 1 η 1 2 2 h 1 η 1 2 η 1 3 18 u 2 x z c 1 h 2 η 2 η 2 2 6 h 2 z 2 2 h 2 η 2 η 2 2 2 h 2 η 2 2 η 2 3 where x x c t η 1 η 1 x η 2 η 2 x

boundary value problem n is the mode number n is the brunt väisälä frequency ψ n x z t is the two dimensional stream function we have 21 ψ n z u ψ n x w in which u and w are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively 3 2 comparison of theoretical and experimental results the experimental results show that the ratios of maximum velocities of the upper and lower layers is similar to the ratios of their thickness as shown in table 2 the thickness ratios of each typical working condition the height differences of case 3 4 and 7 are 20 cm in table 1 are as follows 22 η 2 η 1 h 2 ζ 0 h 1 ζ 0 2 91 c a s e 3 1 83 c a s e 4 1 35 c a s e 7 the experimental results of the thickness ratios of the upper and lower layers are as follows 23 u 1 u 2 2 92 c a s e 3 1 79 c a s e 4 1 27 c a s e 7 the horizontal mass transport is conserved thus it can be derived as follows 24 u 1 u 2 η 2 η 1 where u 1 is the average horizontal velocity in the upper layer u 2 is the average horizontal velocity in the lower layer v u is the maximum upward vertical velocity and v d is the maximum downward vertical velocity the experimental and theoretical results are similar fig 5 shows the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity of an isw the velocity was observed at x 8 m in the tank the horizontal velocities of the isws in the upper and lower layers are opposite and their magnitudes differ there is a sudden change in velocity at the depth of the pycnocline a nonlinear coefficient α ζ 0 h 1 is proposed as a way to determine the degree of nonlinearity of an isw a larger value of α would indicate a stronger nonlinearity of isw the nonlinear coefficients shown in fig 5a 5b and 5c are 1 56 0 83 and 0 45 respectively in fig 5a the velocity of the lower layer calculated by the kdv theory failed and the bottom velocity changed from negative to positive as both m kdv and e kdv have third order nonlinear term the two theoretical models are more effective in the event of a strong nonlinearity in fig 5b the nonlinearity is lower and the three theoretical results are reasonable whereas the results of the kdv equation from the experimental results show large biases however the other two theoretical results agreed well with the experimental results in fig 5c the fitting effects of e kdv and m kdv are still in good consistency with the experimental results the nonlinearity coefficient of the working conditions is small and the fitting results of the kdv theory are much better than those of the first two working conditions generally in the situation of our experimental setup α ranges from 0 45 to 1 56 β ranges from 0 11 to 0 43 and m kdv best fits the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity at the laboratory scale and is suitable for various upper and lower layer thickness ratios along with strong nonlinearity the e kdv theory has not been invalidated by this experiment however the predicted results differ from the experimental results in the case of strong nonlinearity with low upper and lower layer thicknesses the kdv theory can only be applied in the event of a high thickness ratio and weak nonlinearity in these cases the vertical distribution of horizontal velocity calculated by eigenfunction is larger than the results of other theories however only the results of eigenfunction shows the continuous change of velocity in the pycnocline fig 6 shows a timeseries of the horizontal velocity in the upper and lower layers of an isw the observation points in the upper and lower layers are located at z 0 03 and 0 2 m respectively the horizontal velocities at the two observation points varied significantly with time the velocity of the upper layer first increased in the positive direction and then restored to a small magnitude with time while that of the lower layer was contrasting to this in fig 6a the e kdv and m kdv theories are in good agreement with the change trend in the velocity of the upper and lower layers in fig 6b the m kdv theory fits well with the timeseries of the velocities in the upper and lower layer among the theoretical results of e kdv and kdv the duration of the velocity change is significantly shorter than that in the experiment in fig 6c the results of the e kdv and m kdv theories are in good agreement with the experimental results however the fitting results of the kdv theory are still unsatisfied in these cases the e kdv theory is consistent with the experimental results for fitting the time series of the velocity of isws in the kdv theory and eigenfunction the duration of the velocity change is shorter than the experimental duration however in the m kdv theory the duration is longer considering both the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity and the fitting results of the horizontal velocity time series the e kdv theory agreed with the experimental results better the results from the theoretical calculation were essential for further research on motion response of submerged structures under the action of isws furthermore a depth time diagram of the velocity field of an isw can be obtained from the piv results as shown in fig 7 the velocity magnitude and the interface displacement are clearly shown in this figure 4 motion response of the submerged structure as mentioned above the motion responses of submerged structures under 2 d isws include heave surge and pitch responses in this section the experimental results are presented from two aspects i e the variations in the kinematic response of the model with the amplitude of isw and the variations with the relative distances between model and pycnocline the variations in the motion response of the submerged structure under the action of isws with these experimental variables are also further explored 4 1 influence of amplitude of isw oceanic isws are frequently observed to have vertical displacements ranging from tens to hundreds of meters in amplitude sutherland 2010 the larger the amplitude the higher the velocity induced by the isw normally isws with a larger amplitude pose a greater threat to submerged bodies wei et al 2014 in this section three different amplitudes of isw about 5 6 4 and 7 8 cm were set in conditions 1 3 and 10 12 to investigate the influence of different amplitudes on the motion response of the submerged bodies the model did not travel particularly far in the x direction in presence of isw as shown in fig 8 a the model was slightly positively displaced along the x axis under the three conditions the maximum displacement was almost 0 09 m fig 8b shows the heave motion results the model sank rose with interface displacement the heave motion response form is similar to the form of interface displacement the amplitude of the heave motion is directly related to that of the isw however it is 10 6 7 8 and 13 6 lower for conditions 1 3 respectively fig 8c shows the pitch motion of the model the pitch motion began increasing in the negative direction after 7 5 s and subsequently reached the maximum value further it increased in the positive direction and reached the maximum value after 15 s the pitch motion was also related to the amplitude of isw the pitch motion became more violent with higher isw amplitudes the maximum pitch angle was almost 2 1 the cg track of the model is shown in fig 8d and the form of the cg track of the submerged structure is a rightward v with a clockwise ellipse in the lower half of the v shape the range of the ellipse was positively correlated with the isw amplitude the results for the spherical model are shown in fig 9 the track of the model s cg was a clockwise irregular ellipse during the action of the isw the surge motion of the model changed slightly in both positive and negative directions along the x axis with a maximum displacement of less than 0 06 m the heave motion exhibited the same trend as that under conditions 1 3 and the maximum displacement was 7 5 cm in the negative direction along the z axis with an increase in the amplitude of the isw the motion amplitude of the submerged structure increased gradually which included the heave and pitch motions when the amplitude of the isw is too high the pitching angle of the model will oscillate because of the wave packet following the leading wave the amplitude of the heave motion of these six conditions were smaller than that of an isw in different magnitudes fig 8c 4 2 influence of relative distances between model and pycnocline the seasonal pycnocline was situated at depths approximately between 50 and 150 m the main pycnocline in the ocean which extended to depths of 1000 m was unaffected by the seasons sutherland 2010 a submerged structure may be influenced by the upper lower or pycnocline layer effects this section explores the forms of motion response of the submerged structure at different relative distances to pycnocline d see fig 1 with layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 and the pycnocline was taken as the reference plane the three distances were d 5 0 and 5 cm which represent that the model was situated 5 cm above at the center and below the pycnocline respectively the isw amplitude was approximately 8 and 6 cm at layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 respectively the accurate amplitudes are presented in table 2 the surge motions significantly differed among conditions 4 6 when the model was in the upper layer fig 10 a d 5 cm it moved in the positive direction along the x axis by 0 7 m the model at the center of the pycnocline d 0 cm also traveled in the positive direction along the x axis by 0 3 m however when the model was in the lower layer d 5 cm it traveled in the negative direction along the x axis by 0 15 m as shown in fig 10b the effect of d on the heave motion amplitude is negligible because d values of these cases are relatively small however according to the isw theory the amplitude of the heave motion should decrease with the increase in d in fig 10c the pitch angle increased negatively first and then significantly increased to positive when d 0 cm this was contrasting to the pitch motion results of the other two cases under the three conditions the pitch amplitude was greater when d 0 cm maximum positive angle was 1 3 and maximum negative angle was 1 1 in fig 10d the model moves forward in the x direction by maximum 0 7 m and in the z direction by maximum 0 07 m the amplitude of the motion response was high especially when d 5 cm it can be seen from fig 11 a the surge motion responses of the submerged structure are higher in the upper and lower layers than those at the center of pycnocline the amplitude of the surge motion in the upper layer was approximately 0 7 m in the positive direction along the x axis and that in the lower layer was approximately 0 35 m in the negative direction along the x axis under condition 8 d 0 cm the surge motion amplitude was 0 1 m fig 11b shows that the heave motion under conditions 7 9 follows the same trend i e it first increases in the negative direction of z axis and then decreases however the amplitudes of the heave motion are not similar the amplitude of heave motion of d 5 cm was maximum and that of d 5 cm as minimum in these three conditions the same trend is also observed in conditions 16 18 in fig 12 b fig 11c shows that the pitch motion response of the model at the center of the pycnocline is much higher than that of the other two conditions and it first increase in the negative direction and then increase in the positive direction the maximum pitch angles in the negative and positive directions were 0 8 and 1 2 respectively the cg tracks of the model shown in fig 11d are similar to those shown in fig 10d the variations in the motion response of the spherical model with different relative distances with pycnocline were also studied figs 12 and 13 the overall trend of the results was similar to those of the results of conditions 4 9 thereby indicating that d greatly influences the surge motion however it has slight influence on the heave motion in these cases moreover it is known that the amplitude of isw will decrease as the increasing of the distance to pycnocline in the real ocean vlasenko and hutter 2001 it can be inferred that d has an effect on the amplitude of the heave motion when it is relatively large and the amplitude of the heave motion will decrease with an increase in d when the submerged structure is suspended near a free surface or at the bottom the amplitude of the heave motion should be extremely small however these are not the most dangerous situations we want to investigate with a layer thickness ratio of 3 7 fig 13 the variations in surge heave and cg track at different depths were very close to those shown in fig 12 the amplitudes of the surge motion at d 5 0 and 5 cm were 0 38 0 07 and 0 27 m respectively and the amplitude of heave motion was 0 07 m shape is also a key factor that affects the motion response amplitude of the model in most cases the amplitudes of the surge motion of the spherical model were smaller than those of the cylindrical model however the heave motion response amplitude of these models did not exhibit a distinct difference comparing figs 10b and 12b and figs 11b and 13b the heave motion response trends of the cylindrical and spherical models with different values of d are similar the surge motion amplitudes of the spherical model shown in fig 12a are 0 35 0 08 and 0 20 m for d 5 0 and 5 cm respectively which are significantly smaller than the results shown in fig 10a the amplitude of the heave motion is approximately 0 078 m that is to say the shape has a great influence on the motion response of the model moreover the size of the model such as the radius and length of the cylinder model and the radius of the spherical model all have the potential to affect the motion response we will study and discuss it in future research under these conditions we experimentally studied the motion responses of submerged models with different relative distances with pycnocline and layer thickness ratios the results showed that when d varies the direction of the surge motion will also change when the submerged structure was located in the upper and lower layers the submerged structures were affected by the flow velocity in a fixed direction therefore the amplitude of the surge motion was higher when the submerged structure was located at the center of the pycnocline the surge motion amplitude was not very distinct however the pitch angle changed greatly because of the influence of the shear effect of the isw velocity field and the density difference of the upper and lower layers for d 0 cm the model was first affected by the density difference and the pitch angle increased in the negative direction when the isw propagated to the model the pitch angle increased in the positive direction because of the strong shear effect for d 5 cm the model was situated in the upper layer and only shear effect affected the pitch motion the bottom of the model was close to the pycnocline and affected by a smooth velocity and the top of the model was in the middle of the upper layer and affected by a strongly velocity the conditions of d 5 cm were contrasting to this as a result the form of pitch motion in these conditions were different from that of conditions of d 0 cm by comparing the corresponding results of the two different model shapes it was observed that the amplitude of the surge motion of the spherical model was 29 8 lower on an average than that of the cylindrical model furthermore the heave motion amplitude of the spherical model was 4 5 greater on an average than that of the cylindrical model 5 discussions to compare all the conditions tested in this experiment a dimensionless position parameter was defined as follows 25 p d h 1 ζ 0 d h by comparing three examples of each group of working conditions shown in figs 14 a and 14b we can intuitively determine a law for the action of isws on the motion of a submerged structure when the layer thickness ratio is 1 9 the variable is the amplitude of the isw and d does not change therefore the horizontal motion of the submerged structure is weak and does not exceed 0 1 m the vertical motion of the model increases with the isw amplitude the variations in amplitude mainly affect the vertical motion of the model however they have little effect on the horizontal motion when the submerged structure is located at the center of the pycnocline for layer thickness ratios of 2 8 and 3 7 d is the only variable furthermore the surge motion response is significantly influenced by d thus the maximum displacement can reach 15 times that of the minimum displacement however the heave motion is not affected greatly by d in these cases moreover the amplitudes of the motion responses of the cylindrical model are higher than those of the spherical model in most cases for a surge motion in contrast they are lower in the case of a heave motion the response of pitch angle fig 14c shows a good relationship with the layer thickness ratio the higher the layer thickness ratio the smaller the amplitude of the pitch motion response this is because the shear effect in water with a high layer thickness ratio is lower than that in water with a small layer thickness ratio as shown in fig 15 the form of motion response of the submerged structure under an isw was explored from several aspects the experimental results clearly illustrated that ζ 0 β d and the shape of the submerged structure affect the motion response to varying degrees furthermore the first three factors mainly affect the velocity and direction of the motion response according to eq 15 the velocity of the upper layer is positively correlated with the amplitude and negatively correlated with the thickness ratio of the upper and lower layers while the opposite is true for the velocity of the lower layer therefore by comparing the average velocity at the position of the submerged structure to the amplitude of the surge motion under different working conditions the velocity determines the motion amplitude and the direction of the velocity significantly affects that of the surge motion fig 16 an empirical expression for the relationship between the nondimensional maximum displacement of the surge motion and nondimensional isw velocity is proposed 26 x 6 94 v 0 02 where x x d i s p h v u h g x d i s p is the maximum displacement of the surge motion and u is the maximum characteristic velocity at the position of the submerged structure 27 u u u p u u p u d o w n 2 u d o w n d 5 c m d 0 c m d 5 c m the horizontal velocity is the main factor that affect the displacement of the surge motion however the amplitude of isw plays an important role in the displacement of heave motion the relationship between dimensionless amplitude of the heave motion and the dimensionless amplitude of isw is presented in fig 17 and this relationship is expressed as follows 28 z 0 82 a 0 01 where z z d i s p h a ζ 0 h z d i s p is the maximum displacement of the heave motion from eqs 26 and 28 if the dimensionless characteristics of an isw were in the range of this study α ranges from 0 45 to 1 56 and β ranges from 0 11 to 0 43 the direction and distance of the surge and heave motion response of the submerged bodies can be approximated by using the theoretical calculation results of the characteristic velocity and amplitude of isw 6 conclusions in this study we experimentally studied the kinematic responses of a submerged structure under 2d isws the variations in the surge heave pitch and track of cg with the isw amplitudes relative distances between the model and pycnocline thickness ratio of the upper and lower layers and the shape of a submerged structure are studied the experimental results were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and a law of motion of a submerged structure under the action of isws is obtained in different conditions this can guide the construction and operational safety of submerged structures in the future the conclusions of this study are listed as follows 1 the amplitude of an isw is the main factor that affects the amplitude of a submerged structure s motion the higher the amplitude of the isw the higher is the motion amplitude of the submerged structure the influence of amplitude on the heave and pitch motions is more notable than that on the surge motion when the submerged structure is located in the pycnocline the amplitude of the heave motion is lower than the that of the isw 2 the position of the submerged structure in the stratified fluid affects the form of its motion when the submerged structure is located in the upper layer the direction of the surge motion depends on the direction of isw propagation and the surge motion distance is large when the submerged structure is located in the pycnocline the direction of the surge motion depends on both the velocities of the upper and lower layers and the shape of the submerged structure however the amplitude of the motion is low when the submerged structure is in the lower layer the direction of its surge motion is opposite to the direction of the isw propagation and the amplitude of motion is moderate changing the relative distance between the submerged structure and pycnocline had little effect on the heave motion when the structure is close to the pycnocline the pitch motion is opposite to that in the upper and lower layers when the submerged structure is in the pycnocline 3 the shape of the submerged structure also affects its motion response form the motion response amplitude of the spherical submerged structure is notably lower than that of the cylindrical submerged structure the surge motion of the spherical structure is 29 8 lower than that of the cylindrical submerged structure the difference in the heave motions between the two is small as the amplitude of the heave motion of the cylindrical submerged structure is 4 5 larger than that of the spherical submerged structure furthermore when the models are in the pycnocline the form of the track of the cg track of the cylindrical structure is similar to a v shape and that of the spherical structure is similar to an ellipse 4 the surge motion of the submerged structure mainly depends on the magnitude and direction of the flow velocity the relationship between the nondimensional maximum displacement of the surge motion and nondimensional velocity of isw can be concluded as x 6 94 v 0 02 the velocity calculated from the theories could be used to estimate the maximum displacement of the submerged structures the heave motion of the submerged structure mainly depends on the amplitude of isw the relationship between them is concluded as z 0 82 a 0 01 the displacement of heave motion could be estimated from amplitude of isw by using this formula the kinematic response of a submerged structure under the action of an isw is investigated in this study the strong flow in both the horizontal and vertical directions induced by the isw can greatly move

22204,a time domain higher order boundary element method hobem with fully non linear boundary conditions is established to investigate the slamming problem on a rotating flap in free motion the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel boundary conditions with numerical damping layers are adopted to track the time dependent free surface nodes through which the influences of coupled disturbed waves from the outer boundaries are eliminated the potential of each element within the thin long jet is calculated in the rotating coordinate system to overcome numerical instability induced by the local highly oscillatory pressure the domain decomposition method and the unequal distribution scheme of meshes are simultaneously adopted to capture the falling jet with strong non linearity the auxiliary function method is then employed to calculate the pressure distribution through which the mutual dependence between the body motion and the fluid flow is decoupled the present numerical model is verified through comparing the flap motion response dynamic characteristics and free surface elevations against the published experimental data and the computational fluid dynamics cfd results the parameter studies are performed to investigate the influences of flap properties and wave parameters detailed results are provided through free surface profile rotation angle angular velocity torque response and pressure distribution keywords slamming hobem fully nonlinear oscillating wave surge converter splash jet 1 introduction wave slamming on a rigid body has been studied extensively due to the plentiful applications in ships and naval architectures the present paper emphasizes on the problem of wave slamming on a buoyant flap which usually happens to the oscillating wave surge converters owscs the flap is excited by waves and rotates back and forth driving the hydraulic cylinders pumping high pressure water to the electric generator on the bank see fig 1 however when the device operates in a rough sea state the flap will hit water surface with high speed resulting in a short duration but high magnitude pressure on the body surface this slamming event is considered as a threat to the device safety because the cross sections of the flap are mainly the same as a rectangle attached to a half circle and the two dimensional 2d model is highly relevant to many other general cases the flap is simplified to be 2d in the present study the problems of wave impact slamming on a rigid body can be mainly divided into two categories the studies in the first category investigate that waves hit a fixed body the problems in this category mainly happen to a sea wall or a fixed offshore platform it has been found that the front shape of the waves has great influences on the local impact pressure wei et al 2016 however the slamming on the rotating flap should be divided into the second category since the flap is not fixed in waves in this category it has been found that it is the body hits waves rather than waves hit the body henry et al 2014 the studies in this category can be further separated into two subcategories according to the motion mode of the body in the first subcategory the body moves in a prescribed motion several works have been performed to simulate the slamming on a force motion flap sun et al 2015 simulated the forced motion flap plunging into calm water and waves with without gravity effect using the first order boundary element method fobem the authors former work cheng et al 2018a further investigated the current effects on the pressure distribution of the forced motion flap through the higher order boundary element method hobem in the studies of second subcategory the emphasis is focused on the body s free motion to further simulate the slamming in a much realistic circumstance according to the work of wu et al 2004 the pressure on the body surface plays a much more important role in this subcategory when the body is in a prescribed motion the pressure is only used to analyze the loading on the body and in the free motion situation the pressure is an important factor affected the body motion when the flap rotates freely in waves the angular acceleration of the flap is not a free parameter but a part of solution of the flow field the signal of rotational moment is variable to keep the flap rotating continuously in the meantime the flow field is also disturbed by this unknown flap motion the numerical methods also face more challenges when the fully non linear boundary conditions are taken into considered firstly the re reflected waves from the input boundary are coupled with the incident wave zhou et al 2015 thus proper numerical damping layers at both ends of the computational domain are necessary to avoid the body motion being affected by the reflections from the output boundary and the re reflections from the input boundary secondly once the slamming occurs splash jet flow will firstly develop on the body surface and then fall into the main flow while in the fully coupling problems the pressure of the jet flow is demanded to be much smoother and more stable so that the angular acceleration of the flap is not influenced by numerical errors all the existing researches concerning the slamming on a free motion flap were based on navier stokes equations using the viscous flow model such as henry et al 2014 wei et al 2014 wei et al 2016 ferrer et al 2016 this method requires relatively higher computer resources to conduct plenty of parameters studies on the other hand because i the period of slamming impact is too short for the viscous effect to develop batchelor 1967 ii the viscous effect has been proven to be insignificant for the buoyant flap wei et al 2015 and iii the flap motion is much slower than the speed of the sound in water the incompressible potential flow model provides another interesting way to study on the slamming problem the boundary element method bem is a high efficiency method because only the boundary is discretized moreover relative to the fobem the hobem with higher order shape functions can model the free surface with strong nonlinearity much precisely and possess higher accuracy and efficiency however the bem has not been used to simulate the slamming on a free motion flap as mentioned above the main difficulties are that firstly the flow is no longer self similar due to the flap s rotation and secondly several methods should be taken to simulate the detachment of the jet flow these problems become more difficult because of the numerical instability the wave slamming on a flap is similar to the wave entry of a wedge while the rotation is taken into account as an extension of our previous studies regarding wave entry of a wedge cheng et al 2018b 2018c and wave slamming on a flap in prescribed motion cheng et al 2018a the primary aim of the present work is to push the application of the fully nonlinear hobem to simulate this particular slamming event and further elucidate the mechanism of wave slamming on the owsc to this end the description of the numerical model based on hobem with fully non linear boundary conditions is firstly developed in section 2 the corresponding mathematical formulations and numerical methods which are necessary to overcome the related problems are given and explained in relative detail in section 3 to ensure the results are much less affected by the numerical errors the convergent tests focused on time step and mesh scheme are firstly performed after that the comparisons against published experiment and cfd results are undertaken to verify the accuracy of the results obtained through present method on this basic extensive case studies are provided to explain the influences of flap properties and wave parameters to the slamming event in section 4 and finally several conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model 2 1 boundary conditions the schematic diagram of wave interaction with a rotating flap is shown in fig 2 the 2d flap is designed to be a rectangle attached a half circle on the bottom and rotate about the hinged point to deal with the mathematical problem a cartesian coordinate system o xz is defined with the origin at the hinged point in which x axis is along the direction of the incident wave propagation and z axis points upwards as shown in fig 2 γ is rotating angle from z axis to the centerline of the flap and γ 0 represents the flap rotates anticlockwise unless it is specified angular velocity ω is derivative of γ with respect to time t h denotes the static water depth d is vertical distance from the origin to the mean water surface and b is half thickness of the flap the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid with irrotational flow so that a velocity potential ϕ x z t which satisfies the laplace equation can be used to describe the fluid motion 1 2 ϕ 0 the dynamic condition and the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface s f in eulerian form should be written as 2 ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 3 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x where η z d is the free surface elevation above the mean water line in this paper a mixed eulerian lagrangian method mel is adopted to track the time dependent free surface node in the finite computational domain the reflections at the output boundary and the re reflections at the input boundary will affect the flap motion thus two damping layers are defined in boundary conditions to absorb the disturbed waves and not to affect the incident waves 4 d ϕ d t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 v x ϕ ϕ i 5 d x d t ϕ x v x x x 0 6 d z d t ϕ z v x z z 0 where d dt t ϕ is material derivative v x is the damping term which can be found in the work ofcheng et al 2017 x 0 z 0 are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the fluid particle at t 0 ϕ i and η i are the analytic solutions of incident wave which are obtained using the fifth order stokes wave theory 7 ϕ i ω k 2 j 1 5 i 1 5 μ i c i j cosh j k z h sin j k x ω t θ 0 8 η i 1 k j 1 5 i 1 5 μ i d i j cos j k x ω t θ 0 where ω k and θ 0 are wave circular frequency wave number and initial phase respectively the detailed expressions of coefficients μ i c ij and d ij can be found in sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 based on the impermeable condition the boundary condition on the wetted surface s b should be written as 9 ϕ n ω r n where r x z n n x n z is the normal of the body surface pointing out of the fluid domain the bottom s d is impermeable in the present model incident wave is generated through the following method the wave surface at initial time is given by z t 0 d η i and ϕ t 0 ϕ i and the incident wave conditions are always satisfied on the inlet boundary 10 ϕ ϕ i and η η i 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem the above boundary value problem can be transformed into an integral equation through green s second identify 11 α p s ϕ p s γ ln r 1 ln r 2 2 π ϕ q f n ϕ q f 2 π ln r 1 ln r 2 n d γ where α is the solid angle coefficient p s x 0 z 0 and q f x z are source point and field point respectively γ is the whole computational boundary r 1 denotes the distance between the field and source point r 2 is the distance between the field and the mirror image of the source field about sea bottom using quadratic shape functions the whole boundary surface γ is discretized with three node line elements within these isoparametric boundary elements physical variables are also interpolated by the same shape functions the numerical integration is performed using gauss legendre quadrature with 4 integration points within each element and then eq 11 can be discretized as 12 χ p ϕ p i 1 n e j 1 4 k 1 3 1 2 π h j k ϕ k ln r 1 ln r 2 j n j j w j i 1 n e j 1 4 k 1 3 h j k ln r 1 ln r 2 j 2 π ϕ k n j j w j where h represents the shape function j j is the jacobian matrix relating the physical coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates within an element n e is the total number of the discretized elements w j is the gauss coefficient 3 node number of each element and 4 gauss integration point number during the calculation once p s and q f belong to same element the distance between p s and q f gets closed to 0 and the green function lnr 1 lnr 2 2π and its derivates have singularities to eliminate the influences of singular integrals a polar coordinate transformation is employed in the calculation li et al 1985 finally the discretized integral can be transformed in the matrix form 13 a ϕ b ϕ n where a and b are influence matrixes which obtained from the integrations of lnr 1 lnr 2 n and lnr 1 lnr 2 respectively eq 13 can be solved through moving the unknowns to the left hand side namely ϕ n on the free surface and ϕ on the body surface while keeping others on the right hand side to avoid the numerical instability caused by the discontinuity of normal direction at the intersection point between the free surface and the body surface a rotating coordinate system o ξζ is employed with ζ along the centerline of the flap the definition can be written as sun et al 2015 14 ξ x cos γ z sin γ ζ x sin γ z cos γ thus the intersection point satisfies the boundary conditions 15 δ ϕ δ t ζ t ϕ ζ ω ξ ϕ ζ ζ ϕ ξ 1 2 ϕ ξ 2 ϕ ζ 2 g ξ sin γ ζ cos γ d 16 ζ t φ ξ ξ ω φ ξ ζ ω ζ ξ where both δϕ δt and ζ t represents the derivates with respect to t at a given ξ through eqs 15 and 16 the water particle at the intersection point can be updated in the ζ direction for a fixed ξ once the slamming occurs the splash jet flow will firstly develop on the body surface and errors will be brought in the calculation due to the ill conditioned matrix there are mainly two methods to deal with it numerically firstly the very thin part of jet is cut because its pressure closes to the atmospheric pressure e g zhao and faltinsen 1993 lu et al 2000 through which the ill conditioned matrix can be avoided while the oscillations of pressure near the intersection point will occur inevitably since the pressure is a key factor in the fully coupling problem the pressure on the body surface should be stable enough to motivate the flap during the calculation in this paper we adopt the method proposed by wu 2007 to obtain the unknown ϕ n on the jet surface and ϕ on the body surface in the jet flow area the potential of element z k z k 1 in the jet flow area is assumed to vary linearly 17 ϕ a b ξ c ζ since the direction of ξ is perpendicular to the body surface the normal velocity of fluid in jet area can be written as 18 ϕ n b ω r n thus the potential of nodes z k and z k 1 should be written as 19 ϕ k a ξ k ω r n c ζ k and ϕ k 1 a ξ k 1 ω r n c ζ k 1 and according to eq 19 coefficient c can be written as 20 c ϕ k 1 ϕ k ξ k 1 ξ k ω r n ζ k 1 ζ k the variation of ζ in the element can be represented as 21 ζ ζ k ζ k 1 ζ k ξ k 1 ξ k ξ ξ k then the unknown ϕ n on the jet surface can be obtained through 22 ϕ n b ζ k 1 ζ k ξ k 1 ξ k 2 ζ k 1 ζ k 2 c ξ k 1 ξ k ξ k 1 ξ k 2 ζ k 1 ζ k 2 with regard to the unknown ϕ on the body surface in the jet area a perpendicular line which starts from the node on the body surface and intersects the free surface is firstly set combined with the body surface condition the unknown ϕ on the body surface in the jet area can be obtained from 23 ϕ ϕ s f ξ s f b ω r n where subscripts s f represent the free surface and ϕ sf has been known from the free surface conditions with the flap rotating the thin long jet will finally fall into the main flow and a liquid liquid impact will occur since the impact of falling jet to the main flow is small transitory and localized the disturbance caused by the impact is neglected and the jet is allowed to re entries into the main flow however based on this precondition an overlapping domain will occur and eq 13 will no longer be directly solved thus to simulate this process numerically the computational domain is divided into two sub domains of the main flow and the falling jet see fig 3 and a smooth pressure distribution can also be obtained accordingly a particular variable is set in the procedure to track whether the irregular elements of the falling jet appear once the irregular elements appear eq 13 is re written as 24 a r r a r s a s r a s s ϕ r ϕ s b r r b r s b s r b s s ϕ r n ϕ s n where r and s represent the boundaries in fig 3 respectively at the interface s the pressure and the normal velocity are assumed to be continuous 25 ϕ s 1 ϕ s 2 ϕ s 1 n ϕ s 2 n where 1 and 2 represent the subdomains in fig 3 through eqs 24 and 25 eq 13 can be re written as 26 a r 1 r 1 a r 1 s 1 a s 1 r 1 a s 1 s 1 a s 2 s 2 a s 2 r 2 a r 2 s 2 a r 2 r 2 ϕ r 1 ϕ s 1 ϕ r 2 b r 1 r 1 b r 1 s 1 b s 1 r 1 b s 1 s 1 b s 2 s 2 b s 2 r 2 b r 2 s 2 b r 2 r 2 ϕ r 1 n ϕ s 1 n ϕ r 2 n similarly the unknowns in eq 26 can be obtained through moving them to the left hand side and keeping the specified terms on the right hand side 2 3 motion equation when the flap is motivated by wave the mutual dependence of fluid and body should be decoupled in this paper the coupling problem is solved through the motion equation with the auxiliary function method wu and taylor 2003 the motion equation of the flap can be written as 27 m s b p x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ where m represents moment p is the pressure distribution on the body surface m is the mass of the flap z c is the vertical position of mass center besides m can be represented through coefficients of power take off pto e g hydraulic cylinders in fig 1 28 m i a pto ω b pto ω c pto γ where i is the rotational inertia of the flap ω ω t is the angular acceleration a pto b pto and c pto are the inertia damping and elasticity coefficients of the pto respectively in the present work a pto b pto and c pto are set as 0 to simulate the strongest slamming event the pressure distribution p in eq 27 can be obtained through the bernoulli equation 29 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g η it should be pointed out that ϕ t in eq 29 is not explicitly known although ϕ is obtained through hobem thus the auxiliary function is employed and should be set as 30 ϕ t χ 1 ω r ϕ ω χ 2 where χ 1 and χ 2 are auxiliary functions which both satisfy the laplace equation based on the work of wu 1998 the auxiliary functions should satisfy the boundary conditions on s b 31 χ 1 n 0 and χ 2 n x n z z n x based on the dynamic condition the auxiliary functions satisfy the boundary conditions on s f 32 χ 1 1 2 ϕ 2 g η ω r ϕ and χ 2 0 based on the impermeable condition the auxiliary functions satisfy the boundary conditions on s d 33 χ 1 n ω x 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x and χ 2 n 0 at far field s o the potential is identical to incident potential thus the auxiliary functions satisfy 34 χ 1 n 2 ϕ i t n ω n r ϕ i and χ 2 n 0 the above boundary value problem i e eqs 31 34 can be solved through hobem described in section 2 2 since the pressure on body surface has been obtained numerically the only remained problem is the coupling fluid structure problem to decouple the mutual dependence between ω and m eqs 28 30 are substituted into eq 27 and the unknowns are moved to right hand side 35 s b χ 1 ω r ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g η x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ i s b χ 2 x n z z n x d s ω where a pto b pto and c pto have been neglected consequently ω can be calculated through eq 35 and then γ and ω can be obtained accordingly then the time step can be marched through eqs 4 6 with the 4th order runge kutta method 3 model validation 3 1 convergent tests using the hobem model a calculation procedure is developed based on fortran language the flap in the work of henry et al 2014 is selected for the convergence tests in this paper the distance between the origin to the mean water surface d the acceleration due to the gravity g and the water density ρ are used for non dimensionalisation therefore time t angular velocity ω pressure p and mass m are respectively measured through d g 1 2 g d 1 2 ρgd and ρd 3 all the results are non dimensional in following sections unless it is specified after non dimensionalisation the wave conditions are listed as follow wave height h 0 49 wave period t 13 14 wave length l 16 10 initial phase θ 0 0 water depth h 1 49 the corresponding computational domain is taken as 160 h of which 40 is used as damping layers at the two ends of the computational domain a unique distribution scheme of meshes is employed in this paper to track the time dependent nodes on the free surface and the body surface the smallest size of element l m is set on both jet root and flap surface and the size of the element increases gradually away at a given ratio λ 1 02 the biggest element size is not allowed to be larger than 0 5 firstly three different mesh schemes a fine mesh an intermediate mesh and a coarse mesh are selected i e the minimal element length l m 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 respectively it should be explained that the pressure distribution on body surface is given based on s which is the distance measured along the body surface with the origin at the intersection of the centerline with the surface of the flap the negative sign of s denotes the left side of the flap surface fig 4 shows that in the case of l m 0 05 there is a difference in comparison with other results in fact a large l m is hard to track the irregular jet with strong non linearity and more importantly l m is also related to the time step dt l m μv max the present model is strongly affected by the mesh scheme and the time step we found that l m 0 05 will cause significant numerical errors and instability after considering the accuracy and efficiency of calculation l m is set as 0 03 the calculations in the present work were performed on a normal personal computer with 8 cores and 8 gb of ram the results of l m 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 in fig 4 took 9 5 h 4 5 h and 2 2 h respectively secondly convergent tests for time steps with l m 0 03 are then performed time step size is set as dt l m μv max where v max is the maximum of velocity magnitude on the free surface at each time step and μ is a coefficient which is set as 10 20 and 30 respectively once jet departs from the body difference appears in the case of μ 30 see fig 5 therefore μ 20 is dependable enough in the convergent test in the following simulations l m 0 03 μ 20 λ 1 02 and dt l m μv max are adopted to ensure the results are much less affected by the numerical errors 3 2 comparison with published results the validity of the present model is established by comparing our results against the 2d experiment and the cfd simulations in henry et al 2014 the cfd results in the work of wei et al 2016 are also provided to verify the present method the wave parameters and flap properties in the work of wei et al 2016 are consistent with those in the experiment in order to keep consistent with the parameters in the published works in this section i the parameters and results are dimensional ii ω is negative in the anti clockwise direction temporarily iii apart from the last slamming event depicted in fig 6 the overlapping domain between the main flow and the falling jet in other events has been eliminated the dimensional flap properties and wave parameters are the thickness is 0 0875m m 4 27 kg z c 0 132m i 0 1147 kgm2 and height of the flap is 0 310m wave height h 0 1m wave period t 1 9s and wave length is l 3 10m initial phase θ 0 is assumed to be π 2 the dimensional size of symmetrical computational domain is 2 12 2m h of which 12 2m is the distance from the wave maker to the flap in the experiment h 0 305m is the water depth two wave gauges r2 and r5 are set the locations of which are 5 18m and 6 08m from the inlet boundary respectively the slamming event should be more related to the variation of free surface because the slamming pressure occurs at the intersection between the body and free surface according to the researches considering the wave propagating over a submerged sill e g beji and battjes 1993 an uneven bottom will increase the free surface nonlinearity in the present case the lowest part of the flap is 0 056m higher than the flume bottom and thus the height of flap basis is about one sixth of the water depth h 0 305m the length of flap basis in x direction approximately equals to the flap thickness 0 0875m which is only one fortieth of the wave length l 3 10m the reflection diffraction and shoaling caused by the submerged obstacle with this scale are very limited on the other hand the computational domain is 24 4m in x direction and a huge number of much smaller elements will be used on the fluid bottom to precisely define the basis with such small scale in comparison with the very limited influence this much lower computational efficiency is believed to be unnecessary the amount of total meshes are nearly twice larger than that in flat bottom case therefore the basis is neglected in the present validation the free surface profiles in fig 6 have illustrated the main process of the slamming event the flap firstly rotates landwards due to the motivation of wave crest and reaches the maximum landward angle i e fig 6 a then the flap rotates seawards as the wave crest moves past i e fig 6 b when the flap reaches the vertical position with a large angular velocity the water line at left side of the flap drops to the lowest level i e fig 6 c after that the flap continues to rotate seawards and hits the wave surface with a relatively large angular velocity resulting in the slamming event as a result the local water is extruded by the flap moves upside along the body surface and then falls into the main flow i e fig 6 d finally the flap closes to the maximum seaward position before the arrival of next wave crest i e fig 6 e it can be seen from fig 7 that the magnitudes of γ and ω are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data and the cfd results which indicates that the motion characteristics of the flap are well reproduced by the hobem model since γ 0 represents the flap rotating anti clockwise in this section the flap rotates seawards with a much larger velocity according to the results in fig 7 b this should be related to the fact that the nonlinear wave trough is much wider than crest when the flap rotates seawards in wave trough the flap can be much affected by the fluid particle in the same direction on the other hand the nonlinear wave steepness is larger which further decreases the deadrise angle cheng et al 2018a between wave surface and flap when the flap hits wave crests apart from the nonlinear wave amplitude is much larger this can be another possible reason for that slamming on an owsc only occurs in nonlinear wave condition to further verify the dynamic characteristics the torque m and pressure p at s 0 28m which is the location of the pressure sensor p in the reference studies versus time t are given in fig 8 it can be seen the peaks of pressure p and torque m appears at nearly the same time this is because the occurrence of slamming pressure results in a large opposing local moment which further decreases the velocity of rotating seawards at the same time thus the absolute values of angular velocity in fig 7 b start to decrease after the flap suffers the slamming it also can be known from the results that the peak values of p and m keep varying indicating the slamming procedure is greatly affected by disturbance free surface with strong nonlinearity the results of p in henry et al 2014 and m in wei et al 2016 are selected and shown in fig 8 because of the relatively good integrity and clarity while the comparisons against other results will also be illustrated the variation tendencies of m and p agree well with the published results while the peak values are different the present hobem model obtains the slamming peak pressure varying from 0 6 kpa to 0 8 kpa while the cfd result in henry et al 2014 was 0 1 kpa 0 3 kpa see fig 8 a in the work of wei et al 2014 the corresponding result was 0 3 kpa 0 4 kpa using much smaller time step and mesh size wei et al 2016 further obtained the result varying from 0 4 kpa to 1 8 kpa these differences should be related to two main reasons firstly henry et al 2014 claimed that the cfd results of slamming could be underestimated by coarse grid refinement and time resolution this explains that the obtained slamming peak pressure is higher than those in earlier cfd models another reason is that in comparison with wei et al 2016 the velocity of fluid flow might be underestimated by the potential flow hobem model this can be indicated from the generated splash jet which falls much directly into the main flow see fig 6 e than that in the experiment and cfd simulation see fig 10 in wei et al 2016 therefore the relative velocity between fluid particle and the flap is lower resulting in a smaller peak pressure the numerical results of slamming peak pressure obtained by various cfd models and present hobem are generally in the same order of magnitude however much larger differences can be found when those results are compared against to the experimental data of 4 kpa 11 kpa wei et al 2016 pointed out that the slamming experiment might be influenced by various factors such as hydro elasticity and free surface instabilities while a recent study renzi et al 2018 believed that the pressure impulse should be a proper criterion when the numerical slamming pressure is compared against the experimental data since the peak of torque response is directly related to the slamming pressure the obtained result in fig 8 b is slightly under estimated because the present peak pressure is lower than the median in wei et al 2016 fig 9 shows the free surface elevations at two wave gauges the disturbance obtained by the hobem at r2 is less obvious and wave surface is more like the wave only result this is because r2 is much closer to the inlet boundary in contrast with r5 the wave generation method applied in the present paper is based on the analytic solutions at inlet boundary which is different from the flap type wave maker adopted in the experiment and cfd models thus the boundary re reflections within the present model are also different due to the boundary conditions while according to the works of wei et al 2016 the effects of re reflected waves are not significant until t 25s in the present incident conditions thus the small differences against the cfd results should be related to the neglect of viscosity effect and the slightly lower dynamic characteristics in comparison with the experiment both numerical methods underestimate the wave elevation this should also be related to that much lower slamming response has much less influences on wave surface in summary the present hobem model can be proved to be valid through the good agreement with the cfd results including motion characteristics and dynamic characteristics regarding the comparison against the experiment validation will be performed based on the work of renzi et al 2018 in a future work 4 parameter studies in this section several parameter studies are performed to study on the mechanism of the slamming problem the first slamming event is selected in each case so that the influence of re reflections can be avoided thus the domain decomposition method is employed to simulate the detached jet flow the parameters in section 4 are all nondimensional 4 1 flap properties the flap density ρ flap is studied in the first place as it is a basic physical quantity of the flap after non dimensionalisation the half thickness of the flap b is set as 0 21 water depth is 1 49 wave height h is 0 45 wave period t is 13 19 and wave length l is 16 00 to show the variation of slamming affected by ρ flap as complete as possible six sets of input values and the extreme values of slamming pressure appearing in the first place are given in table 1 the time histories of flap motion and slamming pressure at s 1 36 are given in fig 10 the numerical results of one complete slamming event from maximum landward angle to maximum seaward angle are depicted from fig 11 to fig 13 since the wave conditions are identical the peak value of ω and the rotational amplitude are decreased by the rise in i the horizontal pressure differences between both sides of the flap in figs 11 and 14 are less obvious this is because both ω and ω equal to 0 in these angles and the pressure is mainly static pressure and is only affected by submergence depth moreover despite ρ flap being different the maximum landward angles in three cases bear similarity to each other this may indicate that in the slamming process the flap properties have obvious effect on maximum seaward angle rather than maximum landward angle fig 12 a shows that height difference of free surface between both sides of the flap are the most obvious when the flap reaches the vertical position this leads to a distinct pressure difference further resulting in ω reaches its maximum when γ 0 as the flap is driven by exciting torque dias et al 2017 moreover this difference is further enlarged in the case of ρ flap 0 10 due to the maximum i it also can be seen that the variation of wave elevation over time at left side of flap is affected by ρ flap a coupling relationship between ω and the height variation can be indicated that on the one hand an obvious height difference leads to a higher pressure difference resulting in distinct rise in ω and ω on the other hand there re more disturbances of the wave surface when the flap rotates with a larger ω and the height difference becomes much obvious consequently therefore the flap in the case of ρ flap 0 10 rotates with the largest ω and vice versa for ρ flap 0 30 it can be seen from fig 10 b when the flap re enters the water ω is increasing during the rotation the slamming occurs after ω reaches its positive peak after that because the flap suffers a high magnitude reactive force ω and m reach their negative peaks rapidly the sharp variation of pressure and torque prove the present pressure distribution is an impact load instead of a slowly changing dynamic load furthermore the results also indicate that the greater slamming pressure is the sharper and the rapider torque will be the slamming peak pressure reaches its maximum in the case of ρ flap 0 10 and decreases rapidly with increasing ρ flap this is because the flap with ρ flap 0 10 is easily motivated due to the smallest i resulting in rotating with the largest ω fig 13 b also shows that the pressure on the bottom is larger in the cases of larger ρ flap which should be attributed to the higher wave surface in the case of ρ flap 0 10 to further testify whether other flap properties exert significant influences on slamming the influence of vertical distance of mass center z c is altered through changing the flap height while mass m is constant as a result ρ flap can be fixed as 0 15 and z c varies from 1 024 to 1 805 similarly because the rotational inertia of flap with z c 0 470 is the smallest the flap in such case is subject to the most distinct slamming pressure see table 2 and fig 17 b it can be seen from fig 16 that the maximum seaward angles are different while the maximum landward angles are similar in the process of rotating landwards the flap submerges gradually during the rotation thus the vertical position of buoyancy center z f approaches to z c when the flap reaches maximum landward angle it is almost submerged and the distance between z f and z c is closed to 0 the moment is consequently small which can be indicated from ω around t 16 5 in figs 10 b and fig 15 b moreover the wave conditions are identical in these cases thus the flaps with different ρ flap or z c finally reach a similar maximum landward angle after the wave crest moves past the water line at left side of the flap drops rapidly the fast variation of the submerged part results the moment grows rapidly moreover the flap rotates seawards at wave trough the fluid particle further enhances the flap motion the noticeable variation of the torque leads to a rise in ω and ω due to that the variation of free surface at seaside is further affected by input conditions more obvious differences exist among the maximum seaward angles 4 2 wave conditions to figure out the effects of incident waves wave height keeps constant as h 0 45 while wave length varies from 8 00 to 18 00 the corresponding wave period t is from 7 60 to 14 51 the flap properties are set as ρ flap 0 15 and z c 0 690 since the flap properties are identical in these cases the maximum landward angles are only affected by wave length on the one hand once the wave energy increases with l according to the conservation of energy the amplitude of flap motion is enlarged in the case of l 18 00 vice versa for the case of l 8 00 see fig 18 and fig 19 on the other hand wave number increases with l and thus the flap s rotation becomes much frequently moreover the horizontal distance between wave crest and wave trough decreases with l thus reducing the occurrence time of slamming under this circumstance the amplitude of flap motion in the case of l 14 00 is smaller and the slamming occurs earlier while the flap in the case of l 18 00 suffers an obvious slamming pressure it can be seen from both table 3 and fig 20 that the slamming pressure increases with l and is absent in the cases of l 8 00 thus it can be concluded that the rotation is frequently when l is small and the slamming pressure is less obvious in such case to further discuss the influences of wave parameters wave height h is set from 0 25 to 0 50 l 14 00 t 11 82 and other parameters are kept constant it can be seen from fig 21 and fig 22 because wave energy increases with h the largest rotation range occurs in the case of h 0 50 on the other hand wave numbers are identical in all three cases of h thus the slamming occurs nearly at the same time in fig 22 b a higher jet flow is found when h 0 50 which is because the wave surface is higher in such case and ω is also slightly larger in the case of h 0 50 fig 23 shows that the slamming pressure is increased by the rise in input h although the peak value of ω increases with h when the slamming pressure reaches its maximum the differences of ω in present cases are less obvious thus these differences of slamming pressure should also be related to another factor it has been proved that the angle between the wave surface and the body surface namely the deadrise angle is a key factor affected the slamming pressure in the forced motion cases and a smaller deadrise angle will result in larger slamming pressure when ω is identical e g sun et al 2015 cheng et al 2018c fig 23 a illustrates that the rotation angle is the largest in the case of h 0 50 when the slamming pressure reaches its maximum while the wave surface near the flap is the highest as well thus the deadrise angle is the smallest in such case and as shown in both fig 23 b and table 4 a larger slamming pressure is found in the case of h 0 50 since it is hard for ω and γ to be identical while other parameters are different a conclusion can be found that the deadrise angle still has effects on the slamming pressure if ω and γ are respectively similar 4 3 motion before slamming occurs apart from above parameters the effects of the flap motion before the slamming occurs should also be investigated the initial phase θ 0 of incident wave is set as π 2 0 π 2 and π representing the flap is at left middle slop wave crest right middle slope and wave trough at t 0 respectively because the fluid particles at different positions of waves motion toward different directions the flap will rotate toward different directions in the first place the wave conditions are l 16 00 t 13 19 and h 0 45 and the flap properties are identical with those in sections 4 2 because the motions of flap before the slamming occurs are different both the magnitudes and the occurrence time of slamming peak pressure among four cases are different specifically it can be seen from fig 24 that in the case of θ 0 π 2 the flap is at right side of wave crest at t 0 and then rotates landwards directly until t 6 when the flap firstly reaches wave crest it has reached maximum landward angle already see fig 25 and then the slamming occurs when the flap rotates backwards from t 6 to t 11 see fig 27 in the case of θ 0 0 the flap firstly rotates landwards similarly because of the direction of fluid particle nevertheless because the wave crest passes the flap directly the flap will not reach the maximum landward angle before t 2 5 the flap then rotates backwards with a small ω from t 2 5 to t 7 5 resulting in the absence of slamming in this process after that the flap starts to rotate backwards with a larger initial ω because the torque is enlarged after the flap reached the maximum seaward angle the magnitude of ω is further enlarged due to the pressure differences between the both sides of the flap see fig 26 thus when the flap rotates seawards again a slamming occurs similarly in the cases of θ 0 π 2 and θ 0 π the flap firstly rotates seawards corresponding ω in these processes is much smaller and thus the slamming will not occur until the next rotation period combined with these four cases it can be found that once the maximum landward angle is less than 0 60 in present conditions the slamming will then occurs in the process of rotating from the maximum landward angle although the input conditions are identical except for θ 0 differences also exist among the rotational amplitudes in the present cases it can be seen from fig 24 that the rotational amplitudes in the cases of θ 0 π 2 and θ 0 0 is slightly larger than other two cases it can be known that the slamming pressure will be affected by the motion before it occurs and a larger slamming pressure will further enlarge the rotational amplitude in other words the slamming peak pressure and the rotation of flap are mutually influenced thus an important conclusion can be obtained that the slamming peak pressure in a certain case should be a range of undulate value instead of a single constant value in view of this the results in the former tables are given based on the slamming occurring in the first place 5 conclusions the slamming on a rotating flap in free motion is investigated numerically using a time domain hobem model with fully non linear boundary conditions the nodes on the non linear wave surface are tracked through the mel boundary conditions the coupled disturbed waves from the outer boundaries are absorbed by the numerical damping layers in the boundary conditions the falling jet with strong non linearity is captured through the domain decomposition method and the unequal distribution scheme of meshes after that the auxiliary function method is employed to obtain the pressure distribution and the flap motion the present hobem model is verified by comparing the flap motion response dynamic characteristics and free surface elevations against the experimental data and the published cfd results relatively comprehensive numerical simulations have been performed to study on how the factors affect the slamming event through which several conclusions can be obtained when the flaps with different prosperities are motivated by the same wave the maximum landward angles are similar while more obvious differences exist among the maximum seaward angles this is because the torque approaches to 0 in the process of rotating landwards but grows rapidly in the process of rotating seawards the noticeable variation of the moment also leads the different peaks of ω and ω finally results in the different slamming pressure the differences among the peaks of slamming pressure in different cases of m or z c should be also attributed to rotational inertial i similar to the ship pitching with large speed a large i will result to a large added inertia during the flap rotating thus the flap with large mass or high position of mass center will motion slightly the influences of wave conditions are mainly reflected in wave energy once wave energy decreases with l or h the rotational amplitude and slamming pressure will be decreased accordingly on the other hand due to that wave number is enlarged by the decreasing l the flap will rotate frequently and the slamming is less obvious the flap motion before slamming occurs also has effects on slamming thus the slamming peak pressure in a certain case should be a range of undulate value instead of a single constant value finally we choose a rectangle attached a semicircle on the bottom as the example in the present investigation and the numerical model is ready to be extended to arbitrary shape in a future work credit author statement yong cheng

22204,a time domain higher order boundary element method hobem with fully non linear boundary conditions is established to investigate the slamming problem on a rotating flap in free motion the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel boundary conditions with numerical damping layers are adopted to track the time dependent free surface nodes through which the influences of coupled disturbed waves from the outer boundaries are eliminated the potential of each element within the thin long jet is calculated in the rotating coordinate system to overcome numerical instability induced by the local highly oscillatory pressure the domain decomposition method and the unequal distribution scheme of meshes are simultaneously adopted to capture the falling jet with strong non linearity the auxiliary function method is then employed to calculate the pressure distribution through which the mutual dependence between the body motion and the fluid flow is decoupled the present numerical model is verified through comparing the flap motion response dynamic characteristics and free surface elevations against the published experimental data and the computational fluid dynamics cfd results the parameter studies are performed to investigate the influences of flap properties and wave parameters detailed results are provided through free surface profile rotation angle angular velocity torque response and pressure distribution keywords slamming hobem fully nonlinear oscillating wave surge converter splash jet 1 introduction wave slamming on a rigid body has been studied extensively due to the plentiful applications in ships and naval architectures the present paper emphasizes on the problem of wave slamming on a buoyant flap which usually happens to the oscillating wave surge converters owscs the flap is excited by waves and rotates back and forth driving the hydraulic cylinders pumping high pressure water to the electric generator on the bank see fig 1 however when the device operates in a rough sea state the flap will hit water surface with high speed resulting in a short duration but high magnitude pressure on the body surface this slamming event is considered as a threat to the device safety because the cross sections of the flap are mainly the same as a rectangle attached to a half circle and the two dimensional 2d model is highly relevant to many other general cases the flap is simplified to be 2d in the present study the problems of wave impact slamming on a rigid body can be mainly divided into two categories the studies in the first category investigate that waves hit a fixed body the problems in this category mainly happen to a sea wall or a fixed offshore platform it has been found that the front shape of the waves has great influences on the local impact pressure wei et al 2016 however the slamming on the rotating flap should be divided into the second category since the flap is not fixed in waves in this category it has been found that it is the body hits waves rather than waves hit the body henry et al 2014 the studies in this category can be further separated into two subcategories according to the motion mode of the body in the first subcategory the body moves in a prescribed motion several works have been performed to simulate the slamming on a force motion flap sun et al 2015 simulated the forced motion flap plunging into calm water and waves with without gravity effect using the first order boundary element method fobem the authors former work cheng et al 2018a further investigated the current effects on the pressure distribution of the forced motion flap through the higher order boundary element method hobem in the studies of second subcategory the emphasis is focused on the body s free motion to further simulate the slamming in a much realistic circumstance according to the work of wu et al 2004 the pressure on the body surface plays a much more important role in this subcategory when the body is in a prescribed motion the pressure is only used to analyze the loading on the body and in the free motion situation the pressure is an important factor affected the body motion when the flap rotates freely in waves the angular acceleration of the flap is not a free parameter but a part of solution of the flow field the signal of rotational moment is variable to keep the flap rotating continuously in the meantime the flow field is also disturbed by this unknown flap motion the numerical methods also face more challenges when the fully non linear boundary conditions are taken into considered firstly the re reflected waves from the input boundary are coupled with the incident wave zhou et al 2015 thus proper numerical damping layers at both ends of the computational domain are necessary to avoid the body motion being affected by the reflections from the output boundary and the re reflections from the input boundary secondly once the slamming occurs splash jet flow will firstly develop on the body surface and then fall into the main flow while in the fully coupling problems the pressure of the jet flow is demanded to be much smoother and more stable so that the angular acceleration of the flap is not influenced by numerical errors all the existing researches concerning the slamming on a free motion flap were based on navier stokes equations using the viscous flow model such as henry et al 2014 wei et al 2014 wei et al 2016 ferrer et al 2016 this method requires relatively higher computer resources to conduct plenty of parameters studies on the other hand because i the period of slamming impact is too short for the viscous effect to develop batchelor 1967 ii the viscous effect has been proven to be insignificant for the buoyant flap wei et al 2015 and iii the flap motion is much slower than the speed of the sound in water the incompressible potential flow model provides another interesting way to study on the slamming problem the boundary element method bem is a high efficiency method because only the boundary is discretized moreover relative to the fobem the hobem with higher order shape functions can model the free surface with strong nonlinearity much precisely and possess higher accuracy and efficiency however the bem has not been used to simulate the slamming on a free motion flap as mentioned above the main difficulties are that firstly the flow is no longer self similar due to the flap s rotation and secondly several methods should be taken to simulate the detachment of the jet flow these problems become more difficult because of the numerical instability the wave slamming on a flap is similar to the wave entry of a wedge while the rotation is taken into account as an extension of our previous studies regarding wave entry of a wedge cheng et al 2018b 2018c and wave slamming on a flap in prescribed motion cheng et al 2018a the primary aim of the present work is to push the application of the fully nonlinear hobem to simulate this particular slamming event and further elucidate the mechanism of wave slamming on the owsc to this end the description of the numerical model based on hobem with fully non linear boundary conditions is firstly developed in section 2 the corresponding mathematical formulations and numerical methods which are necessary to overcome the related problems are given and explained in relative detail in section 3 to ensure the results are much less affected by the numerical errors the convergent tests focused on time step and mesh scheme are firstly performed after that the comparisons against published experiment and cfd results are undertaken to verify the accuracy of the results obtained through present method on this basic extensive case studies are provided to explain the influences of flap properties and wave parameters to the slamming event in section 4 and finally several conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model 2 1 boundary conditions the schematic diagram of wave interaction with a rotating flap is shown in fig 2 the 2d flap is designed to be a rectangle attached a half circle on the bottom and rotate about the hinged point to deal with the mathematical problem a cartesian coordinate system o xz is defined with the origin at the hinged point in which x axis is along the direction of the incident wave propagation and z axis points upwards as shown in fig 2 γ is rotating angle from z axis to the centerline of the flap and γ 0 represents the flap rotates anticlockwise unless it is specified angular velocity ω is derivative of γ with respect to time t h denotes the static water depth d is vertical distance from the origin to the mean water surface and b is half thickness of the flap the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid with irrotational flow so that a velocity potential ϕ x z t which satisfies the laplace equation can be used to describe the fluid motion 1 2 ϕ 0 the dynamic condition and the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface s f in eulerian form should be written as 2 ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 3 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x where η z d is the free surface elevation above the mean water line in this paper a mixed eulerian lagrangian method mel is adopted to track the time dependent free surface node in the finite computational domain the reflections at the output boundary and the re reflections at the input boundary will affect the flap motion thus two damping layers are defined in boundary conditions to absorb the disturbed waves and not to affect the incident waves 4 d ϕ d t g η 1 2 ϕ 2 v x ϕ ϕ i 5 d x d t ϕ x v x x x 0 6 d z d t ϕ z v x z z 0 where d dt t ϕ is material derivative v x is the damping term which can be found in the work ofcheng et al 2017 x 0 z 0 are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the fluid particle at t 0 ϕ i and η i are the analytic solutions of incident wave which are obtained using the fifth order stokes wave theory 7 ϕ i ω k 2 j 1 5 i 1 5 μ i c i j cosh j k z h sin j k x ω t θ 0 8 η i 1 k j 1 5 i 1 5 μ i d i j cos j k x ω t θ 0 where ω k and θ 0 are wave circular frequency wave number and initial phase respectively the detailed expressions of coefficients μ i c ij and d ij can be found in sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 based on the impermeable condition the boundary condition on the wetted surface s b should be written as 9 ϕ n ω r n where r x z n n x n z is the normal of the body surface pointing out of the fluid domain the bottom s d is impermeable in the present model incident wave is generated through the following method the wave surface at initial time is given by z t 0 d η i and ϕ t 0 ϕ i and the incident wave conditions are always satisfied on the inlet boundary 10 ϕ ϕ i and η η i 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem the above boundary value problem can be transformed into an integral equation through green s second identify 11 α p s ϕ p s γ ln r 1 ln r 2 2 π ϕ q f n ϕ q f 2 π ln r 1 ln r 2 n d γ where α is the solid angle coefficient p s x 0 z 0 and q f x z are source point and field point respectively γ is the whole computational boundary r 1 denotes the distance between the field and source point r 2 is the distance between the field and the mirror image of the source field about sea bottom using quadratic shape functions the whole boundary surface γ is discretized with three node line elements within these isoparametric boundary elements physical variables are also interpolated by the same shape functions the numerical integration is performed using gauss legendre quadrature with 4 integration points within each element and then eq 11 can be discretized as 12 χ p ϕ p i 1 n e j 1 4 k 1 3 1 2 π h j k ϕ k ln r 1 ln r 2 j n j j w j i 1 n e j 1 4 k 1 3 h j k ln r 1 ln r 2 j 2 π ϕ k n j j w j where h represents the shape function j j is the jacobian matrix relating the physical coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates within an element n e is the total number of the discretized elements w j is the gauss coefficient 3 node number of each element and 4 gauss integration point number during the calculation once p s and q f belong to same element the distance between p s and q f gets closed to 0 and the green function lnr 1 lnr 2 2π and its derivates have singularities to eliminate the influences of singular integrals a polar coordinate transformation is employed in the calculation li et al 1985 finally the discretized integral can be transformed in the matrix form 13 a ϕ b ϕ n where a and b are influence matrixes which obtained from the integrations of lnr 1 lnr 2 n and lnr 1 lnr 2 respectively eq 13 can be solved through moving the unknowns to the left hand side namely ϕ n on the free surface and ϕ on the body surface while keeping others on the right hand side to avoid the numerical instability caused by the discontinuity of normal direction at the intersection point between the free surface and the body surface a rotating coordinate system o ξζ is employed with ζ along the centerline of the flap the definition can be written as sun et al 2015 14 ξ x cos γ z sin γ ζ x sin γ z cos γ thus the intersection point satisfies the boundary conditions 15 δ ϕ δ t ζ t ϕ ζ ω ξ ϕ ζ ζ ϕ ξ 1 2 ϕ ξ 2 ϕ ζ 2 g ξ sin γ ζ cos γ d 16 ζ t φ ξ ξ ω φ ξ ζ ω ζ ξ where both δϕ δt and ζ t represents the derivates with respect to t at a given ξ through eqs 15 and 16 the water particle at the intersection point can be updated in the ζ direction for a fixed ξ once the slamming occurs the splash jet flow will firstly develop on the body surface and errors will be brought in the calculation due to the ill conditioned matrix there are mainly two methods to deal with it numerically firstly the very thin part of jet is cut because its pressure closes to the atmospheric pressure e g zhao and faltinsen 1993 lu et al 2000 through which the ill conditioned matrix can be avoided while the oscillations of pressure near the intersection point will occur inevitably since the pressure is a key factor in the fully coupling problem the pressure on the body surface should be stable enough to motivate the flap during the calculation in this paper we adopt the method proposed by wu 2007 to obtain the unknown ϕ n on the jet surface and ϕ on the body surface in the jet flow area the potential of element z k z k 1 in the jet flow area is assumed to vary linearly 17 ϕ a b ξ c ζ since the direction of ξ is perpendicular to the body surface the normal velocity of fluid in jet area can be written as 18 ϕ n b ω r n thus the potential of nodes z k and z k 1 should be written as 19 ϕ k a ξ k ω r n c ζ k and ϕ k 1 a ξ k 1 ω r n c ζ k 1 and according to eq 19 coefficient c can be written as 20 c ϕ k 1 ϕ k ξ k 1 ξ k ω r n ζ k 1 ζ k the variation of ζ in the element can be represented as 21 ζ ζ k ζ k 1 ζ k ξ k 1 ξ k ξ ξ k then the unknown ϕ n on the jet surface can be obtained through 22 ϕ n b ζ k 1 ζ k ξ k 1 ξ k 2 ζ k 1 ζ k 2 c ξ k 1 ξ k ξ k 1 ξ k 2 ζ k 1 ζ k 2 with regard to the unknown ϕ on the body surface in the jet area a perpendicular line which starts from the node on the body surface and intersects the free surface is firstly set combined with the body surface condition the unknown ϕ on the body surface in the jet area can be obtained from 23 ϕ ϕ s f ξ s f b ω r n where subscripts s f represent the free surface and ϕ sf has been known from the free surface conditions with the flap rotating the thin long jet will finally fall into the main flow and a liquid liquid impact will occur since the impact of falling jet to the main flow is small transitory and localized the disturbance caused by the impact is neglected and the jet is allowed to re entries into the main flow however based on this precondition an overlapping domain will occur and eq 13 will no longer be directly solved thus to simulate this process numerically the computational domain is divided into two sub domains of the main flow and the falling jet see fig 3 and a smooth pressure distribution can also be obtained accordingly a particular variable is set in the procedure to track whether the irregular elements of the falling jet appear once the irregular elements appear eq 13 is re written as 24 a r r a r s a s r a s s ϕ r ϕ s b r r b r s b s r b s s ϕ r n ϕ s n where r and s represent the boundaries in fig 3 respectively at the interface s the pressure and the normal velocity are assumed to be continuous 25 ϕ s 1 ϕ s 2 ϕ s 1 n ϕ s 2 n where 1 and 2 represent the subdomains in fig 3 through eqs 24 and 25 eq 13 can be re written as 26 a r 1 r 1 a r 1 s 1 a s 1 r 1 a s 1 s 1 a s 2 s 2 a s 2 r 2 a r 2 s 2 a r 2 r 2 ϕ r 1 ϕ s 1 ϕ r 2 b r 1 r 1 b r 1 s 1 b s 1 r 1 b s 1 s 1 b s 2 s 2 b s 2 r 2 b r 2 s 2 b r 2 r 2 ϕ r 1 n ϕ s 1 n ϕ r 2 n similarly the unknowns in eq 26 can be obtained through moving them to the left hand side and keeping the specified terms on the right hand side 2 3 motion equation when the flap is motivated by wave the mutual dependence of fluid and body should be decoupled in this paper the coupling problem is solved through the motion equation with the auxiliary function method wu and taylor 2003 the motion equation of the flap can be written as 27 m s b p x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ where m represents moment p is the pressure distribution on the body surface m is the mass of the flap z c is the vertical position of mass center besides m can be represented through coefficients of power take off pto e g hydraulic cylinders in fig 1 28 m i a pto ω b pto ω c pto γ where i is the rotational inertia of the flap ω ω t is the angular acceleration a pto b pto and c pto are the inertia damping and elasticity coefficients of the pto respectively in the present work a pto b pto and c pto are set as 0 to simulate the strongest slamming event the pressure distribution p in eq 27 can be obtained through the bernoulli equation 29 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g η it should be pointed out that ϕ t in eq 29 is not explicitly known although ϕ is obtained through hobem thus the auxiliary function is employed and should be set as 30 ϕ t χ 1 ω r ϕ ω χ 2 where χ 1 and χ 2 are auxiliary functions which both satisfy the laplace equation based on the work of wu 1998 the auxiliary functions should satisfy the boundary conditions on s b 31 χ 1 n 0 and χ 2 n x n z z n x based on the dynamic condition the auxiliary functions satisfy the boundary conditions on s f 32 χ 1 1 2 ϕ 2 g η ω r ϕ and χ 2 0 based on the impermeable condition the auxiliary functions satisfy the boundary conditions on s d 33 χ 1 n ω x 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x and χ 2 n 0 at far field s o the potential is identical to incident potential thus the auxiliary functions satisfy 34 χ 1 n 2 ϕ i t n ω n r ϕ i and χ 2 n 0 the above boundary value problem i e eqs 31 34 can be solved through hobem described in section 2 2 since the pressure on body surface has been obtained numerically the only remained problem is the coupling fluid structure problem to decouple the mutual dependence between ω and m eqs 28 30 are substituted into eq 27 and the unknowns are moved to right hand side 35 s b χ 1 ω r ϕ 1 2 ϕ 2 g η x n z z n x d s m z c sin γ i s b χ 2 x n z z n x d s ω where a pto b pto and c pto have been neglected consequently ω can be calculated through eq 35 and then γ and ω can be obtained accordingly then the time step can be marched through eqs 4 6 with the 4th order runge kutta method 3 model validation 3 1 convergent tests using the hobem model a calculation procedure is developed based on fortran language the flap in the work of henry et al 2014 is selected for the convergence tests in this paper the distance between the origin to the mean water surface d the acceleration due to the gravity g and the water density ρ are used for non dimensionalisation therefore time t angular velocity ω pressure p and mass m are respectively measured through d g 1 2 g d 1 2 ρgd and ρd 3 all the results are non dimensional in following sections unless it is specified after non dimensionalisation the wave conditions are listed as follow wave height h 0 49 wave period t 13 14 wave length l 16 10 initial phase θ 0 0 water depth h 1 49 the corresponding computational domain is taken as 160 h of which 40 is used as damping layers at the two ends of the computational domain a unique distribution scheme of meshes is employed in this paper to track the time dependent nodes on the free surface and the body surface the smallest size of element l m is set on both jet root and flap surface and the size of the element increases gradually away at a given ratio λ 1 02 the biggest element size is not allowed to be larger than 0 5 firstly three different mesh schemes a fine mesh an intermediate mesh and a coarse mesh are selected i e the minimal element length l m 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 respectively it should be explained that the pressure distribution on body surface is given based on s which is the distance measured along the body surface with the origin at the intersection of the centerline with the surface of the flap the negative sign of s denotes the left side of the flap surface fig 4 shows that in the case of l m 0 05 there is a difference in comparison with other results in fact a large l m is hard to track the irregular jet with strong non linearity and more importantly l m is also related to the time step dt l m μv max the present model is strongly affected by the mesh scheme and the time step we found that l m 0 05 will cause significant numerical errors and instability after considering the accuracy and efficiency of calculation l m is set as 0 03 the calculations in the present work were performed on a normal personal computer with 8 cores and 8 gb of ram the results of l m 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 in fig 4 took 9 5 h 4 5 h and 2 2 h respectively secondly convergent tests for time steps with l m 0 03 are then performed time step size is set as dt l m μv max where v max is the maximum of velocity magnitude on the free surface at each time step and μ is a coefficient which is set as 10 20 and 30 respectively once jet departs from the body difference appears in the case of μ 30 see fig 5 therefore μ 20 is dependable enough in the convergent test in the following simulations l m 0 03 μ 20 λ 1 02 and dt l m μv max are adopted to ensure the results are much less affected by the numerical errors 3 2 comparison with published results the validity of the present model is established by comparing our results against the 2d experiment and the cfd simulations in henry et al 2014 the cfd results in the work of wei et al 2016 are also provided to verify the present method the wave parameters and flap properties in the work of wei et al 2016 are consistent with those in the experiment in order to keep consistent with the parameters in the published works in this section i the parameters and results are dimensional ii ω is negative in the anti clockwise direction temporarily iii apart from the last slamming event depicted in fig 6 the overlapping domain between the main flow and the falling jet in other events has been eliminated the dimensional flap properties and wave parameters are the thickness is 0 0875m m 4 27 kg z c 0 132m i 0 1147 kgm2 and height of the flap is 0 310m wave height h 0 1m wave period t 1 9s and wave length is l 3 10m initial phase θ 0 is assumed to be π 2 the dimensional size of symmetrical computational domain is 2 12 2m h of which 12 2m is the distance from the wave maker to the flap in the experiment h 0 305m is the water depth two wave gauges r2 and r5 are set the locations of which are 5 18m and 6 08m from the inlet boundary respectively the slamming event should be more related to the variation of free surface because the slamming pressure occurs at the intersection between the body and free surface according to the researches considering the wave propagating over a submerged sill e g beji and battjes 1993 an uneven bottom will increase the free surface nonlinearity in the present case the lowest part of the flap is 0 056m higher than the flume bottom and thus the height of flap basis is about one sixth of the water depth h 0 305m the length of flap basis in x direction approximately equals to the flap thickness 0 0875m which is only one fortieth of the wave length l 3 10m the reflection diffraction and shoaling caused by the submerged obstacle with this scale are very limited on the other hand the computational domain is 24 4m in x direction and a huge number of much smaller elements will be used on the fluid bottom to precisely define the basis with such small scale in comparison with the very limited influence this much lower computational efficiency is believed to be unnecessary the amount of total meshes are nearly twice larger than that in flat bottom case therefore the basis is neglected in the present validation the free surface profiles in fig 6 have illustrated the main process of the slamming event the flap firstly rotates landwards due to the motivation of wave crest and reaches the maximum landward angle i e fig 6 a then the flap rotates seawards as the wave crest moves past i e fig 6 b when the flap reaches the vertical position with a large angular velocity the water line at left side of the flap drops to the lowest level i e fig 6 c after that the flap continues to rotate seawards and hits the wave surface with a relatively large angular velocity resulting in the slamming event as a result the local water is extruded by the flap moves upside along the body surface and then falls into the main flow i e fig 6 d finally the flap closes to the maximum seaward position before the arrival of next wave crest i e fig 6 e it can be seen from fig 7 that the magnitudes of γ and ω are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data and the cfd results which indicates that the motion characteristics of the flap are well reproduced by the hobem model since γ 0 represents the flap rotating anti clockwise in this section the flap rotates seawards with a much larger velocity according to the results in fig 7 b this should be related to the fact that the nonlinear wave trough is much wider than crest when the flap rotates seawards in wave trough the flap can be much affected by the fluid particle in the same direction on the other hand the nonlinear wave steepness is larger which further decreases the deadrise angle cheng et al 2018a between wave surface and flap when the flap hits wave crests apart from the nonlinear wave amplitude is much larger this can be another possible reason for that slamming on an owsc only occurs in nonlinear wave condition to further verify the dynamic characteristics the torque m and pressure p at s 0 28m which is the location of the pressure sensor p in the reference studies versus time t are given in fig 8 it can be seen the peaks of pressure p and torque m appears at nearly the same time this is because the occurrence of slamming pressure results in a large opposing local moment which further decreases the velocity of rotating seawards at the same time thus the absolute values of angular velocity in fig 7 b start to decrease after the flap suffers the slamming it also can be known from the results that the peak values of p and m keep varying indicating the slamming procedure is greatly affected by disturbance free surface with strong nonlinearity the results of p in henry et al 2014 and m in wei et al 2016 are selected and shown in fig 8 because of the relatively good integrity and clarity while the comparisons against other results will also be illustrated the variation tendencies of m and p agree well with the published results while the peak values are different the present hobem model obtains the slamming peak pressure varying from 0 6 kpa to 0 8 kpa while the cfd result in henry et al 2014 was 0 1 kpa 0 3 kpa see fig 8 a in the work of wei et al 2014 the corresponding result was 0 3 kpa 0 4 kpa using much smaller time step and mesh size wei et al 2016 further obtained the result varying from 0 4 kpa to 1 8 kpa these differences should be related to two main reasons firstly henry et al 2014 claimed that the cfd results of slamming could be underestimated by coarse grid refinement and time resolution this explains that the obtained slamming peak pressure is higher than those in earlier cfd models another reason is that in comparison with wei et al 2016 the velocity of fluid flow might be underestimated by the potential flow hobem model this can be indicated from the generated splash jet which falls much directly into the main flow see fig 6 e than that in the experiment and cfd simulation see fig 10 in wei et al 2016 therefore the relative velocity between fluid particle and the flap is lower resulting in a smaller peak pressure the numerical results of slamming peak pressure obtained by various cfd models and present hobem are generally in the same order of magnitude however much larger differences can be found when those results are compared against to the experimental data of 4 kpa 11 kpa wei et al 2016 pointed out that the slamming experiment might be influenced by various factors such as hydro elasticity and free surface instabilities while a recent study renzi et al 2018 believed that the pressure impulse should be a proper criterion when the numerical slamming pressure is compared against the experimental data since the peak of torque response is directly related to the slamming pressure the obtained result in fig 8 b is slightly under estimated because the present peak pressure is lower than the median in wei et al 2016 fig 9 shows the free surface elevations at two wave gauges the disturbance obtained by the hobem at r2 is less obvious and wave surface is more like the wave only result this is because r2 is much closer to the inlet boundary in contrast with r5 the wave generation method applied in the present paper is based on the analytic solutions at inlet boundary which is different from the flap type wave maker adopted in the experiment and cfd models thus the boundary re reflections within the present model are also different due to the boundary conditions while according to the works of wei et al 2016 the effects of re reflected waves are not significant until t 25s in the present incident conditions thus the small differences against the cfd results should be related to the neglect of viscosity effect and the slightly lower dynamic characteristics in comparison with the experiment both numerical methods underestimate the wave elevation this should also be related to that much lower slamming response has much less influences on wave surface in summary the present hobem model can be proved to be valid through the good agreement with the cfd results including motion characteristics and dynamic characteristics regarding the comparison against the experiment validation will be performed based on the work of renzi et al 2018 in a future work 4 parameter studies in this section several parameter studies are performed to study on the mechanism of the slamming problem the first slamming event is selected in each case so that the influence of re reflections can be avoided thus the domain decomposition method is employed to simulate the detached jet flow the parameters in section 4 are all nondimensional 4 1 flap properties the flap density ρ flap is studied in the first place as it is a basic physical quantity of the flap after non dimensionalisation the half thickness of the flap b is set as 0 21 water depth is 1 49 wave height h is 0 45 wave period t is 13 19 and wave length l is 16 00 to show the variation of slamming affected by ρ flap as complete as possible six sets of input values and the extreme values of slamming pressure appearing in the first place are given in table 1 the time histories of flap motion and slamming pressure at s 1 36 are given in fig 10 the numerical results of one complete slamming event from maximum landward angle to maximum seaward angle are depicted from fig 11 to fig 13 since the wave conditions are identical the peak value of ω and the rotational amplitude are decreased by the rise in i the horizontal pressure differences between both sides of the flap in figs 11 and 14 are less obvious this is because both ω and ω equal to 0 in these angles and the pressure is mainly static pressure and is only affected by submergence depth moreover despite ρ flap being different the maximum landward angles in three cases bear similarity to each other this may indicate that in the slamming process the flap properties have obvious effect on maximum seaward angle rather than maximum landward angle fig 12 a shows that height difference of free surface between both sides of the flap are the most obvious when the flap reaches the vertical position this leads to a distinct pressure difference further resulting in ω reaches its maximum when γ 0 as the flap is driven by exciting torque dias et al 2017 moreover this difference is further enlarged in the case of ρ flap 0 10 due to the maximum i it also can be seen that the variation of wave elevation over time at left side of flap is affected by ρ flap a coupling relationship between ω and the height variation can be indicated that on the one hand an obvious height difference leads to a higher pressure difference resulting in distinct rise in ω and ω on the other hand there re more disturbances of the wave surface when the flap rotates with a larger ω and the height difference becomes much obvious consequently therefore the flap in the case of ρ flap 0 10 rotates with the largest ω and vice versa for ρ flap 0 30 it can be seen from fig 10 b when the flap re enters the water ω is increasing during the rotation the slamming occurs after ω reaches its positive peak after that because the flap suffers a high magnitude reactive force ω and m reach their negative peaks rapidly the sharp variation of pressure and torque prove the present pressure distribution is an impact load instead of a slowly changing dynamic load furthermore the results also indicate that the greater slamming pressure is the sharper and the rapider torque will be the slamming peak pressure reaches its maximum in the case of ρ flap 0 10 and decreases rapidly with increasing ρ flap this is because the flap with ρ flap 0 10 is easily motivated due to the smallest i resulting in rotating with the largest ω fig 13 b also shows that the pressure on the bottom is larger in the cases of larger ρ flap which should be attributed to the higher wave surface in the case of ρ flap 0 10 to further testify whether other flap properties exert significant influences on slamming the influence of vertical distance of mass center z c is altered through changing the flap height while mass m is constant as a result ρ flap can be fixed as 0 15 and z c varies from 1 024 to 1 805 similarly because the rotational inertia of flap with z c 0 470 is the smallest the flap in such case is subject to the most distinct slamming pressure see table 2 and fig 17 b it can be seen from fig 16 that the maximum seaward angles are different while the maximum landward angles are similar in the process of rotating landwards the flap submerges gradually during the rotation thus the vertical position of buoyancy center z f approaches to z c when the flap reaches maximum landward angle it is almost submerged and the distance between z f and z c is closed to 0 the moment is consequently small which can be indicated from ω around t 16 5 in figs 10 b and fig 15 b moreover the wave conditions are identical in these cases thus the flaps with different ρ flap or z c finally reach a similar maximum landward angle after the wave crest moves past the water line at left side of the flap drops rapidly the fast variation of the submerged part results the moment grows rapidly moreover the flap rotates seawards at wave trough the fluid particle further enhances the flap motion the noticeable variation of the torque leads to a rise in ω and ω due to that the variation of free surface at seaside is further affected by input conditions more obvious differences exist among the maximum seaward angles 4 2 wave conditions to figure out the effects of incident waves wave height keeps constant as h 0 45 while wave length varies from 8 00 to 18 00 the corresponding wave period t is from 7 60 to 14 51 the flap properties are set as ρ flap 0 15 and z c 0 690 since the flap properties are identical in these cases the maximum landward angles are only affected by wave length on the one hand once the wave energy increases with l according to the conservation of energy the amplitude of flap motion is enlarged in the case of l 18 00 vice versa for the case of l 8 00 see fig 18 and fig 19 on the other hand wave number increases with l and thus the flap s rotation becomes much frequently moreover the horizontal distance between wave crest and wave trough decreases with l thus reducing the occurrence time of slamming under this circumstance the amplitude of flap motion in the case of l 14 00 is smaller and the slamming occurs earlier while the flap in the case of l 18 00 suffers an obvious slamming pressure it can be seen from both table 3 and fig 20 that the slamming pressure increases with l and is absent in the cases of l 8 00 thus it can be concluded that the rotation is frequently when l is small and the slamming pressure is less obvious in such case to further discuss the influences of wave parameters wave height h is set from 0 25 to 0 50 l 14 00 t 11 82 and other parameters are kept constant it can be seen from fig 21 and fig 22 because wave energy increases with h the largest rotation range occurs in the case of h 0 50 on the other hand wave numbers are identical in all three cases of h thus the slamming occurs nearly at the same time in fig 22 b a higher jet flow is found when h 0 50 which is because the wave surface is higher in such case and ω is also slightly larger in the case of h 0 50 fig 23 shows that the slamming pressure is increased by the rise in input h although the peak value of ω increases with h when the slamming pressure reaches its maximum the differences of ω in present cases are less obvious thus these differences of slamming pressure should also be related to another factor it has been proved that the angle between the wave surface and the body surface namely the deadrise angle is a key factor affected the slamming pressure in the forced motion cases and a smaller deadrise angle will result in larger slamming pressure when ω is identical e g sun et al 2015 cheng et al 2018c fig 23 a illustrates that the rotation angle is the largest in the case of h 0 50 when the slamming pressure reaches its maximum while the wave surface near the flap is the highest as well thus the deadrise angle is the smallest in such case and as shown in both fig 23 b and table 4 a larger slamming pressure is found in the case of h 0 50 since it is hard for ω and γ to be identical while other parameters are different a conclusion can be found that the deadrise angle still has effects on the slamming pressure if ω and γ are respectively similar 4 3 motion before slamming occurs apart from above parameters the effects of the flap motion before the slamming occurs should also be investigated the initial phase θ 0 of incident wave is set as π 2 0 π 2 and π representing the flap is at left middle slop wave crest right middle slope and wave trough at t 0 respectively because the fluid particles at different positions of waves motion toward different directions the flap will rotate toward different directions in the first place the wave conditions are l 16 00 t 13 19 and h 0 45 and the flap properties are identical with those in sections 4 2 because the motions of flap before the slamming occurs are different both the magnitudes and the occurrence time of slamming peak pressure among four cases are different specifically it can be seen from fig 24 that in the case of θ 0 π 2 the flap is at right side of wave crest at t 0 and then rotates landwards directly until t 6 when the flap firstly reaches wave crest it has reached maximum landward angle already see fig 25 and then the slamming occurs when the flap rotates backwards from t 6 to t 11 see fig 27 in the case of θ 0 0 the flap firstly rotates landwards similarly because of the direction of fluid particle nevertheless because the wave crest passes the flap directly the flap will not reach the maximum landward angle before t 2 5 the flap then rotates backwards with a small ω from t 2 5 to t 7 5 resulting in the absence of slamming in this process after that the flap starts to rotate backwards with a larger initial ω because the torque is enlarged after the flap reached the maximum seaward angle the magnitude of ω is further enlarged due to the pressure differences between the both sides of the flap see fig 26 thus when the flap rotates seawards again a slamming occurs similarly in the cases of θ 0 π 2 and θ 0 π the flap firstly rotates seawards corresponding ω in these processes is much smaller and thus the slamming will not occur until the next rotation period combined with these four cases it can be found that once the maximum landward angle is less than 0 60 in present conditions the slamming will then occurs in the process of rotating from the maximum landward angle although the input conditions are identical except for θ 0 differences also exist among the rotational amplitudes in the present cases it can be seen from fig 24 that the rotational amplitudes in the cases of θ 0 π 2 and θ 0 0 is slightly larger than other two cases it can be known that the slamming pressure will be affected by the motion before it occurs and a larger slamming pressure will further enlarge the rotational amplitude in other words the slamming peak pressure and the rotation of flap are mutually influenced thus an important conclusion can be obtained that the slamming peak pressure in a certain case should be a range of undulate value instead of a single constant value in view of this the results in the former tables are given based on the slamming occurring in the first place 5 conclusions the slamming on a rotating flap in free motion is investigated numerically using a time domain hobem model with fully non linear boundary conditions the nodes on the non linear wave surface are tracked through the mel boundary conditions the coupled disturbed waves from the outer boundaries are absorbed by the numerical damping layers in the boundary conditions the falling jet with strong non linearity is captured through the domain decomposition method and the unequal distribution scheme of meshes after that the auxiliary function method is employed to obtain the pressure distribution and the flap motion the present hobem model is verified by comparing the flap motion response dynamic characteristics and free surface elevations against the experimental data and the published cfd results relatively comprehensive numerical simulations have been performed to study on how the factors affect the slamming event through which several conclusions can be obtained when the flaps with different prosperities are motivated by the same wave the maximum landward angles are similar while more obvious differences exist among the maximum seaward angles this is because the torque approaches to 0 in the process of rotating landwards but grows rapidly in the process of rotating seawards the noticeable variation of the moment also leads the different peaks of ω and ω finally results in the different slamming pressure the differences among the peaks of slamming pressure in different cases of m or z c should be also attributed to rotational inertial i similar to the ship pitching with large speed a large i will result to a large added inertia during the flap rotating thus the flap with large mass or high position of mass center will motion slightly the influences of wave conditions are mainly reflected in wave energy once wave energy decreases with l or h the rotational amplitude and slamming pressure will be decreased accordingly on the other hand due to that wave number is enlarged by the decreasing l the flap will rotate frequently and the slamming is less obvious the flap motion before slamming occurs also has effects on slamming thus the slamming peak pressure in a certain case should be a range of undulate value instead of a single constant value finally we choose a rectangle attached a semicircle on the bottom as the example in the present investigation and the numerical model is ready to be extended to arbitrary shape in a future work credit author statement yong cheng
