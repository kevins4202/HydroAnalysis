19545,this study develops life cycle water footprints for the production of fuels and chemicals via thermochemical conversion of algae biomass this study is based on two methods of feedstock production ponds and photobioreactors pbrs and four conversion pathways fast pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction htl conventional gasification and hydrothermal gasification htg the results show the high fresh water requirement for algae production and the necessity to recycle harvested water or use alternative water sources to produce 1 kg of algae through ponds 1564 l of water are required when pbrs are used only 372 l water are required however the energy requirements for pbrs are about 30 times higher than for ponds from a final product perspective the pathway based on the gasification of algae biomass was the thermochemical conversion method that required the highest amount of water per mj produced mainly due to its low hydrogen yield followed by fast pyrolysis and htl on the other hand htg has the lowest water footprint mainly because the large amount of electricity generated as part of the process compensates for the electricity used by the system performance in all pathways can be improved through recycling channels keywords algae thermochemical conversion water footprint ponds photobioreactor life cycle assessment 1 introduction the water consumption of the entire life cycle of a product needs to be assessed because water is a scarce resource it is expected that in a few decades it will be challenging to meet basic human needs in terms of access to water for large proportions of the population jackson et al 2001 preserving natural habitats and systems is also very important and the removal of resources fundamental to these systems can be damaging postel and richter 2012 for these reasons it is important that agriculture and industrial processes do not threaten access to water in recent years studies have been conducted to measure the water footprint of many different crops gerbens leenes et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 furthermore as algae cultivation becomes more common it is also important to understand all the effects on the environment so that informed decisions on the possibility and scale of production can be made over the last few decades many different types of feedstocks have been studied as candidates for biomass sources in bioenergy production mckendry 2002a swana et al 2011 and the different characteristics in each offer a range of characteristics on the final product mckendry 2002b one feedstock that has attracted more interest of late is algae biomass mainly due to its unique properties and methods of production including via ponds and photobioreactors pbrs doucha et al 2005 jorquera et al 2010 pankratz et al 2017 ugwu et al 2008 one of the main resources required for alga production and to a lesser extent its processing is water dismukes et al 2008 pate et al 2011 depending on the geographical location of the production facility obtaining the minimum amount of water necessary to produce the biomass can be challenging and given the high volume required for algae cultivation the impact is generally considerable slade and bauen 2013 to reduce water use the possibility of recycling the water used during the algae life cycle yang et al 2011 or cultivating a species of alga in wastewater from municipal waste to lower the high water requirement during cultivation have been considered wang et al 2016 one important consideration regarding water consumption during algae production is to determine which cultivation method offers more advantages the most commonly used and better understood algae production in ponds or the relatively new technology that uses photobioreactors pbrs recent studies show that some types of pbrs can be economically competitive with ponds davis et al 2016 ozkan et al 2012 while there are several studies on the conversion of algae through thermochemical processes or transesterification to produce biofuel jonker and faaij 2013 nautiyal et al 2014 there are none on the conversion of algal biomass to diluent and very few on the production of hydrogen from algae through thermochemical conversion these are the two products of interest and in high demand by the oil sands and chemical industries in oil sands applications the chemicals namely diluent in the form of naphtha and paraffin are employed to reduce density and to liberate hydrocarbon molecules from bitumen rao and liu 2013 diluent broadly defined as a diluting agent is a substance that is added to viscous fluid to increase its flow diluents have a diverse range of applications from the drug industry ebino 1999 to the transportation of oil and bitumen extracted in the canadian oil sands alvarez et al 2009 hemmingsen et al 2005 the diluent helps in reducing the viscosity of bitumen to allow efficient transportation through pipeline miadonye et al 2001 in general they are natural gas condensates consisting of heavy oil components from lighter compounds but may have lighter fractions tipman et al 2001 diluent is composed of paraffinic hydrocarbons molecules anhorn and badakhshan 1994 mehrotra 1992 in this regard a liquid product from pyrolysis in the form of biodiluent has been patented pollard et al 2015 another patent highlights the use of methods for oil extraction using bitumen through fischer tropsch process tessel 2015 furthermore the properties of diluent in relation with naphtha condensates are comparable kumar et al 2017 the aim is to use renewable biomass to produce stabilized bio crude through htl and fast pyrolysis which would be employed as a diluent in oil sands applications hydrogen also versatile is used by the chemical metallurgical glass and electronics industries and has seen an increase in interest from the petroleum refining sector especially for the refining of heavy oils that contain high amounts of sulfur and hydrogen ramachandran and menon 1998 there are studies that explore the water footprint of biofuel production through different conversion pathways dominguez faus et al 2009 gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2011 yi wen and may 2013 gerbens leenes et al provide some details of the water footprint of biofuel production from algae gerbens leenes et al 2014 their study focuses on transesterification as the primary method of biomass conversion since alga and all its conversion pathways are receiving increased interest as possible environmentally friendly sources of biofuels and other products this study analyses the requirements of water an important resource for the sustainability of the production and thermochemical conversion of algae over the life cycle a case study for alberta a western canadian province is conducted in this paper the semi arid climate in most of the canadian provinces and the corresponding low volume of precipitation mbogga et al 2009 dictate that resource use must be well planned to guarantee proper biomass growth the overall objective of this paper is to analyse the life cycle water consumption of diluent and hydrogen production from algal biomass used as raw material the specific objectives are to develop a method to estimate the water footprint for diluent and hydrogen production from algal biomass for four different conversion pathways these thermochemical conversion methods that can be applied to algal biomass produced either through ponds or pbrs are o the production of diluent through fast pyrolysis and the hydrotreating of algae feedstock o the production of diluent through the hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrotreating of algae feedstock o the production of hydrogen through the gasification of algae feedstock and enrichment of syngas and o the production of hydrogen through the hydrothermal gasification htg of algae feedstock and enrichment of syngas conduct sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to study the changes resulting from variations in input parameters on the life cycle water footprints of diluent and hydrogen production from algae 2 method calculating the water footprint from the production of diluent and hydrogen from algal biomass involves an analysis of the life cycle of the biomass from well to tank which means all steps from resource acquisition for biomass cultivation to final production of chemicals of interest except their consumption the international organization for standardization suggests through their iso 14040 norms a life cycle assessment framework that consists of a goal and scope definition life cycle inventory and impact assessment and interpretation standardization 2006 first the goal and scope define the system boundaries of the cases that will be analyzed and include details on possible impacts negative or positive for industry or government the life cycle inventory is the part of the study in which all the information necessary for the analysis is assembled and all the input assumptions are made finally the computation and analysis permit the assessment of environmental impacts and a better interpretation of the results of the study this study adopts a functional unit of 1 mj of diluent for the fast pyrolysis and htl analyses and 1 mj of hydrogen for the gasification and htg analyses more specifically for the resource of interest in this study the results are presented in terms l of water mj of diluent or h2 in other words the functional unit is the amount of water required to produce 1 mj of the product of interest in a wheel to gate approach different base cases were established so that the importance of each variable in the final results could be measured once this was done an uncertainty analysis was conducted through a monte carlo simulation to determine the influence of uncertainties of some inputs on the results it is necessary to consider the unit operations involved in algal biomass production thermochemical conversion through fast pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction hydrothermal gasification or conventional gasification and hydrotreating to obtain diluent in the cases of fast pyrolysis and htl the basic unit operations for fast pyrolysis and htl are the production and dewatering of algal biomass drying for fast pyrolysis only and thermochemical conversion of the feedstock and hydrotreating to produce diluent the conversion pathway for fast pyrolysis is shown in fig 1 and for htl in fig 2 for gasification and htg the unit operations are cultivation and dewatering drying for gasification only and thermochemical conversion and hydrogen production the conversion pathway for thermal gasification and hydrothermal gasification is presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively in both fast pyrolysis and htg it is assumed that the cultivation and conversion facilities are closely located and that the impact of transportation between units is negligible this analysis uses data gathered from the literature on the cultivation and conversion of algal biomass and other types of biomass when case studies for algae are not conclusive information obtained from industry and information obtained through models developed by the authors in aspen plus aspen plus 2009 some key assumptions were made for the analysis conducted in this paper first it was assumed that the algae production facility capacity is 2000 dry tonnes of biomass per day this figure is used in earlier studies on large scale biomass based systems berndes 2002 moazami et al 2012 second the thermochemical conversion plants have the infrastructure to use everything that is produced as it becomes available third the production facilities and conversion plants are adjacent to each other and the impact of biomass transportation is negligible fourth the inoculum systems of ponds have a negligible contribution to the overall water consumption of the process fifth the electricity input to each stage of the process indirectly contributes to the overall water consumption since water is required for energy generation and last water loss due to evaporation in pbrs is negligible considering that pbrs are closed systems versus open ponds a water footprint assessment for algae cultivation was conducted for two options the first is the use of raceway ponds which is currently the most common method of algae cultivation and consists of a recirculation channel where the feedstock immersed in a liquid solution is guided through the channel thereby avoiding sedimentation chisti 2007 the other method is the use of photobioreactors pbrs an innovative technology in which biomass is cultivated in enclosed systems which increases the level of control the operator has over the parameters and makes it possible to maximize biomass production singh and sharma 2012 of the four thermochemical conversion pathways considered in this study two are for the production of diluent and two for hydrogen in this study the life cycle water footprint refers to both direct and indirect consumption of water during the processes used to produce algal biomass and to convert it to diluent or hydrogen direct consumption of water is defined as the total amount of water required during the entire biomass production phase and the subsequent thermochemical conversion processes such as losses due to evaporation or blowdown of water at the steam generation or cooling stages indirect consumption refers to the amount of water used during fertilizer production ammonia and diammonium phosphate in this case and electrical energy input for the various unit operations singh and kumar 2011 surface or ground water can be used as sources for both direct and indirect uses 3 water requirement inventory water requirements calculated in this inventory are categorized based on the unit operations that make up the entire production pathway of algal biomass to diluent or hydrogen 3 1 production of biomass this section presents the input parameters related to the production of algae feedstock for the two main methods of algae cultivation ponds and photobioreactors 3 1 1 ponds raceway ponds are very common in the algae facilities currently in operation chiaramonti et al 2013 hence there are many studies that explore in depth the operating conditions and production optimization methods in ponds borowitzka 1999 chiaramonti et al 2013 lee 2001 moheimani and borowitzka 2006 however most of the literature in this area concentrates on facilities built in warm locations with high solar radiation all year and generally good conditions for algae cultivation in an open air setting pankratz et al 2017 this study considers a pond facility in central alberta canada and assumes that production is limited to the warm months of the year approximately 175 days for ponds some of the main sources of water loss are transpiration and evaporation system blowdown and losses during harvesting and drying while some of these losses can be mitigated for example through water recycling feeds designed for the system evapo transpiration is a challenge in the dry climates and low precipitation rates in alberta mbogga et al 2009 hence water replacement rates may be relatively high in this cultivation method to estimate the average evaporation during summer it was assumed that summer conditions in alberta are similar to late spring early autumn in arizona where detailed data on algae cultivation are available so that an average evaporation rate can be adopted for this study the evaporation data from arizona were compared with data measured in the wabamun lake area in alberta hage 1978 for our study we assumed a large scale facility capable of producing 2000 t of dry algae day with the same basic characteristics of operation and production described in a recent study davis et al 2016 daily alga production is assumed to be 25 g m2 d in a facility divided into farms of 20 2 million m2 dedicated to pond cultivation only and a total footprint per farm including processing and storage of 30 8 million m2 a design with 400 000 m2 modules containing 50 raceway ponds of 8000 m2 each is also assumed the media in these ponds would be mixed by paddlewheels and the alga concentration kept at 0 1 g l or 0 01 wt an inoculum system is also part of the design its goal is to guarantee the production of a high concentration media for insertion into the ponds which maintains the culture at the desired concentration this inoculum system is negligible in size compared to the main system and does not account for a considerable percentage of the water consumption the data for the water footprint analysis of algae cultivation in ponds were acquired from multiple sources from industry partners to extensive studies of algae cultivation empirical data for what can be expected in alberta such as evaporation rate and number of days of harvest per year help more accurately estimate water requirement the calculated water footprint for the production of algae through ponds was 1564 l of water kg of algae the details of algae cultivation in raceway ponds as reported by davis et al 2016 or derived from their data are provided in table 1 it is also important to consider the water footprint of the electricity consumption of the facility in this case the highest energy consuming equipment are the pumps used to carry the algae solution through the ponds the paddlewheels used to stir the ponds and the drying apparatus used to increase the algae concentration to 20 dry weight before it is sent for thermochemical conversion the drying consists of pumps membranes for the first and most basic phase of the dewatering process and centrifuges that guarantee the desired 20 wt the water consumption factor is adopted based on data for alberta canada where most of the electricity generation is coal based for ponds the processes that require the highest amounts of water are the initial filling of the modules water loss to evaporation and blowdown 3 1 2 photobioreactors pbrs are a promising alternative to ponds however there is not much information available on them in the literature pbrs may be able to optimize algae production and resource allocation since they allow more control of the operating parameters such as temperature and light applied to the media chiaramonti et al 2013 they also require a smaller cultivation area than ponds for the same amount of algae produced pbrs can be designed and built in many different sizes for this study a tank size of 6800 l and a daily production of 20 kg of algae like the one used by hy tek bio was assumed this design consists of a hollow tank that has an airlift system to help with the mixture of the media singh and sharma 2012 with a bubble sparging mechanism containing co2 for the photosynthesis process the algae concentration in a system of this type is assumed to be between 3 and 5 g l up to 50 times higher than in ponds because of the scarcity of data available on this equipment a consistent set of parameters provided by industry was used and validated with data from various studies chen et al 2011 li et al 2007 rodolfi et al 2009 the same assumptions were made for pbrs as for a pond producing 2000 t of algae per day pbrs have negligible losses to evaporation since the culture remains in an enclosed space isolated from the environment other losses i e water loss during harvesting can be mitigated through systems controls as expected the water footprint for the cultivation of algae via pbrs is considerably lower than that for ponds pbrs consume only 25 l of water kg of algae produced table 2 gives the details of the basic operational data for algae cultivation in pbrs in terms of electricity consumption pbrs require considerably more energy than ponds davis et al 2016 watanabe and hall 1996 this is due to the equipment necessary for the proper functioning of the system such as the compressors to regulate the pressure and the many led lamps that both transmit light and provide heat to the culture at all times of the day this equipment would allow the cultivation of algae year round even in cold winter climates like alberta s the pbr algae cultivation processes that require the most water are the initial filling of the tanks replacement of blowdown water and electricity generation 3 2 fast pyrolysis fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion method commonly used to convert biomass to bio oil it is a thermal decomposition process that occurs in high temperatures in the absence of oxygen in 0 5 10 s flash pyrolysis lasts less than 0 5 s and conventional pyrolysis takes 5 10 min fast pyrolysis yields relatively high amounts of bio oil demirbas 2008 patel et al 2016 in this method biomass is dried to a moisture content of 10 to decrease the water content in the fast pyrolysis bio oil wright et al 2010 biomass feedstock that only goes through dewatering leaves the cultivation facility with approximately 20 wt dry biomass and must go through extra drying before being fed into the fast pyrolysis reactor feedstock with a moisture content of 5 10 wt is preferred for fast pyrolysis bridgwater et al 1999 other important parameters in the pyrolysis reaction are particle size temperature pressure and residence time once prepared the dried biomass is sent to a fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor at 520 c jones et al 2009 with particles smaller than 2 mm following reaction bio char is removed by cyclones resulting in a bio oil yield of approximately 59 9 wt dry basis depending on the feedstock ringer et al 2006 for this study a yield of 26130 kg hr was estimated using process model kumar et al 2018b the fast pyrolysis values related to the water footprint generated by the cooling ash quenching steam condensing and steam producing processes are extracted from the literature given that there is no significant difference in water requirement for this equipment no matter which feedstock is used most of the water used in these processes is recycled but there is an estimated loss of 3 due to factors such as blowdown and evaporation steam condensing is the main contributor to the water footprint ringer et al 2006 water is indirectly consumed through the generation of the electricity necessary to operate the plant during pre treatment and pyrolysis for the fast pyrolysis of algae a process model was developed in aspen plus to estimate the entire plant s electricity consumption and generation and the results for water requirements for algal pyrolysis are provided in table 3 with the higher heating value hhv of diluent at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in plus the hydrotreating factors table 5 are considered and all their contributions are added the total water footprint from the production of diluent through fast pyrolysis is approximately 0 12 l mj of diluent 3 3 hydrothermal liquefaction htl is a thermochemical conversion process that converts biomass to bio crude in the presence of large amounts of water toor et al 2014 during the process macromolecules are broken down into small molecules that are unstable and can recombine with a good portion of the oxygen present in the biomass being removed toor et al 2011 it is a method used to produce diluent and does so through medium temperature and high pressure reaction in a high concentration of water bio crude is its main product kumar et al 2017 2018a toor et al 2014 in hydrothermal liquefaction biomass is pumped to 18 mpa and passed through heat exchangers to increase the algal stream temperature to 350 c kumar et al 2017 at this temperature water exists slightly below the supercritical point which allows dissolution of biomass organics ou et al 2015 the incoming effluent is fed into the htl reactor which converts biomass components into bio crude the output from the htl reactor is filtered to obtain solid residue in the form of bio char the filtered effluent passes through a heat exchanger to recover heat before moving to a three phase separator unit to produce aqueous bio oil and gaseous phases zhu et al 2014 the bio crude undergoes hydrotreating where it is deoxygenated tews et al 2014 hydrothermal liquefaction happens at medium temperatures and high pressures and generates mainly the liquid product known as bio crude but also gases and an aqueous phase akhtar and amin 2011 in this study it is assumed that 2000 t dry basis of biomass is processed a diluent yield of 28600 kg hr was estimated on aspenplus for the htl case kumar et al 2018b since for htl no extra drying is necessary after cultivation the feedstock fed into the htl reactor is 20 dry content thus about 80 of the water can be recycled after the cooling and depressurization of the reaction effluents jones et al 2014 the remaining water is sent to a wastewater treatment plant the direct water footprint generated by htl is affected by the cooling system and the boiler feed water since these systems consume high amounts of water zhu et al 2014 show that the differences in water requirement for the cooling system and boiler feed are negligible regardless of feedstock and thus in this study we used their water consumption values for the cooling system and boiler feed htl also indirectly requires water for the electricity necessary to operate the equipment however electricity can be generated by burning the methane rich off gas and this energy can be used in the htl system thereby reducing indirect water consumption zhu et al 2014 table 4 shows the water requirements for htl of algae with the higher heating value hhv of diluent at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in plus the hydrotreating factors table 6 are considered and all their contributions are added the total water footprint from production of diluent through htl is approximately 0 20 l mj of diluent 3 4 upgrading of bio oil bio crude the bio oil and bio crude produced during fast pyrolysis and htl respectively go through the hydroprocessing phase to remove oxygen and increase the stability and heating values of the products which make them more attractive commercial options these reactions use hydrogen and a catalyst jones et al 2009 which contribute to the water footprint of the process due to the steam reforming involved in the production of hydrogen the most traditional hydroprocessing method is the one used to convert bio oil bio crude to biofuel which requires hydrotreating or hydrocracking depending on the thermochemical conversion pathway hsu 2012 patel and kumar 2016 singh and kumar 2011 singh et al 2014 wong et al 2016 however for the production of diluent only hydrotreating is required conditions for the hydrotreating of fast pyrolysis and htl products are slightly different since they have different characteristics the water requirements for the hydrotreating of bio oil generated through fast pyrolysis are shown in table 5 for upgrading bio crude from htl the body of knowledge is still limited studies have been conducted in this area are by elliott 2007 elliott et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 tews et al 2014 no large scale facility has been built for this purpose but the hydrotreating process for htl products is in theory simpler than the hydrotreating process for fast pyrolysis products since bio crude has a lower oxygen content than bio oil baker and elliott 1986 bio crude goes through only one hydrotreating step and requires less energy and reactant than the hydrotreating of bio oil zhu et al 2011 which requires two steps in the developed process model the hydrotreating of bio crude involves a reaction of hydrogen in a fixed bed reactor at temperatures around 400 c around 78 85 of the product has diluent properties the main parameters of the reaction are given in table 6 3 5 gasification the gasification of biomass is a thermochemical conversion process that converts feedstock into gaseous products through reactions in high temperatures up to 850 c and atmospheric pressure biomass enters the system at 5 10 moisture content oxygen or steam and a catalyst agent are also used in the reaction turn et al 1998 gases such as ch4 h2 co2 and co are produced from the gasification reaction as are tar and char the hydrogen concentration can be increased through reforming and shift conversion rapagnà et al 1998 in this study the estimated hydrogen yield through gasification is 6475 kg hr an earlier study of the gasification process and the current status of production and water use in a hydrogen plant gives details on losses due to blowdown and evaporation these losses are assumed to remain constant for the entire stream from drying to output of final product and are estimated to be around 2 2 of the flow spath et al 2005 the indirect water footprint from the electricity required to operate the equipment in the plant can be offset by the electricity generated in the steam plant which uses off gases from the gasification process it is estimated that of the approximately 35 mwe necessary to operate the facility only about 10 mwe need to be extracted from the grid the details of the water requirement for the different operations involved in the gasification of algae are provided in table 7 with the higher heating value hhv of hydrogen at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in table 7 are considered and their contributions are added the total water footprint from the production of hydrogen through gasification is approximately 0 19 l mj of hydrogen 3 6 hydrothermal gasification htg is a thermochemical conversion pathway that uses the benefits of supercritical conditions of water in a solution as a reactant making water itself a reaction partner to the feedstock first the bonds between the biomass macromolecules are broken through hydrolysis then new molecules are formed in the presence of a catalyst agent kruse 2009 the reaction normally happens at intermediate temperatures 300 410 c and high pressures 12 34 mpa while the biomass initial concentration remains between 10 and 30 wt waldner and vogel 2005 for this study it is assumed to be 20 wt after the cultivation phase generally the product yield syngas from htg is considerably higher than from gasification and in this case was estimated at 9285 kg hr syngas is then purified into h2 the syngas is cleaned using selexol and then sent to water gas shift reactors to enrich h2 a co generation facility for power generation is also commonly built with the htg plant fang and xu 2014 gasafi et al 2008 verma et al 2015 the co generation plant uses off gases from processing areas to produce electricity gasafi et al 2008 in terms of the direct water consumption it was assumed that the tar reforming and gas compression phases had footprints comparable to their counterparts in the gasification pathway the cooling system steam feed and htg reaction estimates are taken from matsumura whose study considers different types of biomass matsumura 2002 these values are assumed to have a negligible difference compared to those for algae biomass the indirect water footprint from electricity consumption was estimated through the developed process model for all the equipment necessary to run the plant interestingly the power generation possible in an htg facility is so high that it compensates for the power requirement of the entire plant making it possible to sell energy to the grid and consequently lead to a slightly negative water footprint in terms of the balance between electricity consumed and generated table 8 gives the details of the water requirement for different operations for the htg of algae with the higher heating value hhv of hydrogen at approximately 142 mj kg when all the factors shown in table 8 are considered and their contributions added the total water footprint from the production of hydrogen through htg is approximately 0 05 l mj of hydrogen 4 results and discussion base case scenarios were developed to understand the water footprints of each cultivation method coupled with each conversion pathway we compared algae cultivation methods and thermochemical conversion pathways according to their final results for the unit operations and the final water requirement for each base case scenario we then varied the values of some input variables within a specified range so that the most significant ones could be identified lastly an uncertainty analysis was conducted through a monte carlo simulation to estimate changes in results from the uncertainty of the inputs 4 1 base case scenario the base case scenarios give the details of individual unit operations biomass production and dewatering harvesting bio oil or bio crude production followed by hydrotreating fast pyrolysis or htl or hydrogen production gasification and htg different process unit operations for diluent production through fast pyrolysis and htl respectively are listed in tables 9 and 10 shows the results of water use efficiency for the unit operations in the production of hydrogen through gasification and htg respectively the difference in water consumption for algae cultivation compared to every other unit operation is huge in fact it is more than 99 of the total consumption whether ponds or pbrs are used hence any future system modelling aiming for lower water consumption rates must focus primarily on the cultivation side the results show much higher water consumption in the algae biomass derived from pond cultivation than from pbrs this was expected since photobioreactors offer a more controlled setting where evaporation is negligible waste through blowdown and harvest are also significantly lower in pbrs than in ponds on the other hand the water footprint of pbrs from electricity use is considerably higher than that of ponds this could be due to the high electrical demand for the equipment used in pbr cultivation i e lighting compressors etc the higher electricity consumption in pbrs however is not enough to compensate for the high water footprint from the cultivation of algae in ponds it is noticeable that the footprints of the thermochemical conversion methods are very small compared to the footprint of the cultivation phase this is because the standard for any thermochemical plant design includes many opportunities for water recycling and the concentration of algae in the solution that enters the plant is considerably higher than during cultivation it is clear from the results that water consumption mitigation steps are important in the algae thermochemical conversion life cycle work by yang et al suggests means of achieving some reduction goals and reducing water consumption by up to 80 yang et al 2011 some measures that could mitigate the water footprint of algae cultivation include designing a system that includes feedback piping to recycle water to other parts of the system and developing a more efficient system that does not require large amounts of water the electricity consumption is less than the electricity generated for hydrothermal gasification which causes a water footprint of 0 015 l h2o mj hydrogen this causes the water consumption footprint of htg to be lower than in the other thermochemical conversion pathways this is because the power generation of the hydrogen plant works in conjunction with the htg facility the water consumption footprint of gasification and htg is generally lower per unit of energy produced because the higher heating value of hydrogen 142 mj kg is much higher than that of diluent a low energy product of approximately 34 mj kg 4 2 other scenarios sensitivity analysis the effects of the main inputs and contributing factors on the study results were analyzed by introducing different scenarios within specified ranges table 11 list all the considered scenarios in this study for an analysis of ponds and pbrs figs 3 6 show the sensitivity analysis results for the four thermochemical conversion methods and two cultivation options the results presented in the base case scenarios clearly show that biomass cultivation is the unit operation with the highest water footprint in an order of magnitude of almost 1000 1 to any other variable therefore it makes sense that any sensitivity analysis should focus on cultivation parameter variations and their impacts in final outputs since large design changes to a system are not always practical weissman et al 1989 for this sensitivity analysis it was assumed that none of the input variations were below 10 or above 10 from the results it is noticeable that five inputs for ponds and five for pbrs were significant when varied by 10 only two areas did not change the results significantly media harvesting for ponds and harvest volume for pbrs almost all input variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis directly affect the results meaning that a positive variation to the input led to an increase in water footprint the only exceptions were the yield of the desired product and the yearly cultivation period for ponds unlike in ponds where water footprint related electricity consumption is minor the electricity consumption of pbrs is a matter of concern in fact the sensitivity analysis showed a minor contribution of the electricity consumption to the outcome of the water footprint in pbrs a variation of around 1 5 this variation might not be as high as the ones generated by some other inputs but it was significant enough to be considered in the uncertainty analysis 4 3 uncertainty analysis for this study an uncertainty analysis was conducted using a monte carlo simulation the simulation was done through a modelrisk software execution as described by habibi 2017 vose et al 2007 that randomly selected variables within the established range of 100000 iterations when the relationship between variables is known and there are uncertainties in both published and estimated information a triangular probability distribution is commonly adopted since in a distribution of this type the central value is estimated while the maximum and minimum values are fixed this distribution is used for every input considered in the uncertainty analysis the triangular distribution also assumes that the majority of the data is centered around the estimated value uncertainty is commonly estimated by identifying the significant inputs through sensitivity analyses and then assigning a suitable uncertainty to each based on the information available in this study significant inputs with known estimated uncertainty ranges were varied during the monte carlo simulation significant inputs with unknown uncertainty had ranges of 10 attributed to them table 12 shows the water use efficiency values for diluent from fast pyrolysis and htl at various percentiles table 13 shows the water use efficiency values for hydrogen from gasification and htg also at various percentiles the low deviation from the median of each case can be seen by calculating the difference between the median and the values on both extremes for a particular case for example for the fast pyrolysis of algae grown in ponds the deviations for the 5 and 95 extremes from the median are 9 81 and 10 88 respectively for the gasification of algae produced in photobioreactors the deviations for the 5 and 95 extremes from the median are 10 38 and 11 63 respectively with all the uncertainties in the variables considered in the monte carlo simulation the results on the 50 mark were very close to the results obtained in the base case scenarios there were some negligible deviations of a few percentile points from the original cases it is also noticeable from tables 12 and 13 that the spread of results is concentrated around the median therefore the results of this study for the base case scenarios can be considered accurate considering the uncertainty of the inputs used 5 conclusion water may be abundant in many locations but it is a very valuable resource since other uses of water take priority over biomass production it is important to reduce water consumption in this activity the cases of algae cultivation explored in this study present challenges considering the high amount of water used in the production of diluent and hydrogen the process that requires the most water is the cultivation phase which is responsible for more than 99 of consumption this study develops life cycle water footprints including the detailed unit operations involved in pathways the study also shows that a viable cultivation method based on photobioreactors uses less water than ponds to produce algae while pbrs are more expensive and complex than ponds they offer savings in water consumption nutrients and land required which could make them a feasible alternative in all pathways studied the water footprint for algae cultivated in pbrs was less than 25 of that for ponds the difference between different thermochemical conversion methods when the same cultivation method is considered tends to be small though not negligible the thermochemical conversion pathway with the lowest water footprint was htg with about 60 of the footprint of htl the one with highest footprint in the future with increasing demand from industry for products derived from biomass with a lower carbon footprint algae are one of the likeliest prospects some of the technologies discussed in this paper are still novel and can be improved on many levels economic resources required efficiency etc the results presented in this study will help others understand the resource allocation necessary for algae cultivation and processing which in turn will help to make better choices on areas to invest or formulate policy acknowledgements the authors are grateful to alberta innovates bio division aibio abi

19545,this study develops life cycle water footprints for the production of fuels and chemicals via thermochemical conversion of algae biomass this study is based on two methods of feedstock production ponds and photobioreactors pbrs and four conversion pathways fast pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction htl conventional gasification and hydrothermal gasification htg the results show the high fresh water requirement for algae production and the necessity to recycle harvested water or use alternative water sources to produce 1 kg of algae through ponds 1564 l of water are required when pbrs are used only 372 l water are required however the energy requirements for pbrs are about 30 times higher than for ponds from a final product perspective the pathway based on the gasification of algae biomass was the thermochemical conversion method that required the highest amount of water per mj produced mainly due to its low hydrogen yield followed by fast pyrolysis and htl on the other hand htg has the lowest water footprint mainly because the large amount of electricity generated as part of the process compensates for the electricity used by the system performance in all pathways can be improved through recycling channels keywords algae thermochemical conversion water footprint ponds photobioreactor life cycle assessment 1 introduction the water consumption of the entire life cycle of a product needs to be assessed because water is a scarce resource it is expected that in a few decades it will be challenging to meet basic human needs in terms of access to water for large proportions of the population jackson et al 2001 preserving natural habitats and systems is also very important and the removal of resources fundamental to these systems can be damaging postel and richter 2012 for these reasons it is important that agriculture and industrial processes do not threaten access to water in recent years studies have been conducted to measure the water footprint of many different crops gerbens leenes et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 furthermore as algae cultivation becomes more common it is also important to understand all the effects on the environment so that informed decisions on the possibility and scale of production can be made over the last few decades many different types of feedstocks have been studied as candidates for biomass sources in bioenergy production mckendry 2002a swana et al 2011 and the different characteristics in each offer a range of characteristics on the final product mckendry 2002b one feedstock that has attracted more interest of late is algae biomass mainly due to its unique properties and methods of production including via ponds and photobioreactors pbrs doucha et al 2005 jorquera et al 2010 pankratz et al 2017 ugwu et al 2008 one of the main resources required for alga production and to a lesser extent its processing is water dismukes et al 2008 pate et al 2011 depending on the geographical location of the production facility obtaining the minimum amount of water necessary to produce the biomass can be challenging and given the high volume required for algae cultivation the impact is generally considerable slade and bauen 2013 to reduce water use the possibility of recycling the water used during the algae life cycle yang et al 2011 or cultivating a species of alga in wastewater from municipal waste to lower the high water requirement during cultivation have been considered wang et al 2016 one important consideration regarding water consumption during algae production is to determine which cultivation method offers more advantages the most commonly used and better understood algae production in ponds or the relatively new technology that uses photobioreactors pbrs recent studies show that some types of pbrs can be economically competitive with ponds davis et al 2016 ozkan et al 2012 while there are several studies on the conversion of algae through thermochemical processes or transesterification to produce biofuel jonker and faaij 2013 nautiyal et al 2014 there are none on the conversion of algal biomass to diluent and very few on the production of hydrogen from algae through thermochemical conversion these are the two products of interest and in high demand by the oil sands and chemical industries in oil sands applications the chemicals namely diluent in the form of naphtha and paraffin are employed to reduce density and to liberate hydrocarbon molecules from bitumen rao and liu 2013 diluent broadly defined as a diluting agent is a substance that is added to viscous fluid to increase its flow diluents have a diverse range of applications from the drug industry ebino 1999 to the transportation of oil and bitumen extracted in the canadian oil sands alvarez et al 2009 hemmingsen et al 2005 the diluent helps in reducing the viscosity of bitumen to allow efficient transportation through pipeline miadonye et al 2001 in general they are natural gas condensates consisting of heavy oil components from lighter compounds but may have lighter fractions tipman et al 2001 diluent is composed of paraffinic hydrocarbons molecules anhorn and badakhshan 1994 mehrotra 1992 in this regard a liquid product from pyrolysis in the form of biodiluent has been patented pollard et al 2015 another patent highlights the use of methods for oil extraction using bitumen through fischer tropsch process tessel 2015 furthermore the properties of diluent in relation with naphtha condensates are comparable kumar et al 2017 the aim is to use renewable biomass to produce stabilized bio crude through htl and fast pyrolysis which would be employed as a diluent in oil sands applications hydrogen also versatile is used by the chemical metallurgical glass and electronics industries and has seen an increase in interest from the petroleum refining sector especially for the refining of heavy oils that contain high amounts of sulfur and hydrogen ramachandran and menon 1998 there are studies that explore the water footprint of biofuel production through different conversion pathways dominguez faus et al 2009 gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2011 yi wen and may 2013 gerbens leenes et al provide some details of the water footprint of biofuel production from algae gerbens leenes et al 2014 their study focuses on transesterification as the primary method of biomass conversion since alga and all its conversion pathways are receiving increased interest as possible environmentally friendly sources of biofuels and other products this study analyses the requirements of water an important resource for the sustainability of the production and thermochemical conversion of algae over the life cycle a case study for alberta a western canadian province is conducted in this paper the semi arid climate in most of the canadian provinces and the corresponding low volume of precipitation mbogga et al 2009 dictate that resource use must be well planned to guarantee proper biomass growth the overall objective of this paper is to analyse the life cycle water consumption of diluent and hydrogen production from algal biomass used as raw material the specific objectives are to develop a method to estimate the water footprint for diluent and hydrogen production from algal biomass for four different conversion pathways these thermochemical conversion methods that can be applied to algal biomass produced either through ponds or pbrs are o the production of diluent through fast pyrolysis and the hydrotreating of algae feedstock o the production of diluent through the hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrotreating of algae feedstock o the production of hydrogen through the gasification of algae feedstock and enrichment of syngas and o the production of hydrogen through the hydrothermal gasification htg of algae feedstock and enrichment of syngas conduct sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to study the changes resulting from variations in input parameters on the life cycle water footprints of diluent and hydrogen production from algae 2 method calculating the water footprint from the production of diluent and hydrogen from algal biomass involves an analysis of the life cycle of the biomass from well to tank which means all steps from resource acquisition for biomass cultivation to final production of chemicals of interest except their consumption the international organization for standardization suggests through their iso 14040 norms a life cycle assessment framework that consists of a goal and scope definition life cycle inventory and impact assessment and interpretation standardization 2006 first the goal and scope define the system boundaries of the cases that will be analyzed and include details on possible impacts negative or positive for industry or government the life cycle inventory is the part of the study in which all the information necessary for the analysis is assembled and all the input assumptions are made finally the computation and analysis permit the assessment of environmental impacts and a better interpretation of the results of the study this study adopts a functional unit of 1 mj of diluent for the fast pyrolysis and htl analyses and 1 mj of hydrogen for the gasification and htg analyses more specifically for the resource of interest in this study the results are presented in terms l of water mj of diluent or h2 in other words the functional unit is the amount of water required to produce 1 mj of the product of interest in a wheel to gate approach different base cases were established so that the importance of each variable in the final results could be measured once this was done an uncertainty analysis was conducted through a monte carlo simulation to determine the influence of uncertainties of some inputs on the results it is necessary to consider the unit operations involved in algal biomass production thermochemical conversion through fast pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction hydrothermal gasification or conventional gasification and hydrotreating to obtain diluent in the cases of fast pyrolysis and htl the basic unit operations for fast pyrolysis and htl are the production and dewatering of algal biomass drying for fast pyrolysis only and thermochemical conversion of the feedstock and hydrotreating to produce diluent the conversion pathway for fast pyrolysis is shown in fig 1 and for htl in fig 2 for gasification and htg the unit operations are cultivation and dewatering drying for gasification only and thermochemical conversion and hydrogen production the conversion pathway for thermal gasification and hydrothermal gasification is presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively in both fast pyrolysis and htg it is assumed that the cultivation and conversion facilities are closely located and that the impact of transportation between units is negligible this analysis uses data gathered from the literature on the cultivation and conversion of algal biomass and other types of biomass when case studies for algae are not conclusive information obtained from industry and information obtained through models developed by the authors in aspen plus aspen plus 2009 some key assumptions were made for the analysis conducted in this paper first it was assumed that the algae production facility capacity is 2000 dry tonnes of biomass per day this figure is used in earlier studies on large scale biomass based systems berndes 2002 moazami et al 2012 second the thermochemical conversion plants have the infrastructure to use everything that is produced as it becomes available third the production facilities and conversion plants are adjacent to each other and the impact of biomass transportation is negligible fourth the inoculum systems of ponds have a negligible contribution to the overall water consumption of the process fifth the electricity input to each stage of the process indirectly contributes to the overall water consumption since water is required for energy generation and last water loss due to evaporation in pbrs is negligible considering that pbrs are closed systems versus open ponds a water footprint assessment for algae cultivation was conducted for two options the first is the use of raceway ponds which is currently the most common method of algae cultivation and consists of a recirculation channel where the feedstock immersed in a liquid solution is guided through the channel thereby avoiding sedimentation chisti 2007 the other method is the use of photobioreactors pbrs an innovative technology in which biomass is cultivated in enclosed systems which increases the level of control the operator has over the parameters and makes it possible to maximize biomass production singh and sharma 2012 of the four thermochemical conversion pathways considered in this study two are for the production of diluent and two for hydrogen in this study the life cycle water footprint refers to both direct and indirect consumption of water during the processes used to produce algal biomass and to convert it to diluent or hydrogen direct consumption of water is defined as the total amount of water required during the entire biomass production phase and the subsequent thermochemical conversion processes such as losses due to evaporation or blowdown of water at the steam generation or cooling stages indirect consumption refers to the amount of water used during fertilizer production ammonia and diammonium phosphate in this case and electrical energy input for the various unit operations singh and kumar 2011 surface or ground water can be used as sources for both direct and indirect uses 3 water requirement inventory water requirements calculated in this inventory are categorized based on the unit operations that make up the entire production pathway of algal biomass to diluent or hydrogen 3 1 production of biomass this section presents the input parameters related to the production of algae feedstock for the two main methods of algae cultivation ponds and photobioreactors 3 1 1 ponds raceway ponds are very common in the algae facilities currently in operation chiaramonti et al 2013 hence there are many studies that explore in depth the operating conditions and production optimization methods in ponds borowitzka 1999 chiaramonti et al 2013 lee 2001 moheimani and borowitzka 2006 however most of the literature in this area concentrates on facilities built in warm locations with high solar radiation all year and generally good conditions for algae cultivation in an open air setting pankratz et al 2017 this study considers a pond facility in central alberta canada and assumes that production is limited to the warm months of the year approximately 175 days for ponds some of the main sources of water loss are transpiration and evaporation system blowdown and losses during harvesting and drying while some of these losses can be mitigated for example through water recycling feeds designed for the system evapo transpiration is a challenge in the dry climates and low precipitation rates in alberta mbogga et al 2009 hence water replacement rates may be relatively high in this cultivation method to estimate the average evaporation during summer it was assumed that summer conditions in alberta are similar to late spring early autumn in arizona where detailed data on algae cultivation are available so that an average evaporation rate can be adopted for this study the evaporation data from arizona were compared with data measured in the wabamun lake area in alberta hage 1978 for our study we assumed a large scale facility capable of producing 2000 t of dry algae day with the same basic characteristics of operation and production described in a recent study davis et al 2016 daily alga production is assumed to be 25 g m2 d in a facility divided into farms of 20 2 million m2 dedicated to pond cultivation only and a total footprint per farm including processing and storage of 30 8 million m2 a design with 400 000 m2 modules containing 50 raceway ponds of 8000 m2 each is also assumed the media in these ponds would be mixed by paddlewheels and the alga concentration kept at 0 1 g l or 0 01 wt an inoculum system is also part of the design its goal is to guarantee the production of a high concentration media for insertion into the ponds which maintains the culture at the desired concentration this inoculum system is negligible in size compared to the main system and does not account for a considerable percentage of the water consumption the data for the water footprint analysis of algae cultivation in ponds were acquired from multiple sources from industry partners to extensive studies of algae cultivation empirical data for what can be expected in alberta such as evaporation rate and number of days of harvest per year help more accurately estimate water requirement the calculated water footprint for the production of algae through ponds was 1564 l of water kg of algae the details of algae cultivation in raceway ponds as reported by davis et al 2016 or derived from their data are provided in table 1 it is also important to consider the water footprint of the electricity consumption of the facility in this case the highest energy consuming equipment are the pumps used to carry the algae solution through the ponds the paddlewheels used to stir the ponds and the drying apparatus used to increase the algae concentration to 20 dry weight before it is sent for thermochemical conversion the drying consists of pumps membranes for the first and most basic phase of the dewatering process and centrifuges that guarantee the desired 20 wt the water consumption factor is adopted based on data for alberta canada where most of the electricity generation is coal based for ponds the processes that require the highest amounts of water are the initial filling of the modules water loss to evaporation and blowdown 3 1 2 photobioreactors pbrs are a promising alternative to ponds however there is not much information available on them in the literature pbrs may be able to optimize algae production and resource allocation since they allow more control of the operating parameters such as temperature and light applied to the media chiaramonti et al 2013 they also require a smaller cultivation area than ponds for the same amount of algae produced pbrs can be designed and built in many different sizes for this study a tank size of 6800 l and a daily production of 20 kg of algae like the one used by hy tek bio was assumed this design consists of a hollow tank that has an airlift system to help with the mixture of the media singh and sharma 2012 with a bubble sparging mechanism containing co2 for the photosynthesis process the algae concentration in a system of this type is assumed to be between 3 and 5 g l up to 50 times higher than in ponds because of the scarcity of data available on this equipment a consistent set of parameters provided by industry was used and validated with data from various studies chen et al 2011 li et al 2007 rodolfi et al 2009 the same assumptions were made for pbrs as for a pond producing 2000 t of algae per day pbrs have negligible losses to evaporation since the culture remains in an enclosed space isolated from the environment other losses i e water loss during harvesting can be mitigated through systems controls as expected the water footprint for the cultivation of algae via pbrs is considerably lower than that for ponds pbrs consume only 25 l of water kg of algae produced table 2 gives the details of the basic operational data for algae cultivation in pbrs in terms of electricity consumption pbrs require considerably more energy than ponds davis et al 2016 watanabe and hall 1996 this is due to the equipment necessary for the proper functioning of the system such as the compressors to regulate the pressure and the many led lamps that both transmit light and provide heat to the culture at all times of the day this equipment would allow the cultivation of algae year round even in cold winter climates like alberta s the pbr algae cultivation processes that require the most water are the initial filling of the tanks replacement of blowdown water and electricity generation 3 2 fast pyrolysis fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion method commonly used to convert biomass to bio oil it is a thermal decomposition process that occurs in high temperatures in the absence of oxygen in 0 5 10 s flash pyrolysis lasts less than 0 5 s and conventional pyrolysis takes 5 10 min fast pyrolysis yields relatively high amounts of bio oil demirbas 2008 patel et al 2016 in this method biomass is dried to a moisture content of 10 to decrease the water content in the fast pyrolysis bio oil wright et al 2010 biomass feedstock that only goes through dewatering leaves the cultivation facility with approximately 20 wt dry biomass and must go through extra drying before being fed into the fast pyrolysis reactor feedstock with a moisture content of 5 10 wt is preferred for fast pyrolysis bridgwater et al 1999 other important parameters in the pyrolysis reaction are particle size temperature pressure and residence time once prepared the dried biomass is sent to a fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor at 520 c jones et al 2009 with particles smaller than 2 mm following reaction bio char is removed by cyclones resulting in a bio oil yield of approximately 59 9 wt dry basis depending on the feedstock ringer et al 2006 for this study a yield of 26130 kg hr was estimated using process model kumar et al 2018b the fast pyrolysis values related to the water footprint generated by the cooling ash quenching steam condensing and steam producing processes are extracted from the literature given that there is no significant difference in water requirement for this equipment no matter which feedstock is used most of the water used in these processes is recycled but there is an estimated loss of 3 due to factors such as blowdown and evaporation steam condensing is the main contributor to the water footprint ringer et al 2006 water is indirectly consumed through the generation of the electricity necessary to operate the plant during pre treatment and pyrolysis for the fast pyrolysis of algae a process model was developed in aspen plus to estimate the entire plant s electricity consumption and generation and the results for water requirements for algal pyrolysis are provided in table 3 with the higher heating value hhv of diluent at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in plus the hydrotreating factors table 5 are considered and all their contributions are added the total water footprint from the production of diluent through fast pyrolysis is approximately 0 12 l mj of diluent 3 3 hydrothermal liquefaction htl is a thermochemical conversion process that converts biomass to bio crude in the presence of large amounts of water toor et al 2014 during the process macromolecules are broken down into small molecules that are unstable and can recombine with a good portion of the oxygen present in the biomass being removed toor et al 2011 it is a method used to produce diluent and does so through medium temperature and high pressure reaction in a high concentration of water bio crude is its main product kumar et al 2017 2018a toor et al 2014 in hydrothermal liquefaction biomass is pumped to 18 mpa and passed through heat exchangers to increase the algal stream temperature to 350 c kumar et al 2017 at this temperature water exists slightly below the supercritical point which allows dissolution of biomass organics ou et al 2015 the incoming effluent is fed into the htl reactor which converts biomass components into bio crude the output from the htl reactor is filtered to obtain solid residue in the form of bio char the filtered effluent passes through a heat exchanger to recover heat before moving to a three phase separator unit to produce aqueous bio oil and gaseous phases zhu et al 2014 the bio crude undergoes hydrotreating where it is deoxygenated tews et al 2014 hydrothermal liquefaction happens at medium temperatures and high pressures and generates mainly the liquid product known as bio crude but also gases and an aqueous phase akhtar and amin 2011 in this study it is assumed that 2000 t dry basis of biomass is processed a diluent yield of 28600 kg hr was estimated on aspenplus for the htl case kumar et al 2018b since for htl no extra drying is necessary after cultivation the feedstock fed into the htl reactor is 20 dry content thus about 80 of the water can be recycled after the cooling and depressurization of the reaction effluents jones et al 2014 the remaining water is sent to a wastewater treatment plant the direct water footprint generated by htl is affected by the cooling system and the boiler feed water since these systems consume high amounts of water zhu et al 2014 show that the differences in water requirement for the cooling system and boiler feed are negligible regardless of feedstock and thus in this study we used their water consumption values for the cooling system and boiler feed htl also indirectly requires water for the electricity necessary to operate the equipment however electricity can be generated by burning the methane rich off gas and this energy can be used in the htl system thereby reducing indirect water consumption zhu et al 2014 table 4 shows the water requirements for htl of algae with the higher heating value hhv of diluent at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in plus the hydrotreating factors table 6 are considered and all their contributions are added the total water footprint from production of diluent through htl is approximately 0 20 l mj of diluent 3 4 upgrading of bio oil bio crude the bio oil and bio crude produced during fast pyrolysis and htl respectively go through the hydroprocessing phase to remove oxygen and increase the stability and heating values of the products which make them more attractive commercial options these reactions use hydrogen and a catalyst jones et al 2009 which contribute to the water footprint of the process due to the steam reforming involved in the production of hydrogen the most traditional hydroprocessing method is the one used to convert bio oil bio crude to biofuel which requires hydrotreating or hydrocracking depending on the thermochemical conversion pathway hsu 2012 patel and kumar 2016 singh and kumar 2011 singh et al 2014 wong et al 2016 however for the production of diluent only hydrotreating is required conditions for the hydrotreating of fast pyrolysis and htl products are slightly different since they have different characteristics the water requirements for the hydrotreating of bio oil generated through fast pyrolysis are shown in table 5 for upgrading bio crude from htl the body of knowledge is still limited studies have been conducted in this area are by elliott 2007 elliott et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 tews et al 2014 no large scale facility has been built for this purpose but the hydrotreating process for htl products is in theory simpler than the hydrotreating process for fast pyrolysis products since bio crude has a lower oxygen content than bio oil baker and elliott 1986 bio crude goes through only one hydrotreating step and requires less energy and reactant than the hydrotreating of bio oil zhu et al 2011 which requires two steps in the developed process model the hydrotreating of bio crude involves a reaction of hydrogen in a fixed bed reactor at temperatures around 400 c around 78 85 of the product has diluent properties the main parameters of the reaction are given in table 6 3 5 gasification the gasification of biomass is a thermochemical conversion process that converts feedstock into gaseous products through reactions in high temperatures up to 850 c and atmospheric pressure biomass enters the system at 5 10 moisture content oxygen or steam and a catalyst agent are also used in the reaction turn et al 1998 gases such as ch4 h2 co2 and co are produced from the gasification reaction as are tar and char the hydrogen concentration can be increased through reforming and shift conversion rapagnà et al 1998 in this study the estimated hydrogen yield through gasification is 6475 kg hr an earlier study of the gasification process and the current status of production and water use in a hydrogen plant gives details on losses due to blowdown and evaporation these losses are assumed to remain constant for the entire stream from drying to output of final product and are estimated to be around 2 2 of the flow spath et al 2005 the indirect water footprint from the electricity required to operate the equipment in the plant can be offset by the electricity generated in the steam plant which uses off gases from the gasification process it is estimated that of the approximately 35 mwe necessary to operate the facility only about 10 mwe need to be extracted from the grid the details of the water requirement for the different operations involved in the gasification of algae are provided in table 7 with the higher heating value hhv of hydrogen at approximately 34 mj kg when all the factors shown in table 7 are considered and their contributions are added the total water footprint from the production of hydrogen through gasification is approximately 0 19 l mj of hydrogen 3 6 hydrothermal gasification htg is a thermochemical conversion pathway that uses the benefits of supercritical conditions of water in a solution as a reactant making water itself a reaction partner to the feedstock first the bonds between the biomass macromolecules are broken through hydrolysis then new molecules are formed in the presence of a catalyst agent kruse 2009 the reaction normally happens at intermediate temperatures 300 410 c and high pressures 12 34 mpa while the biomass initial concentration remains between 10 and 30 wt waldner and vogel 2005 for this study it is assumed to be 20 wt after the cultivation phase generally the product yield syngas from htg is considerably higher than from gasification and in this case was estimated at 9285 kg hr syngas is then purified into h2 the syngas is cleaned using selexol and then sent to water gas shift reactors to enrich h2 a co generation facility for power generation is also commonly built with the htg plant fang and xu 2014 gasafi et al 2008 verma et al 2015 the co generation plant uses off gases from processing areas to produce electricity gasafi et al 2008 in terms of the direct water consumption it was assumed that the tar reforming and gas compression phases had footprints comparable to their counterparts in the gasification pathway the cooling system steam feed and htg reaction estimates are taken from matsumura whose study considers different types of biomass matsumura 2002 these values are assumed to have a negligible difference compared to those for algae biomass the indirect water footprint from electricity consumption was estimated through the developed process model for all the equipment necessary to run the plant interestingly the power generation possible in an htg facility is so high that it compensates for the power requirement of the entire plant making it possible to sell energy to the grid and consequently lead to a slightly negative water footprint in terms of the balance between electricity consumed and generated table 8 gives the details of the water requirement for different operations for the htg of algae with the higher heating value hhv of hydrogen at approximately 142 mj kg when all the factors shown in table 8 are considered and their contributions added the total water footprint from the production of hydrogen through htg is approximately 0 05 l mj of hydrogen 4 results and discussion base case scenarios were developed to understand the water footprints of each cultivation method coupled with each conversion pathway we compared algae cultivation methods and thermochemical conversion pathways according to their final results for the unit operations and the final water requirement for each base case scenario we then varied the values of some input variables within a specified range so that the most significant ones could be identified lastly an uncertainty analysis was conducted through a monte carlo simulation to estimate changes in results from the uncertainty of the inputs 4 1 base case scenario the base case scenarios give the details of individual unit operations biomass production and dewatering harvesting bio oil or bio crude production followed by hydrotreating fast pyrolysis or htl or hydrogen production gasification and htg different process unit operations for diluent production through fast pyrolysis and htl respectively are listed in tables 9 and 10 shows the results of water use efficiency for the unit operations in the production of hydrogen through gasification and htg respectively the difference in water consumption for algae cultivation compared to every other unit operation is huge in fact it is more than 99 of the total consumption whether ponds or pbrs are used hence any future system modelling aiming for lower water consumption rates must focus primarily on the cultivation side the results show much higher water consumption in the algae biomass derived from pond cultivation than from pbrs this was expected since photobioreactors offer a more controlled setting where evaporation is negligible waste through blowdown and harvest are also significantly lower in pbrs than in ponds on the other hand the water footprint of pbrs from electricity use is considerably higher than that of ponds this could be due to the high electrical demand for the equipment used in pbr cultivation i e lighting compressors etc the higher electricity consumption in pbrs however is not enough to compensate for the high water footprint from the cultivation of algae in ponds it is noticeable that the footprints of the thermochemical conversion methods are very small compared to the footprint of the cultivation phase this is because the standard for any thermochemical plant design includes many opportunities for water recycling and the concentration of algae in the solution that enters the plant is considerably higher than during cultivation it is clear from the results that water consumption mitigation steps are important in the algae thermochemical conversion life cycle work by yang et al suggests means of achieving some reduction goals and reducing water consumption by up to 80 yang et al 2011 some measures that could mitigate the water footprint of algae cultivation include designing a system that includes feedback piping to recycle water to other parts of the system and developing a more efficient system that does not require large amounts of water the electricity consumption is less than the electricity generated for hydrothermal gasification which causes a water footprint of 0 015 l h2o mj hydrogen this causes the water consumption footprint of htg to be lower than in the other thermochemical conversion pathways this is because the power generation of the hydrogen plant works in conjunction with the htg facility the water consumption footprint of gasification and htg is generally lower per unit of energy produced because the higher heating value of hydrogen 142 mj kg is much higher than that of diluent a low energy product of approximately 34 mj kg 4 2 other scenarios sensitivity analysis the effects of the main inputs and contributing factors on the study results were analyzed by introducing different scenarios within specified ranges table 11 list all the considered scenarios in this study for an analysis of ponds and pbrs figs 3 6 show the sensitivity analysis results for the four thermochemical conversion methods and two cultivation options the results presented in the base case scenarios clearly show that biomass cultivation is the unit operation with the highest water footprint in an order of magnitude of almost 1000 1 to any other variable therefore it makes sense that any sensitivity analysis should focus on cultivation parameter variations and their impacts in final outputs since large design changes to a system are not always practical weissman et al 1989 for this sensitivity analysis it was assumed that none of the input variations were below 10 or above 10 from the results it is noticeable that five inputs for ponds and five for pbrs were significant when varied by 10 only two areas did not change the results significantly media harvesting for ponds and harvest volume for pbrs almost all input variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis directly affect the results meaning that a positive variation to the input led to an increase in water footprint the only exceptions were the yield of the desired product and the yearly cultivation period for ponds unlike in ponds where water footprint related electricity consumption is minor the electricity consumption of pbrs is a matter of concern in fact the sensitivity analysis showed a minor contribution of the electricity consumption to the outcome of the water footprint in pbrs a variation of around 1 5 this variation might not be as high as the ones generated by some other inputs but it was significant enough to be considered in the uncertainty analysis 4 3 uncertainty analysis for this study an uncertainty analysis was conducted using a monte carlo simulation the simulation was done through a modelrisk software execution as described by habibi 2017 vose et al 2007 that randomly selected variables within the established range of 100000 iterations when the relationship between variables is known and there are uncertainties in both published and estimated information a triangular probability distribution is commonly adopted since in a distribution of this type the central value is estimated while the maximum and minimum values are fixed this distribution is used for every input considered in the uncertainty analysis the triangular distribution also assumes that the majority of the data is centered around the estimated value uncertainty is commonly estimated by identifying the significant inputs through sensitivity analyses and then assigning a suitable uncertainty to each based on the information available in this study significant inputs with known estimated uncertainty ranges were varied during the monte carlo simulation significant inputs with unknown uncertainty had ranges of 10 attributed to them table 12 shows the water use efficiency values for diluent from fast pyrolysis and htl at various percentiles table 13 shows the water use efficiency values for hydrogen from gasification and htg also at various percentiles the low deviation from the median of each case can be seen by calculating the difference between the median and the values on both extremes for a particular case for example for the fast pyrolysis of algae grown in ponds the deviations for the 5 and 95 extremes from the median are 9 81 and 10 88 respectively for the gasification of algae produced in photobioreactors the deviations for the 5 and 95 extremes from the median are 10 38 and 11 63 respectively with all the uncertainties in the variables considered in the monte carlo simulation the results on the 50 mark were very close to the results obtained in the base case scenarios there were some negligible deviations of a few percentile points from the original cases it is also noticeable from tables 12 and 13 that the spread of results is concentrated around the median therefore the results of this study for the base case scenarios can be considered accurate considering the uncertainty of the inputs used 5 conclusion water may be abundant in many locations but it is a very valuable resource since other uses of water take priority over biomass production it is important to reduce water consumption in this activity the cases of algae cultivation explored in this study present challenges considering the high amount of water used in the production of diluent and hydrogen the process that requires the most water is the cultivation phase which is responsible for more than 99 of consumption this study develops life cycle water footprints including the detailed unit operations involved in pathways the study also shows that a viable cultivation method based on photobioreactors uses less water than ponds to produce algae while pbrs are more expensive and complex than ponds they offer savings in water consumption nutrients and land required which could make them a feasible alternative in all pathways studied the water footprint for algae cultivated in pbrs was less than 25 of that for ponds the difference between different thermochemical conversion methods when the same cultivation method is considered tends to be small though not negligible the thermochemical conversion pathway with the lowest water footprint was htg with about 60 of the footprint of htl the one with highest footprint in the future with increasing demand from industry for products derived from biomass with a lower carbon footprint algae are one of the likeliest prospects some of the technologies discussed in this paper are still novel and can be improved on many levels economic resources required efficiency etc the results presented in this study will help others understand the resource allocation necessary for algae cultivation and processing which in turn will help to make better choices on areas to invest or formulate policy acknowledgements the authors are grateful to alberta innovates bio division aibio abi

19546,charge transfer and mass transport are two underlying mechanisms which are coupled in desalination dynamics using capacitive deionization cdi we developed simple reduced order models based on a mixed reactor volume principle which capture the coupled dynamics of cdi operation using closed form semi analytical and analytical solutions we use the models to identify and explore self similarities in the dynamics among flow rate current and voltage for cdi cell operation including both charging and discharging cycles the similarity approach identifies the specific combination of cell e g capacitance resistance and operational parameters e g flow rate current which determine a unique effluent dynamic response we here demonstrate self similarity using a conventional flow between cdi fbcdi architecture and we hypothesize that our similarity approach has potential application to a wide range of designs we performed an experimental study of these dynamics and used well controlled experiments of cdi cell operation to validate and explore limits of the model for experiments we used a cdi cell with five electrode pairs and a standard flow between electrodes architecture guided by the model we performed a series of experiments that demonstrate natural response of the cdi system we also identify cell parameters and operation conditions which lead to self similar dynamics under a constant current forcing function and perform a series of experiments by varying flowrate currents and voltage thresholds to demonstrate self similarity based on this study we hypothesize that the average differential electric double layer edl efficiency a measure of ion adsorption rate to edl charging rate is mainly dependent on user defined voltage thresholds whereas flow efficiency measure of how well desalinated water is recovered from inside the cell depends on cell volumes flowed during charging which is determined by flowrate current and voltage thresholds results of experiments strongly support this hypothesis results show that cycle efficiency and salt removal for a given flowrate and current are maximum when average edl and flow efficiencies are approximately equal we further explored a range of cc operations with varying flowrates currents and voltage thresholds using our similarity variables to highlight trade offs among salt removal energy and throughput performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization water desalination reduced order model self similarity porous carbon electrodes performance optimization 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technology that has potential to efficiently treat brackish water salt content of 1 10 g l oren 2008 suss et al 2015 in cdi the ions in solution are sequestered into electric double layers within the porous electrodes leaving water with lower salt content to be flushed from the cell cdi performance is known to be significantly affected by operating conditions such as source voltage current electrode dimensions cell resistance and capacitance flowrate and feed concentration kim and yoon 2014 wang and lin 2018 r zhao et al 2013a r zhao et al 2013b cdi electrical charging results in simultaneous adsorption of counter ions and desorption of co ions avraham et al 2009 hence dynamics associated with electric double layer edl charge efficiency plays an important role in salt removal and regeneration using cdi zhao et al 2010 biesheuvel et al 2009 developed a dynamic model for cdi to predict desalination dynamics using both gouy chapmann stern gcs theory and a mixed flow reactor i e continuously stirred tank reactor or cstr model for salt removal and the study validated the model including effluent salt dynamics with constant voltage cv operation experiments subsequently biesheuvel and bazant 2010 developed a non linear mean field theory for capacitive charging and discharging using ideal porous electrodes and identified limiting time scales in cdi desalination dynamics biesheuvel and bazant 2010 described the importance of operation in the desalination regime corresponding to large voltages compared to the thermal voltage for achieving practical amounts of salt removal thus highlighting the role of careful choice of voltage limits for desalination jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 developed simple dynamic response models with analytical solutions to describe time variation of effluent concentration under constant current cc charging however jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 neglected dynamics associated with edls which was shown to play an important role in desalination as highlighted in earlier works biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 later hemmatifar et al 2015 developed a high fidelity two dimensional porous electrode model for flow between cdi fbcdi which was solved computationally and validated experimentally hemmatifar et al 2015 highlighted several underlying physical mechanisms including depletion in electrodes and diffusion in spacer within the cdi cell during electrical charging and discharging similar modeling efforts have recently been carried out for flow through electrode ftecdi cdi systems guyes et al 2017 developed a simple one dimensional model for an ftecdi architecture and highlighted the importance of developing simple engineering models for cdi operation in addition a recent work qu et al 2018 on ftecdi used a hierarchy of simple to complex models to study the interplay between charging and transport dynamics in cdi most existing models and analyses for cdi discussed earlier have been either overly simple e g neglecting edl dynamics considering only charging phase or not involving dynamic steady state conditions or overly complex in scope to clearly highlight general scaling and self similar behavior for example mixed reactor models assuming a constant edl efficiency irrespective of operation jande and kim 2013 or which do not separate the effects of flow efficiency and edl efficiency biesheuvel et al 2009 do not capture the underlying trade offs in desalination performance when operated with varying values of flowrate to current ratio and voltage windows two of the parameters leading to similarity highlighted in our work more comprehensive models such as the numerical two dimensional fbcdi model of hemmatifar et al 2015 and the one dimensional ftecdi model of guyes et al 2017 enable greater and perhaps higher fidelity spatiotemporal information but these are difficult to probe to clearly identify key parameters describing the trade offs among desalination depth energy and throughput in cdi here we aim to capture the essential governing dynamics and identify controllable parameters for tuning desalination performance using cdi we focus our study on cc charge discharge operation since it is energy efficient kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 and has better energy recovery han et al 2015 kang et al 2016 however results of our study can be extended and are applicable to other operations we first extend a volume averaged model for the cdi charging discharging process based on mixed flow reactor type theory first introduced by biesheuvel et al 2009 in addition to bulk electro migration transport and edl dynamics our model also accounts for faradaic losses at the electrode surfaces and considers non zero potential of zero charge we next simplify the model based on practical considerations and derive reduced order models with closed form semi analytical and analytical solutions to evaluate desalination performance of cdi under various cc conditions specifically we obtain expressions for cycle average and time variation of edl efficiency in addition to time variation of effluent concentration jande and kim 2013 and flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 all under dynamic steady state dss conditions we identify the natural and cc forced responses of a cdi cell and its governing parameters and demonstrate self similar effluent concentration profiles across a wide range of time average edl and flow efficiencies we performed an experimental study to validate our models and study the interplay between flow and edl efficiencies in determining overall cycle efficiency and salt removal for cc cdi operation with varying voltage thresholds to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to identify self similarity in cdi desalination dynamics i e identification of variables describing cell parameters and operational conditions which result in a unique temporal response for cdi cells for the first time we identify the unique value of these variables that give rise to optimum values of salt removal given realistic constraints this includes precisely quantifying trade offs among salt removal energy consumption and degree of desalination 2 theory 2 1 gcs based dynamic model numerical in this section we describe a simple dynamic model in which we apply a mixed reactor type formulation of the form first used by biesheuvelet al 2009 for cdi cells the model includes electrical double layer edl charge efficiency effects on salt removal and electro migration effects the model assumes a symmetric and binary univalent salt with constant inlet concentration and neglects diffusive transport under these assumptions mass balance for salt is given by 1 d c d t q c 0 c φ salt where is the volume of flow compartment c and c 0 are effluent and influent salt concentration respectively q is the volumetric flowrate and φ salt is the cell volume averaged salt adsorption rate charge transport from solution to the electrodes is modeled using the idea of an ohmic mass transport layer the potential drop across the mass transport layer δ ϕ m t l relates to electronic charging current density j c h supplied by external power source with units of amp m2 through a mass transport coefficient g as 2 j c h g c f δ ϕ m t l where f is the faraday s constant physically g units of μ m s can be interpreted as inverse effective and approximate resistance of the solution within the cell volume further we use a gouy chapman stern gcs edl model and assume that the electrode pairs have the same area and edl structure except for equal but opposite sign in the electrode potential in the gcs model zhao et al 2010 the ionic surface charge density of edl σ is given by 3 σ 4 λ d c sinh δ ϕ d 2 where λ d 8 π c n a v λ b 1 2 is the debye length n a v is the avogadro s number λ b e 2 4 π ε k t is the bjerrum length and δ ϕ d is the potential drop across the diffuse layer in addition w the number of ions removed per unit internal electrode area a is given by 4 w 8 λ d c sinh 2 δ ϕ d 4 the potential drop in the stern layer δ ϕ s t is related to the surface charge density as 5 σ f c s t δ ϕ s t v t where c s t is the specific stern layer capacity per internal electrode area and v t is the thermal voltage used to obtain non dimensional voltages δ ϕ m t l δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s t we define the total capacitive voltage difference in the cdi cell circuit δ ϕ c a p which is distributed between the stern layer and the diffuse layer at the two electrodes as 6 δ ϕ c a p 2 δ ϕ d δ ϕ s t unlike the model of biesheuvelet al 2009 we will here consider two modifications to the mixed reactor type formulation first in addition to the ohmic mass transport layer we consider an external resistance for the cdi cell which accounts for resistance due to material wiring and contacts second and importantly we here consider effects of coulombic efficiency due to leakage currents coulombic efficiency is defined as the ratio of applied instantaneous electric current to the rate of adsorption of ionic charge into edls these two charge per time quantities differ because charge is consumed by faradaic charge transfer reactions often described as leakage current the instantaneous coulombic efficiency λ c is defined as the ratio of ionic current density to the applied electronic current density λ c j i o n j c h the ionic current density which can contribute toward salt removal j i o n can therefore be written as 7 j i o n j c h j l λ c j c h where j l is the voltage dependent leakage current density this leakage is typically estimated using a butler volmer biesheuvel et al 2011 or tafel qu et al 2016 equation in our work for simplicity we will account for such faradaic losses using an effective cycle averaged value for coulombic efficiency see eq 26 and hawks et al 2018 obtained from experiments in cdi electronic charge at electrode surfaces is balanced by both attraction of counter ions and repulsion of co ions biesheuvel 2009 cohen et al 2011 at low potentials across edls and for symmetric electrolytes the attraction and repulsion of ions is approximately equal at each electrode and so accumulated charge results in no removal of salt defined as anion and cation pairs hence we define a differential edl charge efficiency λ d l as the fraction of ionic current density which contributes toward salt removal as 8 λ d l f j salt j i o n f j salt λ c j c h d w d σ tanh δ ϕ d 2 note that our definition of differential edl charge efficiency in eq 8 accounts for faradaic losses unlike the formulation in biesheuvel 2009 eq 8 also assumes that the time scale associated with charge redistribution in the edl is much smaller than that of concentration changes in the bulk hence the salt adsorption rate in eq 1 is related to the ionic current density through differential edl charge and columbic efficiencies as 9 φ salt a j salt a j i o n λ d l f a j c h λ c λ d l f where j salt is the salt removal flux units of mol m2 s and a is the projected electrode area we next account for an effective non zero potential of zero charge v pzc due to the presence of native charges on the electrodes since a significant non zero value of v pzc can affect desalination performance of the cdi cell avraham et al 2011 the external cell voltage v c e l l is distributed among the resistive v r e s and capacitive v c a p potentials and v pzc as 10 v c e l l i r 2 v t δ ϕ m t l 2 v t δ ϕ d δ ϕ s t v p z c v r e s v c a p v p z c where i j c h a is current supplied by the external power source finally the rate of change of charge density at the electrodes is determined by the ionic current density to the double layer as 11 d σ f a 2 d t a j i o n eqs 1 11 close our model for cdi operation and form a dynamical system which couples salt removal and charge transfer mechanisms this constitutes two coupled ordinary differential equations ode eqs 1 and 11 for respectively effluent concentration and charge which we solve numerically we will hereafter refer to this as the numerical model 2 2 simplified model with time varying edl efficiency semi analytical here we consider reduction of the model of the previous section for dss condition and cc operation so that we can more easily explore the self similarities in response and dynamics our goal is to identify specific combinations of cdi cell and operational parameters which result in a unique dynamic response we will refer to these combinations as variables required for similarity further we will show that fixing these combinations of variables ensures that many effluent concentration versus time responses of many different cells and operations collapse to the same solution which we call self similarity in the response to this end first we rewrite the salt conservation eq 1 in terms of δ c c 0 c as 12 d δ c d t τ δ c natural response i λ t τ f q forcing function where τ q represents the residence time scale and parentheses indicate a function of the left hand side captures the natural response dynamics and the right hand side represents a forcing function here cc operation the dynamic charge efficiency λ t τ in eq 12 can be written as a product of coulombic and differential edl efficiencies as 13 λ t τ λ d l t τ λ c t τ as a simplification we will assume like hawks et al 2018 that the coulombic efficiency can be approximated by an effective constant value i e λ c t τ λ c this effective value reflects faradaic type losses through the entire charge and discharge cycle see eq 26 and si section s1 for further discussion to provide a simplified approximation of λ d l t τ and couple the external applied current to salt transport we treat the electrical response of the cdi cell using a nonlinear resistive and capacitive circuit which is mathematically equivalent to the dynamic gcs model discussed in section 2 1 see si section s1 for complete discussion we assume that the effective series resistance does not change significantly during a cycle as typical of cdi operation e g see hemmatifar et al 2016 further we assume that the total diffuse c d stern c s t and equivalent c e q capacitances are nearly constant during a cc operation and are related by 14 1 c e q 1 c d 1 c s t using eq 14 for dss operation we derive the edl efficiency during the charging phase as 15 λ d l t τ tanh 2 v t c d i t q τ c e q 2 v t c d v min v p z c i r e q and for the discharge phase we obtain 16 λ d l t τ tanh 2 v t c d i t q τ c e q 2 v t c d v max v p z c i r e q where v min and v max are the minimum and maximum external cell voltages and r e q is the effective series resistance in eqs 15 and 16 t 0 corresponds to the start of the charging and discharging respectively we present further details around this derivation and estimation of the capacitances in the si section s2 we benchmarked the current reduced order model with the more complete numerical model described in section 2 1 see si section s2 eqs 12 16 represent a closed form model for effluent concentration for cc operation of cdi under dss conditions for this model the cdi cell parameters are c e q r e q c s t and v p z c and the operational parameters are q i v min and v max the model presented in this section constitutes a reduction of the two coupled odes of the preceding section to a single ode for effluent concentration δ c eq 12 this simple ode model predicts that the effluent concentration and that the behavior will be self similar given the following variables i constant values of the flowrate to current ratio q i ii time dynamics normalized by the residence flow time scale i e t τ and iii equal values of modified low and high voltage values of the form v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q respectively we refer to i ii and iii as the three variables which result in self similar dynamic response of cc operation of a cdi cell in the si section s6 5 we mention a few other studies hawks et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2016 johnson and newman 1971 qu et al 2018a who have touched on some of these variables but have not identified the set required for unique responses finally although the model described here results in a single ode for δ c in time eq 12 we cannot find an analytical expression for δ c t eqs 12 16 need to be solved numerically and hence we refer to this reduced order model with time varying edl efficiency as a semi analytical model 2 3 simplified model with effective cycle edl efficiency analytical we here explore a further simplification of our model for cc operation which can be used to obtain a closed form analytical expression for effluent concentration versus time for full cdi operation over charge and discharge cycles using an approach similar to jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 we assume a constant effective value of edl efficiency λ d l this assumption enables an analytical solution to eq 12 using an ad hoc value for λ d l under this assumption eq 12 becomes 17 d δ c d t τ δ c i λ c λ d l f q instead of choosing an ad hoc value for λ d l as done in previous works e g from curve fitting or assuming λ d l 1 we choose λ d l to be equal to the time average edl efficiency during cyclic operation to close our model in eq 17 we average eqs 15 and 16 in time to derive the time average edl efficiency during an entire charge and discharge cycle as 18 λ d l t c h λ d l t d i s c h log cosh α max log cosh α min α max α min λ d l where λ d l t c h and λ d l t d i s c h denote the average differential edl efficiency during the charging and discharging phases and α max 1 c e q c s t v max v p z c i r e q 2 v t and α min 1 c e q c s t v min v p z c i r e q 2 v t in eq 18 the charging and discharging time can be estimated from the rc circuit analogy see si sections s1 and s2 for charging a capacitor with capacitance c e q using a current i and operated within a voltage window of δ v the charging time is given by c e q δ v i thus we obtain the charging discharging time in eq 18 as 19 t c h τ t d i s c h τ c e q q i v max v p z c i r e q v min v p z c i r e q c e q q i δ v where δ v v h i g h v l o w and we have assumed that λ c is close to unity eq 18 represents a closed form algebraic expression for the effective differential edl efficiency in a cycle resulting in salt removal and regeneration under cc operation the expression 18 is particularly useful in highlighting key non dimensional parameters in cdi cell operation these are the ratio of the reduced operational voltages v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q and v l o w v min v p z c i r e q to the thermal voltage and the ratio of the stern capacitance to the equivalent capacitance further eq 18 also predicts that the average edl efficiency in a cycle is strongly dependent on the reduced operational voltages i e λ d l λ d l v l o w v h i g h and only weakly dependent on current or flowrate the closed form analytical solution of eq 17 which predicts the variation in effluent concentration versus time for cc operation is 20 δ c t i λ d l λ c f q 1 e t τ forced response δ c 0 e t τ natural resposne where λ d l is given by eq 18 note that when dss is reached typically the natural response has decayed sufficiently so only the forced response is observed finally using eq 20 under dss we evaluate the cycle efficiency λ c y c l e defined as ratio of moles of salt removed as measured at the effluent to the input electrical charge in moles we show in si section s3 that the cycle efficiency can be derived as 21 λ c y c l e v l o w v h i g h q i salt removed per cycle in moles charge input per cycle in moles λ d l v l o w v h i g h λ f l δ v q i λ c where λ f l is the flow efficiency see hawks et al 2018 which for the cc operation considered here is given by 22 λ f l t c h 1 2 t c h τ log 2 exp t c h τ 1 exp t c h τ physically flow efficiency estimates the amount of salt removal as measured in the effluent stream relative to the true salt trapped at the electrodes flow inefficiencies arise from an insufficient volume of feed solution flowed during charging or discharging from eqs 19 and 22 flow efficiency depends on the effective voltage thresholds and flowrate to current ratio c f eq 21 we choose here not to model coulombic efficiency λ c in eq 21 in detail and instead concentrate in a regime where faraday losses are kept to a low value by judicious choice of v max see also section s6 of si eqs 18 22 is our analytical model model parameters are the cell properties c e q r e q c s t and v p z c and the operational parameters which are q i v min and v max see fig 1 note that the three similarity variables derived from the semi analytical model of section 2 2 also ensure self similarity in the current analytical model c f eq 20 in si section s4 we discuss further implications of the semi analytical and analytical models on predicting desalination dynamics efficiencies and total salt removal under dss we also discuss the rationale behind the choice of models we use in section 4 when we compare models with experiments 2 4 performance metrics we here define three performance metrics for a cdi cell and use these to explore system performance and tradeoffs between throughput and energy consumption given realistic levels of salt reduction first we describe the productivity prod defined as the ratio of the feed processed rate to the total cross section area of the electrode is 23 prod l m 2 h v d e s a l t c y c l e a where v d e s a l is the volume of desalinated solution in l produced per cycle t c y c l e is the total cycle duration in h and a is the total electrode cross section area in m2 the duration of desalination t d e s a l is defined by the total duration when the effluent concentration is less than the feed i e when c c 0 hence the volume of feed solution processed during t d e s a l comprises the desalinated volume v d e s a l the remainder volume v b r i n e processed during the cycle results in concentrated brine solution corresponding to cycle time when c c 0 at the effluent hence water recovery wr is given by wr v d e s a l v b r i n e v d e s a l second we use volumetric energy consumption vec defined as the net energy spent in a charging discharging cycle per unit volume of fresh water produced as 24 vec kwh m 3 t c y c l e v i d t 3 6 e 6 v d e s a l where the integration is performed for a complete charge discharge cycle and v d e s a l has units of m3 third we evaluate salt removal as δ c a v g defined as the average reduction in the salt concentration in the desalinated volume compared to the feed solution where 25 δ c a v g mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v d e s a l under dss operation if faradaic losses are minimal then cc charging and discharging times are nearly equal to quantify such losses we will estimate an average coulombic efficiency λ c for a cc charge discharge cycle as 26 λ c recovered electronic charge input electronic charge i t d i s c h i t c h t d i s c h t c h where t c h and t d i s c h are the time spent in electrically charging the cell at current i and discharging the cell at current i respectively 3 materials and methods 3 1 cdi cell design we fabricated and assembled an fbcdi cell using the radial flow architecture described by hemmatifar et al 2016 and zhao et al 2013a five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 6 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 7 g were stacked between 5 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors total of six sheets we used two 250 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers these were cut with a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than electrodes and current collectors to prevent electrical short circuits we estimate an effective spacer volume of 4 4 ml with a porosity of 71 this assembly was housed inside a cnc machined acrylic clamshell structure and sealed with o ring gaskets and fasteners we compressed the entire assembly using c clamps to lower the electrode current collector contact resistance see qu et al 2015 for effect of compression on contact resistance in cdi 3 2 experimental methods and model parameters extraction the experimental setup consisted of the fbcdi cell a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm potassium chloride kcl solution a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh and a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet we used kcl to approximate a binary univalent and symmetric solution and circulated the solution in a closed loop with a 3 l reservoir we estimate less than 1 change in reservoir concentration based on adsorption capacity of our cell and thus approximate influent concentration as constant the resistance and capacitance of our entire assembled cell were characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry cv and simple galvanostatic charging see si section s5 for eis and cv data using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry instruments warminster pa usa we estimated effective capacitance values from the slope of voltage versus time data for constant current cc experiments using c e q i d v d t for effective resistance estimates we used the ohmic voltage drop δ v i i during current reversal for cc operation at discharge given by δ v i i 2 i r e q thus we estimated differential capacitances c e q of 37 2 1 8 f and an effective series resistance r e q of 1 55 0 28 ohms for 20 mm kcl these estimates were confirmed using cv and eis measurements see si sections s5 and s6 3 for further details on procedures used for model parameters extraction for the stern capacitance c s t we estimated an optimal value that best fitted the dynamic effluent concentration data and obtained c s t c s t a 2 of 41 6 1 3 f equivalent to 44 f cm3 for all data presented in this work we observed ionic repulsion effects gao et al 2015 at low voltages up to 0 3 v and we corrected for this in our models by subtracting v pzc 0 3 v from the cell voltage when comparing model with experimental data throughout this work to determine the mixed reactor volume we used an exponential fit to the natural response of our cell similar to hawks et al 2018 see section 4 1 and estimated 4 5 0 2 ml further we performed constant current cc operation experiments using pre defined voltage thresholds and did not directly fix water recovery wr for all our cc experiments reported in this work we had a wr of 50 55 4 results 4 1 similarity in natural response open circuit flush following stop flow charging we first look at the natural response of a cdi cell corresponding to an operation wherein i t 0 and δ c 0 0 physically this operation is equivalent to an open circuit flush subsequent to a stopped flow charging or discharging the natural response presented here is also reflected in the initial transients observed in the effluent concentration before reaching dss during cycling operation with some forcing function current or voltage from eq 20 the natural response of the system is given by 27 δ c t δ c 0 exp t τ where τ q is the flow residence time eq 27 shows that in the absence of electric current or any other forcing function the difference between effluent and feed concentrations decays as a first order exponent in time fig 2a and b shows raw effluent concentration data versus time after charging the cdi cell prior to t 0 the cell was charged at stopped flow condition with a constant current of 0 1 a for cell voltage windows of 0 0 8 v and 0 0 6 v respectively the result is two different initial conditions δ c 0 the effluent concentration response of the system is then plotted for each δ c 0 and for an open circuit flush at four flowrates between 4 5 and 12 ml min note the wide range of temporal dynamics in fig 2c we combine all effluent concentration reduction data from fig 2a and b and simply normalize time by the corresponding residence time τ the horizontal alignment of the 8 different curves shows the value of this temporal normalization to determine the cell volume a constant for all cases used in the definition of τ we use raw experimental data and fit an exponential variation for the effluent concentration with time hawks et al 2018 in the advection dominated region for t τ 1 the inset of fig 2c shows the estimated residence time extracted for each of the four flushing flowrates and for each of the two initial conditions the inset curve is strongly linear with a slope equal to a constant cell volume of 4 5 0 2 ml this cell geometry specific value collapses the time scale of all responses across all flow rates and initial conditions c f 8 operations of fig 2c further the extracted value for the mixed reactor volume the cell volume participating in desalination in our fbcdi cell is very close to the effective spacer volume of 4 4 ml as expected c f section 3 1 for a similar cell volume characterization for an ftecdi system refer to hawks et al 2018 the effluent concentration is measured downstream and so the initial step change in concentration is dispersed in a manner consistent with the assumption of mixed reactor volume this dispersion effect is similar for both values of δ c 0 and most pronounced for times less than a single residence time importantly note that all the effluent concentration measurements corresponding to the same initial condition collapse onto the same curve both in the dispersion dominated and advection dominated regions when plotted against time normalized by the appropriate residence time this results in unique effluent dynamics observed in the natural response of cdi the figure therefore highlights the self similarity of the natural response observed for the cdi cell for equal values of initial amount of salt removed δ c 0 this natural response is independent of the shape or intensity of the forcing function used to achieve the initial condition δ c 0 e g cc or constant voltage operation and can be interpreted as the step input response of the cdi cell as a dynamic linear system with a single input which determines δ c 0 and output δ c t we note here that the only time scale governing the natural response as a result of fluid flow is the flow residence time for any forced response due to time varying voltage current as in section 4 2 coupled with fluid flow cdi dynamics is influenced by both i flow residence time τ and ii electrical rc time an example of this coupling is readily apparent from eq 20 for a constant current forcing 4 2 similarity in time dynamics of cdi salt removal for constant current forcing function we here explore a range of operations with varying current flowrate and voltage thresholds to study self similarity in cc cdi operations we hypothesize that operations with the same flowrate to current ratio q i and same effective voltage thresholds v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q have similar effluent concentration variation with normalized time t τ to study our hypothesis we operated at three flowrate and current values but fixed q i ratio as shown in fig 3 a c further we adjusted the cell s operating voltage window by varying v min and v max for different current values for an effective resistance of 1 55 ohms see si section s6 for more details to ensure the same effective voltage thresholds v l o w and v h i g h results in fig 3a and b correspond to the same effective voltage thresholds but different q i in fig 3b and c we keep the same q i ratio but change the voltage threshold by changing v l o w for the same v h i g h in each case we also compare the experimental results with predictions from the semi analytical model with time varying edl efficiency for all cases we used values of c e q 37 2 f and r e q 1 55 ohms and c s t 41 2 f in the model the insets of fig 3a c shows the raw unscaled time variation of the effluent concentration for flowrates which span 3 9 ml min and current values of 50 100 ma and varying cell voltage thresholds operations which satisfy the self similarity variables are grouped together in each of fig 3a c in each subfigure the insets show the wide range of absolute unscaled raw temporal dynamics of the effluent when time is normalized by the residence time scale in fig 3a c there is a unique temporal dynamic variation of effluent concentration vs normalized time i e a collapse onto the same curve across the cases which specifically preserve the similarity variables this collapse highlights the unique dynamics of self similar operations note also that the normalized charging and discharging durations are equal for operations which preserve similarity equal normalized charging time during self similar operations is well predicted by eq 19 resulting in the same number of cell volumes flowed and thus the same flow efficiency see also section s6 1 and table s1 of the si in table s1 of the si we report the average edl efficiency at dss for the experimental data in fig 3 for each of the three cases we estimated the cycle effective edl efficiency as follows we divide the experimentally measured cycle efficiency eqn 21 by the product of predicted flow efficiency eq 22 and the measured coulombic efficiency eqn 26 λ d l λ c y c l e λ f l λ c this estimate yields nearly identical values of λ d l for each self similar case for example fig 3a b and 3c each show self similar operations at three q i values each and the corresponding edl efficiencies for each of these self similar operations are 0 7 0 72 0 75 0 73 0 76 0 77 and 0 42 0 41 0 4 see si table s1 and its discussion this comparison is not an absolute confirmation of model accuracy but shows that self similar operations yield consistent and nearly identical values of the effective edl efficiency the average edl efficiency values for fig 3a and b are nearly equal note also that the average edl efficiency decreased from 0 74 in fig 3a and b to 0 41 041 in fig 3c when the effective voltage thresholds v l o w v h i g h changed from 0 25 to 0 65 v to 0 15 0 65 v respectively this is consistent with our model prediction that the average edl in a cycle is mainly determined by the effective voltage thresholds c f eq 18 and discussion also table s1 of si since self similar operations have same flow and average edl efficiencies we hypothesize that for minimal faradaic losses the cycle efficiency λ c y c l e equal to the product of the efficiencies λ d l λ f l and λ c as per eq 21 is also equal across self similar operations this hypothesis is supported by our analytical model and by analysis of the experimental data see cycle efficiency values in si table s1 we caution the reader that this result holds true when we operate at moderate to high flowrates so the effects of diffusion are not significant and in conditions where faradaic losses are minimal in all our operations presented in fig 3 the measured coulombic efficiencies are high 90 a corollary to the above discussion is that self similar operations also result in similar absolute values of average salt removal per cycle δ c a v g eq 28 because such operations have the same q i and λ c y c l e this observation implies that a cdi user can choose among non unique operation modes e g flowrates and current to achieve a single desired δ c a v g while meeting other constraints such as a fixed values of v max or v min which respectively mitigate faraday losses or operation at low λ d l in other words there exists some surface of equal concentration reduction δ c a v g in the operational parameter space of flowrate current and voltage thresholds lastly note that productivity and vec may vary significantly under self similar operation see si table s1 for data as these are explicit functions of both the flowrate and current as shown in eqs 29 and 30 in particular vec scales as i 2 q while the prod scales as q see eqs 29 and 30 4 3 average edl efficiency and flow efficiency have opposite trends for variations in voltage thresholds we here explore the effects of changing voltage thresholds for cc operation on the flow average edl and cycle efficiencies previous studies have suggested higher v min can overall improve the dynamic cycle efficiencies by avoiding low edl efficiency λ d l due to low δ ϕ d kim et al 2015 however existing studies have not analyzed the effect of changing voltage thresholds on the flow edl and cycle efficiencies simultaneously we here show that this more complete view leads to an optimal voltage window that maximizes salt removal for the same productivity and vec in fig 4 we show data from two sets of cc charge discharge experiments symbols and the analytical model results solid curves with v max threshold of 1 v and flowrate of 9 ml min in fig 4a the current is 100 ma and v min varies between 0 and 0 6 v in fig 4b the current is 50 ma and v min varies between 0 and 0 7 v for the model calculations we use a value c s t 41 8 f and 42 8 f for fig 4a and b respectively and the same values of c e q and r e q mentioned earlier c f section 4 2 to ensure a fair and accurate comparison the cycle efficiency for the model predictions is corrected by multiplying it with the average experimental coulombic efficiency both fig 4a and b shows low average edl efficiency λ d l at small v min values since a significant portion of the cycle time is spent at low δ ϕ d higher v min values always correspond to higher λ d l however flow efficiency suffers at high v min threshold values since this shortens cycle times relative to τ and limits our ability to extract treated water from the cell lowering λ f l this trade off between the average edl and flow efficiencies results in a maximum cycle efficiency at a v min where the average edl and flow efficiencies are nearly equal this is clearly shown by the measurements and matching predictions shown in fig 4 we chose to plot fig 4a and b at the same flow rate with fixed v max and varying v min to highlight the effect of varying current the average edl efficiency λ d l is almost equal for the same v min and v max for the 50 and 100 ma cases note also the consistently higher values for flow efficiency λ f l as current is decreased from 100 to 50 ma note also how the optimum value of cycle efficiency the product of λ d l and λ f l shifts to values of higher v min this is due to the relation between each of λ d l and λ f l with operational parameters on one hand lower currents imply improved flow efficiency because of more cell volumes flowed prior to reaching the constant v max limit flowing more volumes at lower current also implies that the region of rapid drop of λ f l moves to higher values of v min on the other hand for fixed v min and v max λ d l does not change significantly with current since λ d l depends mainly on the voltage dropped across the capacitive elements given by v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q and does not explicitly depend on the current or flow rate c f sections 2 2 and 2 3 the net effect is an increased optimum value of v min to achieve the proper trade off between flowing enough volumes and maintaining potentials significantly greater than the thermal potential across the capacitive elements moreover we here specifically chose conditions e g sufficiently low v max 1 v and maximum current of 100 ma to achieve high cycle average coulombic efficiencies of 97 and 90 for 100 and 50 ma cases respectively such operation is likely of most practical interest and highlights the trade off between λ d l and λ f l we also hypothesize that for self similar operations with a fixed voltage window difference i e same v h i g h v l o w increasing the lower voltage threshold primarily increases λ d l to near unity for the same λ f l lastly we note that the values of average edl efficiencies in fig 4 are slightly lower than that reported in literature e g kim et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 we hypothesize this is because of our non zero potential of zero charge v pzc 0 3 v which adversely affects salt removal performance and average edl efficiency especially at cell voltages below v pzc see si s6 4 for further discussion 4 4 changing voltage thresholds affects salt removal significantly but energy and throughput metrics are almost constant we explored the effect of voltage thresholds on cdi performance metrics fig 5 shows the variation of δ c a v g prod and vec each versus increasing v min for the same operational conditions as in fig 4 a comparison of figs 4 and 5a demonstrates how concentration reduction δ c a v g follows the same trend as to cycle efficiency as v min increases δ c a v g increases reaches a maximum value and then decreases the reason for this correlation and trend is best expressed by the following identity 28 δ c a v g i λ c y c l e f q hence for equal flowrate to current ratio q i δ c a v g and λ c y c l e are directly proportional and reach a maximum simultaneously e g while changing voltage thresholds we next study the effect of changing flowrate to current ratio q i on δ c a v g in fig 5a as q i increases here we show for constant flowrate and changing current in general we observe that δ c a v g decreases however from fig 4a and b cycle efficiency λ c y c l e increases with higher q i a trend opposite to that of δ c a v g for changing q i we explored this opposite trend shown by λ c y c l e and δ c a v g with changing q i in further detail in section 4 5 fig 5b shows that prod and vec are only weak functions of voltage window for fixed current and flowrate conditions these trends are best interpreted using two approximate relations if we assume a coulombic efficiency of approximately unity i e negligible parasitic faraday losses we can simplify the metrics eqns 24 and 23 as follows 29 vec 2 i 2 r e q q 30 prod q 2 a hence to a first approximation for a fixed current and flowrate the prod and vec are independent of voltage window in our experiments at 100 ma cc operation fig 5b coulombic efficiency has only 3 variations 96 99 for the 50 ma case coulombic efficiency varies 10 85 95 with higher values at lower v min see si section s6 2 for data hence in fig 5b prod and vec are approximately constant for the 100 ma cases and both metrics show a slight increase with increasing v min for 50 ma note the dashed lines in fig 5b are model predictions assuming a unity coulombic efficiency for vec the difference between model prediction and data is the result of energy loss due to parasitic reactions which is more prominent at the 50 ma current these results have critical consequences for cdi operation and quantification of cdi cell performance for example fig 5 shows how current can be varied to reach a desired trade off between prod and vec but if v min is not simultaneously optimized as per figs 4 and 5a then δ c a v g can suffer enormously conversely optimizing δ c a v g and vec can be achieved by varying current and v min but mostly likely at the expense of low prod in summary the salt removal varies significantly and shows a pronounced maximum versus voltage threshold for a fixed flowrate to current on the other hand prod and vec are each a strong function of flowrate and current and depend only weakly on voltage thresholds at low currents there is less voltage dropped on series resistance and the cell spends greater time with a higher voltage on capacitive components so that coulombic losses dominate see also hemmatifar et al 2016 4 5 interplay among flowrate current and voltage thresholds on cdi performance predictions from experimentally validated model we here use the experimentally validated analytical model to study the interplay among current flowrate and voltage thresholds on efficiencies fig 6 a and performance metrics fig 6b for the cell parameters we use extracted values of c e q 38 8 f r e q 1 5 ohms and c s t 40 5 f as determined from our preliminary experiments and set v h i g h 1 v we consider the self similarity variables q i and the effective voltage thresholds v l o w and v h i g h as discussed in section 4 2 fig 6a shows contours of the cycle efficiency versus q i and voltage threshold v l o w at a fixed v l o w flow efficiency increases with q i ratio while average edl efficiency is relatively constant see sections 2 3 and 4 2 and eqs 18 and 22 this leads to an overall increase in the cycle efficiency with increasing q i ratio at a fixed q i however the flow efficiency and average edl efficiency respectively decreases and increase with increasing v l o w this leads to an optimal lower voltage threshold v l o w o p t that maximizes cycle efficiency this optimal lower voltage increases as q i increases so for high cycle efficiency we are driven to operate at high q i and at the lower voltage threshold given by v l o w o p t of course these trends need to be weighed against the requirement for sufficient salt removal δ c a v g as discussed next fig 6b shows contours of salt removal δ c a v g versus q i and voltage threshold v l o w for fixed q i increasing v l o w initially increases but then decreases salt removal in the same way as cycle efficiency see fig 6a and refer to section 4 4 and eq 28 however unlike cycle efficiency salt removal monotonically decreases with q i hence a cdi cell user with a primary objective of strong salt removal is driven to operate at low q i and at the optimal voltage v l o w o p t same optimum that maximizes cycle efficiency for cc operation however at low q i prod and vec are each adversely affected recall from eqs 29 and 30 that high ratios of q i imply respectively higher prod and lower vec but also lower degree of salt removal hence a user must properly consider the importance they attribute to prod salt removal and vec in determining cc operation the key operational parameters available include flowrate current and voltage window s of operation lastly we emphasize that in general high cycle efficiencies are not necessarily correlated with high salt removal performance such a correlation holds only when the flowrate to current is fixed and voltage thresholds are varied we hypothesize that the trends discussed here regarding efficiencies and performance will be representative of cdi cells in practical use 5 summary and conclusions we developed several reduced order models based on a mixed reactor approximation which describe the dynamics and performance of cdi systems we concentrated on cc operation but an analogous approach can be used for other operational control methods the first numerical model includes the effects of bulk electromigration edl charge efficiency faradaic losses and non zero potential of zero charge this model results in basically two coupled odes in time for respectively the effluent salt concentration and electrical charge on the electrodes can be solved numerically and is a useful tool for benchmarking the other two models the second semi analytical model further assumes a constant effective capacitance for the cdi cell and reduces to a single ode in time for the effluent concentration which yields insight into non dimensional parameters which govern operation and similarity the third analytical model assumes an effective constant value of edl efficiency and yields closed form algebraic expressions describing dynamics of effluent concentration variation and values of edl and flow efficiencies as a function of operational parameters we used the second and third models to clearly identify the natural and cc forced response of a cdi system and describe parameters and dynamics which lead to self similar performance of cdi this self similar approach highlights the interplay among flowrate current and voltage thresholds in cc cdi operation and performance we also performed an experimental study using a flow between cdi cell we performed preliminary experiments using galvanostatic charging and discharging electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry to extract three cell parameters for the model we fixed these cell parameters and validated the model across fairly wide variations of control parameters we showed that cc operations with same flowrate to current ratio and reduced effective voltage thresholds exhibit similar effluent dynamics when time is normalized by the residence time scale we verified that the average edl efficiency is a strong function of the voltage thresholds and only weakly depends on the current and flowrate as predicted by the analytical model we also proposed and explored global performance metrics including cycle efficiency average absolute concentration reduction productivity and volumetric energy consumption vec we showed that self similar operations resulted in almost equal values of cycle efficiency and average concentration reduction while productivity and vec depended explicitly on flowrate and current we used the validated model to explore a full performance map of charge efficiency average concentration reduction productivity and vec each as a function of flowrate to current ratio and effective voltage thresholds these show that higher values of flowrate to current result in better cycle efficiency throughput and vec but poor average concentration reduction the comparison of these performance maps demonstrates the trade off among salt removal throughput and vec versus cc operation parameters acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge funding from the california energy commission grant ecp 16 014 work at llnl was performed

19546,charge transfer and mass transport are two underlying mechanisms which are coupled in desalination dynamics using capacitive deionization cdi we developed simple reduced order models based on a mixed reactor volume principle which capture the coupled dynamics of cdi operation using closed form semi analytical and analytical solutions we use the models to identify and explore self similarities in the dynamics among flow rate current and voltage for cdi cell operation including both charging and discharging cycles the similarity approach identifies the specific combination of cell e g capacitance resistance and operational parameters e g flow rate current which determine a unique effluent dynamic response we here demonstrate self similarity using a conventional flow between cdi fbcdi architecture and we hypothesize that our similarity approach has potential application to a wide range of designs we performed an experimental study of these dynamics and used well controlled experiments of cdi cell operation to validate and explore limits of the model for experiments we used a cdi cell with five electrode pairs and a standard flow between electrodes architecture guided by the model we performed a series of experiments that demonstrate natural response of the cdi system we also identify cell parameters and operation conditions which lead to self similar dynamics under a constant current forcing function and perform a series of experiments by varying flowrate currents and voltage thresholds to demonstrate self similarity based on this study we hypothesize that the average differential electric double layer edl efficiency a measure of ion adsorption rate to edl charging rate is mainly dependent on user defined voltage thresholds whereas flow efficiency measure of how well desalinated water is recovered from inside the cell depends on cell volumes flowed during charging which is determined by flowrate current and voltage thresholds results of experiments strongly support this hypothesis results show that cycle efficiency and salt removal for a given flowrate and current are maximum when average edl and flow efficiencies are approximately equal we further explored a range of cc operations with varying flowrates currents and voltage thresholds using our similarity variables to highlight trade offs among salt removal energy and throughput performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization water desalination reduced order model self similarity porous carbon electrodes performance optimization 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technology that has potential to efficiently treat brackish water salt content of 1 10 g l oren 2008 suss et al 2015 in cdi the ions in solution are sequestered into electric double layers within the porous electrodes leaving water with lower salt content to be flushed from the cell cdi performance is known to be significantly affected by operating conditions such as source voltage current electrode dimensions cell resistance and capacitance flowrate and feed concentration kim and yoon 2014 wang and lin 2018 r zhao et al 2013a r zhao et al 2013b cdi electrical charging results in simultaneous adsorption of counter ions and desorption of co ions avraham et al 2009 hence dynamics associated with electric double layer edl charge efficiency plays an important role in salt removal and regeneration using cdi zhao et al 2010 biesheuvel et al 2009 developed a dynamic model for cdi to predict desalination dynamics using both gouy chapmann stern gcs theory and a mixed flow reactor i e continuously stirred tank reactor or cstr model for salt removal and the study validated the model including effluent salt dynamics with constant voltage cv operation experiments subsequently biesheuvel and bazant 2010 developed a non linear mean field theory for capacitive charging and discharging using ideal porous electrodes and identified limiting time scales in cdi desalination dynamics biesheuvel and bazant 2010 described the importance of operation in the desalination regime corresponding to large voltages compared to the thermal voltage for achieving practical amounts of salt removal thus highlighting the role of careful choice of voltage limits for desalination jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 developed simple dynamic response models with analytical solutions to describe time variation of effluent concentration under constant current cc charging however jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 neglected dynamics associated with edls which was shown to play an important role in desalination as highlighted in earlier works biesheuvel et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 later hemmatifar et al 2015 developed a high fidelity two dimensional porous electrode model for flow between cdi fbcdi which was solved computationally and validated experimentally hemmatifar et al 2015 highlighted several underlying physical mechanisms including depletion in electrodes and diffusion in spacer within the cdi cell during electrical charging and discharging similar modeling efforts have recently been carried out for flow through electrode ftecdi cdi systems guyes et al 2017 developed a simple one dimensional model for an ftecdi architecture and highlighted the importance of developing simple engineering models for cdi operation in addition a recent work qu et al 2018 on ftecdi used a hierarchy of simple to complex models to study the interplay between charging and transport dynamics in cdi most existing models and analyses for cdi discussed earlier have been either overly simple e g neglecting edl dynamics considering only charging phase or not involving dynamic steady state conditions or overly complex in scope to clearly highlight general scaling and self similar behavior for example mixed reactor models assuming a constant edl efficiency irrespective of operation jande and kim 2013 or which do not separate the effects of flow efficiency and edl efficiency biesheuvel et al 2009 do not capture the underlying trade offs in desalination performance when operated with varying values of flowrate to current ratio and voltage windows two of the parameters leading to similarity highlighted in our work more comprehensive models such as the numerical two dimensional fbcdi model of hemmatifar et al 2015 and the one dimensional ftecdi model of guyes et al 2017 enable greater and perhaps higher fidelity spatiotemporal information but these are difficult to probe to clearly identify key parameters describing the trade offs among desalination depth energy and throughput in cdi here we aim to capture the essential governing dynamics and identify controllable parameters for tuning desalination performance using cdi we focus our study on cc charge discharge operation since it is energy efficient kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 and has better energy recovery han et al 2015 kang et al 2016 however results of our study can be extended and are applicable to other operations we first extend a volume averaged model for the cdi charging discharging process based on mixed flow reactor type theory first introduced by biesheuvel et al 2009 in addition to bulk electro migration transport and edl dynamics our model also accounts for faradaic losses at the electrode surfaces and considers non zero potential of zero charge we next simplify the model based on practical considerations and derive reduced order models with closed form semi analytical and analytical solutions to evaluate desalination performance of cdi under various cc conditions specifically we obtain expressions for cycle average and time variation of edl efficiency in addition to time variation of effluent concentration jande and kim 2013 and flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 all under dynamic steady state dss conditions we identify the natural and cc forced responses of a cdi cell and its governing parameters and demonstrate self similar effluent concentration profiles across a wide range of time average edl and flow efficiencies we performed an experimental study to validate our models and study the interplay between flow and edl efficiencies in determining overall cycle efficiency and salt removal for cc cdi operation with varying voltage thresholds to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to identify self similarity in cdi desalination dynamics i e identification of variables describing cell parameters and operational conditions which result in a unique temporal response for cdi cells for the first time we identify the unique value of these variables that give rise to optimum values of salt removal given realistic constraints this includes precisely quantifying trade offs among salt removal energy consumption and degree of desalination 2 theory 2 1 gcs based dynamic model numerical in this section we describe a simple dynamic model in which we apply a mixed reactor type formulation of the form first used by biesheuvelet al 2009 for cdi cells the model includes electrical double layer edl charge efficiency effects on salt removal and electro migration effects the model assumes a symmetric and binary univalent salt with constant inlet concentration and neglects diffusive transport under these assumptions mass balance for salt is given by 1 d c d t q c 0 c φ salt where is the volume of flow compartment c and c 0 are effluent and influent salt concentration respectively q is the volumetric flowrate and φ salt is the cell volume averaged salt adsorption rate charge transport from solution to the electrodes is modeled using the idea of an ohmic mass transport layer the potential drop across the mass transport layer δ ϕ m t l relates to electronic charging current density j c h supplied by external power source with units of amp m2 through a mass transport coefficient g as 2 j c h g c f δ ϕ m t l where f is the faraday s constant physically g units of μ m s can be interpreted as inverse effective and approximate resistance of the solution within the cell volume further we use a gouy chapman stern gcs edl model and assume that the electrode pairs have the same area and edl structure except for equal but opposite sign in the electrode potential in the gcs model zhao et al 2010 the ionic surface charge density of edl σ is given by 3 σ 4 λ d c sinh δ ϕ d 2 where λ d 8 π c n a v λ b 1 2 is the debye length n a v is the avogadro s number λ b e 2 4 π ε k t is the bjerrum length and δ ϕ d is the potential drop across the diffuse layer in addition w the number of ions removed per unit internal electrode area a is given by 4 w 8 λ d c sinh 2 δ ϕ d 4 the potential drop in the stern layer δ ϕ s t is related to the surface charge density as 5 σ f c s t δ ϕ s t v t where c s t is the specific stern layer capacity per internal electrode area and v t is the thermal voltage used to obtain non dimensional voltages δ ϕ m t l δ ϕ d and δ ϕ s t we define the total capacitive voltage difference in the cdi cell circuit δ ϕ c a p which is distributed between the stern layer and the diffuse layer at the two electrodes as 6 δ ϕ c a p 2 δ ϕ d δ ϕ s t unlike the model of biesheuvelet al 2009 we will here consider two modifications to the mixed reactor type formulation first in addition to the ohmic mass transport layer we consider an external resistance for the cdi cell which accounts for resistance due to material wiring and contacts second and importantly we here consider effects of coulombic efficiency due to leakage currents coulombic efficiency is defined as the ratio of applied instantaneous electric current to the rate of adsorption of ionic charge into edls these two charge per time quantities differ because charge is consumed by faradaic charge transfer reactions often described as leakage current the instantaneous coulombic efficiency λ c is defined as the ratio of ionic current density to the applied electronic current density λ c j i o n j c h the ionic current density which can contribute toward salt removal j i o n can therefore be written as 7 j i o n j c h j l λ c j c h where j l is the voltage dependent leakage current density this leakage is typically estimated using a butler volmer biesheuvel et al 2011 or tafel qu et al 2016 equation in our work for simplicity we will account for such faradaic losses using an effective cycle averaged value for coulombic efficiency see eq 26 and hawks et al 2018 obtained from experiments in cdi electronic charge at electrode surfaces is balanced by both attraction of counter ions and repulsion of co ions biesheuvel 2009 cohen et al 2011 at low potentials across edls and for symmetric electrolytes the attraction and repulsion of ions is approximately equal at each electrode and so accumulated charge results in no removal of salt defined as anion and cation pairs hence we define a differential edl charge efficiency λ d l as the fraction of ionic current density which contributes toward salt removal as 8 λ d l f j salt j i o n f j salt λ c j c h d w d σ tanh δ ϕ d 2 note that our definition of differential edl charge efficiency in eq 8 accounts for faradaic losses unlike the formulation in biesheuvel 2009 eq 8 also assumes that the time scale associated with charge redistribution in the edl is much smaller than that of concentration changes in the bulk hence the salt adsorption rate in eq 1 is related to the ionic current density through differential edl charge and columbic efficiencies as 9 φ salt a j salt a j i o n λ d l f a j c h λ c λ d l f where j salt is the salt removal flux units of mol m2 s and a is the projected electrode area we next account for an effective non zero potential of zero charge v pzc due to the presence of native charges on the electrodes since a significant non zero value of v pzc can affect desalination performance of the cdi cell avraham et al 2011 the external cell voltage v c e l l is distributed among the resistive v r e s and capacitive v c a p potentials and v pzc as 10 v c e l l i r 2 v t δ ϕ m t l 2 v t δ ϕ d δ ϕ s t v p z c v r e s v c a p v p z c where i j c h a is current supplied by the external power source finally the rate of change of charge density at the electrodes is determined by the ionic current density to the double layer as 11 d σ f a 2 d t a j i o n eqs 1 11 close our model for cdi operation and form a dynamical system which couples salt removal and charge transfer mechanisms this constitutes two coupled ordinary differential equations ode eqs 1 and 11 for respectively effluent concentration and charge which we solve numerically we will hereafter refer to this as the numerical model 2 2 simplified model with time varying edl efficiency semi analytical here we consider reduction of the model of the previous section for dss condition and cc operation so that we can more easily explore the self similarities in response and dynamics our goal is to identify specific combinations of cdi cell and operational parameters which result in a unique dynamic response we will refer to these combinations as variables required for similarity further we will show that fixing these combinations of variables ensures that many effluent concentration versus time responses of many different cells and operations collapse to the same solution which we call self similarity in the response to this end first we rewrite the salt conservation eq 1 in terms of δ c c 0 c as 12 d δ c d t τ δ c natural response i λ t τ f q forcing function where τ q represents the residence time scale and parentheses indicate a function of the left hand side captures the natural response dynamics and the right hand side represents a forcing function here cc operation the dynamic charge efficiency λ t τ in eq 12 can be written as a product of coulombic and differential edl efficiencies as 13 λ t τ λ d l t τ λ c t τ as a simplification we will assume like hawks et al 2018 that the coulombic efficiency can be approximated by an effective constant value i e λ c t τ λ c this effective value reflects faradaic type losses through the entire charge and discharge cycle see eq 26 and si section s1 for further discussion to provide a simplified approximation of λ d l t τ and couple the external applied current to salt transport we treat the electrical response of the cdi cell using a nonlinear resistive and capacitive circuit which is mathematically equivalent to the dynamic gcs model discussed in section 2 1 see si section s1 for complete discussion we assume that the effective series resistance does not change significantly during a cycle as typical of cdi operation e g see hemmatifar et al 2016 further we assume that the total diffuse c d stern c s t and equivalent c e q capacitances are nearly constant during a cc operation and are related by 14 1 c e q 1 c d 1 c s t using eq 14 for dss operation we derive the edl efficiency during the charging phase as 15 λ d l t τ tanh 2 v t c d i t q τ c e q 2 v t c d v min v p z c i r e q and for the discharge phase we obtain 16 λ d l t τ tanh 2 v t c d i t q τ c e q 2 v t c d v max v p z c i r e q where v min and v max are the minimum and maximum external cell voltages and r e q is the effective series resistance in eqs 15 and 16 t 0 corresponds to the start of the charging and discharging respectively we present further details around this derivation and estimation of the capacitances in the si section s2 we benchmarked the current reduced order model with the more complete numerical model described in section 2 1 see si section s2 eqs 12 16 represent a closed form model for effluent concentration for cc operation of cdi under dss conditions for this model the cdi cell parameters are c e q r e q c s t and v p z c and the operational parameters are q i v min and v max the model presented in this section constitutes a reduction of the two coupled odes of the preceding section to a single ode for effluent concentration δ c eq 12 this simple ode model predicts that the effluent concentration and that the behavior will be self similar given the following variables i constant values of the flowrate to current ratio q i ii time dynamics normalized by the residence flow time scale i e t τ and iii equal values of modified low and high voltage values of the form v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q respectively we refer to i ii and iii as the three variables which result in self similar dynamic response of cc operation of a cdi cell in the si section s6 5 we mention a few other studies hawks et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2016 johnson and newman 1971 qu et al 2018a who have touched on some of these variables but have not identified the set required for unique responses finally although the model described here results in a single ode for δ c in time eq 12 we cannot find an analytical expression for δ c t eqs 12 16 need to be solved numerically and hence we refer to this reduced order model with time varying edl efficiency as a semi analytical model 2 3 simplified model with effective cycle edl efficiency analytical we here explore a further simplification of our model for cc operation which can be used to obtain a closed form analytical expression for effluent concentration versus time for full cdi operation over charge and discharge cycles using an approach similar to jande and kim 2013 and hawks et al 2018 we assume a constant effective value of edl efficiency λ d l this assumption enables an analytical solution to eq 12 using an ad hoc value for λ d l under this assumption eq 12 becomes 17 d δ c d t τ δ c i λ c λ d l f q instead of choosing an ad hoc value for λ d l as done in previous works e g from curve fitting or assuming λ d l 1 we choose λ d l to be equal to the time average edl efficiency during cyclic operation to close our model in eq 17 we average eqs 15 and 16 in time to derive the time average edl efficiency during an entire charge and discharge cycle as 18 λ d l t c h λ d l t d i s c h log cosh α max log cosh α min α max α min λ d l where λ d l t c h and λ d l t d i s c h denote the average differential edl efficiency during the charging and discharging phases and α max 1 c e q c s t v max v p z c i r e q 2 v t and α min 1 c e q c s t v min v p z c i r e q 2 v t in eq 18 the charging and discharging time can be estimated from the rc circuit analogy see si sections s1 and s2 for charging a capacitor with capacitance c e q using a current i and operated within a voltage window of δ v the charging time is given by c e q δ v i thus we obtain the charging discharging time in eq 18 as 19 t c h τ t d i s c h τ c e q q i v max v p z c i r e q v min v p z c i r e q c e q q i δ v where δ v v h i g h v l o w and we have assumed that λ c is close to unity eq 18 represents a closed form algebraic expression for the effective differential edl efficiency in a cycle resulting in salt removal and regeneration under cc operation the expression 18 is particularly useful in highlighting key non dimensional parameters in cdi cell operation these are the ratio of the reduced operational voltages v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q and v l o w v min v p z c i r e q to the thermal voltage and the ratio of the stern capacitance to the equivalent capacitance further eq 18 also predicts that the average edl efficiency in a cycle is strongly dependent on the reduced operational voltages i e λ d l λ d l v l o w v h i g h and only weakly dependent on current or flowrate the closed form analytical solution of eq 17 which predicts the variation in effluent concentration versus time for cc operation is 20 δ c t i λ d l λ c f q 1 e t τ forced response δ c 0 e t τ natural resposne where λ d l is given by eq 18 note that when dss is reached typically the natural response has decayed sufficiently so only the forced response is observed finally using eq 20 under dss we evaluate the cycle efficiency λ c y c l e defined as ratio of moles of salt removed as measured at the effluent to the input electrical charge in moles we show in si section s3 that the cycle efficiency can be derived as 21 λ c y c l e v l o w v h i g h q i salt removed per cycle in moles charge input per cycle in moles λ d l v l o w v h i g h λ f l δ v q i λ c where λ f l is the flow efficiency see hawks et al 2018 which for the cc operation considered here is given by 22 λ f l t c h 1 2 t c h τ log 2 exp t c h τ 1 exp t c h τ physically flow efficiency estimates the amount of salt removal as measured in the effluent stream relative to the true salt trapped at the electrodes flow inefficiencies arise from an insufficient volume of feed solution flowed during charging or discharging from eqs 19 and 22 flow efficiency depends on the effective voltage thresholds and flowrate to current ratio c f eq 21 we choose here not to model coulombic efficiency λ c in eq 21 in detail and instead concentrate in a regime where faraday losses are kept to a low value by judicious choice of v max see also section s6 of si eqs 18 22 is our analytical model model parameters are the cell properties c e q r e q c s t and v p z c and the operational parameters which are q i v min and v max see fig 1 note that the three similarity variables derived from the semi analytical model of section 2 2 also ensure self similarity in the current analytical model c f eq 20 in si section s4 we discuss further implications of the semi analytical and analytical models on predicting desalination dynamics efficiencies and total salt removal under dss we also discuss the rationale behind the choice of models we use in section 4 when we compare models with experiments 2 4 performance metrics we here define three performance metrics for a cdi cell and use these to explore system performance and tradeoffs between throughput and energy consumption given realistic levels of salt reduction first we describe the productivity prod defined as the ratio of the feed processed rate to the total cross section area of the electrode is 23 prod l m 2 h v d e s a l t c y c l e a where v d e s a l is the volume of desalinated solution in l produced per cycle t c y c l e is the total cycle duration in h and a is the total electrode cross section area in m2 the duration of desalination t d e s a l is defined by the total duration when the effluent concentration is less than the feed i e when c c 0 hence the volume of feed solution processed during t d e s a l comprises the desalinated volume v d e s a l the remainder volume v b r i n e processed during the cycle results in concentrated brine solution corresponding to cycle time when c c 0 at the effluent hence water recovery wr is given by wr v d e s a l v b r i n e v d e s a l second we use volumetric energy consumption vec defined as the net energy spent in a charging discharging cycle per unit volume of fresh water produced as 24 vec kwh m 3 t c y c l e v i d t 3 6 e 6 v d e s a l where the integration is performed for a complete charge discharge cycle and v d e s a l has units of m3 third we evaluate salt removal as δ c a v g defined as the average reduction in the salt concentration in the desalinated volume compared to the feed solution where 25 δ c a v g mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v d e s a l under dss operation if faradaic losses are minimal then cc charging and discharging times are nearly equal to quantify such losses we will estimate an average coulombic efficiency λ c for a cc charge discharge cycle as 26 λ c recovered electronic charge input electronic charge i t d i s c h i t c h t d i s c h t c h where t c h and t d i s c h are the time spent in electrically charging the cell at current i and discharging the cell at current i respectively 3 materials and methods 3 1 cdi cell design we fabricated and assembled an fbcdi cell using the radial flow architecture described by hemmatifar et al 2016 and zhao et al 2013a five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 6 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 7 g were stacked between 5 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors total of six sheets we used two 250 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers these were cut with a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than electrodes and current collectors to prevent electrical short circuits we estimate an effective spacer volume of 4 4 ml with a porosity of 71 this assembly was housed inside a cnc machined acrylic clamshell structure and sealed with o ring gaskets and fasteners we compressed the entire assembly using c clamps to lower the electrode current collector contact resistance see qu et al 2015 for effect of compression on contact resistance in cdi 3 2 experimental methods and model parameters extraction the experimental setup consisted of the fbcdi cell a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm potassium chloride kcl solution a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh and a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet we used kcl to approximate a binary univalent and symmetric solution and circulated the solution in a closed loop with a 3 l reservoir we estimate less than 1 change in reservoir concentration based on adsorption capacity of our cell and thus approximate influent concentration as constant the resistance and capacitance of our entire assembled cell were characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cyclic voltammetry cv and simple galvanostatic charging see si section s5 for eis and cv data using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry instruments warminster pa usa we estimated effective capacitance values from the slope of voltage versus time data for constant current cc experiments using c e q i d v d t for effective resistance estimates we used the ohmic voltage drop δ v i i during current reversal for cc operation at discharge given by δ v i i 2 i r e q thus we estimated differential capacitances c e q of 37 2 1 8 f and an effective series resistance r e q of 1 55 0 28 ohms for 20 mm kcl these estimates were confirmed using cv and eis measurements see si sections s5 and s6 3 for further details on procedures used for model parameters extraction for the stern capacitance c s t we estimated an optimal value that best fitted the dynamic effluent concentration data and obtained c s t c s t a 2 of 41 6 1 3 f equivalent to 44 f cm3 for all data presented in this work we observed ionic repulsion effects gao et al 2015 at low voltages up to 0 3 v and we corrected for this in our models by subtracting v pzc 0 3 v from the cell voltage when comparing model with experimental data throughout this work to determine the mixed reactor volume we used an exponential fit to the natural response of our cell similar to hawks et al 2018 see section 4 1 and estimated 4 5 0 2 ml further we performed constant current cc operation experiments using pre defined voltage thresholds and did not directly fix water recovery wr for all our cc experiments reported in this work we had a wr of 50 55 4 results 4 1 similarity in natural response open circuit flush following stop flow charging we first look at the natural response of a cdi cell corresponding to an operation wherein i t 0 and δ c 0 0 physically this operation is equivalent to an open circuit flush subsequent to a stopped flow charging or discharging the natural response presented here is also reflected in the initial transients observed in the effluent concentration before reaching dss during cycling operation with some forcing function current or voltage from eq 20 the natural response of the system is given by 27 δ c t δ c 0 exp t τ where τ q is the flow residence time eq 27 shows that in the absence of electric current or any other forcing function the difference between effluent and feed concentrations decays as a first order exponent in time fig 2a and b shows raw effluent concentration data versus time after charging the cdi cell prior to t 0 the cell was charged at stopped flow condition with a constant current of 0 1 a for cell voltage windows of 0 0 8 v and 0 0 6 v respectively the result is two different initial conditions δ c 0 the effluent concentration response of the system is then plotted for each δ c 0 and for an open circuit flush at four flowrates between 4 5 and 12 ml min note the wide range of temporal dynamics in fig 2c we combine all effluent concentration reduction data from fig 2a and b and simply normalize time by the corresponding residence time τ the horizontal alignment of the 8 different curves shows the value of this temporal normalization to determine the cell volume a constant for all cases used in the definition of τ we use raw experimental data and fit an exponential variation for the effluent concentration with time hawks et al 2018 in the advection dominated region for t τ 1 the inset of fig 2c shows the estimated residence time extracted for each of the four flushing flowrates and for each of the two initial conditions the inset curve is strongly linear with a slope equal to a constant cell volume of 4 5 0 2 ml this cell geometry specific value collapses the time scale of all responses across all flow rates and initial conditions c f 8 operations of fig 2c further the extracted value for the mixed reactor volume the cell volume participating in desalination in our fbcdi cell is very close to the effective spacer volume of 4 4 ml as expected c f section 3 1 for a similar cell volume characterization for an ftecdi system refer to hawks et al 2018 the effluent concentration is measured downstream and so the initial step change in concentration is dispersed in a manner consistent with the assumption of mixed reactor volume this dispersion effect is similar for both values of δ c 0 and most pronounced for times less than a single residence time importantly note that all the effluent concentration measurements corresponding to the same initial condition collapse onto the same curve both in the dispersion dominated and advection dominated regions when plotted against time normalized by the appropriate residence time this results in unique effluent dynamics observed in the natural response of cdi the figure therefore highlights the self similarity of the natural response observed for the cdi cell for equal values of initial amount of salt removed δ c 0 this natural response is independent of the shape or intensity of the forcing function used to achieve the initial condition δ c 0 e g cc or constant voltage operation and can be interpreted as the step input response of the cdi cell as a dynamic linear system with a single input which determines δ c 0 and output δ c t we note here that the only time scale governing the natural response as a result of fluid flow is the flow residence time for any forced response due to time varying voltage current as in section 4 2 coupled with fluid flow cdi dynamics is influenced by both i flow residence time τ and ii electrical rc time an example of this coupling is readily apparent from eq 20 for a constant current forcing 4 2 similarity in time dynamics of cdi salt removal for constant current forcing function we here explore a range of operations with varying current flowrate and voltage thresholds to study self similarity in cc cdi operations we hypothesize that operations with the same flowrate to current ratio q i and same effective voltage thresholds v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q have similar effluent concentration variation with normalized time t τ to study our hypothesis we operated at three flowrate and current values but fixed q i ratio as shown in fig 3 a c further we adjusted the cell s operating voltage window by varying v min and v max for different current values for an effective resistance of 1 55 ohms see si section s6 for more details to ensure the same effective voltage thresholds v l o w and v h i g h results in fig 3a and b correspond to the same effective voltage thresholds but different q i in fig 3b and c we keep the same q i ratio but change the voltage threshold by changing v l o w for the same v h i g h in each case we also compare the experimental results with predictions from the semi analytical model with time varying edl efficiency for all cases we used values of c e q 37 2 f and r e q 1 55 ohms and c s t 41 2 f in the model the insets of fig 3a c shows the raw unscaled time variation of the effluent concentration for flowrates which span 3 9 ml min and current values of 50 100 ma and varying cell voltage thresholds operations which satisfy the self similarity variables are grouped together in each of fig 3a c in each subfigure the insets show the wide range of absolute unscaled raw temporal dynamics of the effluent when time is normalized by the residence time scale in fig 3a c there is a unique temporal dynamic variation of effluent concentration vs normalized time i e a collapse onto the same curve across the cases which specifically preserve the similarity variables this collapse highlights the unique dynamics of self similar operations note also that the normalized charging and discharging durations are equal for operations which preserve similarity equal normalized charging time during self similar operations is well predicted by eq 19 resulting in the same number of cell volumes flowed and thus the same flow efficiency see also section s6 1 and table s1 of the si in table s1 of the si we report the average edl efficiency at dss for the experimental data in fig 3 for each of the three cases we estimated the cycle effective edl efficiency as follows we divide the experimentally measured cycle efficiency eqn 21 by the product of predicted flow efficiency eq 22 and the measured coulombic efficiency eqn 26 λ d l λ c y c l e λ f l λ c this estimate yields nearly identical values of λ d l for each self similar case for example fig 3a b and 3c each show self similar operations at three q i values each and the corresponding edl efficiencies for each of these self similar operations are 0 7 0 72 0 75 0 73 0 76 0 77 and 0 42 0 41 0 4 see si table s1 and its discussion this comparison is not an absolute confirmation of model accuracy but shows that self similar operations yield consistent and nearly identical values of the effective edl efficiency the average edl efficiency values for fig 3a and b are nearly equal note also that the average edl efficiency decreased from 0 74 in fig 3a and b to 0 41 041 in fig 3c when the effective voltage thresholds v l o w v h i g h changed from 0 25 to 0 65 v to 0 15 0 65 v respectively this is consistent with our model prediction that the average edl in a cycle is mainly determined by the effective voltage thresholds c f eq 18 and discussion also table s1 of si since self similar operations have same flow and average edl efficiencies we hypothesize that for minimal faradaic losses the cycle efficiency λ c y c l e equal to the product of the efficiencies λ d l λ f l and λ c as per eq 21 is also equal across self similar operations this hypothesis is supported by our analytical model and by analysis of the experimental data see cycle efficiency values in si table s1 we caution the reader that this result holds true when we operate at moderate to high flowrates so the effects of diffusion are not significant and in conditions where faradaic losses are minimal in all our operations presented in fig 3 the measured coulombic efficiencies are high 90 a corollary to the above discussion is that self similar operations also result in similar absolute values of average salt removal per cycle δ c a v g eq 28 because such operations have the same q i and λ c y c l e this observation implies that a cdi user can choose among non unique operation modes e g flowrates and current to achieve a single desired δ c a v g while meeting other constraints such as a fixed values of v max or v min which respectively mitigate faraday losses or operation at low λ d l in other words there exists some surface of equal concentration reduction δ c a v g in the operational parameter space of flowrate current and voltage thresholds lastly note that productivity and vec may vary significantly under self similar operation see si table s1 for data as these are explicit functions of both the flowrate and current as shown in eqs 29 and 30 in particular vec scales as i 2 q while the prod scales as q see eqs 29 and 30 4 3 average edl efficiency and flow efficiency have opposite trends for variations in voltage thresholds we here explore the effects of changing voltage thresholds for cc operation on the flow average edl and cycle efficiencies previous studies have suggested higher v min can overall improve the dynamic cycle efficiencies by avoiding low edl efficiency λ d l due to low δ ϕ d kim et al 2015 however existing studies have not analyzed the effect of changing voltage thresholds on the flow edl and cycle efficiencies simultaneously we here show that this more complete view leads to an optimal voltage window that maximizes salt removal for the same productivity and vec in fig 4 we show data from two sets of cc charge discharge experiments symbols and the analytical model results solid curves with v max threshold of 1 v and flowrate of 9 ml min in fig 4a the current is 100 ma and v min varies between 0 and 0 6 v in fig 4b the current is 50 ma and v min varies between 0 and 0 7 v for the model calculations we use a value c s t 41 8 f and 42 8 f for fig 4a and b respectively and the same values of c e q and r e q mentioned earlier c f section 4 2 to ensure a fair and accurate comparison the cycle efficiency for the model predictions is corrected by multiplying it with the average experimental coulombic efficiency both fig 4a and b shows low average edl efficiency λ d l at small v min values since a significant portion of the cycle time is spent at low δ ϕ d higher v min values always correspond to higher λ d l however flow efficiency suffers at high v min threshold values since this shortens cycle times relative to τ and limits our ability to extract treated water from the cell lowering λ f l this trade off between the average edl and flow efficiencies results in a maximum cycle efficiency at a v min where the average edl and flow efficiencies are nearly equal this is clearly shown by the measurements and matching predictions shown in fig 4 we chose to plot fig 4a and b at the same flow rate with fixed v max and varying v min to highlight the effect of varying current the average edl efficiency λ d l is almost equal for the same v min and v max for the 50 and 100 ma cases note also the consistently higher values for flow efficiency λ f l as current is decreased from 100 to 50 ma note also how the optimum value of cycle efficiency the product of λ d l and λ f l shifts to values of higher v min this is due to the relation between each of λ d l and λ f l with operational parameters on one hand lower currents imply improved flow efficiency because of more cell volumes flowed prior to reaching the constant v max limit flowing more volumes at lower current also implies that the region of rapid drop of λ f l moves to higher values of v min on the other hand for fixed v min and v max λ d l does not change significantly with current since λ d l depends mainly on the voltage dropped across the capacitive elements given by v l o w v min v p z c i r e q and v h i g h v max v p z c i r e q and does not explicitly depend on the current or flow rate c f sections 2 2 and 2 3 the net effect is an increased optimum value of v min to achieve the proper trade off between flowing enough volumes and maintaining potentials significantly greater than the thermal potential across the capacitive elements moreover we here specifically chose conditions e g sufficiently low v max 1 v and maximum current of 100 ma to achieve high cycle average coulombic efficiencies of 97 and 90 for 100 and 50 ma cases respectively such operation is likely of most practical interest and highlights the trade off between λ d l and λ f l we also hypothesize that for self similar operations with a fixed voltage window difference i e same v h i g h v l o w increasing the lower voltage threshold primarily increases λ d l to near unity for the same λ f l lastly we note that the values of average edl efficiencies in fig 4 are slightly lower than that reported in literature e g kim et al 2015 zhao et al 2010 we hypothesize this is because of our non zero potential of zero charge v pzc 0 3 v which adversely affects salt removal performance and average edl efficiency especially at cell voltages below v pzc see si s6 4 for further discussion 4 4 changing voltage thresholds affects salt removal significantly but energy and throughput metrics are almost constant we explored the effect of voltage thresholds on cdi performance metrics fig 5 shows the variation of δ c a v g prod and vec each versus increasing v min for the same operational conditions as in fig 4 a comparison of figs 4 and 5a demonstrates how concentration reduction δ c a v g follows the same trend as to cycle efficiency as v min increases δ c a v g increases reaches a maximum value and then decreases the reason for this correlation and trend is best expressed by the following identity 28 δ c a v g i λ c y c l e f q hence for equal flowrate to current ratio q i δ c a v g and λ c y c l e are directly proportional and reach a maximum simultaneously e g while changing voltage thresholds we next study the effect of changing flowrate to current ratio q i on δ c a v g in fig 5a as q i increases here we show for constant flowrate and changing current in general we observe that δ c a v g decreases however from fig 4a and b cycle efficiency λ c y c l e increases with higher q i a trend opposite to that of δ c a v g for changing q i we explored this opposite trend shown by λ c y c l e and δ c a v g with changing q i in further detail in section 4 5 fig 5b shows that prod and vec are only weak functions of voltage window for fixed current and flowrate conditions these trends are best interpreted using two approximate relations if we assume a coulombic efficiency of approximately unity i e negligible parasitic faraday losses we can simplify the metrics eqns 24 and 23 as follows 29 vec 2 i 2 r e q q 30 prod q 2 a hence to a first approximation for a fixed current and flowrate the prod and vec are independent of voltage window in our experiments at 100 ma cc operation fig 5b coulombic efficiency has only 3 variations 96 99 for the 50 ma case coulombic efficiency varies 10 85 95 with higher values at lower v min see si section s6 2 for data hence in fig 5b prod and vec are approximately constant for the 100 ma cases and both metrics show a slight increase with increasing v min for 50 ma note the dashed lines in fig 5b are model predictions assuming a unity coulombic efficiency for vec the difference between model prediction and data is the result of energy loss due to parasitic reactions which is more prominent at the 50 ma current these results have critical consequences for cdi operation and quantification of cdi cell performance for example fig 5 shows how current can be varied to reach a desired trade off between prod and vec but if v min is not simultaneously optimized as per figs 4 and 5a then δ c a v g can suffer enormously conversely optimizing δ c a v g and vec can be achieved by varying current and v min but mostly likely at the expense of low prod in summary the salt removal varies significantly and shows a pronounced maximum versus voltage threshold for a fixed flowrate to current on the other hand prod and vec are each a strong function of flowrate and current and depend only weakly on voltage thresholds at low currents there is less voltage dropped on series resistance and the cell spends greater time with a higher voltage on capacitive components so that coulombic losses dominate see also hemmatifar et al 2016 4 5 interplay among flowrate current and voltage thresholds on cdi performance predictions from experimentally validated model we here use the experimentally validated analytical model to study the interplay among current flowrate and voltage thresholds on efficiencies fig 6 a and performance metrics fig 6b for the cell parameters we use extracted values of c e q 38 8 f r e q 1 5 ohms and c s t 40 5 f as determined from our preliminary experiments and set v h i g h 1 v we consider the self similarity variables q i and the effective voltage thresholds v l o w and v h i g h as discussed in section 4 2 fig 6a shows contours of the cycle efficiency versus q i and voltage threshold v l o w at a fixed v l o w flow efficiency increases with q i ratio while average edl efficiency is relatively constant see sections 2 3 and 4 2 and eqs 18 and 22 this leads to an overall increase in the cycle efficiency with increasing q i ratio at a fixed q i however the flow efficiency and average edl efficiency respectively decreases and increase with increasing v l o w this leads to an optimal lower voltage threshold v l o w o p t that maximizes cycle efficiency this optimal lower voltage increases as q i increases so for high cycle efficiency we are driven to operate at high q i and at the lower voltage threshold given by v l o w o p t of course these trends need to be weighed against the requirement for sufficient salt removal δ c a v g as discussed next fig 6b shows contours of salt removal δ c a v g versus q i and voltage threshold v l o w for fixed q i increasing v l o w initially increases but then decreases salt removal in the same way as cycle efficiency see fig 6a and refer to section 4 4 and eq 28 however unlike cycle efficiency salt removal monotonically decreases with q i hence a cdi cell user with a primary objective of strong salt removal is driven to operate at low q i and at the optimal voltage v l o w o p t same optimum that maximizes cycle efficiency for cc operation however at low q i prod and vec are each adversely affected recall from eqs 29 and 30 that high ratios of q i imply respectively higher prod and lower vec but also lower degree of salt removal hence a user must properly consider the importance they attribute to prod salt removal and vec in determining cc operation the key operational parameters available include flowrate current and voltage window s of operation lastly we emphasize that in general high cycle efficiencies are not necessarily correlated with high salt removal performance such a correlation holds only when the flowrate to current is fixed and voltage thresholds are varied we hypothesize that the trends discussed here regarding efficiencies and performance will be representative of cdi cells in practical use 5 summary and conclusions we developed several reduced order models based on a mixed reactor approximation which describe the dynamics and performance of cdi systems we concentrated on cc operation but an analogous approach can be used for other operational control methods the first numerical model includes the effects of bulk electromigration edl charge efficiency faradaic losses and non zero potential of zero charge this model results in basically two coupled odes in time for respectively the effluent salt concentration and electrical charge on the electrodes can be solved numerically and is a useful tool for benchmarking the other two models the second semi analytical model further assumes a constant effective capacitance for the cdi cell and reduces to a single ode in time for the effluent concentration which yields insight into non dimensional parameters which govern operation and similarity the third analytical model assumes an effective constant value of edl efficiency and yields closed form algebraic expressions describing dynamics of effluent concentration variation and values of edl and flow efficiencies as a function of operational parameters we used the second and third models to clearly identify the natural and cc forced response of a cdi system and describe parameters and dynamics which lead to self similar performance of cdi this self similar approach highlights the interplay among flowrate current and voltage thresholds in cc cdi operation and performance we also performed an experimental study using a flow between cdi cell we performed preliminary experiments using galvanostatic charging and discharging electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry to extract three cell parameters for the model we fixed these cell parameters and validated the model across fairly wide variations of control parameters we showed that cc operations with same flowrate to current ratio and reduced effective voltage thresholds exhibit similar effluent dynamics when time is normalized by the residence time scale we verified that the average edl efficiency is a strong function of the voltage thresholds and only weakly depends on the current and flowrate as predicted by the analytical model we also proposed and explored global performance metrics including cycle efficiency average absolute concentration reduction productivity and volumetric energy consumption vec we showed that self similar operations resulted in almost equal values of cycle efficiency and average concentration reduction while productivity and vec depended explicitly on flowrate and current we used the validated model to explore a full performance map of charge efficiency average concentration reduction productivity and vec each as a function of flowrate to current ratio and effective voltage thresholds these show that higher values of flowrate to current result in better cycle efficiency throughput and vec but poor average concentration reduction the comparison of these performance maps demonstrates the trade off among salt removal throughput and vec versus cc operation parameters acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge funding from the california energy commission grant ecp 16 014 work at llnl was performed

19547,trace elements were commonly used as additives to facilitate anaerobic digestion however their addition is often blind because of the complexity of reaction conditions which has impeded their widespread application therefore this study was conducted to evaluate deficiencies in trace elements during anaerobic digestion by establishing relationships between changes in trace element bioavailability the degree to which elements are available for interaction with biological systems and digestion performance to accomplish this two batch experiments were conducted in the first sequential extraction was used to detect changes in trace element fractions and then to evaluate trace element bioavailability in the whole digestion cycle in the second batch experiment trace elements co fe cu zn mn mo and se were added to the reaction system at three concentrations low medium and high and their effects were monitored the results showed that sequential extraction was a suitable method for assessment of the bioavailability of trace elements appropriate coefficient of variation and recovery rate the results revealed that se had the highest 44 2 70 9 bioavailability while fe had the lowest 1 7 3 0 a lack of trace elements was not directly related to their absolute bioavailability but was instead associated with changes in their bioavailability throughout the digestion cycle trace elements were insufficient when their bioavailability was steady or increased over the digestion cycle these results indicate that changes in trace element bioavailability during the digestion cycle can be used to predict their deficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords trace elements anaerobic digestion bioavailability sequential extraction 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is widely used to process various organic wastes such as crop straw khatri et al 2015 food waste zhang et al 2011a organic wastewater zhang et al 2011b and municipal waste pavi et al 2017 anaerobic digestion can greatly reduce environmental pollution caused by improper disposal of these wastes xu et al 2018 sophie et al 2017 in addition it can produce renewable energy thereby helping to meet the increasing demand for energy however anaerobic digestion systems are often unstable or fail because of excessive accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas thamsiriroj et al 2012 research conducted to reduce the inhibition of vfas has led to methods such as separated two phase technology which separates the digestion process into an acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase for vfas production and methane production however the relatively high construction costs associated with these systems have limited their application zhao et al 2017 co digestion is another way to reduce the inhibition of vfas that employs raw materials with high buffer capacity such as animal manure as co digestion substances although co digestion can improve the utilization efficiency of vfas it can also increase the difficulty of follow up processing because of the additional digestate produced moestedt et al 2016 zhang et al 2011a in recent years adding trace elements fe mn mo cu zn se co that improve the activity of various key methanogenic enzymes has been found to be an effective approach to alleviation of the accumulation of vfas that improves anaerobic digestion performance lübken et al 2015 moestedt et al 2016 however it is difficult to determine whether digestion systems are being impeded by trace element deficiencies studies have shown that using the total amount of trace element to assess a lack of trace elements is not reasonable cai et al 2018 in fact trace elements have different forms in the digestion systems and their bioavailabilities vary greatly among forms in digestion systems it is difficult to separate elements in different chemical forms therefore trace elements are often divided into different fractions according to their chemical properties sequential extraction is a method of dividing trace elements into different fractions according to their chemical properties that has been widely applied in various fields amir et al 2005 mossop and davidson 2003 osuna et al 2004 ortner et al 2014 2015 tessier and campbell 1979 van hullebusch et al 2005 because of the complexity of the anaerobic digestion environment low oxidation reduction potential and high microbial metabolic activity not all sequential extraction methods are applicable to anaerobic digestion samples van hullebusch et al investigated three sequential extraction methods stover bureau communautaire reference and tessier and recommended the tessier scheme for determination of trace metal fractions in anaerobic granular sludge because of its higher recovery rate and better reproducibility than the other methods van hullebusch et al 2005 in the subsequent studies the tessier scheme was gradually optimized for instance ortner divided trace elements into five fractions water soluble f1 exchangeable f2 carbonate f3 organic sulphide f4 and residual fraction f5 and confirmed sequential extraction to be a suitable method for detection of the bioavailability of trace elements ortner et al 2014 additionally the ratio of the sum of trace elements in the first four fractions to that of all five fractions has been considered to be the trace element bioavailability dong et al 2013 sequential extraction had many disadvantages the most of them was unable to directly isolate certain compound leading to the inability to obtain the absolute bioavailability however the crude bioavailability of trace elements can be obtained according to previous study dong et al 2013 based on the definition of iso 11074 2005 bioavailability is the degree to which elements are available for interaction with biological systems marcato et al 2009 in fact relying on existing technologies accurate bioavailability is difficult to obtain because of the complexity of the digestion system therefore the measured bioavailability according to sequential extraction means potential for bioavailability in previous studies sequential extraction has mainly been used for detection of trends in trace element fractions in digestion systems to explore the effects of different treatments and conditions on the bioavailability of the trace elements for example thanh et al 2017 investigated the effects of sulfide on the speciation and bioavailability of iron with and without chelating agent edds and found that sequential extraction is sensitive to changes in iron fractions similar results were also reported by zhang et al 2015b liu et al 2015 confirmed that palygorskite can change heavy metals bioavailability during sewage sludge composting using sequential extraction although these investigations have used sequential extraction few studies have focused on the relationship between bioavailability and the requirements for trace elements in digestion systems the bioavailability of trace elements varies widely within a digestion system however it is not clear if trace elements with low bioavailability lead to system deficiency or if there is any correlation between trends in trace element bioavailability and the lack of trace elements in a digestion system therefore in this study two batch experiments were conducted to clarify those issues in the first batch experiment changes in trace element fractions were explored using sequential extraction and their bioavailability was evaluated without adding any additional trace elements in the second batch experiment trace elements co fe cu zn mn mo and se were added to the reaction system at three concentrations low medium and high we hypothesized that a lack of trace elements is related to trace element bioavailability the results of the present study provide valuable information regarding the application of trace elements in anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum rice straw obtained from the shangzhuang experimental station beijing china of china agricultural university was used as substrate rice straw was pulverized with a high speed grinder fw100 taisite tianjin china then passed through a mesh filter 1 mm to ensure the homogeneity of the substrate after which it was stored at room the inoculum was taken from a full scale biogas plant located in hebei doudian that had been digesting in cow manure for three years prior to use the inoculum was incubated using glucose solution 1 g l at 35 1 c for 15 days to achieve high metabolic activity of microorganisms the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the first batch experiment was conducted by mixing 2 56 g rice straw and 80 ml inoculum in 30 anaerobic reactors with a volume of 100 ml working volume 80 ml the reactors were capped with a red rubber stopper for gas exhaust and then digested for 50 days during which time 40 ml samples were collected separately from three reactors as replicates on days 1 3 5 7 9 10 15 20 30 and 50 samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm cr3i thermo electron co waltham ma usa to separate the solids and liquids after which they were stored at 20 c liquid samples were used to determine the scod alkalinity vfas ph and trace elements in f1 solid samples were used to identify trace elements in f2 f3 f4 and f5 the remaining 40 ml in each reactor was used to determine system total solids ts the second batch experiment was performed in 500 ml serum bottles with 200 ml working volume shuniu sichuan china in this experiment 6 40 g rice straw was added to the reaction system so that the load was consistent with that of the first batch experiment seven different trace elements were separately added to each digestion system and each trace element was added in three concentrations low medium and high the selected concentrations of trace elements were inconsistent according to their absolute amount in the digestion substrate and microorganisms the specific concentrations are given in table 2 no trace elements were added in the control bioassays the digestion period was 20 days during which time biogas yield and composition were tested daily the headspace of all reactor bottles was flushed with 99 999 pure n2 for 2 min to ensure anaerobic conditions all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 chemical analysis total solids vs alkalinity total carbon and total nitrogen were analyzed using the standard methods american public health association apha 2005 the ph was determined using a ph meter sx610 sanxin china while the scod was measured using a cod analyzer et99731 lovibond germany the pressure in the reactor was detected using a pressure gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mess und regelsysteme gmbh wal oldenburg germany and the obtained pressure of the headspace was converted to biogas yield using the conversion formula described by hua et al 2016 the methane content was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan the operational details were the same as those described by zheng et al 2015 a standard curve was constructed using ch4 99 999 purity co2 99 999 purity and n2 99 999 purity and the r2 value was 0 99 the concentrations of vfas formic acetic lactic and propionic acids were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an ion exchange column aminex hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad laboratories hercules ca usa and a detector spd m20a shimadzu kyoto japan for analysis 5 mmol l h2so4 was applied as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min and 35 c data analyses were performed using a commercial hplc software chromatography station for windows shimadzu kyoto japan a standard curve was made from a mixed sample of four volatile fatty acids with an r2 0 99 samples for vfas analysis were obtained on day 1 3 5 7 9 10 15 20 30 and 50 by collecting 2 ml aliquots of the liquid which were stored at 20 c until later analysis for analysis samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 rpm then passed through a 0 45 μm filter and injected 20 μl into the hplc system 2 4 determination and evaluation of the fraction and bioavailability of different elements samples were treated as described in a previous study and shown in fig 1 ortner et al 2014 the supernatant obtained by centrifuging samples at 5000 rpm cr3i thermo electron co waltham ma usa was the water soluble fraction f1 after that samples were eluted with solutions of ammonium acetate 1 m ph 7 acetic acid 1 m ph 5 5 and h2o2 30 ph 2 0 adjusted with nitric acid to obtain the exchangeable fraction f2 carbonate fraction f3 and organic sulphide fraction f4 respectively after the elution the solid sample was dried at 105 c for 2 h then pulverized with a high speed grinder particle size 1 mm to give the residual fraction residual fraction was obtained in this step the pulverized sample was then mixed with 10 ml of aqua regia in polytetrafluoroethylene digestion tubes cem matthews nc usa and kept at room temperature for 24 h after which the digestion tubes were put into a microwave digestion instrument and subjected to the following conditions 120 c for 5 min 150 c for 15 min and 185 c for 20 min after microwave treatment the digestion tubes were cooled at room temperature for 25 min and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icap6300 thermo scientific waltham ma usa was used to determine the concentration of trace element although the sequential extraction method used in this article was derived from ortner et al 2014 they did not provide a formula of describing bioavailability therefore the bioavailability formula reported by dong et al 2013 was used in the present study in their method c m and c t are defined as the total amount of mobile fractions of trace elements and the total amount of trace elements respectively while φ is the ratio of c m c t which reflects the bioavailability of trace elements dong et al 2013 since the sequential extraction method used in this study is different from dong et al 2013 mobile fractions refer to water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction carbonate fraction and organic sulphide fraction in this study 1 c m c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 2 c t c m c f5 3 φ c m c t the recovery rate is an indicator for evaluating the determination method that is expressed as the ratio of the measured value to the actual value equation 4 4 r c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 c f5 c t 100 where r is trace elements recovery rate c t is the total concentration of trace elements mg kg ts and c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 and c f5 are the concentrations of trace elements extracted in the five fractions 2 5 kinetic model a first order kinetics model was used to describe the kinetics of rice straw anaerobic digestion cai et al 2018 the methane yield can be predicted using the following equation 5 m t m max 1 e kt the eq 5 can be linearized as eq 6 6 kt ln 1 m t m max where k is the hydrolysis rate constant d 1 t is the time d m t is the cumulative methane yield at time t ml g vs m max is the potential maximum methane yield ml g vs and k was obtained from the batch experiments using origin 9 0 originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestion performance of the first batch experiments to confirm that the experiment the first batch experiments was representative the parameters of the anaerobic digestion process are listed in table 3 ts scod vfas alkalinity and ph the ts of the system dropped from 9 2 0 1 to 6 03 0 14 at the end of the anaerobic digestion period 55 4 of rice straw had been decomposed the scod ranged from 828 45 to 4957 270 mg l and was mainly composed of soluble sugars and fatty acids produced by the decomposition of rice straw the rice straw was digested rapidly in the early stage thus the scod content was high when there was a high hydrolysis rate in the later stage of digestion the decomposition rate of straw was relatively low and the rice straw hydrolysis and methane production were balanced resulting in a low level of cod production ph is an important parameter that can influence anaerobic digestion in this study the ph range was 6 7 7 9 which was similar to the optimal range for microbial growth 6 8 7 2 kong et al 2016 the ratio of vfa alkalinity is a good indicator of anaerobic digestion stability in a previous study a fermentation system was found to be susceptible to inhibition when the vfa alkalinity ratio 0 4 kong et al 2016 in the present study the vfa alkalinity ratio was much larger than 0 4 in the first ten days of straw fermentation after which it remained stable the trend of these parameters indicates that anaerobic digestion occurred under normal conditions rather than extreme conditions 3 2 coefficient of variation and recovery rate of trace element first batch experiments the total trace elements in an anaerobic digestion system might change because of the sampling process therefore the coefficient of variation cv was used to indicate the degree of dispersion the maximum coefficient of variation ranges of different elements were given in the specification of laboratory quality control as shown in table 4 the obtained coefficient of variation ranged from 2 4 to 15 9 which is in agreement with the maximum coefficient of variation range except for mn further study is required to determine why the coefficient of variation of mn was above this range recovery rate was also used to evaluate the method of determining trace elements as shown in table 4 the recovery of each trace element ranged from 81 8 to 119 6 which is similar to the results of previous studies ortner et al 2014 the high recovery rate and low coefficient of variation indicated that the sequential extraction process has limited loss and is a suitable method for the detection of trace element fractions 3 3 dynamics of different trace element fractions first batch experiment the different fractions of trace elements in an anaerobic reactor are as shown in fig 2 within 50 days the bioavailabilities of various trace elements were different the order of total trace elements in anaerobic reactor was fe mn zn cu ni mo co se among these fractions f1 had the highest bioavailability because of the free ionic conditions the concentration of trace elements in f1 depends on the dissolution equilibrium ortner et al 2014 for the eight trace elements se accounted for the highest proportion up to 16 0 while mo accounted for the lowest 0 0 in f1 additionally the ratio of zn in f1 was 4 2 during the initial stage then quickly reduced to 0 0 except for mo and zn the remaining trace elements in f1 increased first then decreased during the digestion cycle see supplementary material this may have occurred because a large amount of organic matter was converted to vfas thus the ph of the system rapidly decreased in the early stages of digestion during the later stages of digestion the ph increased owing to the degradation of vfas which reduced the solubility of the metal therefore f1 showed a decreasing trend the effects of ph on trace elements dynamics observed in the present study are consistent with those of previous studies gonzalez gil et al 2012 lopes et al 2008 even at the lowest ph the amount of trace elements in the water soluble fraction was 16 researchers have reported that the trace elements in f2 also have a high bioavailability fuentes et al 2008 while f2 and f3 are associated with f1 through microbial metabolism ortner et al 2014 and f4 is important for the accumulation of trace elements in sludge because of the sulfide precipitation trace elements are better retained in the sludge moreover sulfide precipitation may influence the bioavailability of trace elements because of the development more crystalline forms over time gonzalez gil et al 2002 shen et al 1993 sharma and singh 2001 a previous study showed that f4 may act as a sink and source of trace elements gustavsson et al 2013 jansen et al 2007 additionally f2 f3 and f4 are transitional fractions that can be converted to each other and exchange between f1 f2 and f4 is considered to be the most important for microbial activity however fractions f2 and f3 are only indirectly linked to uptake by microorganism through f1 and are dependent on concentration equilibria ortner et al 2014 selenium accounted for 27 7 and 31 4 of the trace elements in f2 and f3 respectively indicating that a large proportion of se in f2 and f3 can be converted into f1 when it is required for microbial growth iron was present in relatively small proportions in f2 f3 and f4 which could lead to insufficient levels in f1 previous studies have shown that even though the total amount of fe was sufficient in a system the addition of fe still had a positive effect on reactor performance bayr et al 2012 cai et al 2017 yu et al 2015 the content of mo was as high as 47 9 in f4 previous studies have shown that the mo content varies with different substrates even when the same determination method is used for example mo in f4 of slaughter house waste accounted for about 30 of the trace elements while that in pig manure and maize silage accounted for up to 100 ortner et al 2014 this may be attributed to the fact that it is easy for mo to combine with structurally dense cellulosic substances ortner et al 2014 also pointed out that the bioavailability of mo differed among substances the trace elements in f5 were not bioavailable in this study dong et al 2013 ortner et al 2014 iron accounted for the highest proportion of trace elements in f5 up to 98 3 while se accounted for the lowest proportion 14 2 with the exception of ni and mo all trace elements in f5 showed an increasing trend copper and zn are often considered to be heavy metals with greater potential for environmental damage than other metals because of their intensive use in farming he et al 2009 in the present study anaerobic digestion was found to reduce the activity of cu and zn thereby reducing the potential for harm caused by biogas from residues applied as fertilizer 3 4 dynamics of the bioavailability of different trace element first batch experiment the bioavailability of trace elements at different digestion times is shown in fig 3 there were three types of bioavailability according to the trends of trace element bioavailability during anaerobic digestion the bioavailabilities of co cu and zn decreased significantly for co cu and zn the p value was 0 003 0 002 and 0 008 respectively from 0 186 0 234 and 0 607 on day 0 0 134 0 174 and 0 450 on day 50 respectively the bioavailability of mo increased obviously from 0 360 on day 0 0 558 on day 50 for fe se and mn the trend of bioavailability changed slightly on day 50 the order of bioavailability of trace elements was fe co cu zn mo mn se ortner et al 2014 studied the bioavailability of six trace elements fe cu ni zn co and mo in three kinds of raw materials grass silage slaughter house waste pig manure and found that the order of bioavailability of trace element was fe zn cu co mo these findings indicate that there is a difference in the trace element bioavailability of different raw materials iron may most easily become deficient if only absolute bioavailability is used for assessment accordingly the absolute amount of fe should also be taken into account when assessing a lack of fe cai et al 2018 many factors affect the bioavailability of trace elements previous studies have shown that the addition of ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and s s ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid increased the bioavailability of trace elements dong et al 2013 gonzalez gil et al 2002 hu et al 2008 vintiloiu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b moreover marcel et al found that upon adjusting the ph of an up flow anaerobic sludge bed to 5 the organic sulphide fractions of co ni and fe increased by 34 47 and 109 within 30 h respectively and the increased trace elements were from the residual fraction zandvoort et al 2005 similar results were also found by marcato and gonzalez et al gonzalez gil et al 2012 marcato et al 2009 in the first batch experiment significant changes occurred in the bioavailability of trace elements without intervention these findings show that the bioavailability of trace elements can also be affected by reactor variables such as ph vfas and scod 3 5 digestion performance after adding trace elements second batch experiment fig 4 clearly shows the cumulative methane yield after adding trace elements for these seven trace elements the methane yield varied widely after addition when compared with the control treatments the addition of fe mn se and mo increased methane production at all three concentrations with the greatest increases being 140 1 144 137 5 and 140 8 respectively for co cu and zn the digestion performance did not improve in response to the addition of any of these metals except for medium amounts of zn the greatest decrease in methane yield from low co treatments was 40 0 indicating that the digestion system does not lack these trace elements moreover adding these trace elements will damage the digestion system in general anaerobic digestion is composed of an acidogenic phase and a methanogenic phase which are used for vfas production and methane production respectively previous studies have shown that the acidification stage is the rate limiting stage of anaerobic digestion yu et al 2016 substrate hydrolysis is an important part of the acidification phase therefore the digestion process was directly influenced by the hydrolysis rate as shown in fig 5 the effects of trace elements high concentration on the hydrolysis efficiency of anaerobic digestion differed the results of the first order kinetics model were consistent with those of the methane yield fig 5 and an evaluation of first order kinetic model was shown in supplementary material table s3 for hydrolysis the constants k were 0 018 0 017 0 075 0 125 0 196 0 143 and 0 023 for co cu fe mn mo se and zn respectively for fe mn mo and se the hydrolysis constants k increased by 159 2 331 3 579 6 and 393 1 respectively when compared with ck while for co cu and zn they decreased by 37 9 41 4 and 20 7 respectively this means that adding appropriate trace element can improve the digestion performance of an anaerobic reactor in fact the hydrolysis of organics is mainly done by bacteria which have a higher diversity than archaea feng et al 2010 cai et al 2017 feng et al 2010 have reported that bacterial community composition would change when trace elements as additive were applied in anaerobic digestion of food waste cai et al 2018 pointed out that addition of trace elements accelerated the anaerobic digestion process and provided more suitable metabolic environment especially for methanomicrobiale in the current study the increase of digestion performance may be also due to the changes of microbial composition and activity 3 6 prediction of trace elements deficiency based on trends in trace element bioavailability the second batch experiment showed that methane yield and hydrolysis efficiency increased with the addition of fe mo se and mn however the bioavailabilities of these trace elements were at different levels differed indicating that the levels of bioavailability of trace elements are not directly correlated to whether the digestion system is lacking a certain trace element for example se had the highest bioavailability among the seven investigated trace elements however adding se at all three concentrations improved digestion the absolute amount of a trace element is also not directly related to the lack of a trace element for example the absolute concentration of fe is 7 6 g kg ts which was the highest concentration of the seven investigated elements nevertheless fe was still insufficient in this system similar results were also reported by nordell et al who found that the addition of trace elements improved the digestion performance even when the substrate manure already contained high levels of trace element nordell et al 2016 to better assess that the total amount of specific trace elements and their bioavailability should be considered in fact even if the absolute amounts and bioavailability of certain trace elements are known it is still difficult to judge whether the system is deficient for that trace element in the current study we found that trends in the bioavailability of certain trace elements were linked to whether it was susceptible to deficiency when the trend in the bioavailability of a specific trace element was stable or increased throughout the digestion process the system was lacking the trace element however when the bioavailability of a trace element decreased during digestion it was present in sufficient levels when microbial metabolism is required f1 is consumed first while f2 and f3 are indirectly related to microbial uptake through f1 and exchange between f1 f2 and f4 is most important for microbial activity ortner et al 2014 these changes are all ultimately reflected in the trend of bioavailability f5 gradually accumulated or remained stable when trace elements in f1 f4 were present at levels sufficient for the metabolic needs of microorganisms under these conditions the bioavailability of trace elements decreased or remained stable on the contrary trace elements in f5 were transformed into f1 f4 when the initial amounts in f1 f4 were insufficient for metabolism causing the bioavailability of trace elements to increase and the digestion system to have insufficient levels 4 conclusions sequential extraction is a suitable method for evaluation of bioavailability appropriate coefficient of variation and recovery rate for all trace elements the water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction contained a relatively small proportion of the total moreover different fractions were found to be transformed into each other additionally se had the highest bioavailability 44 2 70 9 while fe had the lowest bioavailability 1 7 3 0 and there was no direct link between the lack of trace elements and their absolute bioavailability the bioavailability of the trace elements was characterized by three trends stable increasing and decreasing with the first two occurring when there was a lack of the trace element being investigated and the latter indicating sufficient levels overall these findings indicate that bioavailability can be used to predict the deficiency of trace elements providing a new perspective in which sequential extraction is used to predict trace elements deficiency acknowledgements this study was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest china grant number 201503137 the concentration of

bioavailability of trace elements varies widely within a digestion system however it is not clear if trace elements with low bioavailability lead to system deficiency or if there is any correlation between trends in trace element bioavailability and the lack of trace elements in a digestion system therefore in this study two batch experiments were conducted to clarify those issues in the first batch experiment changes in trace element fractions were explored using sequential extraction and their bioavailability was evaluated without adding any additional trace elements in the second batch experiment trace elements co fe cu zn mn mo and se were added to the reaction system at three concentrations low medium and high we hypothesized that a lack of trace elements is related to trace element bioavailability the results of the present study provide valuable information regarding the application of trace elements in anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum rice straw obtained from the shangzhuang experimental station beijing china of china agricultural university was used as substrate rice straw was pulverized with a high speed grinder fw100 taisite tianjin china then passed through a mesh filter 1 mm to ensure the homogeneity of the substrate after which it was stored at room the inoculum was taken from a full scale biogas plant located in hebei doudian that had been digesting in cow manure for three years prior to use the inoculum was incubated using glucose solution 1 g l at 35 1 c for 15 days to achieve high metabolic activity of microorganisms the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the first batch experiment was conducted by mixing 2 56 g rice straw and 80 ml inoculum in 30 anaerobic reactors with a volume of 100 ml working volume 80 ml the reactors were capped with a red rubber stopper for gas exhaust and then digested for 50 days during which time 40 ml samples were collected separately from three reactors as replicates on days 1 3 5 7 9 10 15 20 30 and 50 samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm cr3i thermo electron co waltham ma usa to separate the solids and liquids after which they were stored at 20 c liquid samples were used to determine the scod alkalinity vfas ph and trace elements in f1 solid samples were used to identify trace elements in f2 f3 f4 and f5 the remaining 40 ml in each reactor was used to determine system total solids ts the second batch experiment was performed in 500 ml serum bottles with 200 ml working volume shuniu sichuan china in this experiment 6 40 g rice straw was added to the reaction system so that the load was consistent with that of the first batch experiment seven different trace elements were separately added to each digestion system and each trace element was added in three concentrations low medium and high the selected concentrations of trace elements were inconsistent according to their absolute amount in the digestion substrate and microorganisms the specific concentrations are given in table 2 no trace elements were added in the control bioassays the digestion period was 20 days during which time biogas yield and composition were tested daily the headspace of all reactor bottles was flushed with 99 999 pure n2 for 2 min to ensure anaerobic conditions all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 chemical analysis total solids vs alkalinity total carbon and total nitrogen were analyzed using the standard methods american public health association apha 2005 the ph was determined using a ph meter sx610 sanxin china while the scod was measured using a cod analyzer et99731 lovibond germany the pressure in the reactor was detected using a pressure gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mess und regelsysteme gmbh wal oldenburg germany and the obtained pressure of the headspace was converted to biogas yield using the conversion formula described by hua et al 2016 the methane content was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan the operational details were the same as those described by zheng et al 2015 a standard curve was constructed using ch4 99 999 purity co2 99 999 purity and n2 99 999 purity and the r2 value was 0 99 the concentrations of vfas formic acetic lactic and propionic acids were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an ion exchange column aminex hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm biorad laboratories hercules ca usa and a detector spd m20a shimadzu kyoto japan for analysis 5 mmol l h2so4 was applied as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min and 35 c data analyses were performed using a commercial hplc software chromatography station for windows shimadzu kyoto japan a standard curve was made from a mixed sample of four volatile fatty acids with an r2 0 99 samples for vfas analysis were obtained on day 1 3 5 7 9 10 15 20 30 and 50 by collecting 2 ml aliquots of the liquid which were stored at 20 c until later analysis for analysis samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 rpm then passed through a 0 45 μm filter and injected 20 μl into the hplc system 2 4 determination and evaluation of the fraction and bioavailability of different elements samples were treated as described in a previous study and shown in fig 1 ortner et al 2014 the supernatant obtained by centrifuging samples at 5000 rpm cr3i thermo electron co waltham ma usa was the water soluble fraction f1 after that samples were eluted with solutions of ammonium acetate 1 m ph 7 acetic acid 1 m ph 5 5 and h2o2 30 ph 2 0 adjusted with nitric acid to obtain the exchangeable fraction f2 carbonate fraction f3 and organic sulphide fraction f4 respectively after the elution the solid sample was dried at 105 c for 2 h then pulverized with a high speed grinder particle size 1 mm to give the residual fraction residual fraction was obtained in this step the pulverized sample was then mixed with 10 ml of aqua regia in polytetrafluoroethylene digestion tubes cem matthews nc usa and kept at room temperature for 24 h after which the digestion tubes were put into a microwave digestion instrument and subjected to the following conditions 120 c for 5 min 150 c for 15 min and 185 c for 20 min after microwave treatment the digestion tubes were cooled at room temperature for 25 min and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icap6300 thermo scientific waltham ma usa was used to determine the concentration of trace element although the sequential extraction method used in this article was derived from ortner et al 2014 they did not provide a formula of describing bioavailability therefore the bioavailability formula reported by dong et al 2013 was used in the present study in their method c m and c t are defined as the total amount of mobile fractions of trace elements and the total amount of trace elements respectively while φ is the ratio of c m c t which reflects the bioavailability of trace elements dong et al 2013 since the sequential extraction method used in this study is different from dong et al 2013 mobile fractions refer to water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction carbonate fraction and organic sulphide fraction in this study 1 c m c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 2 c t c m c f5 3 φ c m c t the recovery rate is an indicator for evaluating the determination method that is expressed as the ratio of the measured value to the actual value equation 4 4 r c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 c f5 c t 100 where r is trace elements recovery rate c t is the total concentration of trace elements mg kg ts and c f1 c f2 c f3 c f4 and c f5 are the concentrations of trace elements extracted in the five fractions 2 5 kinetic model a first order kinetics model was used to describe the kinetics of rice straw anaerobic digestion cai et al 2018 the methane yield can be predicted using the following equation 5 m t m max 1 e kt the eq 5 can be linearized as eq 6 6 kt ln 1 m t m max where k is the hydrolysis rate constant d 1 t is the time d m t is the cumulative methane yield at time t ml g vs m max is the potential maximum methane yield ml g vs and k was obtained from the batch experiments using origin 9 0 originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestion performance of the first batch experiments to confirm that the experiment the first batch experiments was representative the parameters of the anaerobic digestion process are listed in table 3 ts scod vfas alkalinity and ph the ts of the system dropped from 9 2 0 1 to 6 03 0 14 at the end of the anaerobic digestion period 55 4 of rice straw had been decomposed the scod ranged from 828 45 to 4957 270 mg l and was mainly composed of soluble sugars and fatty acids produced by the decomposition of rice straw the rice straw was digested rapidly in the early stage thus the scod content was high when there was a high hydrolysis rate in the later stage of digestion the decomposition rate of straw was relatively low and the rice straw hydrolysis and methane production were balanced resulting in a low level of cod production ph is an important parameter that can influence anaerobic digestion in this study the ph range was 6 7 7 9 which was similar to the optimal range for microbial growth 6 8 7 2 kong et al 2016 the ratio of vfa alkalinity is a good indicator of anaerobic digestion stability in a previous study a fermentation system was found to be susceptible to inhibition when the vfa alkalinity ratio 0 4 kong et al 2016 in the present study the vfa alkalinity ratio was much larger than 0 4 in the first ten days of straw fermentation after which it remained stable the trend of these parameters indicates that anaerobic digestion occurred under normal conditions rather than extreme conditions 3 2 coefficient of variation and recovery rate of trace element first batch experiments the total trace elements in an anaerobic digestion system might change because of the sampling process therefore the coefficient of variation cv was used to indicate the degree of dispersion the maximum coefficient of variation ranges of different elements were given in the specification of laboratory quality control as shown in table 4 the obtained coefficient of variation ranged from 2 4 to 15 9 which is in agreement with the maximum coefficient of variation range except for mn further study is required to determine why the coefficient of variation of mn was above this range recovery rate was also used to evaluate the method of determining trace elements as shown in table 4 the recovery of each trace element ranged from 81 8 to 119 6 which is similar to the results of previous studies ortner et al 2014 the high recovery rate and low coefficient of variation indicated that the sequential extraction process has limited loss and is a suitable method for the detection of trace element fractions 3 3 dynamics of different trace element fractions first batch experiment the different fractions of trace elements in an anaerobic reactor are as shown in fig 2 within 50 days the bioavailabilities of various trace elements were different the order of total trace elements in anaerobic reactor was fe mn zn cu ni mo co se among these fractions f1 had the highest bioavailability because of the free ionic conditions the concentration of trace elements in f1 depends on the dissolution equilibrium ortner et al 2014 for the eight trace elements se accounted for the highest proportion up to 16 0 while mo accounted for the lowest 0 0 in f1 additionally the ratio of zn in f1 was 4 2 during the initial stage then quickly reduced to 0 0 except for mo and zn the remaining trace elements in f1 increased first then decreased during the digestion cycle see supplementary material this may have occurred because a large amount of organic matter was converted to vfas thus the ph of the system rapidly decreased in the early stages of digestion during the later stages of digestion the ph increased owing to the degradation of vfas which reduced the solubility of the metal therefore f1 showed a decreasing trend the effects of ph on trace elements dynamics observed in the present study are consistent with those of previous studies gonzalez gil et al 2012 lopes et al 2008 even at the lowest ph the amount of trace elements in the water soluble fraction was 16 researchers have reported that the trace elements in f2 also have a high bioavailability fuentes et al 2008 while f2 and f3 are associated with f1 through microbial metabolism ortner et al 2014 and f4 is important for the accumulation of trace elements in sludge because of the sulfide precipitation trace elements are better retained in the sludge moreover sulfide precipitation may influence the bioavailability of trace elements because of the development more crystalline forms over time gonzalez gil et al 2002 shen et al 1993 sharma and singh 2001 a previous study showed that f4 may act as a sink and source of trace elements gustavsson et al 2013 jansen et al 2007 additionally f2 f3 and f4 are transitional fractions that can be converted to each other and exchange between f1 f2 and f4 is considered to be the most important for microbial activity however fractions f2 and f3 are only indirectly linked to uptake by microorganism through f1 and are dependent on concentration equilibria ortner et al 2014 selenium accounted for 27 7 and 31 4 of the trace elements in f2 and f3 respectively indicating that a large proportion of se in f2 and f3 can be converted into f1 when it is required for microbial growth iron was present in relatively small proportions in f2 f3 and f4 which could lead to insufficient levels in f1 previous studies have shown that even though the total amount of fe was sufficient in a system the addition of fe still had a positive effect on reactor performance bayr et al 2012 cai et al 2017 yu et al 2015 the content of mo was as high as 47 9 in f4 previous studies have shown that the mo content varies with different substrates even when the same determination method is used for example mo in f4 of slaughter house waste accounted for about 30 of the trace elements while that in pig manure and maize silage accounted for up to 100 ortner et al 2014 this may be attributed to the fact that it is easy for mo to combine with structurally dense cellulosic substances ortner et al 2014 also pointed out that the bioavailability of mo differed among substances the trace elements in f5 were not bioavailable in this study dong et al 2013 ortner et al 2014 iron accounted for the highest proportion of trace elements in f5 up to 98 3 while se accounted for the lowest proportion 14 2 with the exception of ni and mo all trace elements in f5 showed an increasing trend copper and zn are often considered to be heavy metals with greater potential for environmental damage than other metals because of their intensive use in farming he et al 2009 in the present study anaerobic digestion was found to reduce the activity of cu and zn thereby reducing the potential for harm caused by biogas from residues applied as fertilizer 3 4 dynamics of the bioavailability of different trace element first batch experiment the bioavailability of trace elements at different digestion times is shown in fig 3 there were three types of bioavailability according to the trends of trace element bioavailability during anaerobic digestion the bioavailabilities of co cu and zn decreased significantly for co cu and zn the p value was 0 003 0 002 and 0 008 respectively from 0 186 0 234 and 0 607 on day 0 0 134 0 174 and 0 450 on day 50 respectively the bioavailability of mo increased obviously from 0 360 on day 0 0 558 on day 50 for fe se and mn the trend of bioavailability changed slightly on day 50 the order of bioavailability of trace elements was fe co cu zn mo mn se ortner et al 2014 studied the bioavailability of six trace elements fe cu ni zn co and mo in three kinds of raw materials grass silage slaughter house waste pig manure and found that the order of bioavailability of trace element was fe zn cu co mo these findings indicate that there is a difference in the trace element bioavailability of different raw materials iron may most easily become deficient if only absolute bioavailability is used for assessment accordingly the absolute amount of fe should also be taken into account when assessing a lack of fe cai et al 2018 many factors affect the bioavailability of trace elements previous studies have shown that the addition of ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and s s ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid increased the bioavailability of trace elements dong et al 2013 gonzalez gil et al 2002 hu et al 2008 vintiloiu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b moreover marcel et al found that upon adjusting the ph of an up flow anaerobic sludge bed to 5 the organic sulphide fractions of co ni and fe increased by 34 47 and 109 within 30 h respectively and the increased trace elements were from the residual fraction zandvoort et al 2005 similar results were also found by marcato and gonzalez et al gonzalez gil et al 2012 marcato et al 2009 in the first batch experiment significant changes occurred in the bioavailability of trace elements without intervention these findings show that the bioavailability of trace elements can also be affected by reactor variables such as ph vfas and scod 3 5 digestion performance after adding trace elements second batch experiment fig 4 clearly shows the cumulative methane yield after adding trace elements for these seven trace elements the methane yield varied widely after addition when compared with the control treatments the addition of fe mn se and mo increased methane production at all three concentrations with the greatest increases being 140 1 144 137 5 and 140 8 respectively for co cu and zn the digestion performance did not improve in response to the addition of any of these metals except for medium amounts of zn the greatest decrease in methane yield from low co treatments was 40 0 indicating that the digestion system does not lack these trace elements moreover adding these trace elements will damage the digestion system in general anaerobic digestion is composed of an acidogenic phase and a methanogenic phase which are used for vfas production and methane production respectively previous studies have shown that the acidification stage is the rate limiting stage of anaerobic digestion yu et al 2016 substrate hydrolysis is an important part of the acidification phase therefore the digestion process was directly influenced by the hydrolysis rate as shown in fig 5 the effects of trace elements high concentration on the hydrolysis efficiency of anaerobic digestion differed the results of the first order kinetics model were consistent with those of the methane yield fig 5 and an evaluation of first order kinetic model was shown in supplementary material table s3 for hydrolysis the constants k were 0 018 0 017 0 075 0 125 0 196 0 143 and 0 023 for co cu fe mn mo se and zn respectively for fe mn mo and se the hydrolysis constants k increased by 159 2 331 3 579 6 and 393 1 respectively when compared with ck while for co cu and zn they decreased by 37 9 41 4 and 20 7 respectively this means that adding appropriate trace element can improve the digestion performance of an anaerobic reactor in fact the hydrolysis of organics is mainly done by bacteria which have a higher diversity than archaea feng et al 2010 cai et al 2017 feng et al 2010 have reported that bacterial community composition would change when trace elements as additive were applied in anaerobic digestion of food waste cai et al 2018 pointed out that addition of trace elements accelerated the anaerobic digestion process and provided more suitable metabolic environment especially for methanomicrobiale in the current study the increase of digestion performance may be also due to the changes of microbial composition and activity 3 6 prediction of trace elements deficiency based on trends in trace element bioavailability the second batch experiment showed that methane yield and hydrolysis efficiency increased with the addition of fe mo se and mn however the bioavailabilities of these trace elements were at different levels differed indicating that the levels of bioavailability of trace elements are not directly correlated to whether the digestion system is lacking a certain trace element for example se had the highest bioavailability among the seven investigated trace elements however adding se at all three concentrations improved digestion the absolute amount of a trace element is also not directly related to the lack of a trace element for example the absolute concentration of fe is 7 6 g kg ts which was the highest concentration of the seven investigated elements nevertheless fe was still insufficient in this system similar results were also reported by nordell et al who found that the addition of trace elements improved the digestion performance even when the substrate manure already contained high levels of trace element nordell et al 2016 to better assess that the total amount of specific trace elements and their bioavailability should be considered in fact even if the absolute amounts and bioavailability of certain trace elements are known it is still difficult to judge whether the system is deficient for that trace element in the current study we found that trends in the bioavailability of certain trace elements were linked to whether it was susceptible to deficiency when the trend in the bioavailability of a specific trace element was stable or increased throughout the digestion process the system was lacking the trace element however when the bioavailability of a trace element decreased during digestion it was present in sufficient levels when microbial metabolism is required f1 is consumed first while f2 and f3 are indirectly related to microbial uptake through f1 and exchange between f1 f2 and f4 is most important for microbial activity ortner et al 2014 these changes are all ultimately reflected in the trend of bioavailability f5 gradually accumulated or remained stable when trace elements in f1 f4 were present at levels sufficient for the metabolic needs of microorganisms under these conditions the bioavailability of trace elements decreased or remained stable on the contrary trace elements in f5 were transformed into f1 f4 when the initial amounts in f1 f4 were insufficient for metabolism causing the bioavailability of trace elements to increase and the digestion system to have insufficient levels 4 conclusions sequential extraction is a suitable method for evaluation of bioavailability appropriate coefficient of variation and recovery rate for all trace elements the water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction contained a relatively small proportion of the total moreover different fractions were found to be transformed into each other additionally se had the highest bioavailability 44 2 70 9 while fe had the lowest bioavailability 1 7 3 0 and there was no direct link between the lack of trace elements and their absolute bioavailability the bioavailability of the trace elements was characterized by three trends stable increasing and decreasing with the first two occurring when there was a lack of the trace element being investigated and the latter indicating sufficient levels overall these findings indicate that bioavailability can be used to predict the deficiency of trace elements providing a new perspective in which sequential extraction is used to predict trace elements deficiency acknowledgements this study was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest china grant number 201503137 the concentration of

19548,tetra amido macrocyclic ligand taml activator is a functional analog of peroxidase enzymes which activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to form high valence iron oxo complexes that selectively degrade persistent aromatic organic contaminants acs in water here we develop quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models based on measured pseudo first order kinetic rate coefficients k obs of 29 acs e g phenols and pharmaceuticals oxidized by taml h2o2 at neutral and basic ph values to gain mechanistic insight on the selectivity and ph dependence of taml h2o2 systems these qsar models infer that electron donating ability e homo is the most important ac characteristic for taml h2o2 oxidation pointing to a rate limiting single electron transfer set mechanism oxidation rates at ph 7 also depend on ac reactive indices such as f m i n and qh which respectively represent propensity for electrophilic attack and the most positive net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms at ph 10 taml h2o2 is more reactive towards acs with a lower hydrogen to carbon atoms ratio h c suggesting the significance of hydrogen atom abstraction in addition ln k obs of 14 monosubstituted phenols is negatively correlated with hammett constants σ and exhibits similar sensitivity to substituent effects as horseradish peroxidase although accurately predicting degradation rates of specific acs in complex wastewater matrices could be difficult these qsar models are statistically robust and help predict both relative degradability and reaction mechanism for taml h2o2 based treatment processes graphical

aops e g ozonation fenton oxidation and persulfate based oxidation have been considered to remove trace acs but the high financial and energy costs have limited their applications zheng et al 2017 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2017b the tetra amido macrocyclic ligand catalyst taml fig 1 which is as a functional analog of peroxidase enzyme is a simple and potentially effective green alternative to aops gupta et al 2002 taml activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to form a high valence iron oxo complex that is very reactive and more selective for oxidation of acs than aop generated easily scavenged free radicals in complex wastewater matrices chanda et al 2006a the toxicity of contaminated water was reported to dramatically decrease after treatment with taml h2o2 and residual traces of taml had no adverse effects on fish or microorganisms ellis et al 2010 additionally taml can be used at very low nm to low μm concentrations e g 1 kg of catalysts could treat 20 000 tons of water shappell et al 2008 and offers high efficiency for near stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide utilization tang et al 2016 accordingly taml has been used to degrade a wide variety of acs in wastewater including dyes chahbane et al 2007 chanda et al 2006a ellis et al 2009 estrogenic compounds chen et al 2012 onundi et al 2017 shappell et al 2008 persistent chloro gupta et al 2002 nitro kundu et al 2015 and bromo wang et al 2017a phenols thiophosphate pesticides chanda et al 2006b molluscicides tang et al 2016 and drugs shen et al 2011 taml activates h2o2 to form oxidized taml which in turn oxidizes the ac molecule and restores itself to taml scheme 1 the initial rates of ac oxidation are given by eq 1 in which taml 0 is the total concentration of taml catalyst k i is the first order rate constant for taml oxidation k i is the rate constant for the reversal reaction and k ii is the rate constant for ac oxidation chahbane et al 2007 if k i h 2 o 2 k ii ac and k i is negligible eq 1 simplifies to eq

structures of both taml and the target acs previously it was shown that the electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring of taml enhance both k i and k ii chahbane et al 2007 however little is known about how ac structure affects treatment efficiency furthermore the speciation of oxidized taml changes with ph ghosh et al 2008 which in turn affects both reaction rates and products distribution chanda et al 2006b onundi et al 2017 therefore taml based treatment process optimization and reliability enhancement requires improved understanding and accurate prediction of how ac

et al 2015 luo et al 2018b for example the second order rate constant for the reaction of horseradish peroxidase hrp with 32 phenolic or aniline compounds was positively correlated with hammett sigma constants na and lee 2017 furthermore the second order rate constants for the oxidation of 34 aromatic compounds by fe vi which is another high valence iron oxo compound was negatively correlated with ionization potential ip ye et al 2017 this implies that set was the rate limiting first step these examples demonstrate the potential of qsar models to predict rate constants of diverse acs oxidation

listed in table s4 2 4 qsar analyses all rate constants were randomly divided into the training set 22 acs for developing the qsar models and test set 7 acs for validating the models a stepwise mlr was used to develop the predictive model by correlating ln k obs and all descriptors of acs compounds next various strategies were adopted for validation of qsar models statistics such as coefficient of determination r 2 f value significance level p and variance inflation factor vif were used to assess internal performance leave one out loo method was used for cross validation for external validation q ext 2 and average absolute model bias amb were used for estimating the predictive capacity of the qsar model which were calculated as eq 7 and eq 8 xiao et al 2015 7 q ext 2 1 i 1 t e s t

calculated using eq 9 and eq 10 9 δ y i y i ˆ i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 n p 1 10 h x i t x t x 1 x i where p is the number of descriptors included in the model x i is the row vector of the descriptors of

tropsha et al 2003 statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss statistics software version 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development table 1 summarizes the measured rate constants of taml h2o2 oxidation for 29 acs at ph 7 and ph 10 reaction kinetics followed pseudo first order figs s1 and s2 with k obs values at ph 7 ranging over two orders of magnitude from 4 0 10 4 min 1 for metronidazole to 6 9 10 2 min 1 for 4 aminophenol the k obs values were transformed into natural logarithm units ln k obs to reduce the span of the data the qsar models were developed with the ln k obs in the training set n 22 and all 42 molecular descriptors a correlation analysis between the ln k obs and selected individual descriptors was performed to assess the interrelationship strengths the correlation coefficients r and the statistical significances were listed in table s5 among the descriptors correlated with ln k obs at ph 7 e homo r 0 69 ip r 0 64 ζ r 0 56 and f m i n r 0 53 are highly significant p 0 01 the results at ph 10 are similar and the order of correlation coefficients p 0 05 is e homo r 0 74 ip r 0 70 ζ r 0 60 f m i n r 0 47 oh r 0 37 however e homo is highly negatively correlated with ip r 0 95 p 0 01 suggesting the collinearity between them interestingly strongly negative correlation has also been found in e lumo with ea and ω proving that the calculated e lumo can be used for estimating these two descriptors zhan et al 2003 moreover the ln k obs values obtained at phs 7 and 10 have a correlation coefficient of 0 95 p 0 01 indicating taml h2o2 systems may have similar reactive preference toward these acs at different phs to avoid missing descriptors with low correlation but high importance all 42 descriptors were selected for stepwise mlr analysis and 6 models were listed in table s6 although the coefficient of determination r 2 increases as the number of variables increases the p value of the last model for ph 10 is larger than 0 05 thus ab was excluded from the model the models for ph 7 and ph 10 were obtained as eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 ln k obs 2 32 1 95 e homo 11 6 qh 27 9 f m i n ph 7 n 22 r 2 0 762 f 18 1 p 0 01 vif 1 2 q

ph 7 and ph 10 are 0 762 and 0 747 respectively which suggest that these qsar models reasonably fitted well with the training set the reasonable f values 18 1 and 26 6 and low p level 0 01 indicate these ln k obs values are unlikely distributed under the null hypothesis which would be rejected further the vif values are less than 1 2 indicating no potential collinearities among the descriptors included in the models the values of r 2 0 6 f 15 p 0 05 and vif 10 all meet the minimum statistical robustness criteria tropsha et al 2003 for internal validation n 22 both q loo 2 values 0 627 and 0 626 are larger than 0 5 corroborating that the models are statistically robust with no obvious over fitting the models predict reasonably well the reactivity of the acs used for external validation n 7 the calculated q ext 2 values are 0 566 and 0 619 for ph 7 and 10 respectively the ambtraining is 1 03 and 1 75 and the ambtest is 1 01 and 0 90 for ph 7 and ph 10 respectively the absolute model bias 100 and 86 2 for ph 7 and ph 10 is within a factor of 0 5 2 confirming the predictive power of the qsar models the comparison of measured and predicted ln k obs value is shown in fig 2 the 1 1 solid line shows perfect agreement among the different families of acs the monosubstituted phenols exhibit relatively high ln k obs but the goodness of the fitting is similar for all acs moreover the probability probability p p plots show random normal distribution for observed standard residuals demonstrating the validity of the regression models fig s3 the williams plot was used to evaluate the applicability domain of the qsar models for oxidation of acs fig 3 the horizontal dash lines are standardized residual outliers 3 and vertical dash lines are warning leverages h 0 545 and 0 409 as can be seen from fig 3 all data points in the training set and the test set fall into applicability domain indicating the qsar models are reliable for predicting k obs of acs by taml h2o2 only diphenhydramine has relatively high leverage h 0 499 but does not exceed h however the models fit these data reasonably well with small standardized residuals which improves model stability no significant difference was found in the applicability domain for different families of acs suggesting that the qsar models are broadly applicable to phenolic compounds pharmaceuticals and organic acids 3 2 implications of model descriptors the qsar models expressed as eq 11 and eq 12 show that quantum chemical e homo and electrostatic f m i n qh descriptors are directly proportional to ln k obs whereas constitutional descriptor h c is inversely proportional to it the contribution of each variable to eq 11 is 44 8 for e homo 27 9 for qh and 27 3 for f m i n respectively for eq 12 e homo and h c contributed 63 4 and 36 6 of the variance both models include e homo the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital which may be the predominant factor affecting the reactivity of acs towards taml h2o2 the experimental ln k obs exhibits a linear trend when correlated with the respective e homo figs s4a and s4b although the coefficients of determination are relatively low r 2 0 47 for ph 7 and r 2 0 55 for ph 10 the general trends show that reactivity increases with e homo the compounds with higher e homo are better electron donors 4 aminophenol has the highest e homo and hence the strongest ability to donate electrons the reaction of high valence iron oxo species with organic compounds is known to be an electrophilic reaction via a set process chahbane et al 2007 the descriptor e homo has frequently been included in other qsar models for oxidation reactions for example lee et al 2015 developed a qsar model for the second order rate constants of the reaction between o3 and 112 aromatic micropollutants in aquatic systems they reported r 2 values of 0 82 1 00 with only e homo as a descriptor salter blanc et al 2016 built qsar models for relative rate constants of aromatic amine oxidation by manganese dioxide mno2 and found that e homo calculated by different functionals hartree fock b3lyp or m06 2x and basis sets 6 31g or 6 311 g 2d 2p correlate well with the logarithm of the relative rate constants in addition to o3 and mineral oxidants the rate constants of biocatalysts such as hrp and bovine methemoglobin are also positively correlated with the e homo of monosubstituted phenols pérez prior et al 2012 sakurada et al 1990 these similarities are consistent with the peroxidase like reaction of taml h2o2 systems indicating that the oxidation rate is controlled by the set from the acs to the active iron center other quantum chemical descriptors such as e gap and ip have been used to establish qsar models for organic contaminants oxidation by o3 sudhakaran and amy 2013 so4 xiao et al 2015 luo et al 2018b and fe vi ye et al 2017 in aqueous systems no significant correlation was found between ln k obs and e gap which is the predominant descriptor affecting oxidation by so4 xiao et al 2015 this suggests that the reactions of taml h2o2 with the acs used here are less likely to proceed through the nucleophilic addition pathway ip is approximately equal to the negative e homo table s5 but less significant than e homo for taml h2o2 oxidation thus excluded by stepwise mlr fukui indices f i f i and f i 0 could quantitatively reflect the respective affinity with nucleophilic attack electrophilic attack and radical attack which may suggest reaction mechanisms for example zhu et al 2015 measured the rate constants of o3 with 33 kinds of acs under acidic conditions and observed that ln k obs correlates strongly with f m a x 0 which represented radical attack for the reaction at ph 7 the correlation between descriptor f m i n and ln k obs is not high but significant r 0 53 p 0 01 fig s4c shows that the acs with higher f m i n have higher ln k obs therefore the susceptibility of acs towards attack by electrophiles influences the reactivity of oxidized taml to some extent qh describes the hydrogen bond donating and electrostatic attraction ability deciding the reactive sites of a molecule to be dehydrogenated acs at neutral ph with greater net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms may possess higher reactivity toward oxidized taml as suggested by the positive coefficient of qh most acs with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups have qh value around 0 5 except for diphenhydramine 0 264 and sulfanilamide 0 437 fig s4e the n h or c h bonds in these two drugs do not react with taml activators easily though the h abstraction reaction pathway the qh was also positively correlate to the rate constants of oh in the established qsar model luo et al 2017b thus qh is considered a general electrostatic descriptor characterizing interactions between oxidants and acs whether for radical or non radical oxidation the computed electrostatic potential on the molecular surface of two example acs 4 chlorophenol and bpa are shown in fig 4 in which the blue color represents most positive value while the red color illustrates most negative value the overall electrostatic potential between 4 chlorophenol and bpa was similar indicating comparable reactivity with taml h2o2 hydrogen atoms h 13 of 4 chlorophenol h 18 and h 19 of bpa in hydroxyl groups have the largest qh and are more easily removed from these compounds condensed fukui indices distribution yield additional insight the f m i n lies in c 5 of 4 chlorophenol and c 19 of bpa while f m a x locates near atoms with f m i n cl 8 of 4 chlorophenol c 6 and c 12 of bpa these regions atoms with their bonds indicate the likely reactive sites for attack by oxidized taml the second important descriptor of the ph 10 model is h c which is not included in models at ph 7 indicating a mechanistic difference between the reaction at ph 7 and ph 10 the negative coefficient of h c indicates that at ph 10 acs with lower ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms have higher reactivity toward oxidized taml this suggests that taml reacts slowly with the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule and h abstraction reaction is a crucial step in acs oxidation nevertheless the correlation between ln k obs and single descriptor h c is not significant fig s4d indicating h c should be considered in combination with other factors h c is a simple constitutional descriptor that was not commonly used in previous qsar models however the similar descriptor o c exhibited an opposite negative correlation with rate constants for organic contaminants oxidation by so4 xiao et al 2015 a high o c ratio means that fewer c h atoms react by abstracting a hydrogen atom with free so4 similar results were reported for oh generated by o3 for oxidation of organic micropollutants in four river water matrices sudhakaran et al 2012 however unlike oxidation by taml h2o2 those are radical based reactions 3 3 hammett correlations acs with electron donating groups are more likely to react through the set pathway than that with electron withdrawing groups luo et al 2017c due to the possible occurrence of the set pathway for ac oxidation by taml h2o2 we investigated the influence of electron donating groups on the relative rate constants k rel k rel k obs k phenol of monosubstituted phenols using phenol as the reference compound for normalization fig s5 amino hydroxyl and methoxy groups were categorized as strong electron donating groups whereas aminoacyl and methyl groups are moderate and weak electron donating groups respectively halogen formyl and nitro groups are weak moderate and strong electron withdrawing groups respectively luo et al 2017c as shown in fig s5 ln k rel decreases in general from strong electron donating groups to strong electron withdrawing groups however the relatively low ln k rel value of resorcinol with meta hydroxyl group and high ln k rel value of halogen substituted phenols are in contrast with the trend this is attributed to different rates of subsequent reaction pathways e g h abstraction following the set reaction hammett constants σ σ and σ are useful for quantitatively examining the inductive and resonance effect of substituents of acs especially phenols and anilines on the reaction kinetics lee and von gunten 2012 the σ and σ are particular scopes of σ constants for the electron donating substituents and the electron withdrawing substituents respectively which have been used for stabilization of reaction centers via resonance interaction with substituents lee and von gunten 2012 the large negative values of hammett constants describing electron donating properties of substituents while electron withdrawing substituents have positive value therefore hammett correlations were established between ln k obs of a series of monosubstituted phenols and the hammett constants σ σ and σ are listed in table s7 the rate constants of a series of substituted phenols are negatively correlated to σ and σ but in poor correlation with σ fig 5 and fig s6 this suggests that the regression equations on fig 5a and d with relatively high r 2 0 74 are simple for predicting the rate constant ln k obs for the oxidation of phenolic contaminants by taml h2o2 where 25 out of 28 89 3 predicted ln k obs are within a factor of 0 5 2 the ln k obs is inversely proportional to hammett constants which is typical for electrophilic reactions these results are consistent with previous studies on the oxidation of phenols and anilines by relevant oxidants o3 lee and von gunten 2012 clo2 lee and von gunten 2012 fe vi lee and von gunten 2012 bovine methemoglobin pérez prior et al 2012 lactoperoxidase zhang and dunford 1993 and hrp na and lee 2017 but are different from oxidation processes with singlet oxygen 1o2 tratnyek and hoigne 1991 and mno2 salter blanc et al 2016 which correlate better with σ constants the slope ρ of the correlation reflects the sensitivity of the reaction to the substituent effect the lower slope ρ 3 63 and 1 98 for variables σ and σ respectively of the ph 7 model compared to that for ph 10 ρ 5 83 and 3 41 for variables σ and σ respectively indicates that reaction at ph 7 is less sensitive to the substituent variation this is consistent with the hammett relationships based on σ for oxidation kinetics of neutral and deprotonated phenolics by fe vi lee and von gunten 2012 and potassium permanganate mn vii song et al 2015 these observations suggest that the reaction mechanism for taml h2o2 with phenols at ph 7 is different from that at ph 10 the hammett correlation between log k ii at ph 10 and σ fig s6d shows that the slope ρ 1 48 is similar to that of hrp ρ 2 0 na and lee 2017 this similar sensitivity to the substituent effect may be due to the comparative reactivity of phenols by enzyme mimic taml and natural peroxidase the ln k obs values of halogenated phenols 4 chlorophenol and 4 bromophenol are higher than those predicted by hammett constants indicating that the reactivity of phenols with taml h2o2 may not simply follow the hammett correlations they were therefore excluded in the linear regression this is in contrast to the oxidation of chloro and bromo substituted bpa by taml h2o2 which have lower k ii than pristine bpa and methyl substituted bpa onundi et al 2017 it is known that the halogen substituents are weak electron withdrawing groups that can reduce the electron density of aromatic compounds making them resistant to chemical or biological oxidation nevertheless taml h2o2 could completely mineralize chlorophenols through an oxidative ring opening pathway and the degradation rate increased with an increased number of electron withdrawing chlorine groups on the phenol ring initial degradation rate pentachlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol which disagrees with the hammett correlation collins et al 2010 gupta et al 2002 a possible reason is that the higher f m i n value of 4 chlorophenol 0 026 and 4 bromophenol 0 025 make them more susceptibly attack by oxidized taml fig 4a the ln k obs of salicylaldehyde is also significantly larger than the qsar prediction the ortho substituted hydroxybenzaldehyde was predicted to have lower ln k obs than the para substituted compounds but the opposite result was observed similar discrepancies were found for nitrophenol oxidation by taml activators 2 nitrophenol has higher k i 154 m 1 s 1 than 4 nitrophenol k i 33 m 1 s 1 kundu et al 2015 note that the 4 nitrophenol is a strong inhibitor of catalytic activity due to steric suppression of reversible binding of nitrophenolate anions to the iron center kundu et al 2015 this suggests that 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde exerts a similar steric effect thus limiting the value of hammett correlations 3 4 the ph dependent mechanism considerable differences between taml h2o2 oxidation of acs at neutral and basic ph were observed both in the qsar models and hammett correlations this indicates that the reaction mechanism changes with ph furthermore the rate constants of acs in our study and previous studies show strong ph dependent reactions of taml activators this ph dependent feature could be attributed to two possible reasons 1 the reactive species of oxidized taml formed by taml and h2o2 were generated faster at ph 10 higher k i 2 the dissociated acs most with pka 10 at ph 10 have a higher electron density and thus are more reactive to electrophilic agents oxidized taml both effects lead to a significant increase in rate as ph increases from 7 to 10 from scheme 1 the taml h2o2 generally form an oxidized taml then reacts with acs these highly reactive species were characterized as high valence iron oxo complex fev o de oliveira et al 2007 or feiv o ghosh et al 2008 depending on ph the deprotonated form of taml with 2 charge has the highest activity to react with h2o2 at around ph 10 ghosh et al 2008 and the k i decreases above ph 10 due to the deprotonation of h2o2 pka 11 suggesting that the highest reactivity of taml h2o2 falls in a narrow range between ph 10 and 11 our qsar models helps understand the results of acs degradation at different ph values generally acs are rapidly destroyed and toxicity decreases at the optimal ph gupta et al 2002 shappell et al 2008 but unintended intermediates may be generated at sub optimal ph chanda et al 2006b onundi et al 2017 shen et al 2011 for example during bpa oxidation by taml h2o2 bpa is condensed into oligomers at neutral ph while destroyed to small molecules at ph 11 onundi et al 2017 the initial step of taml h2o2 oxidative degradation of bpa at neutral ph is set followed by h abstraction eq 11 fig s7 the primary radical cation molecules are the precursors of the coupled c c and c o dimers a potential explanation is that the removal of an electron from the homo of the molecule leads to this pathway indicating that the set from the bpa to the oxidized taml was a rate limiting reaction steps a hydrogen atom h 18 or h 19 with higher positive charge fig 4b is removed subsequently the oxidative coupling reactions of bpa is in agreement with natural hrp h2o2 systems huang and weber 2005 for the fast and complete degradation at ph 10 the bpa undergoes set followed by heterolysis possibly occurred between c 6 or c 12 and c 19 to form hydroquinone and then destroyed through ring fission pathways the possible rate limiting step under this condition is hydrogen atom transfer thus constitute of total molecule h c plays a vital role in the oxidation of acs eq 12 to summarize ph dependent reactivity and degradation pathways yield different qsar models at neutral and basic ph values underscoring the importance to consider ph depending mechanism when using taml h2o2 in wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions we demonstrated rapid taml h2o2 based oxidation of a broad range of acs indicating that this advanced oxidation process had great potential as an efficient approach for water purification first order degradation rate constants k obs for 29 acs were determined at ph 7 and ph 10 and were used to develop qsar models to predict rate constants and inform rate limiting mechanisms these models are ln k obs 2 32 1 95 e homo 11 6 qh 27 9 f min at ph 7 and ln k o b s 35 6 4 53 e h o m o 7 42 h c at ph 10 accordingly the reactivity of taml h2o2 increases with the electron donating ability and is influenced by the electrostatic distribution and molecular composition of acs hammett constants are simple but not accurate predictors of rate constants for phenolic compounds different reaction pathways may occur for some acs under various ph values as is the case for natural enzymes these models could be used as a prescreening tool to identify which acs could be efficiently oxidized and provide novel insight on ph dependent degradation mechanism for such non radical mediated advanced oxidation processes the high efficiency of taml based treatment simulated by our qsar model is based on parameters determined under laboratory conditions this model could also apply to organic contaminants oxidation in complex wastewater matrices however this would require determining system specific rate constants for the taml h2o2 system in the presence of potentially interfering constituents e g natural organic

19548,tetra amido macrocyclic ligand taml activator is a functional analog of peroxidase enzymes which activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to form high valence iron oxo complexes that selectively degrade persistent aromatic organic contaminants acs in water here we develop quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models based on measured pseudo first order kinetic rate coefficients k obs of 29 acs e g phenols and pharmaceuticals oxidized by taml h2o2 at neutral and basic ph values to gain mechanistic insight on the selectivity and ph dependence of taml h2o2 systems these qsar models infer that electron donating ability e homo is the most important ac characteristic for taml h2o2 oxidation pointing to a rate limiting single electron transfer set mechanism oxidation rates at ph 7 also depend on ac reactive indices such as f m i n and qh which respectively represent propensity for electrophilic attack and the most positive net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms at ph 10 taml h2o2 is more reactive towards acs with a lower hydrogen to carbon atoms ratio h c suggesting the significance of hydrogen atom abstraction in addition ln k obs of 14 monosubstituted phenols is negatively correlated with hammett constants σ and exhibits similar sensitivity to substituent effects as horseradish peroxidase although accurately predicting degradation rates of specific acs in complex wastewater matrices could be difficult these qsar models are statistically robust and help predict both relative degradability and reaction mechanism for taml h2o2 based treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative structure activity relationship taml oxidation aromatic organic contaminants 1 introduction a variety of natural and synthetic refractory aromatic organic contaminants acs such as phenolic compounds and pharmaceuticals break through wastewater treatment plants and are released into natural water systems which can impact aquatic ecosystems and human health pal et al 2010 this has increased interest in tertiary wastewater treatment physical adsorption filtration granular activated carbon and membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes aops e g ozonation fenton oxidation and persulfate based oxidation have been considered to remove trace acs but the high financial and energy costs have limited their applications zheng et al 2017 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2017b the tetra amido macrocyclic ligand catalyst taml fig 1 which is as a functional analog of peroxidase enzyme is a simple and potentially effective green alternative to aops gupta et al 2002 taml activates hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to form a high valence iron oxo complex that is very reactive and more selective for oxidation of acs than aop generated easily scavenged free radicals in complex wastewater matrices chanda et al 2006a the toxicity of contaminated water was reported to dramatically decrease after treatment with taml h2o2 and residual traces of taml had no adverse effects on fish or microorganisms ellis et al 2010 additionally taml can be used at very low nm to low μm concentrations e g 1 kg of catalysts could treat 20 000 tons of water shappell et al 2008 and offers high efficiency for near stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide utilization tang et al 2016 accordingly taml has been used to degrade a wide variety of acs in wastewater including dyes chahbane et al 2007 chanda et al 2006a ellis et al 2009 estrogenic compounds chen et al 2012 onundi et al 2017 shappell et al 2008 persistent chloro gupta et al 2002 nitro kundu et al 2015 and bromo wang et al 2017a phenols thiophosphate pesticides chanda et al 2006b molluscicides tang et al 2016 and drugs shen et al 2011 taml activates h2o2 to form oxidized taml which in turn oxidizes the ac molecule and restores itself to taml scheme 1 the initial rates of ac oxidation are given by eq 1 in which taml 0 is the total concentration of taml catalyst k i is the first order rate constant for taml oxidation k i is the rate constant for the reversal reaction and k ii is the rate constant for ac oxidation chahbane et al 2007 if k i h 2 o 2 k ii ac and k i is negligible eq 1 simplifies to eq 2 1 d ac d t k i k ii h 2 o 2 ac k i k i h 2 o 2 k ii ac taml 0 2 d ac d t k ii ac taml 0 k obs ac the reactivity of oxidized taml towards different acs is highly variable table s1 depending on the structures of both taml and the target acs previously it was shown that the electron withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring of taml enhance both k i and k ii chahbane et al 2007 however little is known about how ac structure affects treatment efficiency furthermore the speciation of oxidized taml changes with ph ghosh et al 2008 which in turn affects both reaction rates and products distribution chanda et al 2006b onundi et al 2017 therefore taml based treatment process optimization and reliability enhancement requires improved understanding and accurate prediction of how ac structure and solution ph affect reaction mechanisms and kinetics quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models are powerful tools to correlate degradation rates and physicochemical properties of molecules numerous successful qsar models have been used to predict reaction rate constants for organic contaminants oxidation by ozone o3 sudhakaran and amy 2013 chlorine dioxide clo2 lee and von gunten 2012 uv luo et al 2018a uv h2o2 xiao et al 2016 hexavalent ferrate fe vi ye et al 2017 and free radicals such as oh borhani et al 2016 luo et al 2017a xiao et al 2017 and so4 xiao et al 2015 luo et al 2018b for example the second order rate constant for the reaction of horseradish peroxidase hrp with 32 phenolic or aniline compounds was positively correlated with hammett sigma constants na and lee 2017 furthermore the second order rate constants for the oxidation of 34 aromatic compounds by fe vi which is another high valence iron oxo compound was negatively correlated with ionization potential ip ye et al 2017 this implies that set was the rate limiting first step these examples demonstrate the potential of qsar models to predict rate constants of diverse acs oxidation reactions and to inform rate limiting mechanisms in this work we develop qsar models to predict reactivity and elucidate the reaction mechanism and selectivity of taml h2o2 based oxidative treatment based on rate constants measured for 29 acs at ph 7 and ph 10 representative molecule descriptors 42 in total including constitutional geometrical physicochemical quantum chemical and electrostatic descriptors were considered to develop models by stepwise multiple linear regression mlr correlation analyses internal and external validation and applicability domain assessment were also conducted to assess the statistical robustness of these models and to gain mechanistic insight on rate limiting reactions 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium salt of taml was obtained from greenox

depended on the solubility 2 2 kinetic experiments the batch experiments were conducted according to the following procedures each experiment was performed with 25 ml reaction solution in a 50 ml

metalation i e loss of the iron metal of taml results in irreversible activity loss at acidic ph with cleavage of the fe n bond in taml occurring at ph lower than 4 ghosh et al 2003 considering the ph

tropsha et al 2003 statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss statistics software version 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development table 1 summarizes the measured rate constants of taml h2o2 oxidation for 29 acs at ph 7 and ph 10 reaction kinetics followed pseudo first order figs s1 and s2 with k obs values at ph 7 ranging over two orders of magnitude from 4 0 10 4 min 1 for metronidazole to 6 9 10 2 min 1 for 4 aminophenol the k obs values were transformed into natural logarithm units ln k obs to reduce the span of the data the qsar models were developed with the ln k obs in the training set n 22 and all 42 molecular descriptors a correlation analysis between the ln k obs and selected individual descriptors was performed to assess the interrelationship strengths the correlation coefficients r and the statistical significances were listed in table s5 among the descriptors correlated with ln k obs at ph 7 e homo r 0 69 ip r 0 64 ζ r 0 56 and f m i n r 0 53 are highly significant p 0 01 the results at ph 10 are similar and the order of correlation coefficients p 0 05 is e homo r 0 74 ip r 0 70 ζ r 0 60 f m i n r 0 47 oh r 0 37 however e homo is highly negatively correlated with ip r 0 95 p 0 01 suggesting the collinearity between them interestingly strongly negative correlation has also been found in e lumo with ea and ω proving that the calculated e lumo can be used for estimating these two descriptors zhan et al 2003 moreover the ln k obs values obtained at phs 7 and 10 have a correlation coefficient of 0 95 p 0 01 indicating taml h2o2 systems may have similar reactive preference toward these acs at different phs to avoid missing descriptors with low correlation but high importance all 42 descriptors were selected for stepwise mlr analysis and 6 models were listed in table s6 although the coefficient of determination r 2 increases as the number of variables increases the p value of the last model for ph 10 is larger than 0 05 thus ab was excluded from the model the models for ph 7 and ph 10 were obtained as eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 ln k obs 2 32 1 95 e homo 11 6 qh 27 9 f m i n ph 7 n 22 r 2 0 762 f 18 1 p 0 01 vif 1 2 q

ph 7 and ph 10 are 0 762 and 0 747 respectively which suggest that these qsar models reasonably fitted well with the training set the reasonable f values 18 1 and 26 6 and low p level 0 01 indicate these ln k obs values are unlikely distributed under the null hypothesis which would be rejected further the vif values are less than 1 2 indicating no potential collinearities among the descriptors included in the models the values of r 2 0 6 f 15 p 0 05 and vif 10 all meet the minimum statistical robustness criteria tropsha et al 2003 for internal validation n 22 both q loo 2 values 0 627 and 0 626 are larger than 0 5 corroborating that the models are statistically robust with no obvious over fitting the models predict reasonably well the reactivity of the acs used for external validation n 7 the calculated q ext 2 values are 0 566 and 0 619 for ph 7 and 10 respectively the ambtraining is 1 03 and 1 75 and the ambtest is 1 01 and 0 90 for ph 7 and ph 10 respectively the absolute model bias 100 and 86 2 for ph 7 and ph 10 is within a factor of 0 5 2 confirming the predictive power of the qsar models the comparison of measured and predicted ln k obs value is shown in fig 2 the 1 1 solid line shows perfect agreement among the different families of acs the monosubstituted phenols exhibit relatively high ln k obs but the goodness of the fitting is similar for all acs moreover the probability probability p p plots show random normal distribution for observed standard residuals demonstrating the validity of the regression models fig s3 the williams plot was used to evaluate the applicability domain of the qsar models for oxidation of acs fig 3 the horizontal dash lines are standardized residual outliers 3 and vertical dash lines are warning leverages h 0 545 and 0 409 as can be seen from fig 3 all data points in the training set and the test set fall into applicability domain indicating the qsar models are reliable for predicting k obs of acs by taml h2o2 only diphenhydramine has relatively high leverage h 0 499 but does not exceed h however the models fit these data reasonably well with small standardized residuals which improves model stability no significant difference was found in the applicability domain for different families of acs suggesting that the qsar models are broadly applicable to phenolic compounds pharmaceuticals and organic acids 3 2 implications of model descriptors the qsar models expressed as eq 11 and eq 12 show that quantum chemical e homo and electrostatic f m i n qh descriptors are directly proportional to ln k obs whereas constitutional descriptor h c is inversely proportional to it the contribution of each variable to eq 11 is 44 8 for e homo 27 9 for qh and 27 3 for f m i n respectively for eq 12 e homo and h c contributed 63 4 and 36 6 of the variance both models include e homo the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital which may be the predominant factor affecting the reactivity of acs towards taml h2o2 the experimental ln k obs exhibits a linear trend when correlated with the respective e homo figs s4a and s4b although the coefficients of determination are relatively low r 2 0 47 for ph 7 and r 2 0 55 for ph 10 the general trends show that reactivity increases with e homo the compounds with higher e homo are better electron donors 4 aminophenol has the highest e homo and hence the strongest ability to donate electrons the reaction of high valence iron oxo species with organic compounds is known to be an electrophilic reaction via a set process chahbane et al 2007 the descriptor e homo has frequently been included in other qsar models for oxidation reactions for example lee et al 2015 developed a qsar model for the second order rate constants of the reaction between o3 and 112 aromatic micropollutants in aquatic systems they reported r 2 values of 0 82 1 00 with only e homo as a descriptor salter blanc et al 2016 built qsar models for relative rate constants of aromatic amine oxidation by manganese dioxide mno2 and found that e homo calculated by different functionals hartree fock b3lyp or m06 2x and basis sets 6 31g or 6 311 g 2d 2p correlate well with the logarithm of the relative rate constants in addition to o3 and mineral oxidants the rate constants of biocatalysts such as hrp and bovine methemoglobin are also positively correlated with the e homo of monosubstituted phenols pérez prior et al 2012 sakurada et al 1990 these similarities are consistent with the peroxidase like reaction of taml h2o2 systems indicating that the oxidation rate is controlled by the set from the acs to the active iron center other quantum chemical descriptors such as e gap and ip have been used to establish qsar models for organic contaminants oxidation by o3 sudhakaran and amy 2013 so4 xiao et al 2015 luo et al 2018b and fe vi ye et al 2017 in aqueous systems no significant correlation was found between ln k obs and e gap which is the predominant descriptor affecting oxidation by so4 xiao et al 2015 this suggests that the reactions of taml h2o2 with the acs used here are less likely to proceed through the nucleophilic addition pathway ip is approximately equal to the negative e homo table s5 but less significant than e homo for taml h2o2 oxidation thus excluded by stepwise mlr fukui indices f i f i and f i 0 could quantitatively reflect the respective affinity with nucleophilic attack electrophilic attack and radical attack which may suggest reaction mechanisms for example zhu et al 2015 measured the rate constants of o3 with 33 kinds of acs under acidic conditions and observed that ln k obs correlates strongly with f m a x 0 which represented radical attack for the reaction at ph 7 the correlation between descriptor f m i n and ln k obs is not high but significant r 0 53 p 0 01 fig s4c shows that the acs with higher f m i n have higher ln k obs therefore the susceptibility of acs towards attack by electrophiles influences the reactivity of oxidized taml to some extent qh describes the hydrogen bond donating and electrostatic attraction ability deciding the reactive sites of a molecule to be dehydrogenated acs at neutral ph with greater net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms may possess higher reactivity toward oxidized taml as suggested by the positive coefficient of qh most acs with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups have qh value around 0 5 except for diphenhydramine 0 264 and sulfanilamide 0 437 fig s4e the n h or c h bonds in these two drugs do not react with taml activators easily though the h abstraction reaction pathway the qh was also positively correlate to the rate constants of oh in the established qsar model luo et al 2017b thus qh is considered a general electrostatic descriptor characterizing interactions between oxidants and acs whether for radical or non radical oxidation the computed electrostatic potential on the molecular surface of two example acs 4 chlorophenol and bpa are shown in fig 4 in which the blue color represents most positive value while the red color illustrates most negative value the overall electrostatic potential between 4 chlorophenol and bpa was similar indicating comparable reactivity with taml h2o2 hydrogen atoms h 13 of 4 chlorophenol h 18 and h 19 of bpa in hydroxyl groups have the largest qh and are more easily removed from these compounds condensed fukui indices distribution yield additional insight the f m i n lies in c 5 of 4 chlorophenol and c 19 of bpa while f m a x locates near atoms with f m i n cl 8 of 4 chlorophenol c 6 and c 12 of bpa these regions atoms with their bonds indicate the likely reactive sites for attack by oxidized taml the second important descriptor of the ph 10 model is h c which is not included in models at ph 7 indicating a mechanistic difference between the reaction at ph 7 and ph 10 the negative coefficient of h c indicates that at ph 10 acs with lower ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms have higher reactivity toward oxidized taml this suggests that taml reacts slowly with the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule and h abstraction reaction is a crucial step in acs oxidation nevertheless the correlation between ln k obs and single descriptor h c is not significant fig s4d indicating h c should be considered in combination with other factors h c is a simple constitutional descriptor that was not commonly used in previous qsar models however the similar descriptor o c exhibited an opposite negative correlation with rate constants for organic contaminants oxidation by so4 xiao et al 2015 a high o c ratio means that fewer c h atoms react by abstracting a hydrogen atom with free so4 similar results were reported for oh generated by o3 for oxidation of organic micropollutants in four river water matrices sudhakaran et al 2012 however unlike oxidation by taml h2o2 those are radical based reactions 3 3 hammett correlations acs with electron donating groups are more likely to react through the set pathway than that with electron withdrawing groups luo et al 2017c due to the possible occurrence of the set pathway for ac oxidation by taml h2o2 we investigated the influence of electron donating groups on the relative rate constants k rel k rel k obs k phenol of monosubstituted phenols using phenol as the reference compound for normalization fig s5 amino hydroxyl and methoxy groups were categorized as strong electron donating groups whereas aminoacyl and methyl groups are moderate and weak electron donating groups respectively halogen formyl and nitro groups are weak moderate and strong electron withdrawing groups respectively luo et al 2017c as shown in fig s5 ln k rel decreases in general from strong electron donating groups to strong electron withdrawing groups however the relatively low ln k rel value of resorcinol with meta hydroxyl group and high ln k rel value of halogen substituted phenols are in contrast with the trend this is attributed to different rates of subsequent reaction pathways e g h abstraction following the set reaction hammett constants σ σ and σ are useful for quantitatively examining the inductive and resonance effect of substituents of acs especially phenols and anilines on the reaction kinetics lee and von gunten 2012 the σ and σ are particular scopes of σ constants for the electron donating substituents and the electron withdrawing substituents respectively which have been used for stabilization of reaction centers via resonance interaction with substituents lee and von gunten 2012 the large negative values of hammett constants describing electron donating properties of substituents while electron withdrawing substituents have positive value therefore hammett correlations were established between ln k obs of a series of monosubstituted phenols and the hammett constants σ σ and σ are listed in table s7 the rate constants of a series of substituted phenols are negatively correlated to σ and σ but in poor correlation with σ fig 5 and fig s6 this suggests that the regression equations on fig 5a and d with relatively high r 2 0 74 are simple for predicting the rate constant ln k obs for the oxidation of phenolic contaminants by taml h2o2 where 25 out of 28 89 3 predicted ln k obs are within a factor of 0 5 2 the ln k obs is inversely proportional to hammett constants which is typical for electrophilic reactions these results are consistent with previous studies on the oxidation of phenols and anilines by relevant oxidants o3 lee and von gunten 2012 clo2 lee and von gunten 2012 fe vi lee and von gunten 2012 bovine methemoglobin pérez prior et al 2012 lactoperoxidase zhang and dunford 1993 and hrp na and lee 2017 but are different from oxidation processes with singlet oxygen 1o2 tratnyek and hoigne 1991 and mno2 salter blanc et al 2016 which correlate better with σ constants the slope ρ of the correlation reflects the sensitivity of the reaction to the substituent effect the lower slope ρ 3 63 and 1 98 for variables σ and σ respectively of the ph 7 model compared to that for ph 10 ρ 5 83 and 3 41 for variables σ and σ respectively indicates that reaction at ph 7 is less sensitive to the substituent variation this is consistent with the hammett relationships based on σ for oxidation kinetics of neutral and deprotonated phenolics by fe vi lee and von gunten 2012 and potassium permanganate mn vii song et al 2015 these observations suggest that the reaction mechanism for taml h2o2 with phenols at ph 7 is different from that at ph 10 the hammett correlation between log k ii at ph 10 and σ fig s6d shows that the slope ρ 1 48 is similar to that of hrp ρ 2 0 na and lee 2017 this similar sensitivity to the substituent effect may be due to the comparative reactivity of phenols by enzyme mimic taml and natural peroxidase the ln k obs values of halogenated phenols 4 chlorophenol and 4 bromophenol are higher than those predicted by hammett constants indicating that the reactivity of phenols with taml h2o2 may not simply follow the hammett correlations they were therefore excluded in the linear regression this is in contrast to the oxidation of chloro and bromo substituted bpa by taml h2o2 which have lower k ii than pristine bpa and methyl substituted bpa onundi et al 2017 it is known that the halogen substituents are weak electron withdrawing groups that can reduce the electron density of aromatic compounds making them resistant to chemical or biological oxidation nevertheless taml h2o2 could completely mineralize chlorophenols through an oxidative ring opening pathway and the degradation rate increased with an increased number of electron withdrawing chlorine groups on the phenol ring initial degradation rate pentachlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol which disagrees with the hammett correlation collins et al 2010 gupta et al 2002 a possible reason is that the higher f m i n value of 4 chlorophenol 0 026 and 4 bromophenol 0 025 make them more susceptibly attack by oxidized taml fig 4a the ln k obs of salicylaldehyde is also significantly larger than the qsar prediction the ortho substituted hydroxybenzaldehyde was predicted to have lower ln k obs than the para substituted compounds but the opposite result was observed similar discrepancies were found for nitrophenol oxidation by taml activators 2 nitrophenol has higher k i 154 m 1 s 1 than 4 nitrophenol k i 33 m 1 s 1 kundu et al 2015 note that the 4 nitrophenol is a strong inhibitor of catalytic activity due to steric suppression of reversible binding of nitrophenolate anions to the iron center kundu et al 2015 this suggests that 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde exerts a similar steric effect thus limiting the value of hammett correlations 3 4 the ph dependent mechanism considerable differences between taml h2o2 oxidation of acs at neutral and basic ph were observed both in the qsar models and hammett correlations this indicates that the reaction mechanism changes with ph furthermore the rate constants of acs in our study and previous studies show strong ph dependent reactions of taml activators this ph dependent feature could be attributed to two possible reasons 1 the reactive species of oxidized taml formed by taml and h2o2 were generated faster at ph 10 higher k i 2 the dissociated acs most with pka 10 at ph 10 have a higher electron density and thus are more reactive to electrophilic agents oxidized taml both effects lead to a significant increase in rate as ph increases from 7 to 10 from scheme 1 the taml h2o2 generally form an oxidized taml then reacts with acs these highly reactive species were characterized as high valence iron oxo complex fev o de oliveira et al 2007 or feiv o ghosh et al 2008 depending on ph the deprotonated form of taml with 2 charge has the highest activity to react with h2o2 at around ph 10 ghosh et al 2008 and the k i decreases above ph 10 due to the deprotonation of h2o2 pka 11 suggesting that the highest reactivity of taml h2o2 falls in a narrow range between ph 10 and 11 our qsar models helps understand the results of acs degradation at different ph values generally acs are rapidly destroyed and toxicity decreases at the optimal ph gupta et al 2002 shappell et al 2008 but unintended intermediates may be generated at sub optimal ph chanda et al 2006b onundi et al 2017 shen et al 2011 for example during bpa oxidation by taml h2o2 bpa is condensed into oligomers at neutral ph while destroyed to small molecules at ph 11 onundi et al 2017 the initial step of taml h2o2 oxidative degradation of bpa at neutral ph is set followed by h abstraction eq 11 fig s7 the primary radical cation molecules are the precursors of the coupled c c and c o dimers a potential explanation is that the removal of an electron from the homo of the molecule leads to this pathway indicating that the set from the bpa to the oxidized taml was a rate limiting reaction steps a hydrogen atom h 18 or h 19 with higher positive charge fig 4b is removed subsequently the oxidative coupling reactions of bpa is in agreement with natural hrp h2o2 systems huang and weber 2005 for the fast and complete degradation at ph 10 the bpa undergoes set followed by heterolysis possibly occurred between c 6 or c 12 and c 19 to form hydroquinone and then destroyed through ring fission pathways the possible rate limiting step under this condition is hydrogen atom transfer thus constitute of total molecule h c plays a vital role in the oxidation of acs eq 12 to summarize ph dependent reactivity and degradation pathways yield different qsar models at neutral and basic ph values underscoring the importance to consider ph depending mechanism when using taml h2o2 in wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions we demonstrated rapid taml h2o2 based oxidation of a broad range of acs indicating that this advanced oxidation process had great potential as an efficient approach for water purification first order degradation rate constants k obs for 29 acs were determined at ph 7 and ph 10 and were used to develop qsar models to predict rate constants and inform rate limiting mechanisms these models are ln k obs 2 32 1 95 e homo 11 6 qh 27 9 f min at ph 7 and ln k o b s 35 6 4 53 e h o m o 7 42 h c at ph 10 accordingly the reactivity of taml h2o2 increases with the electron donating ability and is influenced by the electrostatic distribution and molecular composition of acs hammett constants are simple but not accurate predictors of rate constants for phenolic compounds different reaction pathways may occur for some acs under various ph values as is the case for natural enzymes these models could be used as a prescreening tool to identify which acs could be efficiently oxidized and provide novel insight on ph dependent degradation mechanism for such non radical mediated advanced oxidation processes the high efficiency of taml based treatment simulated by our qsar model is based on parameters determined under laboratory conditions this model could also apply to organic contaminants oxidation in complex wastewater matrices however this would require determining system specific rate constants for the taml h2o2 system in the presence of potentially interfering constituents e g natural organic

19549,nitrate has been recognized as a global threat to environmental health in this regard the hyporheic zone saturated media beneath and adjacent to the stream bed plays a crucial role in attenuating groundwater nitrate prior to discharge into surface water while different nitrate removal pathways have been investigated over recent decades the adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments under natural conditions has not yet been identified in this study the natural attenuation capacity of the hyporheic sediments of the ghezel ozan river located in the north west of iran was determined the sampled sediments from 1 m below the stream bed were characterized via xrd ft ir bet sem bjh and zeta potential nitrate adsorption was evaluated using a batch experiment with hyporheic pore water from each study site the study was performed in the hyporheic sediments of two morphologically different zones including z1 located in the parafluvial zone having the clay sediment texture 57 8 clay with smectite illite mixed layer clay type and z2 located in the river confluence area containing silty clay sediment texture 47 6 clay with smectite kaolinite mixed layer clay type data obtained from the batch experiment were subjected to pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich mass transfer kinetic models to characterize the nitrate adsorption mechanism furthermore to replicate nitrate removal efficiencies of the hyporheic sediments under natural conditions the sampled hyporheic pore waters were applied as initial solutions to run the batch experiment the results of the artificial nitrate solution correlated well with pseudo second order r 2 95 in both z1 and z2 and maximum removal efficiencies of 85 3 and 71 2 adsorbent dosage 90 g l ph 5 5 initial adsorbate concentration of 90 mg l were achieved in z1 and z2 respectively the results of the nitrate adsorption analysis revealed that the nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 17 24 1 86 in z1 during the wet season to 28 13 0 89 in z2 during the dry season the results obtained by this study yielded strong evidence of the potential of hyporheic sediments to remove nitrate from an aqueous environment with great efficiency graphical abstract image keywords nitrate adsorption capacity kinetic models hyporheic zone removal efficiency ghezel ozan river 1 introduction the excess of nitrate in groundwater is a major concern worldwide palko et al 2017 the high concentration of nitrate in groundwater is mainly sourced from improper wastewater treatment and excess application of nitrogen fertilizers meghdadi and javar 2017 and in drinking water such high concentrations can seriously affect human health and the ecosystem in general for instance transformation of nitrate ions from nitrite causes a reduction in the oxygen capacity of human blood cells and a subsequent generation of carcinogenic nitrosamine hérissan et al 2017 increased nitrate concentration in a water system leads to hypoxia low water oxygen content altered biodiversity widespread habitat degradation changes in food web structure and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms hautier et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 therefore nitrate removal from aquifers is of prime importance for the environment and ecosystem health in addition characterizing naturally occurring nitrate removal pathways are of critical importance particularly for decision makers in terms of adopting practical and targeted soil and groundwater remediation strategies the hyporheic zone can be conceptualized as the portion of saturated sediments surrounding the stream boano et al 2014 where the groundwater is physically and geochemically influenced by exchange across the sediment water interface cardenas 2009 weatherill et al 2018 to evaluate the attenuation capacity of hyporheic sediments various natural attenuation mechanisms and a number of different techniques to remove nitrate from aquatic systems have been studied including ion exchange alikhani and moghbeli 2014 biological denitrification chung et al 2014 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra roland et al 2017 electrochemical reduction öznülüer et al 2013 catalytic reduction wada et al 2012 reverse osmosis richards et al 2010 and adsorption fazlzadeh et al 2017 all of these methods have shortcomings the conventional techniques such as reverse osmosis are relatively costly biological denitrification requires sufficient amounts of organic carbon sources to be successful cameron and schipper 2010 in dnra nitrate converts to another form of nitrogen compound ammonia and cannot be permanently removed from the aqueous system an and gardner 2002 due to electro chemical reduction the electrodes used in the electrochemical method easily become inactive ammonia and nitrite are hazardous by products of the catalytic reduction method rivett et al 2008 adsorption has been recognized as a superior method compared to biologically mediated ones because of design simplicity and ease of operation kyzas and matis 2015 furthermore it is an environmentally friendly mechanism that does not generate any harmful by products has low operational cost and involves a sludge free operation lahot and tiwari 2016 many efforts have been made to conceptualize the different mechanisms and factors which lead to the attenuation of nitrate in hyporheic sediments for instance krause et al 2013 investigated the effect of hyporheic physical properties on nitrogen cycling and the fate of nitrate particularly at upwelling locations by considering the zonation and depth dependent patterns of nitrate concentration in another study by krause et al 2009 the influence of spatial and seasonal variations in the physio chemical properties of the hyporheic sediments as well as the hydraulic head on attenuation of hyporheic nitrate particularly in the groundwater discharge zone were scrutinized biogeochemical processes regulating hyporheic nitrate attenuation denitrification dnra and assimilation of nitrate by microorganisms have been widely studied e g sovik and morkved 2008 compared with dnra and assimilation by microorganisms biological denitrification has been identified as a dominant nitrate depletion mechanism in the hyporheic zone dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes including sediment denitrification dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation are other nitrate removal pathways for which the rate of groundwater nitrate depletion via dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes have been studied worldwide deng et al 2015 yin et al 2015 in addition numerous synthetic adsorbents such as bio sorbents e g chitosan hu et al 2015 agricultural waste e g rice hull and carbonate base sorbents e g carbon nanotube bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 have been investigated during the last decade to attenuate nitrate in light of the above the capacity of hyporheic sediments to attenuate nitrate via adsorption and under natural conditions has almost never been considered in this study the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic sediments via adsorption was therefore assessed in hyporheic sediments of the ghezel ozan river a third order river in the north west of iran in this regard first the physiochemical properties of sampled sediments collected from sediments at 1 m below the riverbed were characterized by xrd sem ft ir and bet pore size distribution analysis second the adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments was analyzed via a batch experiment by adding different nitrate solutions subjected to various physiochemical conditions lastly the actual nitrate removal efficiency via adsorption was quantified in the laboratory by applying the collected hyporheic pore water to better reflect the effect of spatial and seasonal variations on nitrate adsorption 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sampling and laboratory analysis the study was performed on the ghezel ozan river within the tarom watershed in the north west of iran fig 1 the geology of this river is mainly late tertiary to early quaternary calcareous sand and clay particles meghdadi and eyvazi 2017

zhan et al 2011 the e value of 0 59 kj mol z1 and 0 42 kj mol z2 revealed that the adsorption mechanism was of a physical nature thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δġ enthalpy δḣ and

adsorbent characterization a brief description of the physical and chemical properties of the hyporheic sediments adsorbents is presented in table 1 it was clear that both adsorbents had high surface areas with microporous surface structures in addition the sems of adsorbent surfaces prior to and after nitrate adsorption in two different areas are illustrated in fig 2 the difference in the surface of the hyporheic sediments were observed in which irregular protrusion and heterogeneous morphology on the solid surface after adsorption is attributed to the swelling effects of the clay minerals during the process furthermore the sem images of the hyporheic sediments revealed the porous irregular and uneven structure of the material which provided a perfect substrate for the nitrate ions to be adsorbed trapping them onto the surface of the sediments the x ray diffraction analysis of hyporheic sediments sampled from saturated sediments beneath the riverbed fig 1 are illustrated in fig 3 a the different crystalline peaks of the adsorbents s k k and s i are evident by comparing the xrd patterns of adsorbents some new peaks were produced and some peaks were reduced the clay mineralogical properties of adsorbents were characterized mainly as smectite illite and smectite kaolinite furthermore physical and geochemical characteristics of the adsorbents are described in table 1 accordingly the hyporheic sediments sampled from the west side of the watershed z1 are mainly clay textured with average pore diameter of 68 42 ȧ and the sample from the east side of the watershed z2 is silty clay textured with 59 84 ȧ as an average pore size diameter table 1 semi quantitative xrd analyses for sediment size 2 mm are discussed in table 2 in this study for the sake of convenience the clay textured sediment containing a smectite illite mixed layer type located in z1 fig 1 was referred to as z1 and the silty clay soil texture with a smectite kaolinite mixed layer clay type located in z2 fig 1 was termed z2 quartz and feldspar were common in both adsorbents table 2 and fig 3a the total pore volume bet specific surface area and average pore size of the adsorbents were 0 028cm3 gr 113 13m2 gr and 68 42 ȧ for z1 and 0 02cm3 gr 81 22m2 gr and 59 84 ȧ for z2 the affinity of nitrate for the hyporheic sediments estimated as bet specific surface area and pore volume were respectively large for each zone the barrett joyner halenda bjh distribution of pore sizes is shown in fig 3b in this regard 87 9 of pore sizes in z1 and 85 3 of pore sizes in z2 were between 2 and 50 nm according to the iupac pore size classification the bjh pore size distribution displayed the mesoporous nature of the adsorbents due to the small nitrate ionic radius the adsorbents were conducive to nitrate penetration into the adsorbent inner layer donohue and aranovich 1999 the ftir spectra of the adsorbents is depicted in fig 3c the ftir spectra analysis was employed to determine the functional groups explaining the adsorbate adsorption characteristics the broad adsorption peaks between 400 and 800 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of al o and si o bands hu et al 2015 between 850 and 1100 cm 1 related to the stretching vibration of c o bands mena duran et al 2007 and 3600 4000 cm 1 ascribed to the series of o h bands from sio2 groups djomgoue and njopwouo 2013 the ftir spectra prior to nitrate adsorption showed a wide range of stretching vibrational peaks between 850 and 1100 cm 1 1843 2054 cm 1 and 2436 2589 cm 1 for z1 and between 2386 and 2493 cm 1 and 3246 3305 cm 1 for z2 it was obvious from comparison of the curves before and after adsorption that peaks between 850 and 1100 cm 1 2436 2589 cm 1 and 3234 3318 cm 1 in z1 disappeared after the reaction and the transmittance between 1854 and 1996 cm 1 slightly decreased due to the creation of a dipole moment charge suggesting that new chemical bonds were created between adsorbents and nitrate ions the same interpretation is valid for z2 moreover the appearance of a strong bending vibrational peak after adsorption at 1383 4 cm 1 z1 and 1384 1 cm 1 z2 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of the n o bond that represented the occurrence of nitrate adsorption on the solid surface of the adsorbents fazlzadeh et al 2017 3 2 adsorption capacity analysis in this study the nitrate adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments was assessed by implementing different initial concentrations 10 180 mg l of nano3 and various contact times 10 360 min the relationship between initial nitrate concentrations adsorption capacity and nitrate removal efficiency for both z1 and z2 is depicted in fig 4 a the adsorption capacity increased from 0 16 to 0 82 mg g and from 0 11 to 0 69 mg g with the increase in initial adsorbate concentration in z1 and z2 respectively the results of the adsorption isotherm analysis in z1 and z2 are illustrated in fig 4b and table 3 all isotherms except the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm demonstrated favourable correlations table 3 the calculated rl corresponding to the different initial adsorbate concentrations varied from 0 152 to 0 617 and from 0 217 to 0 714 in z1 and z2 respectively it is typically stated that jain et al 2010 the rl values having the range of 0 rl 1 represented the favourable adsorption of adsorbate onto the different adsorbents meanwhile the langmuir freundlich isotherm known as sip s equation with the highest correlation coefficient incorporated both langmuir and freundlich models and operated as a versatile isotherm to well describe the experimental data jeppu and clement 2012 3 3 adsorption kinetics the procedure of nitrate adsorption as well as the related rate of controlling mechanisms for nitrate removal were investigated at room temperature 25 c as a function of contact time initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l fig 5 using four commonly applied kinetic models including pseudo first order ding et al 2013 pseudo second order ding et al 2013 intra particle diffusion foo and hameed 2010 and elovich mass transfer models foo and hameed 2010 table 4 outlines the linear expression formulas associated parameters and correlation coefficients r2 for the initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l in both z1 and z2 the fitting of experimental data to the linear forms initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l in both z1 and z2 and the correlative parameters of these four kinetic models with were represented in fig 5 it was observed that all kinetic models except the intra particle diffusion fitted well with the experimental data r2 0 9 which indicated the high applicability of those three adsorption kinetics fig 6 and table 4 the adsorption reactions were rapid in the first 60 120 min for the 10 mg l and 180 mg l initial adsorbate concentrations respectively which were followed by a slow incremental trend until adsorption equilibriums were achieved 3 4 thermodynamic effect on adsorption capacity temperature was regarded as a key controlling factor for adjusting the adsorption capacity the adsorption of the adsorbate was investigated at four different temperatures 278 288 298 and 308 k fig 7 a and b a constant adsorbate concentration 90 mg l an adsorbent dosage of 50 g l a ph of 5 5 and 120 min contact time using the van t hoff methods rezaei kalantary et al 2016 the magnitude of the thermodynamic parameters and variation in the nitrate removal capacity with a temperature change from 278 k 308 k are illustrated in table 5 and fig 7a and b respectively as temperature increased the more adsorbate ions were removed from the aqueous solution fig 7 also the positive values of δḣ and ea in both z1 and z2 table 5 suggested that the nitrate adsorption was an endothermic process also shown in fig 7c 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage on nitrate adsorption efficiency adsorbent dosage was an effective factor in the adsorption process the influence of adsorption dosage on the adsorbate removal efficiency and nitrate adsorption capacity in z1 and z2 is illustrated in fig 8 a the nitrate removal efficiency increased from 15 3 to 85 3 z1 and from 19 3 to 71 2 z2 with increases in adsorption dosage from 10 to 90 g l as shown in fig 8a on the other hand nitrate adsorption capacity decreased from 1 22 to 0 75 mg g in z1 and from 1 54 to 0 63 mg g in z2 3 6 effect of ph on nitrate removal efficiency the effect of ph on nitrate removal efficiency is described in fig 8b it was observed that with an increase in ph from 2 to 5 nitrate removal efficiency increased from 51 4 to 63 2 and from 46 15 to 58 16 in z1 and z2 respectively the highest nitrate removal efficiency was acquired at 5 ph 6 followed by a diminished removal efficiency as the ph became more alkaline in this regard the zeta potential of adsorbents in different ph values is depicted in fig 8b for both z1 and z2 the isoelectronic point of the adsorbents occurred at ph 4 indicating that the lower the ph the higher the positive surface charge of the solid surface of the adsorbents caused by higher attraction of the nitrate ions hence the increase of ph from 6 to 11 can decrease the adsorption capacity by creating a negative zeta potential in the surface of the adsorbents which caused an increase in the electrostatic repulsion of adsorbate to occur between nitrate charges in the aqueous solution 3 7 effect of co existing anions on adsorption capacity other ions such as k na nh4 ca2 mg2 cl hco3 f and so4 2 co existing with nitrate in an aquifer are able to exert a destructive influence on the nitrate adsorption process accordingly the competition effect of the above mentioned ions was studied at a ph of 5 5 fig 8c all ions had a negative impact on nitrate removal efficiency with the most adverse being so4 2 followed by cl and hco3 the other ions had slightly negative effects on nitrate removal efficiency 3 8 spatio seasonal variations in nitrate removal efficiency nitrate concentration ph cl hco3 temperature and so4 are among the most influential parameters affecting nitrate adsorption in this study to better conceptualize the actual nitrate removal efficiencies of the hyporheic sediments the sampled hyporheic waters were employed as initial solutions to assess actual nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic sediments spatial and seasonal variations of the influential geochemical parameters in the hyporheic pore water are described in table 6 the hyporheic water and the adsorbents which were collected from z1 and z2 were used for adsorption analysis at 90 g l of the adsorbent dosage 360 min contact time and at temperatures similar to those during the sampling period 29 c and 15 c for dry and wet seasons respectively theses experimental conditions were applied to mirror the environmental condition more accurately also the analysis of one way anova at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was employed to assess the variation of the actual nitrate removal efficiencies around the mean values it was observed that the nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic sediments significantly varied in zones and during different seasons fig 9 a the nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 17 24 1 86 in z1 n 5 p 0 05 during the wet season to 28 13 0 89 in z2 n 5 p 0 05 during the dry season fig 9a however the value of ph in z1 lies within the optimum ph range 5 5 6 5 section 3 6 but the higher so4 and cl concentrations of the hyporheic pore waters in z1 than z2 may comprise the primary reason for the relatively lower nitrate removal efficiency of z1 the maximum nitrate removal efficiencies for the artificial nitrate solutions achieved at 90 g l adsorbent dosage initial nitrate concentration of 180 mg l and ph of 5 5 were equal to 85 3 and 71 2 in z1 and z2 respectively n 5 p 0 05 on the other hand the maximum values of in stream adsorption efficiencies of nitrate adsorption were lower than the experimental values with maximum values during the dry season equal to 25 9 0 78 n 5 p 0 05 in z1 and 28 13 0 89 in z2 n 5 p 0 05 fig 9a the main reason for the high discrepancies between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies are likely to be due primarily to laboratory conditions lacking the ability to represent the geochemical conditions prevailing in real situations for instance maximum in situ recorded groundwater nitrate concentration and mean ph were approximately 76 mg l and 6 9 0 085 respectively meghdadi and javar 2017 which significantly differ from the laboratory obtained optimum values 180 mg l nitrate concentration and ph of 5 5 these differences suggest that significant gaps between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies are inevitable 4 discussions this study presents that the hyporheic sediments can attenuate nitrate via adsorption and to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the efficiency of nitrate adsorption in hyporheic sediments are quantified these results have further implications for the estimation of nutrient balance in streams effects of the geochemical factors on the adsorption efficiency as well as the physio chemical characteristics of the hyporheic nitrate adsorption are discussed in the following sub sections 4 1 effect of temperature ph adsorbent dosage and competitor ions this study states that ph temperature adsorbent dosage and co existing ions have considerable effects on the nitrate removal efficiency by adsorption while by increase in the adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency of nitrate have increased in both z1 and z2 the incremental trend in nitrate removal efficiency was caused by the improved availability of a larger surface area and more activated sites at higher dosages rao and rehman 2010 desaturation of the adsorption aqueous solution on account of the raised adsorbent dosage for a certain adsorbate amount was the main cause of reduced adsorption capacity senturk et al 2009 on the other hand the optimum adsorption efficiencies were achieved in 5 ph 6 while a similar trend was reported by other researchers e g sowmya and meenakshi 2013 the variation in nitrate removal efficiency could be explained by changes in electrostatic attraction between adsorbate and adsorbent in addition as mentioned by li et al 2011 the ph of an aqueous solution not only influences the diffusion rate and the chemical speciation of the solute but also the dissociation of the functional group and surface charge of the adsorbent the thermodynamic analysis indicates that the positive values of the entropy change δṡ in both z1 and z2 table 5 clearly related to the affinity of the sediments for the nitrate ions which is concurrent with randomness increases in the nitrate adsorption in the solid solution interface similar results have been reported by hu et al 2015 the negative δġ highlighted the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process while the more negative values there were for δġ the higher the tendency of the adsorbate to adsorb nitrate ions furthermore the δġ values were less than 10 kj mol which demonstrated the physical adsorption mechanism during the reaction table 5 confirmed by results obtained from the dubinin radushkebbin isotherm model table 3 on the other hand the low values of s less than 0 1 table 5 in both z1 and z2 represented the possibility of the chemical adsorption mechanism horsfall jnr and spiff 2005 these results were also confirmed by the analysis of the adsorption kinetics models see section 3 3 thus it could be concluded that the mechanism of the nitrate adsorption in z1 and z2 was a physio chemical process among the co existing ions so4 2 followed by cl and hco3 have the highest negative effect on nitrate adsorption so4 accumulation on the surface of adsorbents promoted electrostatic repulsion leading to a significant decrease in nitrate adsorption capacity moreover as noted by wan et al 2012 multivalent ions e g so4 2 can be adsorbed more rapidly than monovalent ones e g nitrate therefore the adsorbents had more of a tendency to adsorb sulphate than nitrate in addition cl and hco3 competed with nitrate to be trapped by the adsorbent solid surface and subsequently reduce the nitrate adsorption efficiency 4 2 the physio chemical characteristics of the adsorption to characterize the physical and chemical features of the nitrate adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface the equilibrium experimental data were subjected to the d r model however the correlation coefficient in the d r isotherm model was lower than the other isotherms table 3 but the value of β provided an insight into the mean free energy e kj mol of adsorption per mole of sorbate when the adsorbate transmitted to the solid surface of sorbent from infinity in the aqueous solution tuzen and sari 2010 the incipient rapid reactions were ascribed to the increase in driving force caused by the nitrate concentration gradient in the aqueous phase solution the incremental equilibrium time resulted from the increase in the required time for the active sites on the adsorbent surface to trap nitrate and reach the equilibrium concentration the ki values in the intra particle diffusion model increased followed by an increase in the initial nitrate concentrations this phenomenon was related to the consecutive stages as follows foo and hameed 2010 mirmohseni et al 2012 saha et al 2010 in the initial stage and due to the concentration gradient the nitrate ions were driven to approximate into the pores of the adsorbents until the surfactant functional sites of the adsorbents were fully occupied the adsorbate ions could not be diffused into the pores of the adsorbents for further reaction therefore nitrate adsorption occurred on the surface of the adsorbents or the adsorption happened on the outer sphere surface of the complex monolayer adsorption the decrease in the correlation coefficient particularly in z1 from 0 981 in 10 mg l initial nitrate concentration to 0 052 in 180 mg l of the initial nitrate concentration indicated that the intra particle diffusivity was not an exclusive controlling factor at the incipient time of the adsorption process liu and zhang 2015 all in all it can be confirmed that both chemical and physical adsorption processes were involved in the nitrate removal procedure 4 3 disparity between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies from the results obtained by this study it is clear that adsorption plays a significant role to remove nitrate from an aqueous environment the analysis of the adsorption kinetics revealed that the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbent s surfaces and bulk nitrate solution decreased due to the dramatic increment in driving force caused by the high nitrate concentration srivastava et al 2006 furthermore when the initial nitrate concentration exceeded a certain level 48 mg l in z1 and 63 mg l in z2 a decrease in removal efficiency from 79 6 to 22 7 and 55 20 54 occurred in z1 and z2 respectively due to high correlation coefficient values r2 0 95 and relatively small parameter estimation error and fit distortion values χ 2 a n d n s d in the first three isotherms it was difficult to decide which model better described the adsorption mechanism these results displayed the multilayer characteristics of nitrate adsorption on the adsorbents to examine the spatio seasonal differences between the mean actual and the experimental nitrate removal efficiencies the best fitted langmuir freundlich model r2 0 97 has employed since the nitrate concentration is about 60 mg l and 30 mg l in dry and wet seasons respectively table 6 the langmuir freundlich model equation 6 and table 3 was subjected to theses initial concentrations the values of the mean actual and the measured nitrate removal efficiencies have been illustrated in fig 9b it is evident that the amount of the nitrate removal efficiencies in all seasons and zones except z2 in wet season have been overestimated by the langmuir freundlich model moreover the actual nitrate removal efficiency in the wet season is lower than the dry season for both z1 and z2 fig 9b this may have been due to the obvious temperature difference between the two seasons while compared with the wet season the higher temperatures in the dry season accompany slightly lower concentrations of cl hco3 and so4 which can operate as adsorption promoters that lead to the higher nitrate removal efficiency in the dry season the discrepancies between the mean actual and the calculated removal efficiencies can be due to the destructive effects of the geochemical parameters ph so4 cl hco3 which exist in the applied pore water solution temperature dependency of n and kf l equation 6 chabani et al 2007 and the dependency of the model to the level of surface heterogeneity which inflicts bias from the actual values katal et al 2012 nevertheless the results of this study emphasizes that adsorption can be considered as an effective nitrate removal pathway this become more evident when the effectiveness of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways compared with adsorption efficiency table 7 the range of the actual nitrate removal efficiencies in the watershed by adsorption varied from 17 24 to 29 95 fig 9 these results are comparable with other pathways described in table 7 demonstrates that adsorption should be considered as a significant hyporheic nitrate removal pathway 4 4 scanning electron microscopy of adsorbents in optimum conditions it was evident from the result that the adsorption capacity of nitrate was highest in ph 5 5 adsorbent dosage of 90 g l temperature of 308 k and initial adsorbate concentration of180 mg l known as optimum status in this regard all of the aforementioned optimum characteristics were collected to better visualize the change in surface morphology of the adsorbents during the optimum status resulting in a better conceptualization of the adsorption process the sem image of adsorbents after the adsorption process of nitrate having optimum status is illustrated in fig 10 the highly irregular surface morphology with increased heterogeneity on the surface of the adsorbents relates to the high efficiency of the adsorption process fig 10 also the increased surface roughness because of the swelling effects of the adsorbents during the adsorption process is also evident 5 conclusion in this study river bed sediments were sampled from two mineralogical and morphologically different zones parafluvial sediments and river confluence sediments from the hyporheic zone of the ghezel ozan river the clay types of the sampled sediments were characterized as smectite illite z1 and smectite kaolinite z2 mixed layers both of the adsorbents had high nitrate removal efficiencies analysis via adsorption isotherm models indicated that compared with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherms the langmuir freundlich model is the most versatile isotherm r2 0 95 describing the nitrate adsorption process moreover kinetic model analyses as well as thermodynamic determinations with low s and δġ 10 kj mol revealed the occurrence of physio chemical nitrate adsorption mechanisms on the outer sphere surface of the hyporheic sediments the destructive influence of sulphate ions was relatively significant followed by cl and hco3 and the optimum ph for adsorption was 6 spatial and seasonal differences in actual nitrate removal efficiencies were also quantified in this study the spatio seasonal variations were mainly ascribed to seasonal changes in groundwater geochemical characteristics whereas the concentrations of destructive anions e g so4 decrease the nitrate removal efficiency increases from dry to wet season moreover adsorption significantly contributed in nitrate removal from the hyporheic zone of the ghezel ozan river up to 29 which provide the evidence that the hyporheic adsorption can be considered as an effective attenuation pathway this study reports for the first time the assessment of hyporheic zone adsorption capacity under natural conditions although the importance of adsorption mechanism was demonstrated by this study but further studies regarding the influence of adsorption modification mechanisms for promoting the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic zones and the effect of the percent clay composition of hyporheic sediments on the adsorption efficiency are recommended furthermore comparison of the actual adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments with other pathways provides the evidence that for an effective management of groundwater pollution it is essential to consider an actual hyporheic nitrate adsorption together with other dissimilatory nitrate reduction mechanisms acknowledgement this work was financially

19549,nitrate has been recognized as a global threat to environmental health in this regard the hyporheic zone saturated media beneath and adjacent to the stream bed plays a crucial role in attenuating groundwater nitrate prior to discharge into surface water while different nitrate removal pathways have been investigated over recent decades the adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments under natural conditions has not yet been identified in this study the natural attenuation capacity of the hyporheic sediments of the ghezel ozan river located in the north west of iran was determined the sampled sediments from 1 m below the stream bed were characterized via xrd ft ir bet sem bjh and zeta potential nitrate adsorption was evaluated using a batch experiment with hyporheic pore water from each study site the study was performed in the hyporheic sediments of two morphologically different zones including z1 located in the parafluvial zone having the clay sediment texture 57 8 clay with smectite illite mixed layer clay type and z2 located in the river confluence area containing silty clay sediment texture 47 6 clay with smectite kaolinite mixed layer clay type data obtained from the batch experiment were subjected to pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich mass transfer kinetic models to characterize the nitrate adsorption mechanism furthermore to replicate nitrate removal efficiencies of the hyporheic sediments under natural conditions the sampled hyporheic pore waters were applied as initial solutions to run the batch experiment the results of the artificial nitrate solution correlated well with pseudo second order r 2 95 in both z1 and z2 and maximum removal efficiencies of 85 3 and 71 2 adsorbent dosage 90 g l ph 5 5 initial adsorbate concentration of 90 mg l were achieved in z1 and z2 respectively the results of the nitrate adsorption analysis revealed that the nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 17 24 1 86 in z1 during the wet season to 28 13 0 89 in z2 during the dry season the results obtained by this study yielded strong evidence of the potential of hyporheic sediments to remove nitrate from an aqueous environment with great efficiency graphical abstract image keywords nitrate adsorption capacity kinetic models hyporheic zone removal efficiency ghezel ozan river 1 introduction the excess of nitrate in groundwater is a major concern worldwide palko et al 2017 the high concentration of nitrate in groundwater is mainly sourced from improper wastewater treatment and excess application of nitrogen fertilizers meghdadi and javar 2017 and in drinking water such high concentrations can seriously affect human health and the ecosystem in general for instance transformation of nitrate ions from nitrite causes a reduction in the oxygen capacity of human blood cells and a subsequent generation of carcinogenic nitrosamine hérissan et al 2017 increased nitrate concentration in a water system leads to hypoxia low water oxygen content altered biodiversity widespread habitat degradation changes in food web structure and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms hautier et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 therefore nitrate removal from aquifers is of prime importance for the environment and ecosystem health in addition characterizing naturally occurring nitrate removal pathways are of critical importance particularly for decision makers in terms of adopting practical and targeted soil and groundwater remediation strategies the hyporheic zone can be conceptualized as the portion of saturated sediments surrounding the stream boano et al 2014 where the groundwater is physically and geochemically influenced by exchange across the sediment water interface cardenas 2009 weatherill et al 2018 to evaluate the attenuation capacity of hyporheic sediments various natural attenuation mechanisms and a number of different techniques to remove nitrate from aquatic systems have been studied including ion exchange alikhani and moghbeli 2014 biological denitrification chung et al 2014 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra roland et al 2017 electrochemical reduction öznülüer et al 2013 catalytic reduction wada et al 2012 reverse osmosis richards et al 2010 and adsorption fazlzadeh et al 2017 all of these methods have shortcomings the conventional techniques such as reverse osmosis are relatively costly biological denitrification requires sufficient amounts of organic carbon sources to be successful cameron and schipper 2010 in dnra nitrate converts to another form of nitrogen compound ammonia and cannot be permanently removed from the aqueous system an and gardner 2002 due to electro chemical reduction the electrodes used in the electrochemical method easily become inactive ammonia and nitrite are hazardous by products of the catalytic reduction method rivett et al 2008 adsorption has been recognized as a superior method compared to biologically mediated ones because of design simplicity and ease of operation kyzas and matis 2015 furthermore it is an environmentally friendly mechanism that does not generate any harmful by products has low operational cost and involves a sludge free operation lahot and tiwari 2016 many efforts have been made to conceptualize the different mechanisms and factors which lead to the attenuation of nitrate in hyporheic sediments for instance krause et al 2013 investigated the effect of hyporheic physical properties on nitrogen cycling and the fate of nitrate particularly at upwelling locations by considering the zonation and depth dependent patterns of nitrate concentration in another study by krause et al 2009 the influence of spatial and seasonal variations in the physio chemical properties of the hyporheic sediments as well as the hydraulic head on attenuation of hyporheic nitrate particularly in the groundwater discharge zone were scrutinized biogeochemical processes regulating hyporheic nitrate attenuation denitrification dnra and assimilation of nitrate by microorganisms have been widely studied e g sovik and morkved 2008 compared with dnra and assimilation by microorganisms biological denitrification has been identified as a dominant nitrate depletion mechanism in the hyporheic zone dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes including sediment denitrification dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation are other nitrate removal pathways for which the rate of groundwater nitrate depletion via dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes have been studied worldwide deng et al 2015 yin et al 2015 in addition numerous synthetic adsorbents such as bio sorbents e g chitosan hu et al 2015 agricultural waste e g rice hull and carbonate base sorbents e g carbon nanotube bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 have been investigated during the last decade to attenuate nitrate in light of the above the capacity of hyporheic sediments to attenuate nitrate via adsorption and under natural conditions has almost never been considered in this study the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic sediments via adsorption was therefore assessed in hyporheic sediments of the ghezel ozan river a third order river in the north west of iran in this regard first the physiochemical properties of sampled sediments collected from sediments at 1 m below the riverbed were characterized by xrd sem ft ir and bet pore size distribution analysis second the adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments was analyzed via a batch experiment by adding different nitrate solutions subjected to various physiochemical conditions lastly the actual nitrate removal efficiency via adsorption was quantified in the laboratory by applying the collected hyporheic pore water to better reflect the effect of spatial and seasonal variations on nitrate adsorption 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sampling and laboratory analysis the study was performed on the ghezel ozan river within the tarom watershed in the north west of iran fig 1 the geology of this river is mainly late tertiary to early quaternary calcareous sand and clay particles meghdadi and eyvazi 2017

exchange and subsequently the geochemical characteristics of the groundwater are accentuated in the parafluvial zones meghdadi and eyvazi 2017 on the other hand z2 is located in the river confluence fig 1 and is therefore associated with complex morpho dynamic hydrodynamic and sedimentary process variations song et al 2017 these variations can induce seasonal changes in nutrient e g nitrate flux and geothermal features of the riverbed sediments song et al 2017 the sampling campaign was conducted from 9 to 28 june 2015 which was during the dry season when low flow conditions allow for sediment sampling of the riverbed sediment samples were collected from 20 points fig 1 1 m below the stream bed five replicates for each sampling point in two different zones z1 andz2 having different sediment textures and morphological features as described above using a soil auger core sampler device the samples were collected in distilled high density polyethylene hdpe containers and kept at 4 c prior to transfer to the laboratory hyporheic waters were sampled during wet 25 28 december 2015 and dry 13 15 june 2015 seasons fig 1 five replicas were sampled from 1 m below the riverbed using an hdpe drive

zhan et al 2011 the e value of 0 59 kj mol z1 and 0 42 kj mol z2 revealed that the adsorption mechanism was of a physical nature thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δġ enthalpy δḣ and

adsorbent characterization a brief description of the physical and chemical properties of the hyporheic sediments adsorbents is presented in table 1 it was clear that both adsorbents had high surface areas with microporous surface structures in addition the sems of adsorbent surfaces prior to and after nitrate adsorption in two different areas are illustrated in fig 2 the difference in the surface of the hyporheic sediments were observed in which irregular protrusion and heterogeneous morphology on the solid surface after adsorption is attributed to the swelling effects of the clay minerals during the process furthermore the sem images of the hyporheic sediments revealed the porous irregular and uneven structure of the material which provided a perfect substrate for the nitrate ions to be adsorbed trapping them onto the surface of the sediments the x ray diffraction analysis of hyporheic sediments sampled from saturated sediments beneath the riverbed fig 1 are illustrated in fig 3 a the different crystalline peaks of the adsorbents s k k and s i are evident by comparing the xrd patterns of adsorbents some new peaks were produced and some peaks were reduced the clay mineralogical properties of adsorbents were characterized mainly as smectite illite and smectite kaolinite furthermore physical and geochemical characteristics of the adsorbents are described in table 1 accordingly the hyporheic sediments sampled from the west side of the watershed z1 are mainly clay textured with average pore diameter of 68 42 ȧ and the sample from the east side of the watershed z2 is silty clay textured with 59 84 ȧ as an average pore size diameter table 1 semi quantitative xrd analyses for sediment size 2 mm are discussed in table 2 in this study for the sake of convenience the clay textured sediment containing a smectite illite mixed layer type located in z1 fig 1 was referred to as z1 and the silty clay soil texture with a smectite kaolinite mixed layer clay type located in z2 fig 1 was termed z2 quartz and feldspar were common in both adsorbents table 2 and fig 3a the total pore volume bet specific surface area and average pore size of the adsorbents were 0 028cm3 gr 113 13m2 gr and 68 42 ȧ for z1 and 0 02cm3 gr 81 22m2 gr and 59 84 ȧ for z2 the affinity of nitrate for the hyporheic sediments estimated as bet specific surface area and pore volume were respectively large for each zone the barrett joyner halenda bjh distribution of pore sizes is shown in fig 3b in this regard 87 9 of pore sizes in z1 and 85 3 of pore sizes in z2 were between 2 and 50 nm according to the iupac pore size classification the bjh pore size distribution displayed the mesoporous nature of the adsorbents due to the small nitrate ionic radius the adsorbents were conducive to nitrate penetration into the adsorbent inner layer donohue and aranovich 1999 the ftir spectra of the adsorbents is depicted in fig 3c the ftir spectra analysis was employed to determine the functional groups explaining the adsorbate adsorption characteristics the broad adsorption peaks between 400 and 800 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of al o and si o bands hu et al 2015 between 850 and 1100 cm 1 related to the stretching vibration of c o bands mena duran et al 2007 and 3600 4000 cm 1 ascribed to the series of o h bands from sio2 groups djomgoue and njopwouo 2013 the ftir spectra prior to nitrate adsorption showed a wide range of stretching vibrational peaks between 850 and 1100 cm 1 1843 2054 cm 1 and 2436 2589 cm 1 for z1 and between 2386 and 2493 cm 1 and 3246 3305 cm 1 for z2 it was obvious from comparison of the curves before and after adsorption that peaks between 850 and 1100 cm 1 2436 2589 cm 1 and 3234 3318 cm 1 in z1 disappeared after the reaction and the transmittance between 1854 and 1996 cm 1 slightly decreased due to the creation of a dipole moment charge suggesting that new chemical bonds were created between adsorbents and nitrate ions the same interpretation is valid for z2 moreover the appearance of a strong bending vibrational peak after adsorption at 1383 4 cm 1 z1 and 1384 1 cm 1 z2 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of the n o bond that represented the occurrence of nitrate adsorption on the solid surface of the adsorbents fazlzadeh et al 2017 3 2 adsorption capacity analysis in this study the nitrate adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments was assessed by implementing different initial concentrations 10 180 mg l of nano3 and various contact times 10 360 min the relationship between initial nitrate concentrations adsorption capacity and nitrate removal efficiency for both z1 and z2 is depicted in fig 4 a the adsorption capacity increased from 0 16 to 0 82 mg g and from 0 11 to 0 69 mg g with the increase in initial adsorbate concentration in z1 and z2 respectively the results of the adsorption isotherm analysis in z1 and z2 are illustrated in fig 4b and table 3 all isotherms except the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm demonstrated favourable correlations table 3 the calculated rl corresponding to the different initial adsorbate concentrations varied from 0 152 to 0 617 and from 0 217 to 0 714 in z1 and z2 respectively it is typically stated that jain et al 2010 the rl values having the range of 0 rl 1 represented the favourable adsorption of adsorbate onto the different adsorbents meanwhile the langmuir freundlich isotherm known as sip s equation with the highest correlation coefficient incorporated both langmuir and freundlich models and operated as a versatile isotherm to well describe the experimental data jeppu and clement 2012 3 3 adsorption kinetics the procedure of nitrate adsorption as well as the related rate of controlling mechanisms for nitrate removal were investigated at room temperature 25 c as a function of contact time initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l fig 5 using four commonly applied kinetic models including pseudo first order ding et al 2013 pseudo second order ding et al 2013 intra particle diffusion foo and hameed 2010 and elovich mass transfer models foo and hameed 2010 table 4 outlines the linear expression formulas associated parameters and correlation coefficients r2 for the initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l in both z1 and z2 the fitting of experimental data to the linear forms initial concentrations of 10 mg l 90 mg l and 180 mg l in both z1 and z2 and the correlative parameters of these four kinetic models with were represented in fig 5 it was observed that all kinetic models except the intra particle diffusion fitted well with the experimental data r2 0 9 which indicated the high applicability of those three adsorption kinetics fig 6 and table 4 the adsorption reactions were rapid in the first 60 120 min for the 10 mg l and 180 mg l initial adsorbate concentrations respectively which were followed by a slow incremental trend until adsorption equilibriums were achieved 3 4 thermodynamic effect on adsorption capacity temperature was regarded as a key controlling factor for adjusting the adsorption capacity the adsorption of the adsorbate was investigated at four different temperatures 278 288 298 and 308 k fig 7 a and b a constant adsorbate concentration 90 mg l an adsorbent dosage of 50 g l a ph of 5 5 and 120 min contact time using the van t hoff methods rezaei kalantary et al 2016 the magnitude of the thermodynamic parameters and variation in the nitrate removal capacity with a temperature change from 278 k 308 k are illustrated in table 5 and fig 7a and b respectively as temperature increased the more adsorbate ions were removed from the aqueous solution fig 7 also the positive values of δḣ and ea in both z1 and z2 table 5 suggested that the nitrate adsorption was an endothermic process also shown in fig 7c 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage on nitrate adsorption efficiency adsorbent dosage was an effective factor in the adsorption process the influence of adsorption dosage on the adsorbate removal efficiency and nitrate adsorption capacity in z1 and z2 is illustrated in fig 8 a the nitrate removal efficiency increased from 15 3 to 85 3 z1 and from 19 3 to 71 2 z2 with increases in adsorption dosage from 10 to 90 g l as shown in fig 8a on the other hand nitrate adsorption capacity decreased from 1 22 to 0 75 mg g in z1 and from 1 54 to 0 63 mg g in z2 3 6 effect of ph on nitrate removal efficiency the effect of ph on nitrate removal efficiency is described in fig 8b it was observed that with an increase in ph from 2 to 5 nitrate removal efficiency increased from 51 4 to 63 2 and from 46 15 to 58 16 in z1 and z2 respectively the highest nitrate removal efficiency was acquired at 5 ph 6 followed by a diminished removal efficiency as the ph became more alkaline in this regard the zeta potential of adsorbents in different ph values is depicted in fig 8b for both z1 and z2 the isoelectronic point of the adsorbents occurred at ph 4 indicating that the lower the ph the higher the positive surface charge of the solid surface of the adsorbents caused by higher attraction of the nitrate ions hence the increase of ph from 6 to 11 can decrease the adsorption capacity by creating a negative zeta potential in the surface of the adsorbents which caused an increase in the electrostatic repulsion of adsorbate to occur between nitrate charges in the aqueous solution 3 7 effect of co existing anions on adsorption capacity other ions such as k na nh4 ca2 mg2 cl hco3 f and so4 2 co existing with nitrate in an aquifer are able to exert a destructive influence on the nitrate adsorption process accordingly the competition effect of the above mentioned ions was studied at a ph of 5 5 fig 8c all ions had a negative impact on nitrate removal efficiency with the most adverse being so4 2 followed by cl and hco3 the other ions had slightly negative effects on nitrate removal efficiency 3 8 spatio seasonal variations in nitrate removal efficiency nitrate concentration ph cl hco3 temperature and so4 are among the most influential parameters affecting nitrate adsorption in this study to better conceptualize the actual nitrate removal efficiencies of the hyporheic sediments the sampled hyporheic waters were employed as initial solutions to assess actual nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic sediments spatial and seasonal variations of the influential geochemical parameters in the hyporheic pore water are described in table 6 the hyporheic water and the adsorbents which were collected from z1 and z2 were used for adsorption analysis at 90 g l of the adsorbent dosage 360 min contact time and at temperatures similar to those during the sampling period 29 c and 15 c for dry and wet seasons respectively theses experimental conditions were applied to mirror the environmental condition more accurately also the analysis of one way anova at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was employed to assess the variation of the actual nitrate removal efficiencies around the mean values it was observed that the nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic sediments significantly varied in zones and during different seasons fig 9 a the nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 17 24 1 86 in z1 n 5 p 0 05 during the wet season to 28 13 0 89 in z2 n 5 p 0 05 during the dry season fig 9a however the value of ph in z1 lies within the optimum ph range 5 5 6 5 section 3 6 but the higher so4 and cl concentrations of the hyporheic pore waters in z1 than z2 may comprise the primary reason for the relatively lower nitrate removal efficiency of z1 the maximum nitrate removal efficiencies for the artificial nitrate solutions achieved at 90 g l adsorbent dosage initial nitrate concentration of 180 mg l and ph of 5 5 were equal to 85 3 and 71 2 in z1 and z2 respectively n 5 p 0 05 on the other hand the maximum values of in stream adsorption efficiencies of nitrate adsorption were lower than the experimental values with maximum values during the dry season equal to 25 9 0 78 n 5 p 0 05 in z1 and 28 13 0 89 in z2 n 5 p 0 05 fig 9a the main reason for the high discrepancies between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies are likely to be due primarily to laboratory conditions lacking the ability to represent the geochemical conditions prevailing in real situations for instance maximum in situ recorded groundwater nitrate concentration and mean ph were approximately 76 mg l and 6 9 0 085 respectively meghdadi and javar 2017 which significantly differ from the laboratory obtained optimum values 180 mg l nitrate concentration and ph of 5 5 these differences suggest that significant gaps between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies are inevitable 4 discussions this study presents that the hyporheic sediments can attenuate nitrate via adsorption and to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the efficiency of nitrate adsorption in hyporheic sediments are quantified these results have further implications for the estimation of nutrient balance in streams effects of the geochemical factors on the adsorption efficiency as well as the physio chemical characteristics of the hyporheic nitrate adsorption are discussed in the following sub sections 4 1 effect of temperature ph adsorbent dosage and competitor ions this study states that ph temperature adsorbent dosage and co existing ions have considerable effects on the nitrate removal efficiency by adsorption while by increase in the adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency of nitrate have increased in both z1 and z2 the incremental trend in nitrate removal efficiency was caused by the improved availability of a larger surface area and more activated sites at higher dosages rao and rehman 2010 desaturation of the adsorption aqueous solution on account of the raised adsorbent dosage for a certain adsorbate amount was the main cause of reduced adsorption capacity senturk et al 2009 on the other hand the optimum adsorption efficiencies were achieved in 5 ph 6 while a similar trend was reported by other researchers e g sowmya and meenakshi 2013 the variation in nitrate removal efficiency could be explained by changes in electrostatic attraction between adsorbate and adsorbent in addition as mentioned by li et al 2011 the ph of an aqueous solution not only influences the diffusion rate and the chemical speciation of the solute but also the dissociation of the functional group and surface charge of the adsorbent the thermodynamic analysis indicates that the positive values of the entropy change δṡ in both z1 and z2 table 5 clearly related to the affinity of the sediments for the nitrate ions which is concurrent with randomness increases in the nitrate adsorption in the solid solution interface similar results have been reported by hu et al 2015 the negative δġ highlighted the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process while the more negative values there were for δġ the higher the tendency of the adsorbate to adsorb nitrate ions furthermore the δġ values were less than 10 kj mol which demonstrated the physical adsorption mechanism during the reaction table 5 confirmed by results obtained from the dubinin radushkebbin isotherm model table 3 on the other hand the low values of s less than 0 1 table 5 in both z1 and z2 represented the possibility of the chemical adsorption mechanism horsfall jnr and spiff 2005 these results were also confirmed by the analysis of the adsorption kinetics models see section 3 3 thus it could be concluded that the mechanism of the nitrate adsorption in z1 and z2 was a physio chemical process among the co existing ions so4 2 followed by cl and hco3 have the highest negative effect on nitrate adsorption so4 accumulation on the surface of adsorbents promoted electrostatic repulsion leading to a significant decrease in nitrate adsorption capacity moreover as noted by wan et al 2012 multivalent ions e g so4 2 can be adsorbed more rapidly than monovalent ones e g nitrate therefore the adsorbents had more of a tendency to adsorb sulphate than nitrate in addition cl and hco3 competed with nitrate to be trapped by the adsorbent solid surface and subsequently reduce the nitrate adsorption efficiency 4 2 the physio chemical characteristics of the adsorption to characterize the physical and chemical features of the nitrate adsorption onto the heterogeneous surface the equilibrium experimental data were subjected to the d r model however the correlation coefficient in the d r isotherm model was lower than the other isotherms table 3 but the value of β provided an insight into the mean free energy e kj mol of adsorption per mole of sorbate when the adsorbate transmitted to the solid surface of sorbent from infinity in the aqueous solution tuzen and sari 2010 the incipient rapid reactions were ascribed to the increase in driving force caused by the nitrate concentration gradient in the aqueous phase solution the incremental equilibrium time resulted from the increase in the required time for the active sites on the adsorbent surface to trap nitrate and reach the equilibrium concentration the ki values in the intra particle diffusion model increased followed by an increase in the initial nitrate concentrations this phenomenon was related to the consecutive stages as follows foo and hameed 2010 mirmohseni et al 2012 saha et al 2010 in the initial stage and due to the concentration gradient the nitrate ions were driven to approximate into the pores of the adsorbents until the surfactant functional sites of the adsorbents were fully occupied the adsorbate ions could not be diffused into the pores of the adsorbents for further reaction therefore nitrate adsorption occurred on the surface of the adsorbents or the adsorption happened on the outer sphere surface of the complex monolayer adsorption the decrease in the correlation coefficient particularly in z1 from 0 981 in 10 mg l initial nitrate concentration to 0 052 in 180 mg l of the initial nitrate concentration indicated that the intra particle diffusivity was not an exclusive controlling factor at the incipient time of the adsorption process liu and zhang 2015 all in all it can be confirmed that both chemical and physical adsorption processes were involved in the nitrate removal procedure 4 3 disparity between actual and experimental nitrate removal efficiencies from the results obtained by this study it is clear that adsorption plays a significant role to remove nitrate from an aqueous environment the analysis of the adsorption kinetics revealed that the mass transfer resistance between the adsorbent s surfaces and bulk nitrate solution decreased due to the dramatic increment in driving force caused by the high nitrate concentration srivastava et al 2006 furthermore when the initial nitrate concentration exceeded a certain level 48 mg l in z1 and 63 mg l in z2 a decrease in removal efficiency from 79 6 to 22 7 and 55 20 54 occurred in z1 and z2 respectively due to high correlation coefficient values r2 0 95 and relatively small parameter estimation error and fit distortion values χ 2 a n d n s d in the first three isotherms it was difficult to decide which model better described the adsorption mechanism these results displayed the multilayer characteristics of nitrate adsorption on the adsorbents to examine the spatio seasonal differences between the mean actual and the experimental nitrate removal efficiencies the best fitted langmuir freundlich model r2 0 97 has employed since the nitrate concentration is about 60 mg l and 30 mg l in dry and wet seasons respectively table 6 the langmuir freundlich model equation 6 and table 3 was subjected to theses initial concentrations the values of the mean actual and the measured nitrate removal efficiencies have been illustrated in fig 9b it is evident that the amount of the nitrate removal efficiencies in all seasons and zones except z2 in wet season have been overestimated by the langmuir freundlich model moreover the actual nitrate removal efficiency in the wet season is lower than the dry season for both z1 and z2 fig 9b this may have been due to the obvious temperature difference between the two seasons while compared with the wet season the higher temperatures in the dry season accompany slightly lower concentrations of cl hco3 and so4 which can operate as adsorption promoters that lead to the higher nitrate removal efficiency in the dry season the discrepancies between the mean actual and the calculated removal efficiencies can be due to the destructive effects of the geochemical parameters ph so4 cl hco3 which exist in the applied pore water solution temperature dependency of n and kf l equation 6 chabani et al 2007 and the dependency of the model to the level of surface heterogeneity which inflicts bias from the actual values katal et al 2012 nevertheless the results of this study emphasizes that adsorption can be considered as an effective nitrate removal pathway this become more evident when the effectiveness of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways compared with adsorption efficiency table 7 the range of the actual nitrate removal efficiencies in the watershed by adsorption varied from 17 24 to 29 95 fig 9 these results are comparable with other pathways described in table 7 demonstrates that adsorption should be considered as a significant hyporheic nitrate removal pathway 4 4 scanning electron microscopy of adsorbents in optimum conditions it was evident from the result that the adsorption capacity of nitrate was highest in ph 5 5 adsorbent dosage of 90 g l temperature of 308 k and initial adsorbate concentration of180 mg l known as optimum status in this regard all of the aforementioned optimum characteristics were collected to better visualize the change in surface morphology of the adsorbents during the optimum status resulting in a better conceptualization of the adsorption process the sem image of adsorbents after the adsorption process of nitrate having optimum status is illustrated in fig 10 the highly irregular surface morphology with increased heterogeneity on the surface of the adsorbents relates to the high efficiency of the adsorption process fig 10 also the increased surface roughness because of the swelling effects of the adsorbents during the adsorption process is also evident 5 conclusion in this study river bed sediments were sampled from two mineralogical and morphologically different zones parafluvial sediments and river confluence sediments from the hyporheic zone of the ghezel ozan river the clay types of the sampled sediments were characterized as smectite illite z1 and smectite kaolinite z2 mixed layers both of the adsorbents had high nitrate removal efficiencies analysis via adsorption isotherm models indicated that compared with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherms the langmuir freundlich model is the most versatile isotherm r2 0 95 describing the nitrate adsorption process moreover kinetic model analyses as well as thermodynamic determinations with low s and δġ 10 kj mol revealed the occurrence of physio chemical nitrate adsorption mechanisms on the outer sphere surface of the hyporheic sediments the destructive influence of sulphate ions was relatively significant followed by cl and hco3 and the optimum ph for adsorption was 6 spatial and seasonal differences in actual nitrate removal efficiencies were also quantified in this study the spatio seasonal variations were mainly ascribed to seasonal changes in groundwater geochemical characteristics whereas the concentrations of destructive anions e g so4 decrease the nitrate removal efficiency increases from dry to wet season moreover adsorption significantly contributed in nitrate removal from the hyporheic zone of the ghezel ozan river up to 29 which provide the evidence that the hyporheic adsorption can be considered as an effective attenuation pathway this study reports for the first time the assessment of hyporheic zone adsorption capacity under natural conditions although the importance of adsorption mechanism was demonstrated by this study but further studies regarding the influence of adsorption modification mechanisms for promoting the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic zones and the effect of the percent clay composition of hyporheic sediments on the adsorption efficiency are recommended furthermore comparison of the actual adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments with other pathways provides the evidence that for an effective management of groundwater pollution it is essential to consider an actual hyporheic nitrate adsorption together with other dissimilatory nitrate reduction mechanisms acknowledgement this work was financially
