4200,most infiltration and water retention models for unsaturated porous media proposed in the literature often are based on simplified representations of the pore system and use the matric head as the main state variable an integrated study on the hydraulic properties of homogeneous calcarenites with a complex pore network is presented aimed at assessing water infiltration and retention mechanisms starting from dry to wet conditions under high water inflow medium grained grainstones and fine grained packstones were used as material for laboratory testing and model set up petrophysical characterization and bimodal distribution of pore volume was obtained by standard and unconventional procedures permeability test under saturated conditions was performed with constant and falling head tests falling head infiltration tests at bench scale were carried out to estimate the hydraulic properties of the materials under unsaturated conditions unsaturated hydraulic relationships such as the soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity function were examined the advection diffusion form of richard s equation together with the pore bundle model and dual porosity concept under equilibrium conditions represent the theoretical framework used to investigate the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of the calcarenites in the falling head infiltration test the swrc relative hydraulic conductivity and celerity were determined through the capillary theory and pore bundle concept considering the bi modal nature of the pore size distribution theoretical solutions and model predictions were compared with experimental data which demonstrated the dominant control of macro porosity on water flow and infiltration rate in particular our experimental results indicate that the wetting front propagates mainly through the macropores with a gravity driven flow velocity higher than the diffusive flow through the micropores the effect of texture degree of saturation and boundary conditions on infiltration dynamics is discussed keywords calcarenites fabric unsaturated flow infiltration hydraulic conductivity retention 1 introduction understanding and defining parameters and laws which regulate infiltration processes in the vadose zone is crucial to the representation of the hydrologic cycle and provides useful insights into run off generation aquifer recharge and contaminant transport corradini et al 2011 pastore et al 2020 furthermore rock deterioration processes slope stability settlement and bearing capacity are topics in which water infiltration rate and mechanisms must be defined and determined ng and shi 1998 bouwer 2002 ng and menzies 2007 lu et al 2009 oh and lu 2015 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2017 casnedi et al 2018 li et al 2019 the effects of global warming have led to climate changes in the mediterranean basin resulting in an increase in the frequency of extreme dry periods alternating with clustered rainfall events which together influence runoff infiltration partitioning and aquifer recharge corradini et al 2000 additionally storm water infiltration and pore pressure fluctuations are responsible in many cases for landslides or collapse of underground cavities mar√©chal et al 2008 parise et al 2015 parise et al 2018 fazio et al 2017 martinotti et al 2017 hou et al 2019 in fact according to xiao et al 2016 the dominant factors triggering landslides are water infiltration and redistribution mechanisms within micro and macro porosity rather than cumulative rainfall 1 1 current understanding of unsaturated flow in geological media the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated geologic media is very complex and existing theoretical approaches for modeling efforts are generally not extensive and not always applicable to any lithological or litho technical unit this happens because the water flow within the unsaturated zone is affected by many factors including the hydraulic properties of media and the climatic conditions rainfall intensity and duration rainfall pattern and evapotranspiration most of the uncertainties arise from the high nonlinearity and horizontal and vertical spatial variability of the hydraulic parameters involved in the transient unsaturated flow system and from the spatial and temporal changes in the initial and boundary conditions in terms of influence of human activities slope of the surface topography vegetation and location of the water table corradini et al 2002 zhan and ng 2004 morbidelli et al 2015 lu 2018 furthermore grain grading mineralogy and fabric including texture and microscopic and macroscopic structure control the ability of a soil rock to retain or transmit water and its dissolved content into and through the vadose or saturated zone thus fabric porosity and their relationships are essential because water flow and transport processes that occur in geologic media are affected by geometry and topology of the pore network nimmo 1997 nimmo 2004 nimmo 2005 andriani and walsh 2007 andriani and walsh 2010 characteristically pore structure plays a key role in affecting the hysteresis loop of the soil water retention curve swrc or water retention curve wrc which describes the relationship between volumetric water content and matric suction or matric head the primary empirical theoretical model for simulating infiltration in the field is the green ampt model which is based on a sharp piston wetting front approach for any continuous and isotropic medium green and ampt 1911 it estimates cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate as an implicit function of time by assuming water flow into a vertical homogeneous soil that is infinite in depth more recently this model has been modified and extended to a constant intensity rainfall input condition mein and larson 1973 unsteady rainfall distribution chu 1978 infiltration during complex rainfall sequences corradini et al 1997 sloping surface chen and young 2006 morbidelli et al 2015 layered soils with non uniform initial water content under unsteady infiltration liu et al 2008 local infiltration into two layered soils with a more permeable upper layer corradini et al 2011 and fine textured soils with a coarse interlayer chen et al 2019 to mention the main studies only the hydraulic properties of unsaturated geologic media include water retention and permeability the flow of water through unsaturated geologic media is in fact strongly conditioned by matric suction which corresponds to a negative pressure potential and by hydraulic conductivity which is a nonlinear function of matric suction or water content although over the last 70 years a number of techniques have been used to determine the soil water retention curve swrc for different geologic media their limited applicability poor practicality and high cost along with the significant temporal spatial variabilities in the hydraulic properties suggest applying parametric empirical equations to best fit experimental data nimmo 2009 the most widely used empirical equations are those by brooks and corey 1964 campbell 1974 and van genuchten 1980 the brooks and corey equation 1964 expresses effective saturation as a power function of soil matric head the campbell model 1974 expresses hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as functions of the air entry potential which depends on pore size distribution tortuosity and connectivity of the porous media the van genuchten 1980 equation relates the effective saturation to soil suction as pressure difference between the air and water phases and two other parameters the first related to the air entry value and the second to the slope of the water retention curve lenhard et al 1989 fredlund et al 2012 these models propose theoretical pore size gradings that reflect unimodal distributions and generally are accurate for high and medium water content but often give poor results at lower degrees of saturation wosten and van genuchten 1988 ross et al 1991 fredlund and xing 1994 similar to the saturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is generally governed by darcy s law according to the buckingham darcy flux differential equation for vertical flow fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in particular the hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soils is strongly affected by combined changes in void ratio for unsaturated soils as matric suction increases the void ratio decreases and water content or degree of saturation and useful functions are obtained using laboratory tests gallage et al 2013 while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils is typically greater than that of clayey soils the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils decreases more rapidly with increasing negative pore water pressure or matric suction and can become lower than that of clayey soils usually this occurs because in sands most pores are meso or macropore in nature brewer 1964 and desaturation rate is higher than that of clays thus at a given pore water pressure only a small amount of water remains in the pore system all aforementioned studies focus almost exclusively on soils and therefore are difficult to apply to rock media despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity for these materials also depends on the volumetric water content or in other terms on the degree of saturation and negative pore water pressure although the change in void ratio may be assumed to be null the presence of pervasive discontinuities in rock masses in fact influences the hydraulic behavior of media and fracture dominated flow in addition technical aspects need to be considered because the material strength makes it difficult to install expensive and time consuming devices to date the determination of hydraulic properties of rocks in situ or in laboratory is limited in many cases these are adaptations of soil physical standard methods direct and indirect in nature such methods include reflectometry thermocouple psychrometry electrical resistivity tomography steady state centrifugation and also include theoretical work numerical simulations and experimental studies

liu and xu 2017 1 2 the apulia calcarenites in apulia the calcarenite di gravina formation middle pliocene lower pleistocene constitutes a hydrogeologic unit of great importance in controlling groundwater recharge and transport of contaminants in porous media and groundwater similar geologic formations crop out in north africa the arabian peninsula mexico australia the north sea and the mediterranean basin furthermore the easy availability good workability aesthetic appeal and excellent insulating properties has made this material widely used in southern italy as building and ornamental stone for historical of immense cultural value churches romanesque cathedrals fortified farms imposing castles and medieval towers and it is usage has continued in contemporary construction as well moreover although the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated calcarenites is very important in various scientific research fields it is still little known in the specific literature recently caputo et al 2012 used the single ring infiltrometer test coupled with electrical resistivity measurements for calculating in situ flow rate in unsaturated calcarenites andriani et al 2013 proposed a comprehensive method by combining in situ measurements by 3d time lapse electrical resistivity tomography single ring infiltrometer testing and petrophysical parametrization to obtain the infiltration rate and lowering of the wetting front through the vadose zone of an aquifer laboratory tests for this purpose are generally not recommended as a homogeneous laboratory sample does not actually represent the field conditions in places however these calcarenites at the rock mass scale appear homogeneous massive or thick bedded with only occasional faults and fractures thus the laboratory samples can be considered representative of the in situ conditions interestingly caputo and nimmo 2005 developed a quasi steady centrifuge apparatus for laboratory measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention using core samples of the calcarenite di gravina formation from varying depths 1 3 research aim with the purpose of predicting the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of calcarenites using easy procedures and methods this study presents an integrated approach based on petrophysical characterization including grain and pore size distributions experimental data obtained by falling head infiltration tests at bench scale and conceptual and theoretical solutions to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic behavior in terms of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and soil water retention curve swrc calcarenite ashlars sampled from two quarries in apulia southern italy namely at massafra and canosa di puglia fig 1 were used as testing material the implications of the results obtained in this study are significant in the field of hydrology hydrogeology engineering geology and could be used to understand infiltration rates and patterns through porous calcarenites characterized by a complex network of pores 2 theoretical framework 2 1 Œ∏ based richard s model an early conceptual model for transient water flow in a variably saturated soil was developed in 1931 by richards the theoretical formulation is based on the relation between the hydraulic conductivity and the volumetric water content in particular the flow equation is based on capillary conduction and water storage is assumed to be a function of capillary potential which is perceived to be equivalent to the negative pore water pressure in the soil richards 1931 nimmo 2009 fredlund et al 2012 thus the fluid flow through variably saturated media assuming that a hydraulic equilibrium exists between different pore regions macropore and micropore can be described by richard s well known equation 1 c Œ∏ œà t k Œ∏ œà z where œà m is the matric head Œ∏ m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content c Œ∏ m 1 is the water capacity which is equal to the derivative of Œ∏ with respect toœà and k Œ∏ m s 1 is the water dependent hydraulic conductivity according to the buckingham darcy s law buckingham 1907 k Œ∏ is equal to the product between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks m s 1 and the relative hydraulic conductivity function kr Œ∏ neglecting the residual water content Œ∏r m3 m 3 the volumetric water content Œ∏ is equal to the product of the saturated volumetric water content Œ∏s m3 m 3 and the effective saturation se under unsaturated flow conditions eq 1 can be rewritten using Œ∏ as a state variable instead of œà zehe and jackisch 2016 ogden et al 2017 2 Œ∏ t k Œ∏ d œà d Œ∏ Œ∏ z Œ∏ t d w Œ∏ Œ∏ v Œ∏ Œ∏ where d w Œ∏ k Œ∏ œà Œ∏ m2 s 1 is the hydraulic diffusivity and v Œ∏ k Œ∏ Œ∏ z m s 1 is the water velocity vector since z 0 0 1 and thus water velocity has the only non zero component along the z axis then eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 Œ∏ t c w Œ∏ Œ∏ z d w Œ∏ Œ∏ where cw Œ∏ m s 1 is the celerity defined as the derivative of the darcian flux with respect to the volumetric water content Œ∏ 4 c w Œ∏ d q d Œ∏ d d Œ∏ k Œ∏ Œ∏ z Œ∏ d k Œ∏ d Œ∏ under unsaturated flow conditions the wetting front propagates by means of

the term Œ∏ z is thus large in magnitude therefore the second term on the right side of eq 5 can be neglected assuming that cw Œ∏ is a function of the averaged value of the volumetric water content

lagrangian velocity of the centroid of the wetting front surface having the coordinates along the vertical direction z 2 2 pore bundle model from a physical standpoint for an unsaturated soil between wet and moderately wet stages capillarity is the main retention mechanism the matric head œà can be determined by the equilibrium of air pressure pore water pressure contact angle and water surface tension lu 2016 it is clear that the capillary mechanism favors small pores with a given matric head thus at a given volumetric water content Œ∏i m3 m 3 there exists a critical pore diameter di m whether the pores having d j d i j 1 i are filled with water micropores are the first to be filled followed by the larger pores the capillary mechanism can be expressed by the young laplace equation where the matric head œài at which a pore fills or empties is a function of the correspondent critical pore diameter d i 8 œà i d i œÉ cos Œµ d i œÅ w g where œÉ is the surface tension n m 1 Œµ is the contact angle between particles and water œÅw is density of water kg m 3 and g m s 2 is the acceleration due to gravity according to mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 and chang and cheng 2018 the contact angle Œµ is equal to 0 a simple way to represent the complex porous media structure is the well known pore bundle model golparvar et al 2018 the pore network is reduced to a cluster of tortuous capillary tubes with smooth inner surface according to the mechanism of water retention in the moderately wet range water flows through the pores filled by bulk water the flow rate within the generic tortuous pore j with diameter dj m can be described by the hagen poiseuille equation 9 q j d j œÅ w g Œº w œÄ d j 4 128 Œ¥ h l j where qj m3 s 1 is the flow rate of the pore j Œºw pa s 1 is the water viscosity œÅw kg m 3 is the water density Œ¥h m is the total head drop h z œà is the total head and lj m is the length of the tortuous pore whereas the cross sectional area aj of the generic tortuous pore j is 10 a j d j œÄ d j 2 let a representative elementary volume rev in which the generic j th pore diameter dj varies from dmin j 1 to dmax j n under saturated condition the total flow rate qs m3

4 l j in the same way the effective saturation can be written as the ratio between ai and as 16 s e d i j 1 i d j 2 j 1 n d j 2 according to the fractal concept feng and yu 2007 the length of the tortuous pore lj is suggested to be scaled with the pore diameter dj 17 l j l 0 d t d j 1 d t where l0 m is the representative length and dt is the tortuosity fractal dimension variable between 1 and

principally bioclastic dominated carbonate sediments irregularly and in places weakly cemented known in the murge area as calcareous tufa tropeano and sabato 2000 they are characteristic of shallow marine temperate waters and foreshore shoreface and offshore environments generally the apulian calcarenites are composed of calcite with a low magnesium content caco3 97 98 minor constituents form the insoluble residue which commonly is represented by clay minerals kaolinite illite chlorite smectite and halloysite with negligible quartz feldspar and hydrous iron and aluminium oxides gibbsite and goethite for this study two calcarenite types belonging to the calcarenite di gravina formation middle pliocene lower pleistocene were sampled at massafra caprocetta locality and canosa di puglia tufarelle locality fig 1 for the sake of simplicity the whitish fine grained packstone of caprocetta will be named mc in this paper from massafra caprocetta while the straw yellow medium grained grainstone of tufarelle will be referred to as ct from canosa tufarelle fabric observations were carried out by macroscopic analysis and optical petrographic microscopy with transmitted light on standard thin sections fig 2 the general texture is represented by a self supporting granular framework of skeletal shell fragments and whole shells of marine organisms and by sub rounded and rarely sub angular lithoclasts of micritic limestones the biogenic component prevails over the lithoclasts the bioclastic fraction is represented mainly by lamellibranchs echinoids serpulids benthic foraminifers calcareous algae bryozoans and gastropods lithoclasts include fragments of whitish grey micritic limestones dolomitic limestones and brown and blackish sub rounded and sub angular dolomites deriving from the erosion of the mesozoic basement bioclasts and lithoclasts form a very well sorted mc to moderately sorted ct grain arrangement the degree of packing varies from loosely ct to medium closely packed mc due to the presence of early cement precipitated before grain compaction thus for both types the texture is open and all pores are interconnected and accessible by pore fluids these calcarenites in fact are poorly and irregularly cemented even though the amount of cement is greater in the fine calcarenite type the cement is meniscus calcite formed by equidimensional carbonate microcrystals formed at grain contact or on the grain walls in open pore spaces locally a border crystalline calcite growing perpendicularly from the grain external surfaces is covered by larger and lighter color crystals with scalenohedronic or rhombohedral habitus dog tooth form only in the medium calcarenite early stage of cementation occurs also in the inner cavities of bioclasts late stage cement sparry calcite partially or totally fills the intergranular and intragranular pore spaces but it is very rare and irregularly distributed in both types bioclasts locally exhibit micrite envelopes while microboring is common especially in coarse bivalves the micritic matrix is crypto and micro crystalline and is present in the fine variety it consists of carbonate mud mainly deriving from disintegration of bioclasts by bioerosion and boring or from breaking off and mechanical abrasion of litho and bioclasts in agitated marine waters based upon the pore types and porosity classification of carbonate rocks proposed by choquette and pray 1970 in both calcarenite types the greatest contribution to total porosity is provided by the primary intergranular porosity followed by the intragranular and the moldic porosity the latter being typical of the mc type 4 methods the method proposed in this study consists of four basic steps 1 petrophysical characterization of the materials and hydraulic conductivity tests under saturated conditions by means of standard and unconventional laboratory testing procedures 2 comparative analysis of data and parameters obtained from the bench scale infiltration test 3 definition of pore size distribution and application of theoretical solutions for determining unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water retention curve swrc 4 development of a hydraulic behavior model of unsaturated calcarenites for new hypotheses or predictions to solve practical geo engineering problems 4 1 physical properties following the standard test procedure outlined by the international society for rock mechanics isrm 1979 dry density œÅd mg m 3 and total porosity n were determined on 15 fresh cylindrical calcarenite specimens 71 mm in diameter and 140 mm in height of each type as regards the specific gravity g reference was made to a value of 2 70 based on the chemo mineral composition of the rocks saturated density œÅsat mg m 3 degree of saturation sr and water absorption wa were evaluated according to andriani and walsh 2007 because following the isrm or astm standard procedures most of the water is lost during direct weighting of saturated samples with a common laboratory balance due to the high open porosity and good permeability of this type of materials in particular cylindrical specimens were submerged and suspended in distilled water at 20 c 30 mm below the water surface thus measurements of submerged mass were taken until constant values were achieved for a time variable between 7 ct and 80 mc days afterwards full saturation sr 100 was achieved under vacuum 80 kpa without removing the specimens from the water basket grain gradings were carried out using sieve analysis on loose material obtained from saturated specimens subjected to freeze thaw cycles and disaggregated by hand to avoid breaking of bioclasts and lithoclasts the loose material was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and afterwards sieved using sieve sizes ranging from 2 00 mm to 0 063 mm the remaining fine fractions passing sieve 230 astm series were examined through sedimentation analysis saturated hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted in a purpose built cell on cylindrical rock samples 0 071 0 140 m by means of the constant head and falling head methods according to the procedure proposed by andriani and walsh 2003 the saturated hydraulic conductivity standardized at 20 c k20 m s 1 was evaluated for a range of hydraulic gradient between 0 5 and 15 the test water temperature was 15 1 c 4 2 bench scale falling infiltration tests falling head infiltration tests at bench scale were conducted on regularly shaped prisms ashlars of calcarenite rock with l 50 cm w 25 cm and h 14 cm for mc and l 39 5 cm w 24 5 cm and h 14 5 cm for ct a set of 3 ashlars for both types of calcarenites was used in the experiments ashlar preparation included drying at 110 c in an oven for 24 h a clear polycarbonate cylinder with diameter d of 12 0 cm and height of 50 0 cm was positioned in perfect central position on the top surface of the ashlars to depth of about 0 2 cm into the rock for ensuring good rock cylinder contact the cylinder was then sealed with water proof cement bentonite material to prevent lateral outflow of water the cylinder was filled to the top with de aired water to a given level and a few drops of oil were added on the water surface to prevent the water from evaporating at the beginning of the test a water column of about 25 0 cm was fixed for each test thus at time t 0 the hydraulic head h0 measured in cm and the time were recorded fig 3 the water level in the cylinder was allowed to decrease between 13 and 15 cm the water level fall was measured over time with a ruler the testing time ranged from 60 to 70 min for mc and from 30 to 40 min for ct the room temperature was 20 1 0 c while the test water temperature was 15 1 c no changes in temperature were registered during each test advancement of the lateral wetting front was first observed only on the top surfaces of the ashlars growing in a spiral like concentric circle geometry model after a few minutes the moisture plume appeared also on the fair faced side of the ashlars fig 3a wetting front traces along the faces were also measured over time with a ruler a 3 d visualization of the moisture plume into the rock was derived for both types from a falling head infiltration test using a pvc cylinder positioned at the corner of the top surface of the ashlars fig 3b fig 3c shows the schematic diagram of the falling head infiltration test at the bench scale experimental evidence shows that the wetting front shape can be approximated to a slightly prolate spheroid for the fine calcarenite type mc and to a slightly oblate spheroid for the medium calcarenite type ct for both calcarenite types the shape of the moisture plume is actually like a truncated spheroid acar et al 2009 applied a similar assumption to represent the shape of the moisture plume during infiltration experiments in loam and clay loam soils under this assumption the geometrical evolution of the wetting front over time was controlled by a t m measured on the top surface of the ashlars along the x direction representing the horizontal axis of the truncated spheroid and by z t m measured along the z direction representing the vertical axis of the spheroidal section observed on the fair faced side of the ashlars the vertical axis of the truncated spheroid b m was obtained from the equation 21 b z 1 w 2 4 a 2 where w is the thickness of the ashlar along the y direction as shown in fig 3c the geometric shape of the moisture plume over time was derived as the boolean intersection between the spheroid with the a and b axes and the ashlar using the massprop command of autocad the geometric volume of the moisture plume vg m3 its spatial variance along the horizontal direction œÉ 2 x m2 the surface of the wetting front sg m2 and the coordinates along the vertical direction of the centroid of the wetting front zg were determined as 22 v g v dv 23 œÉ x 2 v x 2 d v v g 24 s g s zds s g 25 z g s zds s g the pore volume of the moisture plume vv m3 was derived as the product between the geometric volume vg and the volumetric water content at saturation Œ∏s m3 m 3 the latter is assumed equal to the porosity n determined using standard geotechnical laboratory procedure the averaged infiltration flow rate qin m3 s 1 was estimated by means of the volumetric method 26 q in h 1 h 2 t 1 t 2 s where s m2 is the internal area of the transverse section of the cylinder and h 1 and h 2 m are the hydraulic heads measured at times t 1 s and t 2 s respectively the total water volume vin m3 in the rock was calculated as 27 v in t Œ¥ t v in t q in t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t with Œ¥ t t 2 t 1 the average effective saturation of the moisture plume was determined as 28 s e v in v g Œ∏ s 4 3 pore size distribution the evaluation of the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve from the pore bundle conceptual model presented in the previous section requires an accurate estimate of the pore size distribution psd for both types mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and image analysis ia techniques were used for this purpose according to astm d4404 1984 the mip was performed for determining pore size distribution effective porosity mean and median pore diameter and tortuosity a micromeritics porosimeter autopore iv 9500 was used at low pressure 3 44 345 kpa and high pressure 0 1 228 mpa on calcarenite fragments of irregular shape of about 2 5 g within the limitation of the operative conditions and the applied methodology the mip technique allowed to evaluate the pore size distribution and the relative porosity for pores with a diameter between 0 0055 and 420 ¬µm previous results and thin section observation under a transmitted light optical microscope demonstrated that the mip analysis concerned only micropores namely less than 50 of the total volume of interconnected pores effectively present in these types of materials andriani and walsh 2002 andriani and walsh 2007 andriani 2021 with the scope to investigate the distribution of pores 420¬µm also an image analysis procedure was performed on photo micrographs of thin sections in plane polarised light transferred directly on a pc twenty five photo micrographs for each type were used for the analysis according to francus 1998 psds by image analysis were carried out as distribution of the equivalent disk diameter it is important to highlight that the minimum size for objects was fixed and depends on the resolving power of the image digitizing equipment 20 ¬µm furthermore starting from the frequency distribution of pore sizes obtained by both mip and ia a representative evaluation of the total pore size distribution for each type was obtained using the monte carlo method specifically if a total number of samples np and assuming that for these materials the porosity n derived from the standard geotechnical laboratory procedure is representative of the total volume of interconnected pores then the number of samples associated to the mip technique is equal to 29 n p mip n p n mip n where n mip is the porosity measured by mip thus the number of samples associated to the ia technique n p ia is 30 n p ia n p 1 n mip n two sets of uniform random number between 0 and 1 u mip and u ia of length equal to n p mip and n p ia are generated the corresponding values of pore diameters will be taken according to f mip 1 u mip and f ia 1 u ia where f mip and f ia are the frequency distribution of pore size diameters derived from the mip and ia techniques respectively finally the combined pore size distribution f di is determined merging the two sets of the pore diameters generated 4 4 prediction of the hydraulic properties from the pore size distribution the monte carlo method was used to estimate the swrc the relative hydraulic conductivity and celerity starting from f di the entire range of pore diameter is divided into several bins let the generic bin Œ¥ d d k 1 d k according to f di a volume fraction of pores Œ¥ f f k 1 f k can be associated according to the pore bundle model a number n Œ¥ d of equivalent cylindrical pores within a range Œ¥d can be determined according to a random sampling procedure a uniform random number u between 0 and 1 is generated then the generic h th equivalent cylindrical pores will be taken according to d h d k Œ¥ d u the random sampling continues until the sum of the cross sectional areas of the generated equivalent cylindrical pores closes the volume fraction of pores 31 h 1 n Œ¥ d œÄ 4 d h 2 Œ¥ f the set of equivalent cylindrical pores associated with each bin is merged and sorted from d min to d max then the matric head œà effective saturation se and relative hydraulic conductivity kr as a function of the critical diameter di can be obtained by eq 8 16 and 18 5 results the aim of the present work is to enhance our knowledge of the unsaturated flow behavior of calcarenites the following sections report the results of the integrated approach used here and which permitted the development of a hydraulic predictive model of the unsaturated flow in such porous calcarenites 5 1 physical properties table 1 shows the physical parameters for both calcarenite types determined by geotechnical laboratory procedures with regard to the constant head test for the saturated condition the experimental values of k20 range between 7 61 10 6 m s 1 and 1 94 10 5 m s 1 for mc and between 4 49 10 5 m s 1 and 7 30 10 5 m s 1 for ct in the falling head test the saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements vary between 9 2 10 6 m s 1 and 3 34 10 5 m s 1 for mc and between 5 28 10 5 m s 1 and 7 88 10 5 m s 1 for ct these data reveal a moderate water permeability for both calcarenite types as regards the imbibition test for submerged samples at the pressure exerted only by buoyancy forces a degree of saturation of 83 and 88 was obtained for ct and mc samples respectively for the two types of calcarenite studied full saturation sr 100 was achieved under vacuum 80 kpa without removing the specimens from the water basket demonstrating total pore interconnection and accessibility fig 4 with reference to the grain size analysis based on the uniformity coefficient cu mc and ct can be classified as uniformly graded and poorly graded respectively fig 5 in fact from the granulometric curves obtained for the two types tested cu varies between 1 5 and 2 7 for mc and between 3 2 and 7 5 for ct 5 2 pore size distributions incremental and cumulative intrusion curves derived by the mip technique related to two representative specimens of both calcarenite types are presented in figs 6 and 7 comparing the intrusion and extrusion curves in fig 7 demonstrates that about 27 0 of the pores for mc samples and 24 0 of the pores for ct samples consist of ink bottle pores the pore parameters obtained by mip are summarised in table 2 the comparison of the experimental data regarding accessible or effective porosity obtained using standard geotechnical laboratory procedures and the mip established that the mip analysis involved 85 6 and 57 8 of the interconnected pores effectively present in the mc and ct samples figs 8 and 9 depict the histograms of the frequency distribution of pore sizes by means of mip and ia for both calcarenite types in table 3 it is possible to compare the frequency of the different pore size classes obtained by mip and ia for the two calcarenite types according to the classification scheme developed by brewer 1964 according to the monte carlo method the psds were derived fig 10 shows the cumulative curves and histograms of the frequency distribution of pore sizes by the combined analysis andriani and walsh 2002 5 3 hydraulic behavior of the unsaturated calcarenites having determined the pore size distributions of both calcarenites their hydraulic properties were predicted according to the pore bundle model the pore diameter range was divided into several bins whose size follows a logarithmic growth equivalent cylindrical pores were generated according to the monte carlo sampling procedure presented in the previous section fig 11 shows the soil water retention curves for both calcarenite types they depict the bi modal features of the psds an initial condition of full saturation where all pores are filled by water was considered when the matric head becomes lower than the air entry value the drainage process starts and the water stored in macropores drains first consequently the effective saturation decreases when the macropores become empty d i 5 10 Œºm œà 10 Œºm a change of slope is evident for both calcarenite types and the drainage process is governed by the micropores thus according to the physical mechanism of capillarity the effective saturation decreases more slowly with regard to the falling head infiltration tests at the bench scale an early rapid drop was highlighted in the hydraulic head versus time curve which showed an exponential behavior due to rapid infiltration in the dry calcarenites by way of example fig 12 shows the changes in hydraulic head with time in test 1 fine grained calcarenite mc and test 4 medium grained calcarenite ct after a hydraulic head drop of 0 059 m at 840 s and of 0 078 m at 540 s respectively for mc and ct the data fall close to a straight line which identifies a steady state water infiltration rate the slope of the best fit line represents the average value of the infiltration rate in m s 1 which amounts to 4 10 5 m s 1 and 6 10 5 m s 1 for mc and ct respectively fig 13 shows the total water volume in the moisture plume vin pore volume of the moisture plume vv v g Œ∏ s and the average effective saturation s e versus time for both calcarenite types in the early stage of the tests water infiltrates rapidly in the dry calcarenites due to the hydraulic head and the rate exceeds the maximum infiltration rate thus vin is near to vv and the moisture plume propagates in a quasi saturated condition because air in the pores is almost completely replaced by water fig 13 later the application rate becomes lower than the maximum infiltration rate and an unsaturated condition develops effective saturation decreases more quickly in the medium grained calcarenite where a higher infiltration rate was reached the advection diffusion form of richard s equation is valid under the unsaturated condition thus only the data measured at values of s e below 90 were considered once the geometry of the moisture plume was defined as stated in the previous section the centroid of the wetting front was determined and plotted versus time fig 14 according to the infiltration rate the z coordinate of the centroid of the wetting front zg propagated more rapidly in ct reaching greater distances than in mc in order to analyze water diffusion processes spatial variance œÉx 2 along the x direction was determined fig 15 shows the relationship between œÉx 2 and average volumetric water content Œ∏ s e Œ∏ s of the moisture plume for the same value of average volumetric water content ct shows higher value of spatial variance than mc this means that according to pore size distribution the moisture plume in ct propagated with a volumetric water content distribution more dispersed than in mc 5 4 prediction of the unsaturated flow in the calcarenite the observed behavior of the moisture plume was compared with the predictive model derived from the pore size distribution determined by experimentation and the pore bundle concept in particular the observed evolution of the centroid of the wetting front zg was fitted with its predicted value z g calculated as the time integral of the celerity function cw eq 20 32 z g c w d t k s Œ∏ s d k r dse d t the values of the derivative of the relative hydraulic conductivity with respect to the effective saturation were determined in correspondence of the values of the average effective saturation s e fig 16 shows the comparison between observed and predicted values for both calcarenite types the data from the predictive model shows a satisfactory fit to the experimental data for a value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 40 10 5 and 5 50 10 5 m s 1 with a value of dt 1 20 fig 17 shows the predicted hydraulic conductivity function estimated though the fitting procedure an inflection is evident in the k se curves when the effective saturation becomes lower than 0 27 and 0 43 for ct and mc respectively macropores characterized by a diameter di higher than 5 10 Œºm are empty and do not contribute to the water flow as a consequence the relative hydraulic conductivity decreases rapidly 6 discussion the main objective of this study is to predict the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of calcarenites by means of laboratory tests and theoretical conceptual analysis based on well known models and detailed characterization of texture in particular porosity and its type pore size distribution and network as regards the calcarenites belonging to calcarenite di gravina formation all facies with few exceptions are characterised by interconnected pores in the network structures at the rock mass scale two components of porosity can be considered textural and structural the textural porosity depends on particle arrangement and interlocking and the nature of individual grains bioclast species type lithoclasts etc the structural porosity on the other hand is linked to the presence of macroscopic non random discontinuities e g fractures faults and karst features andriani and parise 2015 andriani and parise 2017 at the mesoscopic scale porosity of the calcarenites is essentially textural in type and structural porosity is confined to the presence of sedimentary structures bioturbations and microcracks in this study we have utilized two calcarenite types with different texture a packstone mc and a grainstone ct both with nearly random packing but different grain sorting both types are composed of grains with different shapes and roundness due to their different nature with the result of a lower packing density with respect to a theoretical arrangement of spherical grains with the same size distribution besides both types are not organized according to a close arrangement because compaction was inhibited by an early stage carbonate cementation which is the dominant type of cement it follows that the porosity calculated by traditional geotechnical procedures is high and open all pores are interconnected and accessible as demonstrated by the imbibition test results because also intragranular pre depositional moldic and inter crystalline porosity post depositional are connected with the intergranular pores depositional through microcracks post depositional thus intergranular intragranular and moldic porosity in combination with inter crystalline and microfracture porosity reflect high effective porosity and water transmissivity of these materials according to the pore size classification by brewer 1964 if intergranular pores can be considered almost all macropores of uniform size but different shape the other types of pores are characterized by heterogeneous pore size distributions and different shapes in particular moldic pores are mainly subspherical and range from 30 to 350 ¬µm intragranular pores are different in size and shape according to the species types of the bioclastic fraction while inter crystalline pores and micro cracks are mainly represented by tortuous micro throats inter crystalline pores develop inside cements and re crystallized micrite matrix while microcracks affect also bioclasts especially foraminifers in general we can state that suction is higher and permeability lower for the mc because the distribution in pore size is skewed toward the fine tail of the cumulative pore size curve in our opinion pore network of these calcarenites can be schematically considered as a system of pseudo spherical and tetracubic voids directly connected by cylindrical tubes or neck shaped channels the first type of pores are macropores cylindrical tubes are macro or mesopores while neck shaped channels are more tortuous and mainly microporous and in part mesoporous in nature pore size distribution is thus heterogeneous comprised of homogeneous pores of pseudo spherical and tetracubic voids and heterogeneous pores of cylindrical and neck shaped voids it is principally a porosity texture in which macropores and mesopores which constitute the prevailing pore fractions are connected by micro throats thus on the basis of what was observed during the different experimental phases and considering the pore network described above when calcarenite surfaces are exposed to submersion or heavy rainfall the infiltrated water flows first in the available macropores between the grains but some macropores remain dry because they are separated by micro throats this happens because infiltration rates through meso and micropores are lower than the inlet flow rates of water consequently water moves more quickly through interconnected larger pores bypassing the smaller pores which due to the gradient of matric potential absorb water until they are filled thus the matric potential falls abruptly and water initiates infiltration through the remaining meso and macropores therefore the remaining larger pores continue to be inactive until the smaller ones are filled the complexity of such a pore network for the calcarenites studied is characterized by a bi modal pore size distribution which depicts the coexistence of two pore regions macropores and micropores assuming local equilibrium conditions and darcy richards concepts water initially infiltrates into the smallest non wetted part of the pore space micropore the soil water retention curves and the hydraulic conductivity functions determined according to the pore size distribution and pore bundle concepts reflect the textural features of the investigated calcarenite types at the same value of effective saturation the matric head results lower for mc than ct and the former retains more water than the latter as the effective saturation decreases a change of slope is evident in swrc and k se function for both calcarenites li et al 2014 found the same behavior in gap graded soil characterized by bi modal pore size distribution as saturation decreases reaching the value of matric head œà 10 m a change of slope is evident for both calcarenite types macropores are empty and the drainage process is governed by the micropores that loose water in a slower way specifically given that ct presents more macropores than mc with a more pronounced bimodal distribution the change of slope in the swrc occurs at the effective saturation of 0 27 for ct and 0 46 for mc and is more pronounced for the former our laboratory experiments based on soil suction measurements at different volumetric content turturro et al 2013 which employed the quasi steady centrifuge method turturro et al 2020 on the ct and mc calcarenite samples found behavior similar with experimental swrc and hydraulic conductivity functions the time evolution of the centroid of the wetting front was derived adopting the pore bundle model that fits the experimental data obtained from the bench scale infiltration test both calcarenites show the same behavior with a tortuosity fractal dimension dt equal to 1 20 for the saturation range investigated 0 9 se 0 5 the hydraulic conductivity varies passing from 9 48 10 6 m s 1 to 1 15 10 6 m s 1 for ct and from 3 59 10 6 to 1 89 10 7 m s 1 for mc the experimental hydraulic conductivity functions which we have found are in agreement with the results presented in caputo and nimmo 2005 where the hydraulic conductivity functions determined for calcarenite types comparable to that used in our study show the same behavior for the volumetric water content range investigated the falling head infiltration test we conducted shows an early drop of hydraulic head versus time corresponding to a rapid infiltration rate in the dry calcarenite successively infiltration rate become constant reaching values of 4 10 5 m s 1 and 6 10 5 m s 1 for mc and ct respectively the same behavior was observed in single ring infiltrometer field tests conducted by caputo et al 2012 and andriani et al 2013 these studies found an infiltration rate for the medium grained ct grainstone of around 3 10 5 m s 1 at the wet stage se 0 5 which was investigated with the bench scale infiltration test the smallest pores are filled water develops by means of a continuous flow through interconnected macropores or meso and macropores following flow paths characterized by the minimum flow resistance thus the wetting front propagates quickly bypassing large parts of the micropore spaces in the latter a diffuse flow is active although with slow dynamics and is regulated by capillary forces in their study regarding the western australian dune calcarenites treble et al 2013 found that diffuse flow is dominant and follows vertical flow paths water transmission through tortuous micro throats is slower and has a relatively little influence on the water flow through macropores and interconnected macro and mesopores when micro throats are filled water moves through the remaining larger structural pores inside the material consequently gravity driven flow is higher than diffusive mixing mechanisms according to the experimental evidence from this study this simple schematization of the water infiltration process in unsaturated calcarenites is plausible if the inlet flow rates of water are high i e for submersion or high intensity rainfall where high or intermediate saturation conditions occur the falling head infiltration test at the bench scale presented here basically simulates cases that can be compared with high intensity rainfall events after a period of drought the samples were dried before testing during low intensity or distributed rains the inlet flow rates of water are low and diffuse flow through micropores will be favored due to the high value of the matric potential besides at low saturation condition the surface of macropore is covered by absorbed film then water movement could be dominated by film flow mechanisms 7 conclusions the results of this study allowed us to define the hydraulic behavior of calcarenites with different texture in unsaturated conditions by using the advective diffusive forms of richards equation and the pore bundle model the integrated methodological approach proposed here demonstrates that the hydraulic behavior of these materials is strongly influenced by topology of pore network and pore size distribution but at the same time depends on the degree of saturation of the materials at the beginning of the infiltration process as well as on the inlet flow rate of water according to the experimental evidence although the porosity of materials resulted open the pore size distribution governs the infiltration processes the wetting front propagates mainly through the macropores with a gravity driven flow velocity higher than the diffusive flow through the micropores the results obtained in our study raise new questions is the diffusive flow velocity higher than the gravity driven flow velocity under low infiltration rate during a low wet phase what is the relationship between the two flow velocities in different saturation conditions by varying the infiltration rate for these reasons the infiltration processes in calcarenites have to be investigated at different spatial and temporal scale for these reasons the infiltration processes in calcarenites have to be investigated at different spatial and temporal scales future scenarios concern the possibility of considering more complex conceptual models such as multi porosity and multi permeability models under non equilibrium conditions in order to depict the complex porous structure of calcarenites further numerical models could be implemented and the validity and reliability of the proposed conceptual models by comparing the observed and the simulated data at the same time new experimental laboratory and or field tests could be set up in order to investigate the limits of validity of the capillary dominated flow in calcarenites varying the initial degree of saturation and the infiltration rate credit authorship contribution statement gioacchino francesco andriani conceptualization methodology validation formal

4200,most infiltration and water retention models for unsaturated porous media proposed in the literature often are based on simplified representations of the pore system and use the matric head as the main state variable an integrated study on the hydraulic properties of homogeneous calcarenites with a complex pore network is presented aimed at assessing water infiltration and retention mechanisms starting from dry to wet conditions under high water inflow medium grained grainstones and fine grained packstones were used as material for laboratory testing and model set up petrophysical characterization and bimodal distribution of pore volume was obtained by standard and unconventional procedures permeability test under saturated conditions was performed with constant and falling head tests falling head infiltration tests at bench scale were carried out to estimate the hydraulic properties of the materials under unsaturated conditions unsaturated hydraulic relationships such as the soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity function were examined the advection diffusion form of richard s equation together with the pore bundle model and dual porosity concept under equilibrium conditions represent the theoretical framework used to investigate the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of the calcarenites in the falling head infiltration test the swrc relative hydraulic conductivity and celerity were determined through the capillary theory and pore bundle concept considering the bi modal nature of the pore size distribution theoretical solutions and model predictions were compared with experimental data which demonstrated the dominant control of macro porosity on water flow and infiltration rate in particular our experimental results indicate that the wetting front propagates mainly through the macropores with a gravity driven flow velocity higher than the diffusive flow through the micropores the effect of texture degree of saturation and boundary conditions on infiltration dynamics is discussed keywords calcarenites fabric unsaturated flow infiltration hydraulic conductivity retention 1 introduction understanding and defining parameters and laws which regulate infiltration processes in the vadose zone is crucial to the representation of the hydrologic cycle and provides useful insights into run off generation aquifer recharge and contaminant transport corradini et al 2011 pastore et al 2020 furthermore rock deterioration processes slope stability settlement and bearing capacity are topics in which water infiltration rate and mechanisms must be defined and determined ng and shi 1998 bouwer 2002 ng and menzies 2007 lu et al 2009 oh and lu 2015 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2017 casnedi et al 2018 li et al 2019 the effects of global warming have led to climate changes in the mediterranean basin resulting in an increase in the frequency of extreme dry periods alternating with clustered rainfall events which together influence runoff infiltration partitioning and aquifer recharge corradini et al 2000 additionally storm water infiltration and pore pressure fluctuations are responsible in many cases for landslides or collapse of underground cavities mar√©chal et al 2008 parise et al 2015 parise et al 2018 fazio et al 2017 martinotti et al 2017 hou et al 2019 in fact according to xiao et al 2016 the dominant factors triggering landslides are water infiltration and redistribution mechanisms within micro and macro porosity rather than cumulative rainfall 1 1 current understanding of unsaturated flow in geological media the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated geologic media is very complex and existing theoretical approaches for modeling efforts are generally not extensive and not always applicable to any lithological or litho technical unit this happens because the water flow within the unsaturated zone is affected by many factors including the hydraulic properties of media and the climatic conditions rainfall intensity and duration rainfall pattern and evapotranspiration most of the uncertainties arise from the high nonlinearity and horizontal and vertical spatial variability of the hydraulic parameters involved in the transient unsaturated flow system and from the spatial and temporal changes in the initial and boundary conditions in terms of influence of human activities slope of the surface topography vegetation and location of the water table corradini et al 2002 zhan and ng 2004 morbidelli et al 2015 lu 2018 furthermore grain grading mineralogy and fabric including texture and microscopic and macroscopic structure control the ability of a soil rock to retain or transmit water and its dissolved content into and through the vadose or saturated zone thus fabric porosity and their relationships are essential because water flow and transport processes that occur in geologic media are affected by geometry and topology of the pore network nimmo 1997 nimmo 2004 nimmo 2005 andriani and walsh 2007 andriani and walsh 2010 characteristically pore structure plays a key role in affecting the hysteresis loop of the soil water retention curve swrc or water retention curve wrc which describes the relationship between volumetric water content and matric suction or matric head the primary empirical theoretical model for simulating infiltration in the field is the green ampt model which is based on a sharp piston wetting front approach for any continuous and isotropic medium green and ampt 1911 it estimates cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate as an implicit function of time by assuming water flow into a vertical homogeneous soil that is infinite in depth more recently this model has been modified and extended to a constant intensity rainfall input condition mein and larson 1973 unsteady rainfall distribution chu 1978 infiltration during complex rainfall sequences corradini et al 1997 sloping surface chen and young 2006 morbidelli et al 2015 layered soils with non uniform initial water content under unsteady infiltration liu et al 2008 local infiltration into two layered soils with a more permeable upper layer corradini et al 2011 and fine textured soils with a coarse interlayer chen et al 2019 to mention the main studies only the hydraulic properties of unsaturated geologic media include water retention and permeability the flow of water through unsaturated geologic media is in fact strongly conditioned by matric suction which corresponds to a negative pressure potential and by hydraulic conductivity which is a nonlinear function of matric suction or water content although over the last 70 years a number of techniques have been used to determine the soil water retention curve swrc for different geologic media their limited applicability poor practicality and high cost along with the significant temporal spatial variabilities in the hydraulic properties suggest applying parametric empirical equations to best fit experimental data nimmo 2009 the most widely used empirical equations are those by brooks and corey 1964 campbell 1974 and van genuchten 1980 the brooks and corey equation 1964 expresses effective saturation as a power function of soil matric head the campbell model 1974 expresses hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as functions of the air entry potential which depends on pore size distribution tortuosity and connectivity of the porous media the van genuchten 1980 equation relates the effective saturation to soil suction as pressure difference between the air and water phases and two other parameters the first related to the air entry value and the second to the slope of the water retention curve lenhard et al 1989 fredlund et al 2012 these models propose theoretical pore size gradings that reflect unimodal distributions and generally are accurate for high and medium water content but often give poor results at lower degrees of saturation wosten and van genuchten 1988 ross et al 1991 fredlund and xing 1994 similar to the saturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is generally governed by darcy s law according to the buckingham darcy flux differential equation for vertical flow fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in particular the hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soils is strongly affected by combined changes in void ratio for unsaturated soils as matric suction increases the void ratio decreases and water content or degree of saturation and useful functions are obtained using laboratory tests gallage et al 2013 while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils is typically greater than that of clayey soils the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils decreases more rapidly with increasing negative pore water pressure or matric suction and can become lower than that of clayey soils usually this occurs because in sands most pores are meso or macropore in nature brewer 1964 and desaturation rate is higher than that of clays thus at a given pore water pressure only a small amount of water remains in the pore system all aforementioned studies focus almost exclusively on soils and therefore are difficult to apply to rock media despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity for these materials also depends on the volumetric water content or in other terms on the degree of saturation and negative pore water pressure although the change in void ratio may be assumed to be null the presence of pervasive discontinuities in rock masses in fact influences the hydraulic behavior of media and fracture dominated flow in addition technical aspects need to be considered because the material strength makes it difficult to install expensive and time consuming devices to date the determination of hydraulic properties of rocks in situ or in laboratory is limited in many cases these are adaptations of soil physical standard methods direct and indirect in nature such methods include reflectometry thermocouple psychrometry electrical resistivity tomography steady state centrifugation and also include theoretical work numerical simulations and experimental studies

as well moreover although the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated calcarenites is very important in various scientific research fields it is still little known in the specific literature recently caputo et al 2012 used the single ring infiltrometer test coupled with electrical resistivity measurements for calculating in situ flow rate in unsaturated calcarenites andriani et al 2013 proposed a comprehensive method by combining in situ measurements by 3d time lapse electrical resistivity tomography single ring infiltrometer testing and petrophysical parametrization to obtain the infiltration rate and lowering of the wetting front through the vadose zone of an aquifer laboratory tests for this purpose are generally not recommended as a homogeneous laboratory sample does not actually represent the field conditions in places however these calcarenites at the rock mass scale appear homogeneous massive or thick bedded with only occasional faults and fractures thus the laboratory samples can be considered representative of the in situ conditions interestingly caputo and nimmo 2005 developed a quasi steady centrifuge apparatus for laboratory measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention using core samples of the calcarenite di gravina formation from varying depths 1 3 research aim with the purpose of predicting the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of calcarenites using easy procedures and methods this study presents an integrated approach based on petrophysical characterization including grain and pore size distributions experimental data obtained by falling head infiltration tests at bench scale and conceptual and theoretical solutions to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic behavior in terms of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and soil water retention curve swrc calcarenite ashlars sampled from two quarries in apulia southern italy namely at massafra and canosa di puglia fig 1 were used as testing material the implications of the results obtained in this study are significant in the field of hydrology hydrogeology engineering geology and could be used to understand infiltration rates and patterns through porous calcarenites characterized by a complex network of pores 2 theoretical framework 2 1 Œ∏ based richard s model an early conceptual model for transient water flow in a variably saturated soil was developed in 1931 by richards the theoretical formulation is based on the relation between the hydraulic conductivity and the volumetric water content in particular the flow equation is based on capillary conduction and water storage is assumed to be a function of capillary potential which is perceived to be equivalent to the negative pore water pressure in the soil richards 1931 nimmo 2009 fredlund et al 2012 thus the fluid flow through variably saturated media assuming that a hydraulic equilibrium exists between different pore regions macropore and micropore can be described by richard s well known equation 1 c Œ∏ œà t k Œ∏ œà z where œà m is the matric head Œ∏ m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content c Œ∏ m 1 is the water capacity which is equal to the derivative of Œ∏ with respect toœà and k Œ∏ m s 1 is the water dependent hydraulic conductivity according to the buckingham darcy s law buckingham 1907 k Œ∏ is equal to the product between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks m s 1 and the relative hydraulic conductivity function kr Œ∏ neglecting the residual water content Œ∏r m3 m 3 the volumetric water content Œ∏ is equal to the product of the saturated volumetric water content Œ∏s m3 m 3 and the effective saturation se under unsaturated flow conditions eq 1 can be rewritten using Œ∏ as a state variable instead of œà zehe and

wet and moderately wet stages capillarity is the main retention mechanism the matric head œà can be determined by the equilibrium of air pressure pore water pressure contact angle and water surface tension lu 2016 it is clear that the capillary mechanism favors small pores with a given matric head thus at a given volumetric water content Œ∏i m3 m 3 there exists a critical pore diameter di m whether the pores having d j d i j 1 i are filled with water micropores are the first to be filled followed by the larger pores the capillary mechanism can be expressed by the young laplace equation where the matric head œài at which a pore fills or empties is a function of the correspondent critical pore diameter d i 8 œà i d i œÉ cos Œµ d i œÅ w g where œÉ is the surface tension n m 1 Œµ is the contact angle between particles and water œÅw is density of water kg m 3 and g m s 2 is the acceleration due to gravity according to mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 and chang and cheng 2018 the contact angle Œµ is equal to 0 a simple way to represent the complex porous media structure is the well known pore bundle model golparvar et al 2018 the pore network is reduced to a cluster of tortuous capillary tubes with smooth inner surface according to the mechanism of water retention in the moderately wet range water flows through the pores filled by bulk water the flow rate within the generic tortuous pore j with diameter dj m can be described by the hagen poiseuille equation 9 q j d j œÅ w g Œº w œÄ d j 4 128 Œ¥ h l j where qj m3 s 1 is the flow rate of the pore j Œºw pa s 1 is the water

principally bioclastic dominated carbonate sediments irregularly and in places weakly cemented known in the murge area as calcareous tufa tropeano and sabato 2000 they are characteristic of shallow marine temperate waters and foreshore shoreface and offshore environments generally the apulian calcarenites are composed of calcite with a low magnesium content caco3 97 98 minor constituents form the insoluble residue which commonly is represented by clay minerals kaolinite illite chlorite smectite and halloysite with negligible quartz feldspar and hydrous iron and aluminium oxides gibbsite and goethite for this study two calcarenite types belonging to the calcarenite di gravina formation middle pliocene lower pleistocene were sampled at massafra caprocetta locality and canosa di puglia tufarelle locality fig 1 for the sake of simplicity the whitish fine grained packstone of caprocetta will be named mc in this paper from massafra caprocetta while the straw yellow medium grained grainstone of tufarelle will be referred to as ct from canosa tufarelle fabric observations were carried out by macroscopic analysis and optical petrographic microscopy with transmitted light on standard thin sections fig 2 the general texture is represented by a self supporting granular framework of skeletal shell fragments and whole shells of marine organisms and by sub rounded and rarely sub angular lithoclasts of micritic limestones the biogenic component prevails over the lithoclasts the bioclastic fraction is represented mainly by lamellibranchs echinoids serpulids benthic foraminifers calcareous algae bryozoans and gastropods lithoclasts include fragments of whitish grey micritic limestones dolomitic limestones and brown and blackish sub rounded and sub angular dolomites deriving from the erosion of the mesozoic basement bioclasts and lithoclasts form a very well sorted mc to moderately sorted ct grain arrangement the degree of packing varies from loosely ct to medium closely packed mc due to the presence of early cement precipitated before grain compaction thus for both types the texture is open and all pores are interconnected and accessible by pore fluids these calcarenites in fact are poorly and irregularly cemented even though the amount of cement is greater in the fine calcarenite type the cement is meniscus calcite formed by equidimensional carbonate microcrystals formed at grain contact or on the grain walls in open pore spaces locally a border crystalline calcite growing perpendicularly from the grain external surfaces is covered by larger and lighter color crystals with scalenohedronic or rhombohedral habitus dog tooth form only in the medium calcarenite early stage of cementation occurs also in the inner cavities of bioclasts late stage cement sparry calcite partially or totally fills the intergranular and intragranular pore spaces but it is very rare and irregularly distributed in both types bioclasts locally exhibit micrite envelopes while microboring is common especially in coarse bivalves the micritic matrix is crypto and micro crystalline and is present in the fine variety it consists of carbonate mud mainly deriving from disintegration of bioclasts by bioerosion and boring or from breaking off and mechanical abrasion of litho and bioclasts in agitated marine waters based upon the pore types and porosity classification of carbonate rocks proposed by choquette and pray 1970 in both calcarenite types the greatest contribution to total porosity is provided by the primary intergranular porosity followed by the intragranular and the moldic porosity the latter being typical of the mc type 4 methods the method proposed in this study consists of four basic steps 1 petrophysical characterization of the materials and hydraulic conductivity tests under saturated conditions by means of standard and unconventional laboratory testing procedures 2 comparative analysis of data and parameters obtained from the bench scale infiltration test 3 definition of pore size distribution and application of theoretical solutions for determining unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water retention curve swrc 4 development of a hydraulic behavior model of unsaturated calcarenites for new hypotheses or predictions to solve practical geo engineering problems 4 1 physical properties following the standard test procedure outlined by the international society for rock mechanics isrm 1979 dry density œÅd mg m 3 and total porosity n were determined on 15 fresh cylindrical calcarenite specimens 71 mm in diameter and 140 mm in height of each type as regards the specific gravity g reference was made to a value of 2 70 based on the chemo mineral composition of the rocks saturated density œÅsat mg m 3 degree of saturation sr and water absorption wa were evaluated according to andriani and walsh 2007 because following the isrm or astm standard procedures most of the water is lost during direct weighting of saturated samples with a common laboratory balance due to the high open porosity and good permeability of this type of materials in particular cylindrical specimens were submerged and suspended in distilled water at 20 c 30 mm below the water surface thus measurements of submerged mass were taken until constant values were achieved for a time variable between 7 ct and 80 mc days afterwards full saturation sr 100 was achieved under vacuum 80 kpa without removing the specimens from the water basket grain gradings were carried out using sieve analysis on loose material obtained from saturated specimens subjected to freeze thaw cycles and disaggregated by hand to avoid breaking of bioclasts and lithoclasts the loose material was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and afterwards sieved using sieve sizes ranging from 2 00 mm to 0 063 mm the remaining fine fractions passing sieve 230 astm series were examined through sedimentation analysis saturated hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted in a purpose built cell on cylindrical rock samples 0 071 0 140 m by means of the constant head and falling head methods according to the procedure proposed by andriani and walsh 2003 the saturated hydraulic conductivity standardized at 20 c k20 m s 1 was evaluated for a range of hydraulic gradient between 0 5 and 15 the test water temperature was 15 1 c 4 2 bench scale falling infiltration tests falling head infiltration tests at bench scale were conducted on regularly shaped prisms ashlars of calcarenite rock with l 50 cm w 25 cm and h 14 cm for mc and l 39 5 cm w 24 5 cm and h 14 5 cm for ct a set of 3 ashlars for both types of calcarenites was used in the experiments ashlar preparation included drying at 110 c in an oven for 24 h a clear polycarbonate cylinder with diameter d of 12 0 cm and height of 50 0 cm was positioned in perfect central position on the top surface of the ashlars to depth of about 0 2 cm into the rock for ensuring good rock cylinder contact the cylinder was then sealed with water proof cement bentonite material to prevent lateral outflow of water the cylinder was filled to the top with de aired water to a given level and a few drops of oil were added on the water surface to prevent the water from evaporating at the beginning of the test a water column of about 25 0 cm was fixed for each test thus at time t 0 the hydraulic head h0 measured in cm and the time were recorded fig 3 the water level in the cylinder was allowed to decrease between 13 and 15 cm the water level fall was measured over time with a ruler the testing time ranged from 60 to 70 min for mc and from 30 to 40 min for ct the room temperature was 20 1 0 c while the test water temperature was 15 1 c no changes in temperature were registered during each test advancement of the lateral wetting front was first observed only on the top surfaces of the ashlars growing in a spiral like concentric circle geometry model after a few minutes the moisture plume appeared also on the fair faced side of the ashlars fig 3a wetting front traces along the faces were also measured over time with a ruler a 3 d visualization of the moisture plume into the rock was derived for both types from a falling head infiltration test using a pvc cylinder positioned at the corner of the top surface of the ashlars fig 3b fig 3c shows the schematic diagram of the falling head infiltration test at the bench scale experimental evidence shows that the wetting front shape can be approximated to a slightly prolate spheroid for the fine calcarenite type mc and to a slightly oblate spheroid for the medium calcarenite type ct for both calcarenite types the shape of the moisture plume is actually like a truncated spheroid acar et al 2009 applied a similar assumption to represent the shape of the moisture plume during infiltration experiments in loam and clay loam soils under this assumption the geometrical evolution of the wetting front over time was controlled by a t m measured on the top surface of the ashlars along the x direction representing the horizontal axis of the truncated spheroid and by z t m measured along the z direction representing the vertical axis of the spheroidal section observed on the fair faced side of the ashlars the vertical axis of the truncated spheroid b m was obtained from the equation 21 b z 1 w 2 4 a 2 where w is the thickness of the ashlar along the y direction as shown in fig 3c the geometric shape of the moisture plume over time was derived as the boolean intersection between the spheroid with the a and b axes and the ashlar using the massprop command of autocad the geometric volume of the moisture plume vg m3 its spatial variance along the horizontal direction œÉ 2 x m2 the surface of the wetting front sg m2 and the coordinates along the vertical direction of the centroid of the wetting front zg were determined as 22 v g v dv 23 œÉ x 2 v x 2 d v v g 24 s g s zds s g 25 z g s zds s g the pore volume of the moisture plume vv m3 was derived as the product between the geometric volume vg and the volumetric water content at saturation Œ∏s m3 m 3 the latter is assumed equal to the porosity n determined using standard geotechnical laboratory procedure the averaged infiltration flow rate qin m3 s 1 was estimated by means of the volumetric method 26 q in h 1 h 2 t 1 t 2 s where s m2 is the internal area of the transverse section of the cylinder and h 1 and h 2 m are the hydraulic heads measured at times t 1 s and t 2 s respectively the total water volume vin m3 in the rock was calculated as 27 v in t Œ¥ t v in t q in t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t with Œ¥ t t 2 t 1 the average effective saturation of the moisture plume was determined as 28 s e v in v g Œ∏ s 4 3 pore size distribution the evaluation of the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve from the pore bundle conceptual model presented in the previous section requires an accurate estimate of the pore size distribution psd for both types mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and image analysis ia techniques were used for this purpose according to astm d4404 1984 the mip was performed for determining pore size distribution effective porosity mean and median pore diameter and tortuosity a micromeritics porosimeter autopore iv 9500 was used at low pressure 3 44 345 kpa and high pressure 0 1 228 mpa on calcarenite fragments of irregular shape of about 2 5 g within the limitation of the operative conditions and the applied methodology the mip technique allowed to evaluate the pore size distribution and the relative porosity for pores with a diameter between 0 0055 and 420 ¬µm previous results and thin section observation under a transmitted light optical microscope demonstrated that the mip analysis concerned only micropores namely less than 50 of the total volume of interconnected pores effectively present in these types of materials andriani and walsh 2002 andriani and walsh 2007 andriani 2021 with the scope to investigate the distribution of pores 420¬µm also an image analysis procedure was performed on photo micrographs of thin sections in plane polarised light transferred directly on a pc twenty five photo micrographs for each type were used for the analysis according to francus 1998 psds by image analysis were carried out as distribution of the equivalent disk diameter it is important to highlight that the minimum size for objects was fixed and depends on the resolving power of the image digitizing equipment 20 ¬µm furthermore starting from the frequency distribution of pore sizes obtained by both mip and ia a representative evaluation of the total pore size distribution for each type was obtained using the monte carlo method specifically if a total number of samples np and assuming that for these materials the porosity n derived from the standard geotechnical laboratory procedure is representative of the total volume of interconnected pores then the number of samples associated to the mip technique is equal to 29 n p mip n p n mip n where n mip is the porosity measured by mip thus the number of samples associated to the ia technique n p ia is 30 n p ia n p 1 n mip n two sets of uniform random number between 0 and 1 u mip and u ia of length equal to n p mip and n p ia are generated the corresponding values of pore diameters will be taken according to f mip 1 u mip and f ia 1 u ia where f mip and f ia are the frequency distribution of pore size diameters derived from the mip and ia techniques respectively finally the combined pore size distribution f di is determined merging the two sets of the pore diameters generated 4 4 prediction of the hydraulic properties from the pore size distribution the monte carlo method was used to estimate the swrc the relative hydraulic conductivity and celerity starting from f di the entire range of pore diameter is divided into several bins let the generic bin Œ¥ d d k 1 d k according to f

continues until the sum of the cross sectional areas of the generated equivalent cylindrical pores closes the volume fraction of pores 31 h 1 n Œ¥ d œÄ 4 d h 2 Œ¥ f the set of equivalent cylindrical pores associated with each bin is merged and sorted from d min to d max then the matric head œà effective saturation se and relative hydraulic conductivity kr as a function of the critical diameter di can be obtained by eq 8 16 and 18 5 results the aim of the present work is to enhance our knowledge of the unsaturated flow behavior of calcarenites the following sections report the results of the integrated approach used here and which permitted the development of a hydraulic predictive model of the unsaturated flow in such porous calcarenites 5 1 physical properties table 1 shows the physical parameters for both calcarenite types determined by geotechnical laboratory procedures with regard to the constant head test for the saturated condition the experimental values of k20 range between 7 61 10 6 m s 1 and 1 94 10 5 m s 1 for mc and between 4 49 10 5 m s 1 and 7 30 10 5 m s 1 for ct in the falling head test the saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements vary between 9 2 10 6 m s 1 and 3 34 10 5 m s 1 for mc and between 5 28 10 5 m s 1 and 7 88 10 5 m s 1 for ct these data reveal a moderate water permeability for both calcarenite types as regards the imbibition test for submerged samples at the pressure exerted only by buoyancy forces a degree of saturation of 83 and 88 was obtained for ct and mc samples respectively for the two types of calcarenite studied full saturation sr 100 was achieved under vacuum 80 kpa without removing the specimens from the water basket demonstrating total pore interconnection and accessibility fig 4 with reference to the grain size analysis based on the uniformity coefficient cu mc and ct can be classified as uniformly graded and poorly graded respectively fig 5 in fact from the granulometric curves obtained for the two types tested cu varies between 1 5 and 2 7 for mc and between 3 2 and 7 5 for ct 5 2 pore size distributions incremental and cumulative intrusion curves derived by the mip technique related to two representative specimens of both calcarenite types are presented in figs 6 and 7 comparing the intrusion and extrusion curves in fig 7 demonstrates that about 27 0 of the pores for mc samples and 24 0 of the pores for ct samples consist of ink bottle pores the pore parameters obtained by mip are summarised in table 2 the comparison of the experimental data regarding accessible or effective porosity obtained using standard geotechnical laboratory procedures and the mip established that the mip analysis involved 85 6 and 57 8 of the interconnected pores effectively present in the mc and ct samples figs 8 and 9 depict the histograms of the frequency distribution of pore sizes by means of mip and ia for both calcarenite types in table 3 it is possible to compare the frequency of the different pore size classes obtained by mip and ia for the two calcarenite types according to the classification scheme developed by brewer 1964 according to the monte carlo method the psds were derived fig 10 shows the cumulative curves and histograms of the frequency distribution of pore sizes by the combined analysis andriani and walsh 2002 5 3 hydraulic behavior of the unsaturated calcarenites having determined the pore size distributions of both calcarenites their hydraulic properties were predicted according to the pore bundle model the pore diameter range was divided into several bins whose size follows a logarithmic growth equivalent cylindrical pores were generated according to the monte carlo sampling procedure presented in the previous section fig 11 shows the soil water retention curves for both calcarenite types they depict the bi modal features of the psds an initial condition of full saturation where all pores are filled by water was considered when the matric head becomes lower than the air entry value the drainage process starts and the water stored in macropores drains first consequently the effective saturation decreases when the macropores become empty d i 5 10 Œºm œà 10 Œºm a change of slope is evident for both calcarenite types and the drainage process is governed by the micropores thus according to the physical mechanism of capillarity the effective saturation decreases more slowly with regard to the falling head infiltration tests at the bench scale an early rapid drop was highlighted in the hydraulic head versus time curve which showed an exponential behavior due to rapid infiltration in the dry calcarenites by way of example fig 12 shows the changes in hydraulic head with time in test 1 fine grained calcarenite mc and test 4 medium grained calcarenite ct after a hydraulic head drop of 0 059 m at 840 s and of 0 078 m at 540 s respectively for mc and ct the data fall close to a straight line which identifies a steady state water infiltration rate the slope of the best fit line represents the average value of the infiltration rate in m s 1 which amounts to 4 10 5 m s 1 and 6 10 5 m s 1 for mc and ct respectively fig 13 shows the total water volume in the moisture plume vin pore volume of the moisture plume vv v g Œ∏ s and the average effective saturation s e versus time for both calcarenite types in the early stage of the tests water infiltrates rapidly in the dry calcarenites due to the hydraulic head and the rate exceeds the maximum infiltration rate thus vin is near to vv and the moisture plume propagates in a quasi saturated condition because air in the pores is almost completely replaced by water fig 13 later the application rate becomes lower than the maximum infiltration rate and an unsaturated condition develops effective saturation decreases more quickly in the medium grained calcarenite where a higher infiltration rate was reached the advection diffusion form of richard s equation is valid under the unsaturated condition thus only the data measured at values of s e below 90 were considered once the geometry of the moisture plume was defined as stated in the previous section the centroid of the wetting front was determined and plotted versus time fig 14 according to the infiltration rate the z coordinate of the centroid of the wetting front zg propagated more rapidly in ct reaching greater distances than in mc in order to analyze water diffusion processes spatial variance œÉx 2 along the x direction was determined fig 15 shows the relationship between œÉx 2 and average volumetric water content Œ∏ s e Œ∏ s of the moisture plume for the same value of average volumetric water content ct shows higher value of spatial variance than mc this means that according to pore size distribution the moisture plume in ct propagated with a volumetric water content distribution more dispersed than in mc 5 4 prediction of the unsaturated flow in the calcarenite the observed behavior of the moisture plume was compared with the predictive model derived from the pore size distribution determined by experimentation and the pore bundle concept in particular the observed evolution of the centroid of the wetting front zg was fitted with its predicted value z g calculated as the time integral of the celerity function cw eq 20 32 z g c w d t k s Œ∏ s d k r dse d t the values of the derivative of the relative hydraulic conductivity with respect to the effective saturation were determined in correspondence of the values of the average effective saturation s e fig 16 shows the comparison between observed and predicted values for both calcarenite types the data from the predictive model shows a satisfactory fit to the experimental data for a value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 40 10 5 and 5 50 10 5 m s 1 with a value of dt 1 20 fig 17 shows the predicted hydraulic conductivity function estimated though the fitting procedure an inflection is evident in the k se curves when the effective saturation becomes lower than 0 27 and 0 43 for ct and mc respectively macropores characterized by a diameter di higher than 5 10 Œºm are empty and do not contribute to the water flow as a consequence the relative hydraulic conductivity decreases rapidly 6 discussion the main objective of this study is to predict the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of calcarenites by means of laboratory tests and theoretical conceptual analysis based on well known models and detailed characterization of texture in particular porosity and its type pore size distribution and network as regards the calcarenites belonging to calcarenite di gravina formation all facies with few exceptions are characterised by interconnected pores in the network structures at the rock mass scale two components of porosity can be considered textural and structural the textural porosity depends on particle arrangement and interlocking and the nature of individual grains bioclast species type lithoclasts etc the structural porosity on the other hand is linked to the presence of macroscopic non random discontinuities e g fractures faults and karst features andriani and parise 2015 andriani and parise 2017 at the mesoscopic scale porosity of the calcarenites is essentially textural in type and structural porosity is confined to the presence of sedimentary structures bioturbations and microcracks in this study we have utilized two calcarenite types with different texture a packstone mc and a grainstone ct both with nearly random packing but different grain sorting both types are composed of grains with different shapes and roundness due to their different nature with the result of a lower packing density with respect to a theoretical arrangement of spherical grains with the same size distribution besides both types are not organized according to a close arrangement because compaction was inhibited by an early stage carbonate cementation which is the dominant type of cement it follows that the porosity calculated by traditional geotechnical procedures is high and open all pores are interconnected and accessible as demonstrated by the imbibition test results because also intragranular pre depositional moldic and inter crystalline porosity post depositional are connected with the intergranular pores depositional through microcracks post depositional thus intergranular intragranular and moldic porosity in combination with inter crystalline and microfracture porosity reflect high effective porosity and water transmissivity of these materials according to the pore size classification by brewer 1964 if intergranular pores can be considered almost all macropores of uniform size but different shape the other types of pores are characterized by heterogeneous pore size distributions and different shapes in particular moldic pores are mainly subspherical and range from 30 to 350 ¬µm intragranular pores are different in size and shape according to the species types of the bioclastic fraction while inter crystalline pores and micro cracks are mainly represented by tortuous micro throats inter crystalline pores develop inside cements and re crystallized micrite matrix while microcracks affect also bioclasts especially foraminifers in general we can state that suction is higher and permeability lower for the mc because the distribution in pore size is skewed toward the fine tail of the cumulative pore size curve in our opinion pore network of these calcarenites can be schematically considered as a system of pseudo spherical and tetracubic voids directly connected by cylindrical tubes or neck shaped channels the first type of pores are macropores cylindrical tubes are macro or mesopores while neck shaped channels are more tortuous and mainly microporous and in part mesoporous in nature pore size distribution is thus heterogeneous comprised of homogeneous pores of pseudo spherical and tetracubic voids and heterogeneous pores of cylindrical and neck shaped voids it is principally a porosity texture in which macropores and mesopores which constitute the prevailing pore fractions are connected by micro throats thus on the basis of what was observed during the different experimental phases and considering the pore network described above when calcarenite surfaces are exposed to submersion or heavy rainfall the infiltrated water flows first in the available macropores between the grains but some macropores remain dry because they are separated by micro throats this happens because infiltration rates through meso and micropores are lower than the inlet flow rates of water consequently water moves more quickly through interconnected larger pores bypassing the smaller pores which due to the gradient of matric potential absorb water until they are filled thus the matric potential falls abruptly and water initiates infiltration through the remaining meso and macropores therefore the remaining larger pores continue to be inactive until the smaller ones are filled the complexity of such a pore network for the calcarenites studied is characterized by a bi modal pore size distribution which depicts the coexistence of two pore regions macropores and micropores assuming local equilibrium conditions and darcy richards concepts water initially infiltrates into the smallest non wetted part of the pore space micropore the soil water retention curves and the hydraulic conductivity functions determined according to the pore size distribution and pore bundle concepts reflect the textural features of the investigated calcarenite types at the same value of effective saturation the matric head results lower for mc than ct and the former retains more water than the latter as the effective saturation decreases a change of slope is evident in swrc and k se function for both calcarenites li et al 2014 found the same behavior in gap graded soil characterized by bi modal pore size distribution as saturation decreases reaching the value of matric head œà 10 m a change of slope is evident for both calcarenite types macropores are empty and the drainage process is governed by the micropores that loose water in a slower way specifically given that ct presents more macropores than mc with a more pronounced bimodal distribution the change of slope in the swrc occurs at the effective saturation of 0 27 for ct and 0 46 for mc and is more pronounced for the former our laboratory experiments based on soil suction measurements at different volumetric content turturro et al 2013 which employed the quasi steady centrifuge method turturro et al 2020 on the ct and mc calcarenite samples found behavior similar with experimental swrc and hydraulic conductivity functions the time evolution of the centroid of the wetting front was derived adopting the pore bundle model that fits the experimental data obtained from the bench scale infiltration test both calcarenites show the same behavior with a tortuosity fractal dimension dt equal to 1 20 for the saturation range investigated 0 9 se 0 5 the hydraulic conductivity varies passing from 9 48 10 6 m s 1 to 1 15 10 6 m s 1 for ct and from 3 59 10 6 to 1 89 10 7 m s 1 for mc the experimental hydraulic conductivity functions which we have found are in agreement with the results presented in caputo and nimmo 2005 where the hydraulic conductivity functions determined for calcarenite types comparable to that used in our study show the same behavior for the volumetric water content range investigated the falling head infiltration test we conducted shows an early drop of hydraulic head versus time corresponding to a rapid infiltration rate in the dry calcarenite successively infiltration rate become constant reaching values of 4 10 5 m s 1 and 6 10 5 m s 1 for mc and ct respectively the same behavior was observed in single ring infiltrometer field tests conducted by caputo et al 2012 and andriani et al 2013 these studies found an infiltration rate for the medium grained ct grainstone of around 3 10 5 m s 1 at the wet stage se 0 5 which was investigated with the bench scale infiltration test the smallest pores are filled water develops by means of a continuous flow through interconnected macropores or meso and macropores following flow paths characterized by the minimum flow resistance thus the wetting front propagates quickly bypassing large parts of the micropore spaces in the latter a diffuse flow is active although with slow dynamics and is regulated by capillary forces in their study regarding the western australian dune calcarenites treble et al 2013 found that diffuse flow is dominant and follows vertical flow paths water transmission through tortuous micro throats is slower and has a relatively little influence on the water flow through macropores and interconnected macro and mesopores when micro throats are filled water moves through the remaining larger structural pores inside the material consequently gravity driven flow is higher than diffusive mixing mechanisms according to the experimental evidence from this study this simple schematization of the water infiltration process in unsaturated calcarenites is plausible if the inlet flow rates of water are high i e for submersion or high intensity rainfall where high or intermediate saturation conditions occur the falling head infiltration test at the bench scale presented here basically simulates cases that can be compared with high intensity rainfall events after a period of drought the samples were dried before testing during low intensity or distributed rains the inlet flow rates of water are low and diffuse flow through micropores will be favored due to the high value of the matric potential besides at low saturation condition the surface of macropore is covered by absorbed film then water movement could be dominated by film flow mechanisms 7 conclusions the results of this study allowed us to define the hydraulic behavior of calcarenites with different texture in unsaturated conditions by using the advective diffusive forms of richards equation and the pore bundle model the integrated methodological approach proposed here demonstrates that the hydraulic behavior of these materials is strongly influenced by topology of pore network and pore size distribution but at the same time depends on the degree of saturation of the materials at the beginning of the infiltration process as well as on the inlet flow rate of water according to the experimental evidence although the porosity of materials resulted open the pore size distribution governs the infiltration processes the wetting front propagates mainly through the macropores with a gravity driven flow velocity higher than the diffusive flow through the micropores the results obtained in our study raise new questions is the diffusive flow velocity higher than the gravity driven flow velocity under low infiltration rate during a low wet phase what is the relationship between the two flow velocities in different saturation conditions by varying the infiltration rate for these reasons the infiltration processes in calcarenites have to be investigated at different spatial and temporal scale for these reasons the infiltration processes in calcarenites have to be investigated at different spatial and temporal scales future scenarios concern the possibility of considering more complex conceptual models such as multi porosity and multi permeability models under non equilibrium conditions in order to depict the complex porous structure of calcarenites further numerical models could be implemented and the validity and reliability of the proposed conceptual models by comparing the observed and the simulated data at the same time new experimental laboratory and or field tests could be set up in order to investigate the limits of validity of the capillary dominated flow in calcarenites varying the initial degree of saturation and the infiltration rate credit authorship contribution statement gioacchino francesco andriani conceptualization methodology validation formal

surface models world wide water w3 and catchment land surface model with grace data assimilation clsm da the evaluation shows that the accuracy of lstm is significantly higher than the machine learning models by increasing pearson coefficient pr values during the prediction period by 23 89 compared to ann and 41 32 compared to rf respectively the inclusion of grace data has a significant impact on the performance of predicted gwls by improving pr from 0 430 to 0 643 on average the clsm da gwls products have higher accuracy than the w3 model which underlines the benefit of including grace data in land surface models the lstm model achieves higher accuracy in plain areas while the performance in ocean and mountain areas is poorer due to abrupt changes in climate variables this study supplies a feasible and accurate approach for predicting gwls dynamics and provides a reference for model selection keywords grace lstm groundwater levels forecasting w3 model victoria 1 introduction accurate knowledge of groundwater resources is crucial for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors especially in arid and semi arid regions alley et al 2002 taylor et al 2012 dangar

groundwater models are effective tools for monitoring spatiotemporal distributions of groundwater resources unfortunately the implementation of groundwater models requires significant effort to construct and calibrate model parameters which is often difficult in remote areas due to ground data availability hu et al 2016 several global water models have been developed in recent years to improve water storage estimates at very high spatial and temporal scales e g tangdamrongsub et al 2021 although a poor performance arises for the groundwater component rateb et al 2020 the limitations of hydrology models are the significant uncertainties caused by inaccurate model parameters and meteorological forcing data tangdamrongsub et al 2017 data assimilation is an effective approach to optimally combine information from both model predictions and observations based on assimilation approaches e g ensemble kalman filter ensemble square root filter and particle filter recent studies e g tangdamrongsub et al 2017 yin et al 2020b demonstrated the potential of grace data assimilation to improve the estimates of the groundwater and soil moisture components in land surface models despite the superior performance of data assimilation it is worth noting that its implementation is complicated and the calculation demands extensive computational resources sahour et al 2020 machine learning algorithms provide an effective measure to predict gwls because it does not require the understanding of underlying processes of the physical system like in physically based models chen et al 2020 specifically random forest rf model is characterized as an ensemble based method that performs better than other machine learning methods in grace data applications chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns have the advantages in modeling virtually any nonlinear function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy french et al 1992 daliakopoulos et al 2005 this makes anns attractive tools to forecast groundwater level variations in the past decade for example sun et al 2016 applied ann to predict the groundwater table in a freshwater swamp forest of singapore the results indicated that ann could provide an accurate prediction with a leading time of 1 day whereas the performance decreases with an increased forecast period amaranto et al 2018 also confirmed the effectiveness of data driven models for gws forecast and anns showed the best performance however it is found that traditional ann models are inferior in capturing sufficient sequential temporal information of the time series which is crucial for accurate time series predictions fan et al 2020 deep learning approaches especially the state of the art long short term memory lstm network utilize the sequential information of data record instead of a single data record as in ann resulting in more accurate time series prediction song et al 2020 theoretically lstm represents a more effective solution with respect to these two methods above thus has a promising application prospect for water level prediction wunsch et al 2018 m√ºller et al 2020 when using data driven models it is critical to choose representative input variables to increase the accuracy of the calculated results adamowski and chan 2011 sun et al 2016 according to the statistics of rajaee et al 2019 the input variables widely utilized as the input layer in the case of gwls forecasting are precipitation temperature and past gwls time series however gwls might also be influenced by other factors e g vertical interaction between aquifers and abstraction rate but those are either not monitored regularly or difficult to measure at all wunsch et al 2018 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites launched in march 2002 provided an unprecedent opportunity to capture the changes in total water storage tws at all depths many studies e g feng et al 2013 pan et al 2016 zhong et al 2020 have successfully analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater storage based on grace observations and auxiliary information at the grace footprint 200 000 km2 therefore a possible solution to improve model prediction accuracy would be the integration of grace observations in data driven models sun 2013 mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 some studies compared the performance of gwl prediction between physically based models and data driven models for example moghaddam et al 2019 employed the numerical model modflow the bayesian network bn and the ann models to forecast monthly gwls in birjand aquifer in iran the results of different models revealed that ann models required less input data and computational time than physically based models and bn chen et al 2020 simulated the groundwater dynamics of the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china and found the same conclusion that machine learning models outperformed numerical models despite these above successes there are still some potential shortcomings that should be addressed firstly previous studies predicted gwls using feedforward networks i e a type of ann that allows signals to travel one way only associated only with climate variables e g precipitation temperature whereas the performance of integrating lstm and grace observations has not been fully investigated secondly the comparison between data driven and physically based models is primarily conducted in smaller areas 10 000 km2 under the background of globalization the study of large scale regions can provide a big picture of regional climate variations finally only a few studies have compared the performance of a state of the art hydrological model and a land surface model with data assimilation in gwl prediction against different data driven models the goal of this study is to compare the ability of gwl prediction from traditional machine learning deep learning and physical models specifically the inter comparison among different data driven models aims to confirm whether deep learning provides better predictive ability and quantify the importance of grace observations as the predictor the comparison among data driven and physically based models is intended to highlight the benefit of data assimilation on the gwl forecasting in terms of hydrological models this study selects the state of victoria in

2007 era interim liu et al 2018 and the global land data assimilation system gldas noahv2 1 rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 whereas the temperature data are obtained from the era interim

storage at 1 1 3 2 3 gldas products monthly precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the gldas rodell et al 2004 the outputs of the noahv2 1 model are employed in this study covering the period from 2000 to present previous studies wang et al 2014 han et al 2020 have comprehensively evaluated the performance of gldas precipitation and temperature against ground based measurements the evaluation demonstrates that these estimates are generally accurate but caution should be taken when the data are applied in mountainous areas or places with sparse weather stations 3 3 ground measurements monthly gwls are collected from the australian groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer covering the period of march 2003 to june 2017 the groundwater level products are divided into three categories namely depth to water dtw depth below a reference point on the bore standing water level swl distance from the top of the groundwater surface to the groundwater and reduced standing water level rswl groundwater elevation above australian height datum the detailed description can be seen in http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer faq shtml the comparison between in situ data and model simulations is performed at 1 1 grid size the in situ gwl change is aggregated from point data to 1 1 grid cells by averaging all observations inside the same 1 1 pixel prior to the comparison in situ observations with abnormal jumps significant data gaps and outliers are removed from our analysis the summary of all datasets used in this study is shown in table 1 4 method 4 1 methodological framework the analysis framework of this study is divided into four parts fig 2 and detailed descriptions are as follows 1 part i prepares the input and target variables for data driven models namely rf ann and lstm all datasets are separated into three sequential parts training validation and prediction in particular 60 of the data april 2002 to april 2011 is used for training 20 for validation may 2011 to june 2014 and the remaining 20 for prediction july 2014 to june 2017 2 part ii evaluates the performance of three data driven models using the same input and target data from part i it is worth noting that grace data are used as an input variable in all data driven models so the accuracy of predicted gwls mainly reflects the performance of data driven models three case studies are used to evaluate the impact of input variables and time lag on the model performance the first case is a generic lstm hereinafter lstm ref using climate variables and grace data as inputs the second case hereinafter lstm 2 omits grace data aiming to quantify the impact of grace data on the performance of gws prediction the third case hereinafter lstm 3 is the same as lstm ref but neglect the time lag of precipitation and temperature aiming to investigate the necessity of including time lags in the trained model 3 in part iii three approaches are utilized to obtain gwl records by combining the hydrological model and grace observations the first approach uses the w3 model to simulate gwl hereinafter w3 sim the second approach computes gwl from grace derived tws anomalies by removing soil moisture components derived from the w3 model from grace data hereinafter grace w3 the last approach uses gws from clsm da products hereinafter clsm da 4 the purpose of part iv is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of data driven models and physically based models on the prediction of gwls the influence of the precedent level on the predicted gwls and the benefit of data assimilation is also assessed 4 2 data driven models regarding different data driven models the optimal parameters are determined based on the grid search approach which builds a model for every combination of hyper parameter specified and returns the optimal parameters with the best performance in this way the model can spread all reasonable possible values of the parameter for each individual parameter and model specifically the priority of hidden neurons was tried from 1 to 1000 until the best match is achieved based on the root mean square error between the observed and modeled gwls then the best model was saved for the following discussions with respect to the time lag of predictor variables the precipitation and air temperature are one month ahead of gwls as the impact of precipitation gradually propagates into surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage ahmed et al 2011 frappart et al 2013 recent studies yin et al 2020a 2020b indicated better consistency between grace based results and monitored gwls in time scale thus the time lag in grace observations is not considered some measures are adopted to alleviate the influence of an over fitting problem which means that a model perfectly fits the training set while performs badly on the new samples specifically these measures include 1 the grid search approach is applied to optimize the parameters of ann rf and lstm 2 the features e g precipitation and temperature which are most important for the gwls prediction are chosen 3 with regard to ann and lstm models the early stopping strategy stops training when generalization error increases is applied while the ensemble strategy aggregates the results from multiple prediction models as the final result is used in rf 4 2 1 random forest rf model random forest is part of the list of the most successful methods currently available to handle both classification and regression problems the rf is a decision tree based ensemble model which is able to improve the prediction accuracy and stability by integrating many decision trees into one model what has greatly contributed to the popularity of the rf model is the fact they can be applied to a wide range of prediction problems with high performance while having few parameters to tune although a small number of trees can reduce the computation time the prediction accuracy will also be reduced on the other hand a large number of trees will result in more accurate predictions meanwhile the computation time will increase substantially and also cause an over fitting problem the other parameters are set equal to the default values as in the implementation by biau and scornet 2015 4 2 2 artificial neural networks anns artificial neural networks inspired by the biological neural networks typically have three types of layers namely input layer hidden layer and output layer adjacent layers are fully connected with nodes neurons with weight vectors the ability to learn and generalize relationships between predictors and predictands makes it possible to solve large scale complex problems which are either linear or nonlinear in nature taking three layers ann as an example given a dataset with m input features x i i 1 m with k neurons in the hidden layer the input value for the kth neuron is the weighted sum of input layer and the bias term bishop 2006 1 a k i 1 m w ki l x i w k 0 l x i k 1 2 k where ak is the input value for the kth neuron in the hidden layer w ki 1 i 1 m and w k 0 1 are the weights and bias term between input layer and hidden layer respectively the superscripts in eq 1 denote the lth layer the output value of the current neuron is transformed using a non linear activation function as follows 2 z k œÜ a k k 1 2 k where z k is the output of the kth neuron and œÜ is the activation function it can be a sigmoid function a rectified linear unit function or other activation functions with the values obtained from equation 2 in the hidden layer the final output in the output layer can be expressed as 3 y i k 1 k w jk 2 z k w j 0 2 where yi is output neuron and w ki 12 i 1 m and w j 0 2 are the weights and the bias term of the output layer respectively similar to w ki 1 i 1 m and w k 0 1 but with different values in this study the priority of hidden neurons was tried between 0 and 1000 with the interval of 50 then the best model was saved for the following discussions 4 2 3 long short term memory lstm model the lstm network is a special kind of recurrent neural network structure that is used to address the gradient vanishing and exploding problem this is because the weights are calculated based on the product which makes their result tend to be either exponentially small or exponentially big often occurs in deep layer models the lstm model can store and relate the previous information by learning long term dependencies in a sequence a standard lstm model consists of four main parts namely an output gate an input gate a forget gate and a memory cell with these four parts interacting together lstm is able to forget or save the information to the cell state by using the sigmoid activation function for the gates the output value of each gate is between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of information saved to the next state where the value 0 means discard all information and 1 means obtain all the information the detailed process of the lstm memory cell is calculated based on equations 4 9 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 bowes et al 2019 4 forget gate f t œÉ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 5 input gate i

where wf wi wo wc and uf are the weight matrices for the forget gate input gate output gate memory cell and the hidden state respectively xt are the input values at time t bf bi bo bc are the bias vectors for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cell respectively activation functions œÉ and tanh are sigmoid function and tanh function respectively 4 3 physically based models the hydrological model employed in this study is the world wide water w3 model it is a grid biophysical model that simulates landscape water stores in the vegetation and soil system van dijk 2010 providing estimates of various water storage components e g soil moisture surface water and groundwater the model outputs show a reasonable agreement with a spatiotemporal pattern of grace derived tws in australia thus is used as an important auxiliary means for the local water resources management tregoning et al 2012 it should be noted that the accuracy of the w3 groundwater component is likely inaccurate due to the simplified generalization of the groundwater i e lack of a groundwater consumption module and the simplified generalization of the groundwater component in the w3 model tangdamrongsub et al 2018 the w3 parameters used in this study are obtained from a default configuration of the awra l version 0 5 van dijk 2010 and the forcing data are resampled to 1 1 to be consistent with the model resolution the gldas catchment land surface model level 4 gldas 2 2 li et al 2020 is also used for comparison the data are produced based on the nasa s catchment land surface model clsm together with the application of grace data assimilation to improve the model state estimates hereinafter clsm da the clsm da product provides daily water storage variables at 0 25 resolution the comparison between w3 or data driven models and clsm da can also be used to determine the benefit of grace data assimilation in the modelled groundwater estimates 4 4 evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of different models two indices are utilized to compare predicted values with in situ measurements which include pearson correlation coefficient pr and root mean square error rmse respectively pr measures how model prediction and in situ data is temporally correlated while rmse in meter quantifies how closely the amplitude of predicted values match the observed values pr and rmse are calculated as follows 10 pr i 1 n y i y y i y i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 rmse i 1 n o i y i 2 n where o and y represent observations and predicted values respectively n is the length of time series y and o are the mean values of y and o respectively the best fit between observed and predicted gwls under ideal conditions would yield rmse 0 m and pr 1 in this study the performance of different models is classified into four categories a pr 0 75 the model performance is very good b pr 0 60 then the performance of the model is good c pr 0 50 the performance is satisfactory d pr 0 50 the performance is unsatisfactory 5 results 5 1 determining optimal input data of data driven models the use of different climate variables in data driven models has significant impact on groundwater storage estimates first of all precipitation and temperature from different sources are assessed to choose the representative estimates within the study area as shown in fig 3 three precipitation data sets are consistent in terms of timing with the pr varying from 0 95 to 0 98 the largest difference is detected in 2011 between era interim and trmm with the value of 7 6 mm shown in fig 3a for the temperature era interim significantly agrees with these from gldas model and the correlation reaches up to 0 99 during the study period conversely the discrepancies are larger when the temperature falls to the annual trough fig 3b in accordance with grace data we calculate the average values of different precipitation and temperature data as the input variables of data driven models 5 2 comparison of tws anomalies from grace and hydrological models a comparison of monthly tws anomalies from mascon solutions and physically based models is shown in fig 4 high consistency between two mascon solutions are seen with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 fig 4a tws anomalies present sharply decreasing trends from 2002 to 2009 with the rates of 12 78 1 81 mm yr and 17 06 1 48 mm yr for csr m and jpl m respectively it is mainly caused by the millennium drought which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies leblanc et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 negative trends are also detected after 2012 likely induced by drainage mechanisms after the region received extreme rainfall during the 2009 2012 la ni√±a period to reduce the uncertainties of grace products the average of these two solutions is used as the representative tws anomalies within this study the performance of physically based tws anomalies from w3 and clsm da models are evaluated against mascon solutions fig 4b overall the dynamic range of grace derived tws anomalies is larger than that of the w3 simulation the small amplitude of the w3 model may be attributed to the shallow groundwater depth and absent anthropogenic activities e g irrigation domestic and livestock water use in the w3 groundwater module large discrepancies observed in 2012 see yellow shades in fig 4b is likely due to inaccurate forcing data particularly precipitation that underestimates extreme rainfall events the assimilated tws anomalies agree well with mascon solutions compared to the w3 model with the correlation coefficient of 0 85 especially for the period marked with yellow shading the fitting effect is clearly improved although some discrepancies remain 5 3 accuracy assessment of gwls prediction from data driven models theoretically some discrepancies may exist in gwls on different geographical and terrain locations within the study area two pixels g13 and g28 as shown in fig 1 are not adjacent to each other and are located in low altitude and high altitude regions respectively therefore these two pixels are chosen as the example to test the performance of different data driven models as shown in fig 5 results of other pixels are also provided in figs s2 s3 of the supplementary material during the training period from apr 2002 to apr 2011 the rf model performs the best with the largest pr 0 986 on average and smallest rmse 0 097 m on average but still lacks in the accuracy of data prediction the fitting performance of lstm model between trained data and observations is worse than that of rf model and similar to ann model however the lstm model outperforms two machine learning models during the prediction period between jul 2014 and jun 2017 for example the metrics pr rmse in g13 is 0 602 0 340 m for lstm model which is superior to rf 0 231 0 51 m and ann 0 441 0 383 m models that is to say that the performance of lstm model belongs to good during the prediction period while unsatisfactory for the other two models similar improvements can also be detected in other study periods and pixels table 2 shows the comprehensive comparisons between rf ann and lstm models for different studying periods and pixels within the study area it is noteworthy that the pixels marked with are close to ocean while the pixels near to mountain areas are marked with the bold numbers in table 2 denote the improvements in pr and rmse are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level during the prediction period in general the lstm model achieves better metrics 0 789 0 535 m of pr rmse than that of ann 0 632 0 582 m of pr rmse and rf models 0 574 0 646 m of pr rmse during the validation period moreover better performance can also be observed using lstm model 0 643 0 788 m of pr rmse followed by ann 0 519 0 973 m of pr rmse and rf 0 455 0 905 m of pr rmse for the prediction period in some pixels e g g15 the correlation of all data driven models is lower which is likely attributed to large uncertainties in the observed levels causing the data driven models fail to capture the seasonal variations in terms of the overall performance of three models lstm model achieves very good and good performance for the validation and prediction periods which are superior to ann good satisfactory and rf satisfactory unsatisfactory models additionally the differences in performance between the lstm model and traditional data driven model are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level in most grids within the study area 5 4 influence of different processing scenarios for lstm model the purpose of this section is to analyze the influence of grace observations and time lags on the performance of data driven models based on the conclusion in section 5 3 lstm model behaves best on the gwls prediction thus is chosen as the representative model for the following discussion comparisons of predicted gwls in other pixels are also provided in figs s4 s5 of the supplementary material as shown in fig 6 large discrepancies exist between lstm ref and lstm 2 where the seasonal amplitudes of gwls in lstm 2 generally vary from 0 to 0 8 much smaller than that of in situ measurements also the lstm 2 model fails to represent the dynamics of gwl variations and capture the downward trend in gwls affected by the drought event 2002 2009 in terms of cross correlation a significant improvement is observed in fig 5 after including grace observations in the input parameters of lstm ref and the pr increases by 151 98 from 0 239 to 0 602 and 70 69 from 0 442 to 0 755 for g13 and g28 during the prediction period with respect to the influence of time lag on the predicators it can be found that the time series of lstm 3 are basically consistent with that of lstm ref during the whole study period with the correlation up to 0 982 on average it can be concluded that the time lag is unnecessary in the lstm model during the validation period may 2011 jun 2014 the largest rmse can be observed in lstm 2 within the study area indicating that the accuracy of the model is seriously degraded without considering grace observations as predictors fig 7 the lstm ref model significantly outperforms the lstm 2 model and delivers higher pr 0 789 on average and smaller rmse 0 365 m on average spatially lstm ref shows higher accuracy in 9 out of total 14 pixels e g g14 and g24 accounting for 64 3 of all pixels the ratio increases to 85 7 in the prediction period fig 8 additionally the statistical values of lstm ref and lstm 3 exhibit similar metrics over most grid cells with the pr rmse values of 0 789 0 365 m and 0 761 0 386 m in the validation period and 0 643 0 509 m and 0 602 0 510 m in the prediction period consequently the evaluation indicates that grace observations play an important role in improving the accuracy of the predicted results while less contribution is detected in the time lags of the climatic variables it should also be noted that grace tws is helpful for simulating long term trends however the inclusion of grace observations does not appear to improve prediction of short term seasonal and inter annual gwls variations e g the predicted variations are less than observed values 5 5 prediction based on different algorithms and physical models the development of global hydrological models provides a supplement measure to estimate groundwater storage changes at pixel scale which can compensate the limitations of groundwater models at large scale and remote areas however the accurate knowledge of the groundwater component is generally limited due to the unavailability of the groundwater use information especially in areas with intensive anthropogenic activities with respect to grace satellites they can monitor changes in water storage at all depths below the ground such as snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater alternatively the groundwater changes can be obtained from grace derived tws anomalies as explained in sect 4 1 part iii in this section the soil moisture components provided by the w3 model are used and the derived gwls are called grace w3 in the following discussions in order to improve the accuracy of prediction previous studies coulibaly et al 2001 juan et al 2015 employed antecedent gwl records as predictors for time series forecasting we adopt the same concept in our analysis and the prediction associated with the use of antecedent gwl records is called lstm ante specifically lstm ante is the same as lsmt ref but includes the past gwl information in the input variables see fig 2 it is estimated that spatially averaged specific yields in victoria range from 0 06 to 0 14 thus a mean value of 0 1 is used to transform simulated gws to gwl anomalies tangdamrongsub et al 2018 fig 9 shows that w3 significantly underestimates gwl amplitude while grace w3 solutions improve the long term patterns of gwl estimates grace w3 solutions increase the correlation coefficient from 0 17 to 0 88 g13 and from 0 50 to 0 82 g28 compared to the lstm ref the lstm ante gwls show higher agreement with in situ level reflecting the benefit of including antecedent gwls in the data driven model during the training and validation periods the pr between lstm ante and in situ measurements reach 0 994 0 967 in g14 and 0 987 0 968 in g28 respectively as to the prediction period the pr decreases to 0 77 and 0 82 for g14 and g28 this is anticipated as the past gwl is usually an effective predictor of the future gwl sun 2013 however the inclusion of previous gwl records also causes the accumulated errors in the predictor for the long time period prediction this behavior is also observed in our study particularly during the prediction period overall the w3 model provides the smallest pr and the largest rmse which is likely caused by the inaccurate representation of groundwater processes tangdamrongsub et al 2018 comparatively better performance is observed from grace w3 with the pr increased from 0 56 0 41 to 0 65 0 50 for validation fig 10 and prediction periods fig 11 respectively in other words the data driven performance is improved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory during the prediction period when grace data is used the improvement is also seen in rmse decreased by 35 64 validation period in fig 10 and 24 34 prediction period in fig 11 this analysis suggests the need of w3 improvement in groundwater storage estimate which is also confirmed in rateb et al 2020 overall lstm model performs reasonably well at pixel and basin scales compared to that simulated by physically based models we also found that lstm ante performs better than lstm ref in inland and plain pixels e g g15 however lstm ante provides inaccurate estimates when the pixels are near to ocean or mountains areas this might be attributed to a high frequency climate variation in these areas which reduces the close correlation between the present and precedent gwls additionally there may be large uncertainties in grace observations near the coast and mountainous areas landerer and swenson 2012 mu et al 2020 6 discussions 6 1 benefit of data assimilation on gwls forecasting recent studies tangdamrongsub et al 2020 tian et al 2019 have demonstrated that data assimilation could improve the accuracy of groundwater storage estimates however few studies are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of data driven models hydrological models and data assimilation algorithm in this study the outputs from clsm da are used to highlight the benefit of data assimilation on the groundwater estimates fig 12 shows a statistical measure of the goodness of fit over 14 pixels within victoria in general the lstm model significantly outperforms the grace w3 and clsm da with the higher median metric values during the validation and prediction periods for example the lstm model provides the median pr rmse of 0 863 0 271 m during the prediction period superior to grace w3 0 163 0 654 m and clsm da 0 489 0 642 m compared to grace w3 estimates a higher correlation is found between clsm da and in situ levels with the median value of 0 710 and 0 489 for validation and prediction periods respectively similar performance can also be seen in terms of rmse fig 12 c and d based on above discussions it can be confirmed that data assimilation has the benefit of improving gwls forecasting relative to the best combination of grace and the w3 model 6 2 advantages and disadvantages of different predicted models groundwater models have always been the main measure of simulating and predicting gwls changes for a long period however the biggest limitation faced by this approach lies in that it is difficult to collect sufficient ground truth data for model construction and optimization this will inevitably reduce the accuracy of prediction especially in data sparse areas with the development of machine learning algorithms data driven models have been proposed to work as the surrogate model of traditional groundwater models and achieved reasonable success gu et al 2020 wei et al 2020 therefore it may create the illusion that physical models might be replaced by machine learning in the future to the best of our knowledge there are also some limitations in the data driven models in practice for instance the data driven models require precedent observed information to train the predicted model which limits its application in data sparse regions importantly the data driven model is normally treated as a black box model without a priori assumptions about the underlying physical process as such the data driven models are unlikely applicable for predicting gwls under complex environments such as areas with intensive irrigation activities several hydrological models have been proposed in recent years which can provide global water storage estimates the common issue is the large uncertainties in groundwater estimations due to the simplified process of groundwater simulation and lack of human intervention modules e g groundwater withdrawal groundwater flow streamflow and stream aquifer interactions therefore the groundwater storage component is usually isolated from grace derived tws anomalies based on the auxiliary information e g soil moisture from hydrological models in order to enhance the accuracy of gwl estimates on the one hand some efforts have been made to improve the structure of these models such as considering different types of water demand in the pcr globwbw model on the other hand assimilation of grace observations into hydrological models can combine the strengths of these two measures while mitigating their respective weaknesses achieving the purpose of improving the accuracy of the groundwater components 7 conclusions this study investigated the accuracy of data driven and physically based models in the gwls prediction using victoria australia as a case study the physically based models used in the analysis are w3 and clsm models the data driven models were developed based on ann rf and lstm models respectively the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the predicted gwls from the lstm model significantly perform better than those of rf and ann models during validation and prediction periods the possible reasons may be that lstm model can store and relate the previous information by learning long term dependencies in a sequence while mitigating the drawback of gradient vanishing in traditional recurrent neural networks the rf model provides the highest accuracy during the training period with the largest pr and smallest rmse while performs worse in other periods it indicates that the rf model may be over fitting in this period 2 clear improvements are observed when considering grace observations in the predictors with the metrics pr rmse improved from 0 239 0 755 m to 0 602 0 442 m during the prediction period however there are little differences on the performance of the lstm model with and without considering the time lags additionally better correlation is detected between the lstm model and in situ measurements in plain and inland areas while it is worse in pixels near to ocean and mountainous areas 3 physically based levels reveal the general fitting effect relative to the in situ measurements especially during the long term drought period the assimilated results can significantly improve the amplitude of groundwater storage against simulated values and improve the metrics from 0 41 0 79 m to 0 50 0 60 m for pr rmse in victoria it indicates that data assimilation has the great potential to improve the performance of groundwater storage while is inferior to the deep learning model this study clarifies the strength and weakness of different predicted models and assess as the application performance in victoria it also provides some suggestions for scholars to choose appropriate models and input variables in gwls forecasting although better performance is achieved in the lstm model it requires some previous information to train the model in places where there are limited measurements the physical models may still be the only method available credit authorship contribution statement wenjie yin methodology investigation writing original draft zongwen

4201,accurate prediction of groundwater levels gwls is of significant importance in the sustainable use and efficient management of groundwater resources a comparative study is conducted to evaluate the performance of machine learning and physical models in forecasting groundwater dynamics using the state of victoria australia as a case study gwls are predicted using two traditional machine learning models random forest rf and artificial neural network ann and a deep learning model long short term memory lstm the impact of utilizing grace derived terrestrial water storage tws anomalies as input parameters in all three models is also evaluated the gwl estimates are compared with in situ gwl measurements from ground networks and groundwater storage simulated from two different land surface models world wide water w3 and catchment land surface model with grace data assimilation clsm da the evaluation shows that the accuracy of lstm is significantly higher than the machine learning models by increasing pearson coefficient pr values during the prediction period by 23 89 compared to ann and 41 32 compared to rf respectively the inclusion of grace data has a significant impact on the performance of predicted gwls by improving pr from 0 430 to 0 643 on average the clsm da gwls products have higher accuracy than the w3 model which underlines the benefit of including grace data in land surface models the lstm model achieves higher accuracy in plain areas while the performance in ocean and mountain areas is poorer due to abrupt changes in climate variables this study supplies a feasible and accurate approach for predicting gwls dynamics and provides a reference for model selection keywords grace lstm groundwater levels forecasting w3 model victoria 1 introduction accurate knowledge of groundwater resources is crucial for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors especially in arid and semi arid regions alley et al 2002 taylor et al 2012 dangar

sustainable utilization and the management of groundwater resources groundwater models e g gms gogu et al 2001 feflow hu and jiao 2015 modflow ohmer et al 2019 land surface model e g cable

groundwater models are effective tools for monitoring spatiotemporal distributions of groundwater resources unfortunately the implementation of groundwater models requires significant effort to construct and calibrate model parameters which is often difficult in remote areas due to ground data availability hu et al 2016 several global water models have been developed in recent years to improve water storage estimates at very high spatial and temporal scales e g tangdamrongsub et al 2021 although a poor performance arises for the groundwater component rateb et al 2020 the limitations of hydrology models are the significant uncertainties caused by inaccurate model parameters and meteorological forcing data tangdamrongsub et al 2017 data assimilation is an effective approach to optimally combine information from both model predictions and observations based on assimilation approaches e g ensemble kalman filter ensemble square root filter and particle filter recent studies e g tangdamrongsub et al 2017 yin et al 2020b demonstrated the potential of grace data assimilation to improve the estimates of the groundwater and soil moisture components in land surface models despite the superior performance of data assimilation it is worth noting that its implementation is complicated and the calculation demands extensive computational resources sahour et al 2020 machine learning algorithms provide an effective measure to predict gwls because it does not require the understanding of underlying processes of the physical system like in physically based models chen et al 2020 specifically random forest rf model is characterized as an ensemble based method that performs better than other machine learning methods in grace data applications chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns have the advantages in modeling virtually any nonlinear function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy french et al 1992 daliakopoulos et al 2005 this makes anns attractive tools to forecast groundwater level variations in the past decade for example sun et al 2016 applied ann to predict the groundwater table in a freshwater swamp forest of singapore the results indicated that ann could provide an accurate prediction with a leading time of 1 day whereas the performance decreases with an increased forecast period amaranto et al 2018 also confirmed the effectiveness of data driven models for gws forecast and anns showed the best performance however it is found that traditional ann models are inferior in capturing sufficient sequential temporal information of the time series which is crucial for accurate time series predictions fan et al 2020 deep learning approaches especially the state of the art long short term memory lstm network utilize the sequential information of data record instead of a single data record as in ann resulting in more accurate time series prediction song et al 2020 theoretically lstm represents a more effective solution with respect to these two methods above thus has a promising application prospect for water level prediction wunsch et al 2018 m√ºller et al 2020 when using data driven models it is critical to choose representative input variables to increase the accuracy of the calculated results adamowski and chan 2011 sun et al 2016 according to the statistics of rajaee et al 2019 the input variables widely utilized as the input layer in the case of gwls forecasting are precipitation temperature and past gwls time series however gwls might also be influenced by other factors e g vertical interaction between aquifers and abstraction rate but those are either not monitored regularly or difficult to measure at all wunsch et al 2018 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites launched in march 2002 provided an unprecedent opportunity to capture the changes in total water storage tws at all depths many studies e g feng et al 2013 pan et al 2016 zhong et al 2020 have successfully analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater storage based on grace observations and auxiliary information at the grace footprint 200 000 km2 therefore a possible solution to improve model prediction accuracy would be the integration of grace observations in data driven models sun 2013 mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 some studies compared the performance of gwl prediction between physically based models and data driven models for example moghaddam et al 2019 employed the numerical model modflow the bayesian network bn and the ann models to forecast monthly gwls in birjand aquifer in iran the results of different models revealed that ann models required less input data and computational time than physically based models and bn chen et al 2020 simulated the groundwater dynamics of the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china and found the same conclusion that machine learning models outperformed numerical models despite these above successes there are still some potential shortcomings that should be addressed firstly previous studies predicted gwls using feedforward networks i e a type of ann that allows signals to travel one way only associated only with climate variables e g precipitation temperature whereas the performance of integrating lstm and grace observations has not been fully investigated secondly the comparison between data driven and physically based models is primarily conducted in smaller areas 10 000 km2 under the background of globalization the study of large scale regions can provide a big picture of regional climate variations finally only a few studies have compared the performance of a state of the art hydrological model and a land surface model with data assimilation in gwl prediction against different data driven models the goal of this study is to compare the ability of gwl prediction from traditional machine learning deep learning and physical models specifically the inter comparison among different data driven models aims to confirm whether deep learning provides better predictive ability and quantify the importance of grace observations as the predictor the comparison among data driven and physically based models is intended to highlight the benefit of data assimilation on the gwl forecasting in terms of hydrological models this study selects the state of victoria in australia as the study area where the in situ groundwater network is available for validation this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the detailed information of the study area section 3 and 4 present a brief description of datasets as well as different kinds of physical and data driven models used in this study section 5 presents the comparative results from different data driven models and physical models and the influence of input variables on the predicted results section 6 reports the advantages and disadvantages of different models thus provides some suggestions to choose appropriate models for groundwater level forecasting 2 study area the state of victoria encompasses 140 150 e longitude and 34 39 s latitude an area of 237 629 km2 fig 1 a the weather of victoria is primarily influenced by weather patterns originating in the southern indian ocean and the ocean atmosphere system in the tropical pacific victoria has a varied climate ranging from semi arid and hot in the north west to warm and cool temperature along the coast rahmat et al 2015 a long drought period i e millennium drought ummenhofer et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 occurred in victoria during the

the mascon products are tws anomalies relative to jan 2004 to dec 2009 mean baseline the gain factors provided by jpl are applied to the jpl rl06m data to account for leakage errors which are officially provided along with tws anomalies 3 2 precipitation and temperature precipitation data are obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b43 huffman et al 2001 huffman et al 2007 era interim liu et al 2018 and the global land data assimilation system gldas noahv2 1 rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 whereas the temperature data are obtained from the era interim

liu et al 2018 the reanalysis data combine a forecast model with three fully coupled components atmosphere land surface ocean waves and assimilate various types of observations huang et al 2013 daily meteorological data including global minimum and maximum temperature down welling short wave radiation and total precipitation are used as forcing data in the w3 simulations to estimate groundwater storage at 1 1 3 2 3 gldas products monthly precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the gldas rodell et al 2004 the outputs of the noahv2 1 model are employed in this study covering the period from 2000 to present previous studies wang et al 2014 han et al 2020 have comprehensively evaluated the performance of gldas precipitation and temperature against ground based measurements the evaluation demonstrates that these estimates are generally accurate but caution should be taken when the data are applied in mountainous areas or places with sparse weather stations 3 3 ground measurements monthly gwls are collected from the australian groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer covering the period of march 2003 to june 2017 the groundwater level products are divided into three categories namely depth to water dtw depth below a reference point on the bore standing water level swl distance from the top of the groundwater surface to the groundwater and reduced standing water level rswl groundwater elevation above australian height datum the detailed description can be seen in http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer faq shtml the comparison between in situ data and model simulations is performed at 1 1 grid size the in situ gwl change is aggregated from point data to 1 1 grid cells by averaging all observations inside the same 1 1 pixel prior to the comparison in situ observations with abnormal jumps significant data gaps and outliers are removed from our analysis the summary of all datasets used in this study is shown in table 1 4 method 4 1 methodological framework the analysis framework of this study is divided into four parts fig 2 and detailed descriptions are as follows 1 part i prepares the input and target variables for data driven models namely rf ann and lstm all datasets are separated into three sequential parts training validation and prediction in particular 60 of the data april 2002 to april 2011 is used for training 20 for validation may 2011 to june 2014 and the remaining 20 for prediction july 2014 to june 2017 2 part ii evaluates the performance of three data driven models using the same input and target data from part i it is worth noting that grace data are used as an input variable in all data driven models so the accuracy of predicted gwls mainly reflects the performance of data driven models three case studies are used to evaluate the impact of input variables and time lag on the model performance the first case is a generic lstm hereinafter lstm ref using climate variables and grace data as inputs the second case hereinafter lstm 2 omits grace data aiming to quantify the impact of grace data on the performance of gws prediction the third case hereinafter lstm 3 is the same as lstm ref but neglect the time lag of precipitation and temperature aiming to investigate the necessity of including time lags in the trained model 3 in part iii three approaches are utilized to obtain gwl records by combining the hydrological model and grace observations the first approach uses the w3 model to simulate gwl hereinafter w3 sim the second approach computes gwl from grace derived tws anomalies by removing soil moisture components derived from the w3 model from grace data hereinafter grace w3 the last approach uses gws from clsm da products hereinafter clsm da 4 the purpose of part iv is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of data driven models and physically based models on the prediction of gwls the influence of the precedent level on the predicted gwls and the benefit of data assimilation is also assessed 4 2 data driven models regarding different data driven models the optimal parameters are determined based on the grid search approach which builds a model for every combination of hyper parameter specified and returns the optimal parameters with the best performance in this way the model can spread all reasonable possible values of the parameter for each individual parameter and model specifically the priority of hidden neurons was tried from 1 to 1000 until the best match is achieved based on the root mean square error between the observed and modeled gwls then the best model was saved for the following discussions with respect to the time lag of predictor variables the precipitation and air temperature are one month ahead of gwls as the impact of precipitation gradually propagates into surface water soil moisture and groundwater storage ahmed et al 2011 frappart et al 2013 recent studies yin et al 2020a 2020b indicated better consistency between grace based results and monitored gwls in time scale thus the time lag in grace observations is not considered some measures are adopted to alleviate the influence of an over fitting problem which means that a model perfectly fits the training set while performs badly on the new samples specifically these measures include 1 the grid search approach is applied to optimize the parameters of ann rf and lstm 2 the features e g precipitation and temperature which are most important for the gwls prediction are chosen 3 with regard to ann and lstm models the early stopping strategy stops training when generalization error increases is applied while the ensemble strategy aggregates the results from multiple prediction models as the final result is used in rf 4 2 1 random forest rf model random forest is part of the list of the most successful methods currently available to handle both classification and regression problems the rf is a decision tree based ensemble model which is able to improve the prediction accuracy and stability by integrating many decision trees into one model what has greatly contributed to the popularity of the rf model is the fact they can be applied to a wide range of prediction problems with high performance while having few parameters to tune although a small number of trees can reduce the computation time the prediction accuracy will also be reduced on the other hand a large number of trees will result in more accurate predictions meanwhile the computation time will increase substantially and also cause an over fitting problem the other parameters are set equal to the default values as in the implementation by biau and scornet 2015 4 2 2 artificial neural networks anns artificial neural networks inspired by the biological neural networks typically have three types of layers namely input layer hidden layer and output layer adjacent layers are fully connected with nodes neurons with weight vectors the ability to learn and generalize relationships between predictors and predictands makes it possible to solve large scale complex problems which are either linear or nonlinear in nature taking three layers ann as an example given a dataset with m input features x i i 1 m with k neurons in the hidden layer the input value for the kth neuron is the weighted sum of input layer and the bias term bishop 2006 1 a k i 1 m w ki l x i w k 0 l x i k 1 2 k where ak is the input value for the kth neuron in the hidden layer w ki 1 i 1 m and w k 0 1 are the weights and bias term between input layer and hidden layer respectively the superscripts in eq 1 denote the lth layer the output value of the current neuron is transformed using a non linear activation function as follows 2 z k œÜ a k k 1 2 k where z k is the output of the kth neuron and œÜ is the activation function it can be a sigmoid function a rectified linear unit function or other activation functions with the values obtained from equation 2 in the hidden layer the final output in the output layer can be expressed as 3 y i k 1 k w jk 2 z k w j 0 2 where yi is output neuron and w ki 12 i 1 m and w j 0 2 are the weights and the bias term of the output layer respectively similar to w ki 1 i 1 m and w k 0 1 but with different values in this study the priority of hidden neurons was tried between 0 and 1000 with the interval of 50 then the best model was saved for the following discussions 4 2 3 long short term memory lstm model the lstm network is a special kind of recurrent neural network structure that is used to address the gradient vanishing and exploding problem this is because the weights are calculated based on the product which makes their result tend to be either exponentially small or exponentially big often occurs in deep layer models the lstm model can store and relate the previous information by learning long term dependencies in a sequence a standard lstm model consists of four main parts namely an output gate an input gate a forget gate and a memory cell with these four parts interacting together lstm is able to forget or save the information to the cell state by using the sigmoid activation function for the gates the output value of each gate is between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of information saved to the next state where the value 0 means discard all information and 1 means obtain all the information the detailed process of the lstm memory cell is calculated based on equations 4 9 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 bowes et al 2019 4 forget gate f t œÉ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 5 input gate i

where wf wi wo wc and uf are the weight matrices for the forget gate input gate output gate memory cell and the hidden state respectively xt are the input values at time t bf bi bo bc are the bias vectors for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cell respectively activation functions œÉ and tanh are sigmoid function and tanh function respectively 4 3 physically based models the hydrological model employed in this study is the world wide water w3 model it is a grid biophysical model that simulates landscape water stores in the vegetation and soil system van dijk 2010 providing estimates of various water storage components e g soil moisture surface water and groundwater the model outputs show a reasonable agreement with a spatiotemporal pattern of grace derived tws in australia thus is used as an important auxiliary means for the local water resources management tregoning et al 2012 it should be noted that the accuracy of the w3 groundwater component is likely inaccurate due to the simplified generalization of the groundwater i e lack of a groundwater consumption module and the simplified generalization of the groundwater component in the w3 model tangdamrongsub et al 2018 the w3 parameters used in this study are obtained from a default configuration of the awra l version 0 5 van dijk 2010 and the forcing data are resampled to 1 1 to be consistent with the model resolution the gldas catchment land surface model level 4 gldas 2 2 li et al 2020 is also used for comparison the data are produced based on the nasa s catchment land surface model clsm together with the application of grace data assimilation to improve the model state estimates hereinafter clsm da the clsm da product provides daily water storage variables at 0 25 resolution the comparison between w3 or data driven models and clsm da can also be used to determine the benefit of grace data assimilation in the modelled groundwater estimates 4 4 evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of different models two indices are utilized to compare predicted values with in situ measurements which include pearson correlation coefficient pr and root mean square error rmse respectively pr measures how model prediction and in situ data is temporally correlated while rmse in meter quantifies how closely the amplitude of predicted values match the observed values pr and rmse are calculated as follows 10 pr i 1 n y i y y i y i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 rmse i 1 n o i y i 2 n where o and y represent observations and predicted values respectively n is the length of time series y and o are the mean values of y and o respectively the best fit between observed and predicted gwls under ideal conditions would yield rmse 0 m and pr 1 in this study the performance of different models is classified into four categories a pr 0 75 the model performance is very good b pr 0 60 then the performance of the model is good c pr 0 50 the performance is satisfactory d pr 0 50 the performance is unsatisfactory 5 results 5 1 determining optimal input data of data driven models the use of different climate variables in data driven models has significant impact on groundwater storage estimates first of all precipitation and temperature from different sources are assessed to choose the representative estimates within the study area as shown in fig 3 three precipitation data sets are consistent in terms of timing with the pr varying from 0 95 to 0 98 the largest difference is detected in 2011 between era interim and trmm with the value of 7 6 mm shown in fig 3a for the temperature era interim significantly agrees with these from gldas model and the correlation reaches up to 0 99 during the study period conversely the discrepancies are larger when the temperature falls to the annual trough fig 3b in accordance with grace data we calculate the average values of different precipitation and temperature data as the input variables of data driven models 5 2 comparison of tws anomalies from grace and hydrological models a comparison of monthly tws anomalies from mascon solutions and physically based models is shown in fig 4 high consistency between two mascon solutions are seen with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 fig 4a tws anomalies present sharply decreasing trends from 2002 to 2009 with the rates of 12 78 1 81 mm yr and 17 06 1 48 mm yr for csr m and jpl m respectively it is mainly caused by the millennium drought which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies leblanc et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 negative trends are also detected after 2012 likely induced by drainage mechanisms after the region received extreme rainfall during the 2009 2012 la ni√±a period to reduce the uncertainties of grace products the average of these two solutions is used as the representative tws anomalies within this study the performance of physically based tws anomalies from w3 and clsm da models are evaluated against mascon solutions fig 4b overall the dynamic range of grace derived tws anomalies is larger than that of the w3 simulation the small amplitude of the w3 model may be attributed to the shallow groundwater depth and absent anthropogenic activities e g irrigation domestic and livestock water use in the w3 groundwater module large discrepancies observed in 2012 see yellow shades in fig 4b is likely due to inaccurate forcing data particularly precipitation that underestimates extreme rainfall events the assimilated tws anomalies agree well with mascon solutions compared to the w3 model with the correlation coefficient of 0 85 especially for the period marked with yellow shading the fitting effect is clearly improved although some discrepancies remain 5 3 accuracy assessment of gwls prediction from data driven models theoretically some discrepancies may exist in gwls on different geographical and terrain locations within the study area two pixels g13 and g28 as shown in fig 1 are not adjacent to each other and are located in low altitude and high altitude regions respectively therefore these two pixels are chosen as the example to test the performance of different data driven models as shown in fig 5 results of other pixels are also provided in figs s2 s3 of the supplementary material during the training period from apr 2002 to apr 2011 the rf model performs the best with the largest pr 0 986 on average and smallest rmse 0 097 m on average but still lacks in the accuracy of data prediction the fitting performance of lstm model between trained data and observations is worse than that of rf model and similar to ann model however the lstm model outperforms two machine learning models during the prediction period between jul 2014 and jun 2017 for example the metrics pr rmse in g13 is 0 602 0 340 m for lstm model which is superior to rf 0 231 0 51 m and ann 0 441 0 383 m models that is to say that the performance of lstm model belongs to good during the prediction period while unsatisfactory for the other two models similar improvements can also be detected in other study periods and pixels table 2 shows the comprehensive comparisons between rf ann and lstm models for different studying periods and pixels within the study area it is noteworthy that the pixels marked with are close to ocean while the pixels near to mountain areas are marked with the bold numbers in table 2 denote the improvements in pr and rmse are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level during the prediction period in general the lstm model achieves better metrics 0 789 0 535 m of pr rmse than that of ann 0 632 0 582 m of pr rmse and rf models 0 574 0 646 m of pr rmse during the validation period moreover better performance can also be observed using lstm model 0 643 0 788 m of pr rmse followed by ann 0 519 0 973 m of pr rmse and rf 0 455 0 905 m of pr rmse for the prediction period in some pixels e g g15 the correlation of all data driven models is lower which is likely attributed to large uncertainties in the observed levels causing the data driven models fail to capture the seasonal variations in terms of the overall performance of three models lstm model achieves very good and good performance for the validation and prediction periods which are superior to ann good satisfactory and rf satisfactory unsatisfactory models additionally the differences in performance between the lstm model and traditional data driven model are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level in most grids within the study area 5 4 influence of different processing scenarios for lstm model the purpose of this section is to analyze the influence of grace observations and time lags on the performance of data driven models based on the conclusion in section 5 3 lstm model behaves best on the gwls prediction thus is chosen as the representative model for the following discussion comparisons of predicted gwls in other pixels are also provided in figs s4 s5 of the supplementary material as shown in fig 6 large discrepancies exist between lstm ref and lstm 2 where the seasonal amplitudes of gwls in lstm 2 generally vary from 0 to 0 8 much smaller than that of in situ measurements also the lstm 2 model fails to represent the dynamics of gwl variations and capture the downward trend in gwls affected by the drought event 2002 2009 in terms of cross correlation a significant improvement is observed in fig 5 after including grace observations in the input parameters of lstm ref and the pr increases by 151 98 from 0 239 to 0 602 and 70 69 from 0 442 to 0 755 for g13 and g28 during the prediction period with respect to the influence of time lag on the predicators it can be found that the time series of lstm 3 are basically consistent with that of lstm ref during the whole study period with the correlation up to 0 982 on average it can be concluded that the time lag is unnecessary in the lstm model during the validation period may 2011 jun 2014 the largest rmse can be observed in lstm 2 within the study area indicating that the accuracy of the model is seriously degraded without considering grace observations as predictors fig 7 the lstm ref model significantly outperforms the lstm 2 model and delivers higher pr 0 789 on average and smaller rmse 0 365 m on average spatially lstm ref shows higher accuracy in 9 out of total 14 pixels e g g14 and g24 accounting for 64 3 of all pixels the ratio increases to 85 7 in the prediction period fig 8 additionally the statistical values of lstm ref and lstm 3 exhibit similar metrics over most grid cells with the pr rmse values of 0 789 0 365 m and 0 761 0 386 m in the validation period and 0 643 0 509 m and 0 602 0 510 m in the prediction period consequently the evaluation indicates that grace observations play an important role in improving the accuracy of the predicted results while less contribution is detected in the time lags of the climatic variables it should also be noted that grace tws is helpful for simulating long term trends however the inclusion of grace observations does not appear to improve prediction of short term seasonal and inter annual gwls variations e g the predicted variations are less than observed values 5 5 prediction based on different algorithms and physical models the development of global hydrological models provides a supplement measure to estimate groundwater storage changes at pixel scale which can compensate the limitations of groundwater models at large scale and remote areas however the accurate knowledge of the groundwater component is generally limited due to the unavailability of the groundwater use information especially in areas with intensive anthropogenic activities with respect to grace satellites they can monitor changes in water storage at all depths below the ground such as snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater alternatively the groundwater changes can be obtained from grace derived tws anomalies as explained in sect 4 1 part iii in this section the soil moisture components provided by the w3 model are used and the derived gwls are called grace w3 in the following discussions in order to improve the accuracy of prediction previous studies coulibaly et al 2001 juan et al 2015 employed antecedent gwl records as predictors for time series forecasting we adopt the same concept in our analysis and the prediction associated with the use of antecedent gwl records is called lstm ante specifically lstm ante is the same as lsmt ref but includes the past gwl information in the input variables see fig 2 it is estimated that spatially averaged specific yields in victoria range from 0 06 to 0 14 thus a mean value of 0 1 is used to transform simulated gws to gwl anomalies tangdamrongsub et al 2018 fig 9 shows that w3 significantly underestimates gwl amplitude while grace w3 solutions improve the long term patterns of gwl estimates grace w3 solutions increase the correlation coefficient from 0 17 to 0 88 g13 and from 0 50 to 0 82 g28 compared to the lstm ref the lstm ante gwls show higher agreement with in situ level reflecting the benefit of including antecedent gwls in the data driven model during the training and validation periods the pr between lstm ante and in situ measurements reach 0 994 0 967 in g14 and 0 987 0 968 in g28 respectively as to the prediction period the pr decreases to 0 77 and 0 82 for g14 and g28 this is anticipated as the past gwl is usually an effective predictor of the future gwl sun 2013 however the inclusion of previous gwl records also causes the accumulated errors in the predictor for the long time period prediction this behavior is also observed in our study particularly during the prediction period overall the w3 model provides the smallest pr and the largest rmse which is likely caused by the inaccurate representation of groundwater processes tangdamrongsub et al 2018 comparatively better performance is observed from grace w3 with the pr increased from 0 56 0 41 to 0 65 0 50 for validation fig 10 and prediction periods fig 11 respectively in other words the data driven performance is improved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory during the prediction period when grace data is used the improvement is also seen in rmse decreased by 35 64 validation period in fig 10 and 24 34 prediction period in fig 11 this analysis suggests the need of w3 improvement in groundwater storage estimate which is also confirmed in rateb et al 2020 overall lstm model performs reasonably well at pixel and basin scales compared to that simulated by physically based models we also found that lstm ante performs better than lstm ref in inland and plain pixels e g g15 however lstm ante provides inaccurate estimates when the pixels are near to ocean or mountains areas this might be attributed to a high frequency climate variation in these areas which reduces the close correlation between the present and precedent gwls additionally there may be large uncertainties in grace observations near the coast and mountainous areas landerer and swenson 2012 mu et al 2020 6 discussions 6 1 benefit of data assimilation on gwls forecasting recent studies tangdamrongsub et al 2020 tian et al 2019 have demonstrated that data assimilation could improve the accuracy of groundwater storage estimates however few studies are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of data driven models hydrological models and data assimilation algorithm in this study the outputs from clsm da are used to highlight the benefit of data assimilation on the groundwater estimates fig 12 shows a statistical measure of the goodness of fit over 14 pixels within victoria in general the lstm model significantly outperforms the grace w3 and clsm da with the higher median metric values during the validation and prediction periods for example the lstm model provides the median pr rmse of 0 863 0 271 m during the prediction period superior to grace w3 0 163 0 654 m and clsm da 0 489 0 642 m compared to grace w3 estimates a higher correlation is found between clsm da and in situ levels with the median value of 0 710 and 0 489 for validation and prediction periods respectively similar performance can also be seen in terms of rmse fig 12 c and d based on above discussions it can be confirmed that data assimilation has the benefit of improving gwls forecasting relative to the best combination of grace and the w3 model 6 2 advantages and disadvantages of different predicted models groundwater models have always been the main measure of simulating and predicting gwls changes for a long period however the biggest limitation faced by this approach lies in that it is difficult to collect sufficient ground truth data for model construction and optimization this will inevitably reduce the accuracy of prediction especially in data sparse areas with the development of machine learning algorithms data driven models have been proposed to work as the surrogate model of traditional groundwater models and achieved reasonable success gu et al 2020 wei et al 2020 therefore it may create the illusion that physical models might be replaced by machine learning in the future to the best of our knowledge there are also some limitations in the data driven models in practice for instance the data driven models require precedent observed information to train the predicted model which limits its application in data sparse regions importantly the data driven model is normally treated as a black box model without a priori assumptions about the underlying physical process as such the data driven models are unlikely applicable for predicting gwls under complex environments such as areas with intensive irrigation activities several hydrological models have been proposed in recent years which can provide global water storage estimates the common issue is the large uncertainties in groundwater estimations due to the simplified process of groundwater simulation and lack of human intervention modules e g groundwater withdrawal groundwater flow streamflow and stream aquifer interactions therefore the groundwater storage component is usually isolated from grace derived tws anomalies based on the auxiliary information e g soil moisture from hydrological models in order to enhance the accuracy of gwl estimates on the one hand some efforts have been made to improve the structure of these models such as considering different types of water demand in the pcr globwbw model on the other hand assimilation of grace observations into hydrological models can combine the strengths of these two measures while mitigating their respective weaknesses achieving the purpose of improving the accuracy of the groundwater components 7 conclusions this study investigated the accuracy of data driven and physically based models in the gwls prediction using victoria australia as a case study the physically based models used in the analysis are w3 and clsm models the data driven models were developed based on ann rf and lstm models respectively the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the predicted gwls from the lstm model significantly perform better than those of rf and ann models during validation and prediction periods the possible reasons may be that lstm model can store and relate the previous information by learning long term dependencies in a sequence while mitigating the drawback of gradient vanishing in traditional recurrent neural networks the rf model provides the highest accuracy during the training period with the largest pr and smallest rmse while performs worse in other periods it indicates that the rf model may be over fitting in this period 2 clear improvements are observed when considering grace observations in the predictors with the metrics pr rmse improved from 0 239 0 755 m to 0 602 0 442 m during the prediction period however there are little differences on the performance of the lstm model with and without considering the time lags additionally better correlation is detected between the lstm model and in situ measurements in plain and inland areas while it is worse in pixels near to ocean and mountainous areas 3 physically based levels reveal the general fitting effect relative to the in situ measurements especially during the long term drought period the assimilated results can significantly improve the amplitude of groundwater storage against simulated values and improve the metrics from 0 41 0 79 m to 0 50 0 60 m for pr rmse in victoria it indicates that data assimilation has the great potential to improve the performance of groundwater storage while is inferior to the deep learning model this study clarifies the strength and weakness of different predicted models and assess as the application performance in victoria it also provides some suggestions for scholars to choose appropriate models and input variables in gwls forecasting although better performance is achieved in the lstm model it requires some previous information to train the model in places where there are limited measurements the physical models may still be the only method available credit authorship contribution statement wenjie yin methodology investigation writing original draft zongwen

4202,studies on shallow geothermal applications have demonstrated that mechanical thermal dispersion is an important heat transport mechanism in saturated porous media however most previous studies have assumed the thermal dispersivity ratio which has not been sufficiently examined this study investigates the validity of the general assumption that the transverse dispersivity is one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity for this purpose heat transport experiments specifically designed at the laboratory scale for estimating dispersivity were conducted using two different heat sources at darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 37 47 m d reynolds number re 0 3 the results from the analytical models showed that the dispersivity ratios differed from the thermal dispersivity assumption indicating that the ratio can vary depending on the properties of the porous media additionally heat transport modeling was performed to confirm the influence of the dispersivity ratio on the temperature plumes that develop from the thermal use of shallow aquifers such as groundwater heat pump systems we found that under steady state conditions the decrease in the dispersivity ratio led to smaller plume dimensions in all directions owing to the increased heat dissipation in the transverse direction transient simulations for flow and heat transport indicated that the effect of the thermal dispersivity ratio was time dependent and heterogeneous and increased with the injection rate these results suggest that the thermal dispersivity ratio is crucial for assessing the environmental impacts of aquifer thermal use especially for long term and large scale applications therefore the magnitude and ratio of thermal dispersivity should be evaluated at the design stage for more efficient and sustainable use of shallow geothermal resources keywords thermal dispersivity dispersivity ratio aquifer heat transport thermal plume thermal dispersion 1 introduction a groundwater heat pump gwhp system is an open loop ground source heat pump gshp system that pumps groundwater from one or more wells exchanges thermal energy with the water usually through a plate heat exchanger and generally reinjects it into another well to reduce the drawdown in water level thereby mitigating surface subsidence as well as disposing of thermal wastewater this direct use of groundwater makes the gwhp system more efficient and suitable for large scale heating and cooling facilities than a closed loop gshp system however its efficiency is highly dependent on the hydrogeological and thermal properties of the aquifer casasso sethi 2015 lo russo et al 2012 nam ooka 2010 park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 in particular injected water generates thermal plumes or thermally affected zones in the aquifer which can cause two thermal risks banks 2009 one of the risks is thermal interference between pumping and injection wells which can occur by the upstream propagation of thermal plumes from injection wells ferguson woodbury 2005 and degrade the thermal performance of the gwhp system the other risk is the environmental impact that can result from downstream plume propagation adversely affecting the sustainable use of groundwater in downgradient regions such as drinking water wells and other gwhp plants brashears 1941 ferguson woodbury 2006 the potential for thermal interference between adjacent facilities is increasing because of the rapid increase in the number of shallow geothermal systems especially in urban areas bayer et al 2012 also see attard et al 2020 garc√≠a gil et al 2019 for this reason some countries regulate the minimum distances between shallow geothermal systems and their temperature thresholds haehnlein et al 2010 additionally recent studies have attempted to predict and manage thermal plumes from gwhp systems in shallow urban aquifers attard et al 2020 garc√≠a gil et al 2019 pophillat et al 2020 thermal plumes from the injection wells of gwhp systems propagate in saturated porous media by mechanical thermal dispersion as well as conduction and advection mechanical dispersion is a physical process that represents heat spreading owing to the differences in flow velocity because of differences in friction pore size and travel distance at the pore level the actual velocities in porous media are non uniform and deviate from the average linear velocity de marsily 1986 fetter 2001 freeze cherry 1979 this spatial variability of the flow velocity at a small scale results in heat spreading in the longitudinal and transverse directions at the field scale the spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and porosity results in a heterogeneous flow field and thus results in macroscopic dispersion de marsily 1986 fetter 2001 freeze cherry 1979 in numerical models such as feflow diersch 2005 which is also used to predict thermal plumes in a saturated porous medium mechanical dispersion dm m2 s is reproduced using thermal dispersivity Œ≤ m and thermal front velocity vt m s i e dm Œ≤ vt many studies on low enthalpy geothermal applications have indicated that mechanical thermal dispersion can be an important heat transport mechanism in saturated porous media for example sauty et al 1982 investigated hot water storage experiments on single and double wells in the bonnaud confined aquifer in france using two mathematical models and found that mechanical thermal dispersion plays an important role in assessing the recovery efficiency of the stored energy this finding is consistent with a numerical study on the storage of aquifer thermal energy indicating that the energy recovery factor and recovery temperature are most sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity of the storage formation dwyer eckstein 1987 based on the hydrogeological conditions of the study site lo russo and civita 2009 numerically evaluated the feasibility of a gwhp system for a large commercial building near turin italy the simulation results for the five development scenarios indicated that the dimensions and geometry of a thermal plume are sensitive to the thermal dispersivity values park et al 2015a estimated the site thermal dispersivity through a field push pull test and investigated its significance in the design of a gwhp system they concluded that the thermal dispersivity of an aquifer strongly affects the subsurface temperature distribution as well as the arrival time especially at elevated velocities induced by pumping and injection more recently piga et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis considering hydrodynamic thermal and geometrical parameters using long term 50 years simulations for open loop gwhp systems numerical investigations demonstrated that thermal dispersivity considerably affects the assessment of the thermal plume length from a closed loop geothermal perspective molina giraldo et al 2011 examined the dispersion effects on the temperature plumes evolving from borehole heat exchangers using 2 d analytical models for steady state and transient conditions they concluded that mechanical thermal dispersion is a crucial factor in the accurate prediction of thermal plumes for heterogeneous sand and gravel aquifers at a regional scale alcaraz et al 2016 quantified the shallow geothermal potential and related environmental impacts using a gis methodology that considered the advection dispersion and transient thermal state the analysis results suggested that for high darcy fluxes 10 6 m s neglecting the effects of dispersion can overestimate the thermal plume length by up to three times whereas it can lead to the underestimation of the plume length for darcy fluxes of 10 7 to 10 6 m s in the past three years an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the thermal transport of gwhps kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2018 park et al 2018 piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 tu et al 2019 although all these studies considered thermal dispersion effects most of them used the default values given in their numerical models kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2018 tu et al 2019 or the assumed values piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 as thermal dispersivity generally transverse dispersivity is assumed to be one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity alcaraz et al 2016 hopmans et al 2002 kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2012 lo russo et al 2018 lo russo and civita 2009 molson et al 1992 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 smith and chapman 1983 su et al 2004 tu et al 2019 even in sensitivity analyses for investigating the effect of aquifer properties on thermal plume dimensions lo russo et al 2012 piga et al 2017 the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity was fixed at 10 and transverse dispersivity was calculated from the anisotropy ratio and varying longitudinal dispersivity however using a fixed ratio of 10 could lead to the underestimation or overestimation of transverse dispersion in real aquifers and thus fail to predict the environmental impact of gwhp systems there could be several reasons why the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse thermal dispersivity was assumed first unlike solute dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 it is difficult to directly compare thermal dispersivity values owing to various mathematical descriptions of thermal dispersion coefficients rau et al 2014 this is because over the past few decades there has been disagreement among authors with respect to the description of thermal dispersivity and the relationship between thermal dispersion and flow velocity rau et al 2012a second thermal dispersivity could be insignificant bear 1972 if conduction was dominant over mechanical dispersion as believed under natural groundwater flow conditions molina giraldo et al 2011 and references therein this seems to be evident from the fact that molecular diffusion is of the order of 10 9 m2 s de marsily 1986 whereas thermal diffusivity which describes the influence of conduction is of the order of 10 7 10 6 m2 s domenico schwartz 1998 third there is a lack of information on thermal dispersivity in the literature see stauffer et al 2013 wagner et al 2014 because mechanical thermal dispersion has been ignored or underestimated in previous studies a few studies have conducted field based assessments of thermal dispersivity however they did not estimate transverse thermal dispersivity stauffer et al 2013 wagner et al 2014 therefore the anisotropy ratio of thermal dispersivity under the influence of field conditions remains unknown the anisotropy ratio of 10 likely originates from solute transport see hopmans et al 2002 molson et al 1992 su et al 2004 this assumption of thermal dispersivity ratio is based on the similarity between the transfer of solute and heat de marsily 1986 however solute transfers only in the liquid phase whereas heat transfers in both the solid and liquid phases as a consequence solute and heat propagation can occur in different transport regimes even under the same flow conditions rau et al 2012a recent studies on aquifer macrodispersivity indicate that field scale dispersivity can vary depending on the scale of measurement and aquifer heterogeneity chang yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 the scaling of macroscopic dispersivity with the dissimilar transport of solute and heat could make their dispersivity different even at the same site moreover experimental observations of field scale solute transport do not clarify that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity is 10 de marsily 1986 domenico schwartz 1998 gelhar et al 1992 for example a critical review of solute dispersivity data from 59 different aquifers conducted by gelhar et al 1992 indicated that transverse dispersivity is approximately one third of longitudinal dispersivity of 23 field dispersivity ratio data only two high reliability points showed that longitudinal dispersivity is an order of magnitude higher than transverse dispersivity as gelhar et al 1992 commented it is difficult to justify this anisotropy ratio because the high reliability field data on transverse solute dispersivity are very limited to the best of the authors knowledge transport experiments estimating both the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values have rarely been performed and the influence of the anisotropy ratio on heat transport processes in saturated porous media has not been sufficiently investigated especially for the thermal use of shallow aquifers such as gwhp systems the assumption of the anisotropy ratio of thermal dispersivity could affect the magnitude of transverse dispersion thus affecting the quantification of thermal plumes which is required for assessing managing and regulating an environmental impact of gwhp systems in crowded urban aquifers the objective of this study is to investigate the validity of the general assumption that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse thermal dispersivity is 10 and analyze its impact on predicting thermal plumes in saturated porous media for these purposes we performed heat transport experiments using a laboratory based experimental system initially designed to examine advective dispersive heat transport under a disturbed flow field using injected water according to a previous study park et al 2018 the transport experiments were conducted in saturated porous media at darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 37 47 m d reynolds number re 0 3 first heat transport experiments were performed using an electrical resistor to estimate the thermal properties of porous media quantify the relationship between them and derive the thermal dispersivity ratio then heat transport experiments using injected water were conducted and the observations were used to validate the developed numerical model the validated model was employed to investigate the influence of the dispersivity ratio on the time evolution and geometry of thermal plumes that developed from injection wells in the analysis of anisotropy ratio effects this study also considered the change in the injection rate longitudinal dispersivity and threshold temperature for an isotherm that can affect plume propagation 2 materials and methods heat transport experiments were conducted in this study to verify the assumption of the thermal dispersivity ratio and examine its influence on predicting thermal plumes and they can be divided into electrical resistor and injection tests depending on the type of heat source resistor tests use a small electrical resistor as a point heat source and transfer only heat into a porous medium whereas injection tests inject warm water heat and mass as a point heat source thus disturbing the background flow and temperature fields as gwhp systems do first resistor tests were performed without background water flow and in this case heat propagated in a porous medium only by conduction the temperature time series data observed around the electrical resistor were analyzed using an analytical model for thermal diffusion and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the bulk volume were estimated then resistor tests were conducted at various background flow velocities see fig 1 a and in this case heat transferred in a porous medium by conduction advection and dispersion the observed temperature data were interpreted using an analytical model for advective dispersive heat transport the analysis results were used to determine the thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity whose relationship was quantified using a regression model to estimate the magnitude and ratio of thermal dispersivity second injection tests were conducted with various background flow velocities and the obtained temperature time series data were used to validate a numerical model developed to reproduce transient flow and transient heat transport by injected water the validated model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis where longitudinal dispersivity was fixed and transverse dispersivity was calculated using variable dispersivity ratios from 1 to 10 2 1 heat transport experiments 2 1 1 experimental design the experimental system used in this study was initially designed to examine the mechanical thermal dispersion behavior under flow conditions disturbed by warm water injection park et al 2018 and consisted of an acrylic glass tank two heat sources and a data acquisition daq system fig 1 the outer dimensions of the rectangular tank were 1 3 m 0 6 m 0 8 m l w h and its wall thickness was 15 mm the tank was divided into three parts the middle chamber was 1 m long and filled with saturated sand the two chambers on the sides were 0 13 m long and operated as constant hydraulic head tanks by adjusting the water levels in the side chambers and thus the hydraulic gradients between them the background water flow velocities passing through the porous media could be changed after the completion of the experimental setup the sand tank was thermally insulated with multiple layers of insulation sheets 4 mm thickness containing sealed air bubbles two different heat sources an electrical resistor and warm water were used in the heat transport experiments a small wire wound resistor 7 mm in diameter resistance of 47 œâ and power rating of 5 w was waterproofed with teflon tape mounted on an acrylic tube 8 mm in diameter and 0 7 m in height and installed at a height of 0 3 m see fig 1 a laboratory dc power supply ac input 220 v dc output 0 30 v applied a constant voltage to the resistor enabling it to act as a constant heat source as shown in fig 1a a peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson usa transferred warm water from a thermostatic barrel through a pvc tube to the injection well with an internal diameter of 14 mm and a height of 0 7 m the well had a screened section ranging from 0 29 to 0 31 m in height which allowed the injected water to propagate radially from the injection point at a height of 0 3 m the daq system comprises temperature sensors pt100 hayashi denko japan analog input modules ni 9217 national instruments usa compact daq chassis cdaq 9178 national instruments usa and daq software daqmx and labview 2015 a detailed description of the daq system was provided by park 2019 of the 32 resistance temperature detectors rtds 29 were installed in saturated porous media and the remaining were employed to measure the temperatures of air warm water and background water fig 1 after the installation of the sensors and heat sources sand was carefully sprinkled from a few centimeters above the water table and compacted by manual compression among the various methods for packing porous media the wet packing technique was used for this study because the laboratory experiments required a saturated initial state and wet packing in thin layers can provide much denser and more uniform packing than dry packing oliviera et al 1996 after the middle chamber was filled with saturated sand the rtd sensors were connected to a laptop computer via ni modules and chassis and were controlled to sample and log the temperature every 0 1 s using the labview program 2 1 2 physical properties and uncertainties the uncertainty analysis is presented in appendix a grain size analysis of 30 samples was conducted using a series of sieves to confirm the average diameter and uniformity of the two different sands see fig 2 a the mean grain size d50 was estimated to be 0 52 mm 0 5 for sand n5 and 0 76 mm 1 3 for sand n4 which are within the range of coarse sand friedman sanders 1978 but smaller than those used in previous studies metzger et al 2004 park et al 2018 rau et al 2012a the uniformity value u was 1 41 0 8 and 1 50 1 7 for sand n5 and n4 indicating well sorted materials in this study we did not differentiate between the total porosity n and kinematic or effective porosity ne the total porosities of coarse sands n5 and n4 were estimated using two different methods first the porosities of sands n5 and n4 were determined to be 0 331 3 4 and 0 360 0 7 respectively by measuring the moisture content six times with two soil moisture sensors 5te decagon usa which were installed at a height of 45 cm in the experimental setup see fig 1 the porosity values of sands n5 and n4 were determined to be 0 377 0 2 and 0 374 0 2 respectively by measuring the dry sand volume and the bulk volume of 50 and 51 samples using a mass cylinder and burette laboratory x ray diffraction xrd analyses of the sand samples were also performed to quantify the proportion of different minerals present in the samples and the results indicated a quartz content of 68 3 for sand n5 and 75 6 for sand n4 as shown in fig 2b a simple linear regression method was used to investigate the relationship between the darcy flux or specific discharge and the hydraulic gradient measured in the sand tank experiments using regression models the hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 2 039 10 3 m s 2 2 for sand n5 and 3 228 10 3 m s 0 9 for sand n4 2 1 3 experimental conditions for tracer tests under no flow condition electrical resistor experiments were conducted seven times to estimate the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the coarse sands n5 and n4 see table 1 a constant power of 4 230 w or 4 517 w was applied to the resistor and the temporal variation in temperature was measured using 29 rtd sensors around the heat source a total of 44 heat transport experiments using the resistor were also performed at various background flow velocities between 4 74 and 12 32 m d for sand n5 and between 8 13 and 36 75 m d for sand n4 as it takes longer to reach a steady state at a slower flow velocity the power applied to the resistor was adjusted to the 3 426 4 517 w range as a result of the heat transport experiments the temperature of the saturated sand in the middle chamber was perturbed or increased such spatial differences in temperature can cause additional heat fluxes and violate the initial equilibrium state of the analytical models before the experiments were conducted tap water having a nearly constant temperature was kept flowing through the sand tank for several hours till the perturbed temperature of the porous media was restored to the temperature of the background water heat transport experiments using warm water as a tracer were performed at four different darcy fluxes of 11 93 21 21 29 47 and 37 47 m d for

used to analyze the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio eq 16 on the geometry and temporal evolution of the thermal plumes generated from the injection well in this study numerical modeling of the conductive and convective transport of heat in porous media was performed using the feflow 5 3 finite element code diersch 2005 which is based on the linear dispersion model m 1 given as follows

elements Œ¥x Œ¥y 0 002 m see fig 3a the initial time step was set to 10 9 d with a maximum time step of 10 4 d the spatial and temporal discretization used in our study was determined in a previous study park et al 2018 using transient simulations where the grid spacing and time step were changed based on the grid peclet and courant numbers daus et al 1985 until the modeling results were not affected by the discretization fig 3b and c illustrate the location of the injection well and the temperature sensors and the boundary conditions bcs of the numerical model the initial hydraulic head was set to 0 6 m across the entire model domain the head distribution was calculated by performing steady state simulations where the observed water levels were reflected on both sides of the model domain as constant head bcs the hydraulic gradient ranged from 0 041 to 0 118 depending on the experimental conditions the calculated hydraulic heads were used as the initial conditions for the subsequent transient simulations the initial temperature for the entire domain was set to be equal to the background water temperature observed prior to the injection tests the background water temperature was also employed as a constant bc on the left boundary of the model into which the background water flowed the injection of warm water was represented by two bcs at the injection point that is the average injection rate and injection temperature measured in the experiments see fig 3 the developed model was then validated by performing transient flow and transport simulations and comparing the results with the temperature time series data observed from the injection experiments heat transport modeling using the validated model was performed using dispersivity ratios of 1 to 10 the case simulations also considered the dispersivity ratios calculated in this study and previous studies 3 70 in rau et al 2012a and 3 00 in saeid et al 2014 background flow velocities and injection rates in the numerical modeling the density and viscosity of the fluid were assumed to be constant because the temperature change in all the experiments remained within 5 c see leaf et al 2012 ma zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 rau et al 2012a the hydrogeological and thermal parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 2 3 thermal parameter estimation as described in section 2 1 4 the resistor experiments were analyzed by fitting the thermal breakthrough curves of the analytical models in eqs 9 and 11 into the observed temperature data the quality of the fitting in the analytical modeling results was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse given as 14 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 where mi and si are the measured and simulated values respectively from the best fitted cps and mcps models which minimized the rmse value three thermal properties and thermal front velocities were estimated this criterion was also applied to validate the numerical model the quality of the models for different experimental conditions was compared using the normalized rmse nrmse which is expressed as 15 nrmse r m s e t max t min where tmax and tmin are the maximum and minimum temperatures of each temperature time series data respectively the analysis procedure for the parameters was repeated in matlab until the estimated values varied within 0 1 a detailed description can be found in park et al 2018 because the feflow program is based on the linear dispersion model of eq 13 the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities evaluated by the mcps model was analyzed using a linear regression method the thermal dispersivity values in the longitudinal and transverse directions were derived from the regression equation that best represented their relationship the anisotropy ratio of the longitudinal to transverse dispersivity can be calculated using the following formula 16 Œ≥ Œ≤ l Œ≤ t a thermal plume or thermally

2012 was subdivided into plume length l1 indicating upstream propagation and plume length l2 representing downstream propagation the plume length l2 corresponded to the plume length of piga et al 2017 the plume width was defined as the maximum plume extent in the direction transverse to the background water flow piga et al 2017 3 results 3 1 analytical modeling for electrical resistor tests electrical resistor experiments conducted without background flow were analyzed using the cps model to estimate the bulk thermal conductivity and bulk volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous media figure s1 illustrates the temperature time series data observed at the center and off center locations along with the best fitted cps model results as shown in figure s1 the analytical modeling results were in good agreement with the observed temperature data rmse 0 007 and nrmse 0 010 the thermal properties of the saturated sands and corrected sensor locations were determined from the best fit satisfying the minimum rmse all the experiments were repeatedly performed and analyzed and the average values of the estimates are shown in table 3 as the best estimates for sand n4 for which the experiments were performed five times the relative uncertainty of the best estimates was also expressed in parentheses as a percentage the solid thermal properties were derived from the arithmetic and geometric mean models in eqs 3 and 5 with average porosities of 0 377 sand n5 and 0 374 sand n4 as estimated from the sand samples the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of solids for sand n5 were estimated to be 3 826 w m k and 1 890 106 j m3 k respectively and those for sand n4 were 3 845 w m k and 1 970 106 j m3 k respectively as can be seen in table 3 the thermal conductivity values 3 271 4 451 w m k estimated for the two sands were high cf 1 5 4 0 w m k in stauffer et al 2013 2 5 3 5 w m k in de marsily 1986 also see jury horton 2004 therefore laboratory xrd analyses of the sand samples were conducted to confirm their chemical compositions the results indicated a high quartz content of 75 6 sand n4 and 68 3 sand n5 based on the quartz contents and the reference values for dry sand and quartz balland arp 2005 stauffer et al 2013 the likely range of thermal conductivity was calculated from the geometric mean model in eq 5 as shown in figure s2 the values estimated from the heat transport experiments for both sands were within the calculated possible range for thermal conductivity indicating that the high thermal conductivity value may have originated from the high quartz content the electrical resistor experiments conducted at various background flow velocities darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 36 75 m d were analyzed using the mcps model to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities figure s3 illustrates observed temperature time series data and their best fitted mcps models for three observation points r 0 048 0 096 and 0 139 m at darcy fluxes of 10 44 and 35 85 m d compared with the example in figure s3a with the smallest nrmse figure s3b which has the largest nrmse shows a difference between the observed and modeled temperatures especially at the beginning of the plateau however the analytical models successfully reproduced the observed temperature breakthrough curves in that the r2 values were 0 9970 or higher for all the experiments figures 5 and 6 show the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities estimated for sand n5 and n4 respectively as shown in fig 5 it was observed for sand n5 that the thermal dispersion coefficients increased in the longitudinal direction but decreased in the transverse direction although heat transport experiments for sand n4 were also performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 7 it was observed that both the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersion coefficients increased with the flow velocity fig 6 to quantitatively express the relationship between thermal dispersion coefficients and flow velocities and to derive thermal dispersivity values a simple linear regression method was applied the linear regression equation for sand n5 did not show a clear tendency r2 0 3 whereas that for sand n4 showed a distinct increasing trend with r2 values of 0 7890 and 0 7593 in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively see black solid lines in figs 5 and 6 from the regression models the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values for sand n4 were estimated to be 2 278 10 3 m 5 2 and 1 533 10 3 m 5 6 respectively table 2 however there was a scatter in the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities which made it difficult to determine their relationship and derive thermal dispersivity values especially for sand n5 this is discussed in section 4 1 3 2 steady state and transient simulations for injection tests heat transport experiments using warm water as a heat source were performed to validate the 3 d numerical model and to investigate the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio in predicting thermal plumes from gwhp systems figure s4 represents the temperature time series for the data from both the injection tests and the numerical model at r 0 1390 m with darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d despite the deviation at the beginning and end of the temperature breakthrough curves it was found that the model successfully reproduced the observed data in terms of r2 0 9905 fig 7 shows the thermal plume dimensions for steady state simulations conducted with various thermal dispersivity ratios at two different darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d it is clear that the length and width of the thermal plume increased with the thermal dispersivity ratio in addition the change in the plume dimensions increased as the background flow velocity increased the gray isotherms in fig 7a represent the projection of the isotherms in fig 7b which were observed at a faster background flow the effect of dispersivity ratio on the plume dimensions was compared for different background flow velocities see fig 7a as the background flow velocity increased the thermal plume width decreased but the thermal plume length increased or decreased depending on the thermal dispersivity ratio based on the transient flow and transient transport simulations fig 8 displays the temporal variation of the thermal plume lengths with different thermal dispersivity ratios ranging from 1 to 10 at a darcy flux of 29 47 m d notably it was difficult to identify the difference in the thermal plume length l1 calculated from the isotherm of Œ¥t 1 c because the plume length l1 can be used as a spatial restriction to avoid thermal interference between the pumping and injection wells and ensure system efficiency e g the spacing between pumping and injection wells should exceed the plume length l1 a more stringent criterion of Œ¥t 0 1 c was applied to calculate the plume length l1 as shown in fig 8 the thermal dispersivity ratio affected the thermal plume lengths l1 and l2 however its influence varied with space and time the effect of the thermal dispersivity ratio was stronger in the downstream direction than in the upstream direction and stronger in the steady state than in the transient state fig 9 illustrates the temporal variation in thermal plume widths having different thermal dispersivity ratios at two darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d it was confirmed that thermal dispersivity ratio also affected the thermal plume dimension perpendicular to the background flow direction especially in the steady state however its influence on the plume width was much weaker than that on the plume length l2 as the background flow velocity increased the thermal plume width decreased noticeably but the effect of the dispersivity ratio increased only marginally fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 thermal dispersion and flow velocity relationship the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities represented a distinct increasing trend for sand n4 but there was no clear trend for sand n5 as shown in figs 5 and 6 the scatter made it difficult to quantify the dispersion velocity relationship r2 0 3 especially for low flow velocities pet 0 3 this has also been observed in previous studies kunii smith 1961 park et al 2018 rau et al 2012a yagi et al 1960 yuan et al 1991 there are several reasons for this scatter the first reason could be attributed to the transport regime although the hydraulic gradient between the chambers on the side was kept as high as possible fig 1a it was found that all the experiments were performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 2 for sand n5 and pet 0 7 for sand n4 in the thermal regime represented by a very low pet 0 3 the thermal diffusivity first term in eq 13 was up to 89 of the longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient and up to 8 1 times higher than the mechanical dispersion figure s5 thus the dominance of conductive heat transport rendered the contribution of the background flow to the dispersion coefficient insignificant for q 1 50 10 4 m s this partly explains the difficulty in indentifying the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities for sand n5 r2 0 3 see fig 5 for which all the experiments were performed under very slow flow conditions pet 0 2 figure s6 shows the variation in the thermal front velocity estimated from the three observation points as the background flow increased for q 1 50 10 4 m s the velocity difference among the rtd sensors was less than 13 and 11 for sand n5 and n4 respectively compared to the respective maximum velocities this difference in the thermal front velocity can change the longitudinal dispersion coefficient up to 4 but cannot account for the scatter in the dispersion coefficient as listed in table 3 the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of coarse sands n5 and n4 varied between the observation points indicating the spatial heterogeneity of the thermal properties the thermal diffusivity first term in eq 13 calculated from the bulk thermal properties varied up to 13 among rtd15 rtd20 and rtd25 and this can affect the dispersion coefficient in the longitudinal direction by up to 11 and 10 for sand n5 and n4 respectively considering the variation in the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of 5 to 21 sand n5 and 4 to 19 sand n4 the heterogeneity of the thermal properties could be the main reason for the scatter in the dispersion velocity relationship especially for low flow velocities these explanations clarify the interpretation by park et al 2018 for heat tracer tests in a saturated porous medium having homogeneous but different grain size distributions u 1 36 d 50 1 28 mm and low flow pet 1 which is partly supported by the fact that a more pronounced trend was observed with higher r2 values when the relationship was analyzed by each observation point see fig 6 for q 1 50 10 4 m s or 12 96 m d where thermal diffusion and mechanical dispersion are comparable the spatial variability of thermal properties alone cannot explain why the deviation among thermal dispersion coefficients increased with increasing background flow velocities see fig 6 as shown in figure s6b the difference in the thermal front velocity increases at a single location as well as among the different observation points this result indicates that the velocity field may not be homogeneous rau et al 2012b experimentally demonstrated that a non uniform flow field can occur even in a small scale experiment 0 96 m 0 96 m 0 4 m using homogeneous natural materials u 1 68 and d 50 2 mm under a transition regime pet 0 7 this flow field makes heat transport inhomogeneous in the flow direction resulting in lateral temperature gradients that are further enhanced with increasing flow velocity see rau et al 2012b this can be a possible explanation for the spatial temperature variability found in the complex shallow aquifer located near the han river south korea which shows a heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity kaown et al 2018 in recent years numerical studies at the streambed scale have shown that lateral heat transport can significantly affect temperature based specific discharge estimation ferguson bense 2011 schornberg et al 2010 as rau et al 2012b further commented the flow field non uniformity and lateral heat conduction stemming from the small scale heterogeneity of permeability can violate the underlying assumptions of the uniform flow field and plume fringe of the mcps model and this can lead to the scatter in the dispersion velocity relationship especially for q 1 50 10 4 m s fig 6 the above results show that the small scale heterogeneity of thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity can affect the dispersion velocity relationship even though the heat transport experiments in this study were performed at the sub meter scale using homogeneous materials u 1 50 notably both parameters are governed by soil texture and fabric hence in field conditions that are likely to be more heterogeneous these effects can be stronger even at low flow rates further research is required to reveal the influence of material texture on the thermal dispersion coefficients 4 2 anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity as shown in fig 6 the thermal dispersivity values estimated using the linear dispersion model in eq 13 represent thermal dispersivity ratios of 1 33 to 1 73 this range includes the values of 1 48 to 1 58 assessed in a previous study park et al 2018 which was performed with bigger and more homogeneous coarse sands d50 1 28 mm and u 1 36 this provides experimental evidence that the dispersivity ratio differs from the general assumption of 10 we also calculated the ratios from other studies cf Œ≥ 3 70 with d50 2 mm and u 1 68 in rau et al 2012a Œ≥ 3 00 with d50 0 13 mm and u 1 64 in saeid et al 2014 and compared them with ratios obtained from our study it was difficult to find any trends among the properties Œ≥ d50 and u due to the lack of available data for the calculation of the anisotropy ratio 4 3 effects of dispersivity ratio on plume propagation as shown in fig 7 a decrease in the thermal dispersivity ratio leads to a decrease in the thermal plume dimension this is relevant to the influence of transverse thermal dispersion on thermal plume propagation under steady state conditions transverse dispersion is dominant over longitudinal dispersion alcaraz et al 2016 metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 the decrease in the dispersivity ratio indicates an increase in the transverse dispersivity and therefore reinforces heat dissipation in the transverse direction to the background flow reducing the dimension of the thermal plume hence the modeling results for the general value of 10 can overestimate the thermal plume extension under steady state conditions in comparison to the dispersivity ratios estimated from the heat transport experiments fig 7 groundwater flow is controlled by the hydrodynamic parameters of a numerical model and has a significant influence on the thermal plume propagation in the longitudinal and transverse directions lo russo et al 2012 a recent study also confirmed that a higher groundwater flow velocity causes an increase in plume length but a decrease in plume width piga et al 2017 as shown in fig 7a the thermal plume length l2 did not always increase for all the dispersivity ratios notably the plume length l2 decreased with increasing background flow velocity when the dispersivity ratio was less than 5 a possible explanation is that a sufficiently small dispersivity ratio causes the transverse dispersion to prevail over the other transport processes although an increase in the background flow velocity leads to an increase in both advection and mechanical dispersion therefore the enhanced heat spreading in the transverse direction resulted in a shorter plume length as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the impacts of the thermal dispersivity ratio on thermal plumes can vary depending on the thermal state transient or steady state of the system for early transient times the thermal plume dimensions varied slightly with the dispersivity ratio when approaching the steady state condition the difference in the plume extensions dramatically increased especially in plume length l2 fig 8b this is attributed to the fact that the importance of longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values is time dependent as demonstrated by the relative sensitivities obtained as a function of time metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 therefore using a fixed value of 10 as the thermal dispersivity ratio can lead to an overestimation of the longitudinal and transverse propagation of thermal plumes especially in long term simulations which are vital for reducing thermal risks and ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of shallow geothermal systems figures 8 and 9 also show that the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio is not homogeneous this can be related to the heterogeneous velocity field caused by the injected water and the background flow in a real system heterogeneous thermal properties and non uniform flow fields can affect the temperature distribution and hence can complicate the spatially variable effect of the dispersivity ratio as depicted in figs 8 and 9 the effect is minimal in the upstream direction and maximum in the downstream propagation of thermal plumes this suggests that the thermal dispersivity ratio plays an important role in assessing the environmental impacts of the thermal use of shallow aquifers which can impair the sustainable use of groundwater in downstream regions such as water for drinking and for space heating and cooling the injected water in gwhp systems increases the flow velocity and thus makes mechanical thermal dispersion critical in the heat transport mechanism park et al 2015a park et al 2018 to investigate the influence of injection on the significance of the thermal dispersivity ratio numerical simulations were conducted using different injection rates of 26 to 75 ml min fig 10 shows that the plume length l1 and the plume width increased with injection rates which corresponds with a previous study piga et al 2017 but the effect of the dispersivity ratio hardly changed and was small enough to be discarded less than 6 change however as shown in fig 10b the dispersivity ratio can have a greater influence on the plume length l2 in case of higher injection rates indicating that it can play an important role in assessing the environmental impacts of large scale gwhp systems notably the relative importance of the ratio can vary with the assessment time because injection retards reaching steady state conditions see red dashed lines in fig 10b previous studies lo russo et al 2012 molina giraldo et al 2011 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 used a fixed dispersivity ratio in their sensitivity analysis resulting in difficulty in determining the independent effect of longitudinal dispersivity alone fig 11 shows the results of the simulations in which the longitudinal dispersivity was changed with respect to the fixed transverse dispersivity hence its effect can be investigated independently fig 11a shows that the longitudinal dispersivity increased the plume length l1 indicating that it can affect the thermal interference between pumping and injection wells and thus the efficiency of the gwhp systems as can be seen in fig 11b and c in contrast to the transverse dispersivity the longitudinal dispersivity is important under transient conditions which is consistent with recent studies on vertical gshp systems alcaraz et al 2016 molina giraldo et al 2011 notably the longitudinal dispersivity increased the upstream propagation of the thermal plumes whereas it decreased the plume length l2 and plume width fig 11 this result is different from those of previous studies that used a fixed dispersivity ratio of 10 for example such a decrease in the plume dimensions was not observed in short term 60 days simulations lo russo et al 2012 although analytical modeling for the steady state showed that the plume length decreased with increasing dispersivity this was attributed to the transverse thermal dispersivity molina giraldo et al 2011 a possible explanation is that under steady state conditions the transverse dispersion dominates over the longitudinal dispersion metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 even though the latter also contributes to energy dissipation the assessment of thermal plume dimensions is based on isotherms calculated from a temperature threshold which represents the temperature difference between the plume and ambient water for instance some authors have used 1 k as a threshold value alcaraz et al 2016 lo russo et al 2012 piga et al 2017 whereas others have used 0 1 k molina giraldo et al 2011 an arbitrary threshold can influence the prediction of thermal plume propagation in this regard thermal plume length l2 was re evaluated for steady state simulations with different threshold values ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 k see fig 12 and figure s7 as the temperature threshold decreased the thermal plume length l2 exponentially increased and the effect of the dispersivity ratio also increased fig 12 this change in the plume length suggests that the temperature threshold can also affect the thermal state as the injection rate does if the threshold value is smaller the time required to reach the steady state is longer therefore the use of an arbitrary threshold may lead to the underestimation or overestimation of thermal impacts from the thermal use of shallow aquifers which is significant for the management and regulation of groundwater resources notably continuous heat sources were used in this study if the actual thermal load of buildings which is transient in time is considered in the analysis the change in plume dimensions can be more complicated because of plume separation see piga et al 2017 the thermal dispersivities obtained in this study were very small Œ≤ 1 106 2 547 mm over tens of centimeters because the transport experiments were performed at the sub meter scale using homogeneous materials u 1 5 field application systems such as gwhp systems however have a much larger radius of thermal influence than laboratory experiments see park et al 2018 and real aquifers are more heterogeneous than the sands used in this study sauty et al 1982 inferred from thermal experiments at the bonnaud site in france that the dispersivity on the field scale increases asymptotically with the transfer distance and aquifer heterogeneity their observation is in agreement with recent findings on the scaling of aquifer macrodispersivity chang yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 therefore the thermal dispersivities of gwhp systems can be several orders of magnitude higher than those at the laboratory scale see molina giraldo et al 2011 stauffer et al 2013 in this context the effect of the anisotropy ratio Œ≥ at the field scale was investigated using an upscaled model based on previous field studies park et al 2015a park et al 2015b as depicted in fig 13 the impact of the dispersivity ratio on the plume length l2 increased significantly from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens to hundreds of meters on the field scale despite a slow local groundwater flow velocity of q 3 64 m d cf q 11 93 and 29 47 m d in fig 7 it is noted that the dispersivity Œ≤l 0 4 m and injection rates q 25 and 50 m3 d used in the upscaled model were still small cf Œ≤l 0 1 100 m in wagner et al 2014 q 1 800 8 000 m3 d in al zyoud et al 2014 suggesting that the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio can be greater in predicting thermal plumes for long term sustainability of large scale gwhp systems however as shown in fig 13b these results can be affected by technical operating parameters such as system capacity operating time and transient and imbalanced heat loads therefore further field based studies are required in recent years many studies have demonstrated that mechanical thermal dispersion is significant for the thermal use of shallow aquifers alcaraz et al 2016 lo russo civita 2009 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 however most of these studies used a generally assumed value of 10 as the anisotropy ratio for thermal dispersivity to the best of our knowledge the accuracy of such an assumption and its influence have not been investigated especially for the thermal use of shallow aquifers the experimental relationships between the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities indicated that the assumption can be violated numerical simulations for steady state and transient conditions indicated that the effect of the dispersivity ratio was strongest on the downstream propagation of thermal plumes under steady state conditions and increased with injection rates moreover this influence may be greater at the field scale depending on the scale of measurements and the degree of heterogeneity chang yeh 2012 sauty et al 1982 zech et al 2015 this suggests that dispersivity ratio can play a crucial role in assessing the environmental impacts of aquifer thermal use especially for large scale facilities this has significant implications for predicting managing and regulating thermal plumes because the potential thermal risk from neighboring facilities is rapidly increasing with the growing use of shallow geothermal energy pophillat et al 2020 also see bayer et al 2012 therefore the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity should be evaluated and reflected for the efficient and sustainable use of shallow aquifers 5 conclusions in this study we experimentally and numerically investigated the validity of the general assumption that the transverse dispersivity is one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity the dispersion velocity relationship eq 13 for homogeneous coarse sand u 1 50 and d50 0 76 mm indicated that the anisotropy ratio for thermal dispersivity Œ≥ 1 3 1 7 could be different from the generally assumed value of 10 fig 6 transient simulations showed that the effect of the dispersivity ratio varied spatiotemporally figs 8 and 9 the anisotropy ratio had a significant influence on the downstream propagation of thermal plumes under steady state conditions and its effect increased with the injection rate this suggests that dispersivity ratio can play a crucial role in the environmental impact assessment of aquifer thermal use especially for long term operations of large scale facilities importantly incorrect assumptions about the dispersivity ratio can lead to the overestimation or underestimation of thermal propagation limiting the shallow geothermal potential due to over regulation or thermal interference therefore it is necessary to evaluate and reflect the magnitude and ratio of dispersivity at the design stage the results of this study can contribute to a more accurate prediction of thermal plumes and thus help to manage and regulate the thermal risks related to the utilization of low enthalpy geothermal resources this can have significant implications for the sustainable use of shallow aquifers in that the conflict with neighboring facilities will grow as the installation of shallow

4202,studies on shallow geothermal applications have demonstrated that mechanical thermal dispersion is an important heat transport mechanism in saturated porous media however most previous studies have assumed the thermal dispersivity ratio which has not been sufficiently examined this study investigates the validity of the general assumption that the transverse dispersivity is one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity for this purpose heat transport experiments specifically designed at the laboratory scale for estimating dispersivity were conducted using two different heat sources at darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 37 47 m d reynolds number re 0 3 the results from the analytical models showed that the dispersivity ratios differed from the thermal dispersivity assumption indicating that the ratio can vary depending on the properties of the porous media additionally heat transport modeling was performed to confirm the influence of the dispersivity ratio on the temperature plumes that develop from the thermal use of shallow aquifers such as groundwater heat pump systems we found that under steady state conditions the decrease in the dispersivity ratio led to smaller plume dimensions in all directions owing to the increased heat dissipation in the transverse direction transient simulations for flow and heat transport indicated that the effect of the thermal dispersivity ratio was time dependent and heterogeneous and increased with the injection rate these results suggest that the thermal dispersivity ratio is crucial for assessing the environmental impacts of aquifer thermal use especially for long term and large scale applications therefore the magnitude and ratio of thermal dispersivity should be evaluated at the design stage for more efficient and sustainable use of shallow geothermal resources keywords thermal dispersivity dispersivity ratio aquifer heat transport thermal plume thermal dispersion 1 introduction a groundwater heat pump gwhp system is an open loop ground source heat pump gshp system that pumps groundwater from one or more wells exchanges thermal energy with the water usually through a plate heat exchanger and generally reinjects it into another well to reduce the drawdown in water level thereby mitigating surface subsidence as well as disposing of thermal wastewater this direct use of groundwater makes the gwhp system more efficient and suitable for large scale heating and cooling facilities than a closed loop gshp system however its efficiency is highly dependent on the hydrogeological and thermal properties of the aquifer casasso sethi 2015 lo russo et al 2012 nam ooka 2010 park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 in particular injected water generates thermal plumes or thermally affected zones in the aquifer which can cause two thermal risks banks 2009 one of the risks is thermal interference between pumping and injection wells which can occur by the upstream propagation of thermal plumes from injection wells ferguson woodbury 2005 and degrade the thermal performance of the gwhp system the other risk is the environmental impact that can result from downstream plume propagation adversely affecting the sustainable use of groundwater in downgradient regions such as drinking water wells and other gwhp plants brashears 1941 ferguson woodbury 2006 the potential for thermal interference between adjacent facilities is increasing because of the rapid increase in the number of shallow geothermal systems especially in urban areas bayer et al 2012 also see attard et al 2020 garc√≠a gil et al 2019 for this reason some countries regulate the minimum distances between shallow geothermal systems and their temperature thresholds haehnlein et al 2010 additionally recent studies have attempted to predict and manage thermal plumes from gwhp systems in shallow urban aquifers attard et al 2020 garc√≠a gil et al 2019 pophillat et al 2020 thermal plumes from the injection wells of gwhp systems propagate in saturated porous media by mechanical thermal dispersion as well as conduction and advection mechanical dispersion is a physical process that represents heat spreading owing to the differences in flow velocity because of differences in friction pore size and travel distance at the pore level the actual velocities in porous media are non uniform and deviate from the average linear velocity de marsily 1986 fetter 2001 freeze cherry 1979 this spatial variability of the flow velocity at a small scale results in heat spreading in the longitudinal and transverse directions at the field scale the spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and porosity results in a heterogeneous flow field and thus results in macroscopic dispersion de marsily 1986 fetter 2001 freeze cherry 1979 in numerical models such as feflow diersch 2005 which is also used to predict thermal plumes in a saturated porous medium mechanical dispersion dm m2 s is reproduced using thermal dispersivity Œ≤ m and thermal front velocity vt m s i e dm Œ≤ vt many studies on low enthalpy geothermal applications have indicated that mechanical thermal dispersion can be an important heat transport mechanism in saturated porous media for example sauty et al 1982 investigated hot water storage experiments on single and double wells in the bonnaud confined aquifer in france using two mathematical models and found that mechanical thermal dispersion plays an important role in assessing the recovery efficiency of the stored energy this finding is consistent with a numerical study on the storage of aquifer thermal energy indicating that the energy recovery factor and recovery temperature are most sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity of the storage formation dwyer eckstein 1987 based on the hydrogeological conditions of the study site lo russo and civita 2009 numerically evaluated the feasibility of a gwhp system for a large commercial building near turin italy the simulation results for the five development scenarios indicated that the dimensions and geometry of a thermal plume are sensitive to the thermal dispersivity values park et al 2015a estimated the site thermal dispersivity through a field push pull test and investigated its significance in the design of a gwhp system they concluded that the thermal dispersivity of an aquifer strongly affects the subsurface temperature distribution as well as the arrival time especially at elevated velocities induced by pumping and injection more recently piga et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis considering hydrodynamic thermal and geometrical parameters using long term 50 years simulations for open loop gwhp systems numerical investigations demonstrated that thermal dispersivity considerably affects the assessment of the thermal plume length from a closed loop geothermal perspective molina giraldo et al 2011 examined the dispersion effects on the temperature plumes evolving from borehole heat exchangers using 2 d analytical models for steady state and transient conditions they concluded that mechanical thermal dispersion is a crucial factor in the accurate prediction of thermal plumes for heterogeneous sand and gravel aquifers at a regional scale alcaraz et al 2016 quantified the shallow geothermal potential and related environmental impacts using a gis methodology that considered the advection dispersion and transient thermal state the analysis results suggested that for high darcy fluxes 10 6 m s neglecting the effects of dispersion can overestimate the thermal plume length by up to three times whereas it can lead to the underestimation of the plume length for darcy fluxes of 10 7 to 10 6 m s in the past three years an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the thermal transport of gwhps kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2018 park et al 2018 piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 tu et al 2019 although all these studies considered thermal dispersion effects most of them used the default values given in their numerical models kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2018 tu et al 2019 or the assumed values piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 as thermal dispersivity generally transverse dispersivity is assumed to be one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity alcaraz et al 2016 hopmans et al 2002 kim et al 2018 lo russo et al 2012 lo russo et al 2018 lo russo and civita 2009 molson et al 1992 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 smith and chapman 1983 su et al 2004 tu et al 2019 even in sensitivity analyses for investigating the effect of aquifer properties on thermal plume dimensions lo russo et al 2012 piga et al 2017 the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity was fixed at 10 and transverse dispersivity was calculated from the anisotropy ratio and varying longitudinal dispersivity however using a fixed ratio of 10 could lead to the underestimation or overestimation of transverse dispersion in real aquifers and thus fail to predict the environmental impact of gwhp systems there could be several reasons why the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse thermal dispersivity was assumed first unlike solute dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 it is difficult to directly compare thermal dispersivity values owing to various mathematical descriptions of thermal dispersion coefficients rau et al 2014 this is because over the past few decades there has been disagreement among authors with respect to the description of thermal dispersivity and the relationship between thermal dispersion and flow velocity rau et al 2012a second thermal dispersivity could be insignificant bear 1972 if conduction was dominant over mechanical dispersion as believed under natural groundwater flow conditions molina giraldo et al 2011 and references therein this seems to be evident from the fact that molecular diffusion is of the order of 10 9 m2 s de marsily 1986 whereas thermal diffusivity which describes the influence of conduction is of the order of 10 7 10 6 m2 s domenico schwartz 1998 third there is a lack of information on thermal dispersivity in the literature see stauffer et al 2013 wagner et al 2014 because mechanical thermal dispersion has been ignored or underestimated in previous studies a few studies have conducted field based assessments of thermal dispersivity however they did not estimate transverse thermal dispersivity stauffer et al 2013 wagner et al 2014 therefore the anisotropy ratio of thermal dispersivity under the influence of field conditions remains unknown the anisotropy ratio of 10 likely originates from solute transport see hopmans et al 2002 molson et al 1992 su et al 2004 this assumption of thermal dispersivity ratio is based on the similarity between the transfer of solute and heat de marsily 1986 however solute transfers only in the liquid phase whereas heat transfers in both the solid and liquid phases as a consequence solute and heat propagation can occur in different transport regimes even under the same flow conditions rau et al 2012a recent studies on aquifer macrodispersivity indicate that field scale dispersivity can vary depending on the scale of measurement and aquifer heterogeneity chang yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 the scaling of macroscopic dispersivity with the dissimilar transport of solute and heat could make their dispersivity different even at the same site moreover experimental observations of field scale solute transport do not clarify that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity is 10 de marsily 1986 domenico schwartz 1998 gelhar et al 1992 for example a critical review of solute dispersivity data from 59 different aquifers conducted by gelhar et al 1992 indicated that transverse dispersivity is approximately one third of longitudinal dispersivity of 23 field dispersivity ratio data only two high reliability points showed that longitudinal dispersivity is an order of magnitude higher than transverse dispersivity as gelhar et al 1992 commented it is difficult to justify this anisotropy ratio because the high reliability field data on transverse solute dispersivity are very limited to the best of the authors knowledge transport experiments estimating both the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values have rarely been performed and the influence of the anisotropy ratio on heat transport processes in saturated porous media has not been sufficiently investigated especially for the thermal use of shallow aquifers such as gwhp systems the assumption of the anisotropy ratio of thermal dispersivity could affect the magnitude of transverse dispersion thus affecting the quantification of thermal plumes which is required for assessing managing and regulating an environmental impact of gwhp systems in crowded urban aquifers the objective of this study is to investigate the validity of the general assumption that the ratio of longitudinal to transverse thermal dispersivity is 10 and analyze its impact on predicting thermal plumes in saturated porous media for these purposes we performed heat transport experiments using a laboratory based experimental system initially designed to examine advective dispersive heat transport under a disturbed flow field using injected water according to a previous study park et al 2018 the transport experiments were conducted in saturated porous media at darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 37 47 m d reynolds number re 0 3 first heat transport experiments were performed using an electrical resistor to estimate the thermal properties of porous media quantify the relationship between them and derive the thermal dispersivity ratio then heat transport experiments using injected water were conducted and the observations were used to validate the developed numerical model the validated model was employed to investigate the influence of the dispersivity ratio on the time evolution and geometry of thermal plumes that developed from injection wells in the analysis of anisotropy ratio effects this study also considered the change in the injection rate longitudinal dispersivity and threshold temperature for an isotherm that can affect plume propagation 2 materials and methods heat transport experiments were conducted in this study to verify the assumption of the thermal dispersivity ratio and examine its influence on predicting thermal plumes and they can be divided into electrical resistor and injection tests depending on the type of heat source resistor tests use a small electrical resistor as a point heat source and transfer only heat into a porous medium whereas injection tests inject warm water heat and mass as a point heat source thus disturbing the background flow and temperature fields as gwhp systems do first resistor tests were performed without background water flow and in this case heat propagated in a porous medium only by conduction the temperature time series data observed around the electrical resistor were analyzed using an analytical model for thermal diffusion and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the bulk volume were estimated then resistor tests were conducted at various background flow velocities see fig 1 a and in this case heat transferred in a porous medium by conduction advection and dispersion the observed temperature data were interpreted using an analytical model for advective dispersive heat transport the analysis results were used to determine the thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity whose relationship was quantified using a regression model to estimate the magnitude and ratio of thermal dispersivity second injection tests were conducted with various background flow velocities and the obtained temperature time series data were used to validate a numerical model developed to reproduce transient flow and transient heat transport by injected water the validated model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis where longitudinal dispersivity was fixed and transverse dispersivity was calculated using variable dispersivity ratios from 1 to 10 2 1 heat transport experiments 2 1 1 experimental design the experimental system used in this study was initially designed to examine the mechanical thermal dispersion behavior under flow conditions disturbed by warm water injection park et al 2018 and consisted of an acrylic glass tank two heat sources and a data acquisition daq system fig 1 the outer dimensions of the rectangular tank were 1 3 m 0 6 m 0 8 m l w h and its wall thickness was 15 mm the tank was divided into three parts the middle chamber was 1 m long and filled with saturated sand the two chambers on the sides were 0 13 m long and operated as constant hydraulic head tanks by adjusting the water levels in the side chambers and thus the hydraulic gradients between them the background water flow velocities passing through the porous media could be changed after the completion of the experimental setup the sand tank was thermally insulated with multiple layers of insulation sheets 4 mm thickness containing sealed air bubbles two different heat sources an electrical resistor and warm water were used in the heat transport experiments a small wire wound resistor 7 mm in diameter resistance of 47 œâ and power rating of 5 w was waterproofed with teflon tape mounted on an acrylic tube 8 mm in diameter and 0 7 m in height and installed at a height of 0 3 m see fig 1 a laboratory dc power supply ac input 220 v dc output 0 30 v applied a constant voltage to the resistor enabling it to act as a constant heat source as shown in fig 1a a peristaltic pump minipuls 3 gilson usa transferred warm water from a thermostatic barrel through a pvc tube to the injection well with an internal diameter of 14 mm and a height of 0 7 m the well had a screened section ranging from 0 29 to 0 31 m in height which allowed the injected water to propagate radially from the injection point at a height of 0 3 m the daq system comprises temperature sensors pt100 hayashi denko japan analog input modules ni 9217 national instruments usa compact daq chassis cdaq 9178 national instruments usa and daq software daqmx and labview 2015 a detailed description of the daq system was provided by park 2019 of the 32 resistance temperature detectors rtds 29 were installed in saturated porous media and the remaining were employed to measure the temperatures of air warm water and background water fig 1 after the installation of the sensors and heat sources sand was carefully sprinkled from a few centimeters above the water table and compacted by manual compression among the various methods for packing porous media the wet packing technique was used for this study because the laboratory experiments required a saturated initial state and wet packing in thin layers can provide much denser and more uniform packing than dry packing oliviera et al 1996 after the middle chamber was filled with saturated sand the rtd sensors were connected to a laptop computer via ni modules and chassis and were controlled to sample and log the temperature every 0 1 s using the labview program 2 1 2 physical properties and uncertainties the uncertainty analysis is presented in appendix a grain size analysis of 30 samples was conducted using a series of sieves to confirm the average diameter and uniformity of the two different sands see fig 2 a the mean grain size d50 was estimated to be 0 52 mm 0 5 for sand n5 and 0 76 mm 1 3 for sand n4 which are within the range of coarse sand friedman sanders 1978 but smaller than those used in previous studies metzger et al 2004 park et al 2018 rau et al 2012a the uniformity value u was 1 41 0 8 and 1 50 1 7 for sand n5 and n4 indicating well sorted materials in this study we did not differentiate between the total porosity n and kinematic or effective porosity ne the total porosities of coarse sands n5 and n4 were estimated using two different methods first the porosities of sands n5 and n4 were determined to be 0 331 3 4 and 0 360 0 7 respectively by measuring the moisture content six times with two soil moisture sensors 5te decagon usa which were installed at a height of 45 cm in the experimental setup see fig 1 the porosity values of sands n5 and n4 were determined to be 0 377 0 2 and 0 374 0 2 respectively by measuring the dry sand volume and the bulk volume of 50 and 51 samples using a mass cylinder and burette laboratory x ray diffraction xrd analyses of the sand samples were also performed to quantify the proportion of different minerals present in the samples and the results indicated a quartz content of 68 3 for sand n5 and 75 6 for sand n4 as shown in fig 2b a simple linear regression method was used to investigate the relationship between the darcy flux or specific discharge and the hydraulic gradient measured in the sand tank experiments using regression models the hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 2 039 10 3 m s 2 2 for sand n5 and 3 228 10 3 m s 0 9 for sand n4 2 1 3 experimental conditions for tracer tests under no flow condition electrical resistor experiments were conducted seven times to estimate the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the coarse sands n5 and n4 see table 1 a constant power of 4 230 w or 4 517 w was applied to the resistor and the temporal variation in temperature was measured using 29 rtd sensors around the heat source a total of 44 heat transport experiments using the resistor were also performed at various background flow velocities between 4 74 and 12 32 m d for sand n5 and between 8 13 and 36 75 m d for sand n4 as it takes longer to reach a steady state at a slower flow velocity the power applied to the resistor was adjusted to the 3 426 4 517 w range as a result of the heat transport experiments the temperature of the saturated sand in the middle chamber was perturbed or increased such spatial differences in temperature can cause additional heat fluxes and violate the initial equilibrium state of the analytical models before the experiments were conducted tap water having a nearly constant temperature was kept flowing through the sand tank for several hours till the perturbed temperature of the porous media was restored to the temperature of the background water heat transport experiments using warm water as a tracer were performed at four different darcy fluxes of 11 93 21 21 29 47 and 37 47 m d for sand n4 the flow rate of the peristaltic pump varied with the rotational speed of the pump after repeated measurements at different rotational speeds an injection rate of 50 ml min was used as the base value and additional injection rates of 26 and 75 ml min were employed in the experiments several critical temperatures have been proposed in the literature to avoid the effects of variable density and viscosity of fluid e g 10 c in leaf et al 2012 15 c in ma and zheng 2010 8 c in ma et al 2012 and 3 c in rau et al 2012a in our study the temperature difference between the injected water and background water was limited by a threshold value of 5 c to prevent free convection the temperature changes monitored at the injection point were not identical in all the experiments but remained below 3 c in most experiments 2 1 4 analytical models for point heat source the conductive and convective propagation of heat in a saturated porous medium can be described by the following

elements Œ¥x Œ¥y 0 002 m see fig 3a the initial time step was set to 10 9 d with a maximum time step of 10 4 d the spatial and temporal discretization used in our study was determined in a previous study park et al 2018 using transient simulations where the grid spacing and time step were changed based on the grid peclet and courant numbers daus et al 1985 until the modeling results were not affected by the discretization fig 3b and c illustrate the location of the injection well and the temperature sensors and the boundary conditions bcs of the numerical model the initial hydraulic head was set to 0 6 m across the entire model domain the head distribution was calculated by performing steady state simulations where the observed water levels were reflected on both sides of the model domain as constant head bcs the hydraulic gradient ranged from 0 041 to 0 118 depending on the experimental conditions the calculated hydraulic heads were used as the initial conditions for the subsequent transient simulations the initial temperature for the entire domain was set to be equal to the background water temperature observed prior to the injection tests the background water temperature was also employed as a constant bc on the left boundary of the model into which the background water flowed the injection of warm water was represented by two bcs at the injection point that is the average injection rate and injection temperature measured in the experiments see fig 3 the developed model was then validated by performing transient flow and transport simulations and comparing the results with the temperature time series data observed from the injection experiments heat transport modeling using the validated model was performed using dispersivity ratios of 1 to 10 the case simulations also considered the dispersivity ratios calculated in this study and previous studies 3 70 in rau et al 2012a and 3 00 in saeid et al 2014 background flow velocities and injection rates in the numerical modeling the density and viscosity of the fluid were assumed to be constant because the temperature change in all the experiments remained within 5 c see leaf et al 2012 ma zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 rau et al 2012a the hydrogeological and thermal parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 2 3 thermal parameter estimation as described in section 2 1 4 the resistor experiments were analyzed by fitting the thermal breakthrough curves of the analytical models in eqs 9 and 11 into the observed temperature data the quality of the fitting in the analytical modeling results was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse given as 14 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 where mi and si are the measured and simulated values respectively from the best fitted cps and mcps models which minimized the rmse value three thermal properties and thermal front velocities were estimated this criterion was also applied to validate the numerical model the quality of the models for different experimental conditions was compared using the normalized rmse nrmse which is expressed as 15 nrmse r m s e t max t min where tmax and tmin are the maximum and minimum temperatures of each temperature time series data respectively the analysis procedure for the parameters was repeated in matlab until the estimated values varied within 0 1 a detailed description can be found in park et al 2018 because the feflow program is based on the linear dispersion model of eq 13 the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities evaluated by the mcps model was analyzed using a linear regression method the thermal dispersivity values in the longitudinal and transverse directions were derived from the regression equation that best represented their relationship the anisotropy ratio of the longitudinal to transverse dispersivity can be calculated using the following formula 16 Œ≥ Œ≤ l Œ≤ t a thermal plume or thermally affected zone is defined as an isotherm satisfying a specific temperature criterion e g Œ¥t 1 c in this study see lo russo et al 2012 molina giraldo et al 2011 piga et al 2017 thermal plume dimensions indicate the extent or size of thermal plumes that are quantitatively represented by the plume length and width lo russo et al 2012 piga et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 the plume length of lo russo et al 2012 was subdivided into plume length l1 indicating upstream propagation and plume length l2 representing downstream propagation the plume length l2 corresponded to the plume length of piga et al 2017 the plume width was defined as the maximum plume extent in the direction transverse to the background water flow piga et al 2017 3 results 3 1 analytical modeling for electrical resistor tests electrical resistor experiments conducted without background flow were analyzed using the cps model to estimate the bulk thermal conductivity and bulk volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous media figure s1 illustrates the temperature time series data observed at the center and off center locations along with the best fitted cps model results as shown in figure s1 the analytical modeling results were in good agreement with the observed temperature data rmse 0 007 and nrmse 0 010 the thermal properties of the saturated sands and corrected sensor locations were determined from the best fit satisfying the minimum rmse all the experiments were repeatedly performed and analyzed and the average values of the estimates are shown in table 3 as the best estimates for sand n4 for which the experiments were performed five times the relative uncertainty of the best estimates was also expressed in parentheses as a percentage the solid thermal properties were derived from the arithmetic and geometric mean models in eqs 3 and 5 with average porosities of 0 377 sand n5 and 0 374 sand n4 as estimated from the sand samples the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of solids for sand n5 were estimated to be 3 826 w m k and 1 890 106 j m3 k respectively and those for sand n4 were 3 845 w m k and 1 970 106 j m3 k respectively as can be seen in table 3 the thermal conductivity values 3 271 4 451 w m k estimated for the two sands were high cf 1 5 4 0 w m k in stauffer et al 2013 2 5 3 5 w m k in de marsily 1986 also see jury horton 2004 therefore laboratory xrd analyses of the sand samples were conducted to confirm their chemical compositions the results indicated a high quartz content of 75 6 sand n4 and 68 3 sand n5 based on the quartz contents and the reference values for dry sand and quartz balland arp 2005 stauffer et al 2013 the likely range of thermal conductivity was calculated from the geometric mean model in eq 5 as shown in figure s2 the values estimated from the heat transport experiments for both sands were within the calculated possible range for thermal conductivity indicating that the high thermal conductivity value may have originated from the high quartz content the electrical resistor experiments conducted at various background flow velocities darcy fluxes of 4 74 to 36 75 m d were analyzed using the mcps model to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities figure s3 illustrates observed temperature time series data and their best fitted mcps models for three observation points r 0 048 0 096 and 0 139 m at darcy fluxes of 10 44 and 35 85 m d compared with the example in figure s3a with the smallest nrmse figure s3b which has the largest nrmse shows a difference between the observed and modeled temperatures especially at the beginning of the plateau however the analytical models successfully reproduced the observed temperature breakthrough curves in that the r2 values were 0 9970 or higher for all the experiments figures 5 and 6 show the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities estimated for sand n5 and n4 respectively as shown in fig 5 it was observed for sand n5 that the thermal dispersion coefficients increased in the longitudinal direction but decreased in the transverse direction although heat transport experiments for sand n4 were also performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 7 it was observed that both the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersion coefficients increased with the flow velocity fig 6 to quantitatively express the relationship between thermal dispersion coefficients and flow velocities and to derive thermal dispersivity values a simple linear regression method was applied the linear regression equation for sand n5 did not show a clear tendency r2 0 3 whereas that for sand n4 showed a distinct increasing trend with r2 values of 0 7890 and 0 7593 in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively see black solid lines in figs 5 and 6 from the regression models the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values for sand n4 were estimated to be 2 278 10 3 m 5 2 and 1 533 10 3 m 5 6 respectively table 2 however there was a scatter in the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities which made it difficult to determine their relationship and derive thermal dispersivity values especially for sand n5 this is discussed in section 4 1 3 2 steady state and transient simulations for injection tests heat transport experiments using warm water as a heat source were performed to validate the 3 d numerical model and to investigate the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio in predicting thermal plumes from gwhp systems figure s4 represents the temperature time series for the data from both the injection tests and the numerical model at r 0 1390 m with darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d despite the deviation at the beginning and end of the temperature breakthrough curves it was found that the model successfully reproduced the observed data in terms of r2 0 9905 fig 7 shows the thermal plume dimensions for steady state simulations conducted with various thermal dispersivity ratios at two different darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d it is clear that the length and width of the thermal plume increased with the thermal dispersivity ratio in addition the change in the plume dimensions increased as the background flow velocity increased the gray isotherms in fig 7a represent the projection of the isotherms in fig 7b which were observed at a faster background flow the effect of dispersivity ratio on the plume dimensions was compared for different background flow velocities see fig 7a as the background flow velocity increased the thermal plume width decreased but the thermal plume length increased or decreased depending on the thermal dispersivity ratio based on the transient flow and transient transport simulations fig 8 displays the temporal variation of the thermal plume lengths with different thermal dispersivity ratios ranging from 1 to 10 at a darcy flux of 29 47 m d notably it was difficult to identify the difference in the thermal plume length l1 calculated from the isotherm of Œ¥t 1 c because the plume length l1 can be used as a spatial restriction to avoid thermal interference between the pumping and injection wells and ensure system efficiency e g the spacing between pumping and injection wells should exceed the plume length l1 a more stringent criterion of Œ¥t 0 1 c was applied to calculate the plume length l1 as shown in fig 8 the thermal dispersivity ratio affected the thermal plume lengths l1 and l2 however its influence varied with space and time the effect of the thermal dispersivity ratio was stronger in the downstream direction than in the upstream direction and stronger in the steady state than in the transient state fig 9 illustrates the temporal variation in thermal plume widths having different thermal dispersivity ratios at two darcy fluxes of 11 93 and 29 47 m d it was confirmed that thermal dispersivity ratio also affected the thermal plume dimension perpendicular to the background flow direction especially in the steady state however its influence on the plume width was much weaker than that on the plume length l2 as the background flow velocity increased the thermal plume width decreased noticeably but the effect of the dispersivity ratio increased only marginally fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 thermal dispersion and flow velocity relationship the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities represented a distinct increasing trend for sand n4 but there was no clear trend for sand n5 as shown in figs 5 and 6 the scatter made it difficult to quantify the dispersion velocity relationship r2 0 3 especially for low flow velocities pet 0 3 this has also been observed in previous studies kunii smith 1961 park et al 2018 rau et al 2012a yagi et al 1960 yuan et al 1991 there are several reasons for this scatter the first reason could be attributed to the transport regime although the hydraulic gradient between the chambers on the side was kept as high as possible fig 1a it was found that all the experiments were performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 2 for sand n5 and pet 0 7 for sand n4 in the thermal regime represented by a very low pet 0 3 the thermal diffusivity first term in eq 13 was up to 89 of the longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient and up to 8 1 times higher than the mechanical dispersion figure s5 thus the dominance of conductive heat transport rendered the contribution of the background flow to the dispersion coefficient insignificant for q 1 50 10 4 m s this partly explains the difficulty in indentifying the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities for sand n5 r2 0 3 see fig 5 for which all the experiments were performed under very slow flow conditions pet 0 2 figure s6 shows the variation in the thermal front velocity estimated from the three observation points as the background flow increased for q 1 50 10 4 m s the velocity difference among the rtd sensors was less than 13 and 11 for sand n5 and n4 respectively compared to the respective maximum velocities this difference in the thermal front velocity can change the longitudinal dispersion coefficient up to 4 but cannot account for the scatter in the dispersion coefficient as listed in table 3 the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of coarse sands n5 and n4 varied between the observation points indicating the spatial heterogeneity of the thermal properties the thermal diffusivity first term in eq 13 calculated from the bulk thermal properties varied up to 13 among rtd15 rtd20 and rtd25 and this can affect the dispersion coefficient in the longitudinal direction by up to 11 and 10 for sand n5 and n4 respectively considering the variation in the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of 5 to 21 sand n5 and 4 to 19 sand n4 the heterogeneity of the thermal properties could be the main reason for the scatter in the dispersion velocity relationship especially for low flow velocities these explanations clarify the interpretation by park et al 2018 for heat tracer tests in a saturated porous medium having homogeneous but different grain size distributions u 1 36 d 50 1 28 mm and low flow pet 1 which is partly supported by the fact that a more pronounced trend was observed with higher r2 values when the relationship was analyzed by each observation point see fig 6 for q 1 50 10 4 m s or 12 96 m d where thermal diffusion and mechanical dispersion are comparable the spatial variability of thermal properties alone cannot explain why the deviation among thermal dispersion coefficients increased with increasing background flow velocities see fig 6 as shown in figure s6b the difference in the thermal front velocity increases at a single location as well as among the different observation points this result indicates that the velocity field may not be homogeneous rau et al 2012b experimentally demonstrated that a non uniform flow field can occur even in a small scale experiment 0 96 m 0 96 m 0 4 m using homogeneous natural materials u 1 68 and d 50 2 mm under a transition regime pet 0 7 this flow field makes heat transport inhomogeneous in the flow direction resulting in lateral temperature gradients that are further enhanced with increasing flow velocity see rau et al 2012b this can be a possible explanation for the spatial temperature variability found in the complex shallow aquifer located near the han river south korea which shows a heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity kaown et al 2018 in recent years numerical studies at the streambed scale have shown that lateral heat transport can significantly affect temperature based specific discharge estimation ferguson bense 2011 schornberg et al 2010 as rau et al 2012b further commented the flow field non uniformity and lateral heat conduction stemming from the small scale heterogeneity of permeability can violate the underlying assumptions of the uniform flow field and plume fringe of the mcps model and this can lead to the scatter in the dispersion velocity relationship especially for q 1 50 10 4 m s fig 6 the above results show that the small scale heterogeneity of thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity can affect the dispersion velocity relationship even though the heat transport experiments in this study were performed at the sub meter scale using homogeneous materials u 1 50 notably both parameters are governed by soil texture and fabric hence in field conditions that are likely to be more heterogeneous these effects can be stronger even at low flow rates further research is required to reveal the influence of material texture on the thermal dispersion coefficients 4 2 anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity as shown in fig 6 the thermal dispersivity values estimated using the linear dispersion model in eq 13 represent thermal dispersivity ratios of 1 33 to 1 73 this range includes the values of 1 48 to 1 58 assessed in a previous study park et al 2018 which was performed with bigger and more homogeneous coarse sands d50 1 28 mm and u 1 36 this provides experimental evidence that the dispersivity ratio differs from the general assumption of 10 we also calculated the ratios from other studies cf Œ≥ 3 70 with d50 2 mm and u 1 68 in rau et al 2012a Œ≥ 3 00 with d50 0 13 mm and u 1 64 in saeid et al 2014 and compared them with ratios obtained from our study it was difficult to find any trends among the properties Œ≥ d50 and u due to the lack of available data for the calculation of the anisotropy ratio 4 3 effects of dispersivity ratio on plume propagation as shown in fig 7 a decrease in the thermal dispersivity ratio leads to a decrease in the thermal plume dimension this is relevant to the influence of transverse thermal dispersion on thermal plume propagation under steady state conditions transverse dispersion is dominant over longitudinal dispersion alcaraz et al 2016 metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 the decrease in the dispersivity ratio indicates an increase in the transverse dispersivity and therefore reinforces heat dissipation in the transverse direction to the background flow reducing the dimension of the thermal plume hence the modeling results for the general value of 10 can overestimate the thermal plume extension under steady state conditions in comparison to the dispersivity ratios estimated from the heat transport experiments fig 7 groundwater flow is controlled by the hydrodynamic parameters of a numerical model and has a significant influence on the thermal plume propagation in the longitudinal and transverse directions lo russo et al 2012 a recent study also confirmed that a higher groundwater flow velocity causes an increase in plume length but a decrease in plume width piga et al 2017 as shown in fig 7a the thermal plume length l2 did not always increase for all the dispersivity ratios notably the plume length l2 decreased with increasing background flow velocity when the dispersivity ratio was less than 5 a possible explanation is that a sufficiently small dispersivity ratio causes the transverse dispersion to prevail over the other transport processes although an increase in the background flow velocity leads to an increase in both advection and mechanical dispersion therefore the enhanced heat spreading in the transverse direction resulted in a shorter plume length as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the impacts of the thermal dispersivity ratio on thermal plumes can vary depending on the thermal state transient or steady state of the system for early transient times the thermal plume dimensions varied slightly with the dispersivity ratio when approaching the steady state condition the difference in the plume extensions dramatically increased especially in plume length l2 fig 8b this is attributed to the fact that the importance of longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values is time dependent as demonstrated by the relative sensitivities obtained as a function of time metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 therefore using a fixed value of 10 as the thermal dispersivity ratio can lead to an overestimation of the longitudinal and transverse propagation of thermal plumes especially in long term simulations which are vital for reducing thermal risks and ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of shallow geothermal systems figures 8 and 9 also show that the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio is not homogeneous this can be related to the heterogeneous velocity field caused by the injected water and the background flow in a real system heterogeneous thermal properties and non uniform flow fields can affect the temperature distribution and hence can complicate the spatially variable effect of the dispersivity ratio as depicted in figs 8 and 9 the effect is minimal in the upstream direction and maximum in the downstream propagation of thermal plumes this suggests that the thermal dispersivity ratio plays an important role in assessing the environmental impacts of the thermal use of shallow aquifers which can impair the sustainable use of groundwater in downstream regions such as water for drinking and for space heating and cooling the injected water in gwhp systems increases the flow velocity and thus makes mechanical thermal dispersion critical in the heat transport mechanism park et al 2015a park et al 2018 to investigate the influence of injection on the significance of the thermal dispersivity ratio numerical simulations were conducted using different injection rates of 26 to 75 ml min fig 10 shows that the plume length l1 and the plume width increased with injection rates which corresponds with a previous study piga et al 2017 but the effect of the dispersivity ratio hardly changed and was small enough to be discarded less than 6 change however as shown in fig 10b the dispersivity ratio can have a greater influence on the plume length l2 in case of higher injection rates indicating that it can play an important role in assessing the environmental impacts of large scale gwhp systems notably the relative importance of the ratio can vary with the assessment time because injection retards reaching steady state conditions see red dashed lines in fig 10b previous studies lo russo et al 2012 molina giraldo et al 2011 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 used a fixed dispersivity ratio in their sensitivity analysis resulting in difficulty in determining the independent effect of longitudinal dispersivity alone fig 11 shows the results of the simulations in which the longitudinal dispersivity was changed with respect to the fixed transverse dispersivity hence its effect can be investigated independently fig 11a shows that the longitudinal dispersivity increased the plume length l1 indicating that it can affect the thermal interference between pumping and injection wells and thus the efficiency of the gwhp systems as can be seen in fig 11b and c in contrast to the transverse dispersivity the longitudinal dispersivity is important under transient conditions which is consistent with recent studies on vertical gshp systems alcaraz et al 2016 molina giraldo et al 2011 notably the longitudinal dispersivity increased the upstream propagation of the thermal plumes whereas it decreased the plume length l2 and plume width fig 11 this result is different from those of previous studies that used a fixed dispersivity ratio of 10 for example such a decrease in the plume dimensions was not observed in short term 60 days simulations lo russo et al 2012 although analytical modeling for the steady state showed that the plume length decreased with increasing dispersivity this was attributed to the transverse thermal dispersivity molina giraldo et al 2011 a possible explanation is that under steady state conditions the transverse dispersion dominates over the longitudinal dispersion metzger et al 2004 molina giraldo et al 2011 even though the latter also contributes to energy dissipation the assessment of thermal plume dimensions is based on isotherms calculated from a temperature threshold which represents the temperature difference between the plume and ambient water for instance some authors have used 1 k as a threshold value alcaraz et al 2016 lo russo et al 2012 piga et al 2017 whereas others have used 0 1 k molina giraldo et al 2011 an arbitrary threshold can influence the prediction of thermal plume propagation in this regard thermal plume length l2 was re evaluated for steady state simulations with different threshold values ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 k see fig 12 and figure s7 as the temperature threshold decreased the thermal plume length l2 exponentially increased and the effect of the dispersivity ratio also increased fig 12 this change in the plume length suggests that the temperature threshold can also affect the thermal state as the injection rate does if the threshold value is smaller the time required to reach the steady state is longer therefore the use of an arbitrary threshold may lead to the underestimation or overestimation of thermal impacts from the thermal use of shallow aquifers which is significant for the management and regulation of groundwater resources notably continuous heat sources were used in this study if the actual thermal load of buildings which is transient in time is considered in the analysis the change in plume dimensions can be more complicated because of plume separation see piga et al 2017 the thermal dispersivities obtained in this study were very small Œ≤ 1 106 2 547 mm over tens of centimeters because the transport experiments were performed at the sub meter scale using homogeneous materials u 1 5 field application systems such as gwhp systems however have a much larger radius of thermal influence than laboratory experiments see park et al 2018 and real aquifers are more heterogeneous than the sands used in this study sauty et al 1982 inferred from thermal experiments at the bonnaud site in france that the dispersivity on the field scale increases asymptotically with the transfer distance and aquifer heterogeneity their observation is in agreement with recent findings on the scaling of aquifer macrodispersivity chang yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 therefore the thermal dispersivities of gwhp systems can be several orders of magnitude higher than those at the laboratory scale see molina giraldo et al 2011 stauffer et al 2013 in this context the effect of the anisotropy ratio Œ≥ at the field scale was investigated using an upscaled model based on previous field studies park et al 2015a park et al 2015b as depicted in fig 13 the impact of the dispersivity ratio on the plume length l2 increased significantly from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens to hundreds of meters on the field scale despite a slow local groundwater flow velocity of q 3 64 m d cf q 11 93 and 29 47 m d in fig 7 it is noted that the dispersivity Œ≤l 0 4 m and injection rates q 25 and 50 m3 d used in the upscaled model were still small cf Œ≤l 0 1 100 m in wagner et al 2014 q 1 800 8 000 m3 d in al zyoud et al 2014 suggesting that the influence of the thermal dispersivity ratio can be greater in predicting thermal plumes for long term sustainability of large scale gwhp systems however as shown in fig 13b these results can be affected by technical operating parameters such as system capacity operating time and transient and imbalanced heat loads therefore further field based studies are required in recent years many studies have demonstrated that mechanical thermal dispersion is significant for the thermal use of shallow aquifers alcaraz et al 2016 lo russo civita 2009 park et al 2015a park et al 2015b piga et al 2017 pophillat et al 2020 however most of these studies used a generally assumed value of 10 as the anisotropy ratio for thermal dispersivity to the best of our knowledge the accuracy of such an assumption and its influence have not been investigated especially for the thermal use of shallow aquifers the experimental relationships between the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities indicated that the assumption can be violated numerical simulations for steady state and transient conditions indicated that the effect of the dispersivity ratio was strongest on the downstream propagation of thermal plumes under steady state conditions and increased with injection rates moreover this influence may be greater at the field scale depending on the scale of measurements and the degree of heterogeneity chang yeh 2012 sauty et al 1982 zech et al 2015 this suggests that dispersivity ratio can play a crucial role in assessing the environmental impacts of aquifer thermal use especially for large scale facilities this has significant implications for predicting managing and regulating thermal plumes because the potential thermal risk from neighboring facilities is rapidly increasing with the growing use of shallow geothermal energy pophillat et al 2020 also see bayer et al 2012 therefore the anisotropy ratio of longitudinal to transverse dispersivity should be evaluated and reflected for the efficient and sustainable use of shallow aquifers 5 conclusions in this study we experimentally and numerically investigated the validity of the general assumption that the transverse dispersivity is one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity the dispersion velocity relationship eq 13 for homogeneous coarse sand u 1 50 and d50 0 76 mm indicated that the anisotropy ratio for thermal dispersivity Œ≥ 1 3 1 7 could be different from the generally assumed value of 10 fig 6 transient simulations showed that the effect of the dispersivity ratio varied spatiotemporally figs 8 and 9 the anisotropy ratio had a significant influence on the downstream propagation of thermal plumes under steady state conditions and its effect increased with the injection rate this suggests that dispersivity ratio can play a crucial role in the environmental impact assessment of aquifer thermal use especially for long term operations of large scale facilities importantly incorrect assumptions about the dispersivity ratio can lead to the overestimation or underestimation of thermal propagation limiting the shallow geothermal potential due to over regulation or thermal interference therefore it is necessary to evaluate and reflect the magnitude and ratio of dispersivity at the design stage the results of this study can contribute to a more accurate prediction of thermal plumes and thus help to manage and regulate the thermal risks related to the utilization of low enthalpy geothermal resources this can have significant implications for the sustainable use of shallow aquifers in that the conflict with neighboring facilities will grow as the installation of shallow

intensification can have significant often adverse effects of soil physical health houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 hu et al 2021 this includes various soil hydraulic properties shp that regulate hydrological processes such as drainage nitrate leaching and runoff of sediments and contaminants jarvis et al 2013 ostad ali askari et al 2019 price et al 2010 soil hydraulic properties including both soil water storage properties swsp and hydraulic conductivity k are key parameters in many hydrologic climate land surface and crop models brisson et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 consequently they represent essential data in most global and national soil information systems and are often derived from predictive models that use readily available soil survey data such as soil texture soil structure and soil organic carbon soc content as pedo transfer functions arrouays et al 2014 mcneill et al 2018 effects of land use and agricultural intensification associated with cultivation and livestock treading on shp have been extensively investigated e g drewry et al 2008 glab 2014 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 hu et al 2009 jarvis et al 2013 for example intensive use of pasture and cropland soils is commonly reported to decrease k or infiltration rate bagarello et al 2010 bodhinayake and si 2004 bormann and klaassen 2008 germer et al 2010 jarvis et al 2013 price et al 2010 and soil water holding capacity owuor et al 2018 price et al 2010 relative to native grassland and forest dairy pasture soils typically have lower saturated hydraulic conductivity k0 and available water capacity awc than sheep grazed pastures owing to greater soil compaction from treading drewry et al 2004 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 reported that differences in awc in the top 30 cm between dairy and sheep pasture soils were greater under irrigation than without irrigation houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 a recent review showed that more intensive land uses e g grazing and cropping consistently result in more serious deterioration of shp including reduced macroporosity …õmac and k0 however previous studies on the effects of land use and intensification on shp have mainly focused on a single soil type drewry et al 2021 glab 2014 hu et al 2009 kabir et al 2020 kodesova et al 2011 and the effects of land use effects are often not consistent for example the k of grazed grassland can be higher bormann and klaassen 2008 kabir et al 2020 or lower kelishadi et al 2014 than cultivated land and the available water content awc of irrigated pastures can be higher drewry et al 2021 rickard and cossens 1966 rickard and cossens 1968 lower houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 or not different mesman 2014 to that of dryland pastures these results indicate that the land use effects on shp may depend on soil type which is an important knowledge gap among the most common shp awc and its components e g readily available water content rawc and non readily available water content nrawc are of great importance due to their controls on water uptake and evapotranspiration drewry et al 2008 reynolds et al 2009 the rawc and nrawc are defined as the differences between field capacity fc and the stress point also termed refill point and between the stress point and permanent wilting point pwp respectively however the criteria for determining fc in soil physics laboratories is typically independent of soil type instead fc œà f c is determined on soil cores using a single soil matric potential smp varying between 5 10 and 33 kpa minasny and mcbratney 2018 under field conditions fc has been defined as the water content of a soil that was saturated and allowed to drain until further drainage is negligible i e 0 01 1 mm day 1 assouline and or 2014 an alternative recently proposed method uses dynamic criteria to estimate œà f c based on each soil s individual soil water release curve assouline and or 2014 according to assouline and or 2014 drainage is negligible when soil water is maintained at fc because of a loss of hydraulic continuity this difference in the operational definition of fc also has important consequences for the determination of awc and rawc potentially leading to different conclusions regarding the effect of land use on swsp the impact of soil texture on œà fc has been explored and coarser soils tend to have higher œà f c values assouline and or 2014 however we don t know how land use affects the dynamic criteria for fc and how those criteria affect the response of swsp to differences in land use soil organic carbon is an important component of soil that affects structure bronick and lal 2005 the effect of soc on swsp and k has been much studied but there is still no consensus on the direction e g positive or negative or magnitude of the effect of soc on shp for example the effect of soc on awc has been reported as either positive hudson 1994 rawls et al 2003 or neutral eden et al 2017 and as either small minasny and mcbratney 2018 or very large hudson 1994 likewise increases in soc have been shown to increase owuor et al 2018 decrease jarvis et al 2013 wang et al 2009 or have no significant effect moragues saitua et al 2017 on k0 nevertheless soc is often included into pedotransfer function ptf models that underpin soil information systems to estimate variables in the van genuchten model e g k0 saturated and residual water content vereecken et al 1989 wosten et al 1999 or to directly predict swsp e g fc awc and pwp and k jorda et al 2015 rawls et al 2003 however improvement in shp predictions as a result of inclusion of soc in the ptf has met with variable success for example some studies have reported that soc significantly improve the prediction of water retention at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa saxton and rawls 2006 whereas others have found little improvement in the same parameters lal 1978 or only at specific smps rawls et al 2003 the inconsistent effects of soc on k are reflected in the small number of commonly used ptfs that explicitly include soc zhang et al 2020 the inconsistent role of soc in shp may imply that soc affects swsp and k only under a specific range of smp e g equivalent to different porosity combinations however the smps at which shp are most affected by soc is an important knowledge gap that needs to be understood to advance the application of ptfs in soil information systems there is some evidence from x ray ct scanning that shows a positive relationship between soc and micropore 15 Œºm volume in native grasslands ananyeva et al 2013 therefore it is expected that soc may play a more important role in soil water storage in micropores to date soc has not been included in national ptfs for new zealand mcneill et al 2018 partly due to the unconfirmed relationship between soc and shp therefore we need to confirm if soc affects shp and determine the critical range of smps at which shp are most affected by soc furthermore the effects of land use have generally not been considered in ptfs both in the new zealand mcneill et al 2018 and internationally zhang et al 2020 the objectives of our study were to a determine how long term 20 years land use interacts with soil type to affect shp using a regional study across the canterbury plains new zealand b quantify the role of soc in contributing to variability in shp and c investigate the potential of soc and categorical variables including land use to improve the prediction of shp 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description and field sampling a soil sampling campaign that targeted three common agricultural soils with contrasting drainage level was carried out across the canterbury plains new zealand fig 1 which has a warm temperate oceanic climate mean annual temperature of 11 13 mean annual rainfall of 600 650 mm three soils sampled were well drained lismore lis stony silt loam moderately well drained templeton tem silt loam and poorly drained waterton temuka wat clay loam they belong to brown pallic and gley soil orders respectively based on the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 their usda equivalents are typic dystrudept udic haplustept and mollic endoaquept smith 2014 respectively the sampled sites consisted of three long term 20 years land uses irrigated cropping ic irrigated pasture ip and dryland pasture dp the ic sites were selected to represent typical irrigated arable cropping rotations of the canterbury plains which include wheat triticum aestivum l barley hordeum vulgare l peas pisum sativum l potatoes solanum tuberosum l and herbage seed crops established with a mix of spring and autumn tillage inversion and non inversion practices to a maximum depth of 20 cm the ip sites were selected to represent high production irrigated perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l white clover trifolium repens l pastures used for dairy grazing irrigation of pasture typically extends between spring and autumn to meet the soil water requirements of high production swards the dp sites were selected to represent continuous drystock sheep and beef grazed pastures composed of perennial ryegrass white clover tall fescue festuca arundinacea sch phalaris phalaris aquatica l cocksfoot dactylis glomerata l and other common dryland pasture species each land use was represented by a total of 9 9 and 12 sites on the lis wat and tem soils respectively the majority of sites n 69 were sampled in autumn march may 2018 and a further 21 pasture sites were sampled in spring september october 2018 all of the ic sites were sampled after crop harvest and before cultivation for subsequent crops soil samples were collected for measuring k and swrc at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 15 30 cm depths at each site samples were collected from within a 2 2 m2 area in the centre of each field site to minimise the spatial variability and edge effects two sets of samples were collected at each soil depth one set of intact cores for determination of soil hydraulic properties shp and a second set of disturbed samples for the determination of other soil physical and chemical properties intact soil cores 10 cm diameter were collected at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 18 25 5 cm depths for the measurement of hydraulic conductivity k adjacent smaller intact soil cores 5 cm diameter were collected at 2 5 9 12 and 20 23 cm depths for the determination of soil water release curves swrc from which soil water storage properties swsp were obtained note that different sizes of intact cores were collected for k and swrc measurements while both were sampled from the center of their representative depths separate disturbed samples were collected by soil cores for measuring water stable aggregate distribution soil texture and soc the disturbed samples were returned to the laboratory where any surface grass or crop residues were gently removed and the samples were stored field moist at 4 c prior to processing soils were sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and coarse plant residues and air dried at 25 c before measuring soil properties 2 2 measurement and calculation 2 2 1 soil water release curves soil water release curves were derived from measurements of soil water contents at soil matric potentials smps œà of 0 4 0 7 1 5 10 20 40 100 and 1500 kpa for each intact core fig s1 measurements at smps 10 kpa were made on high flow ceramic plates using a hanging water column whilst pressure chambers were used at lower smps following the standard methods used in new zealand gradwell and birrell 1979 saturated water content was calculated from the total soil porosity derived from the bulk density and particle density refer to section 2 3 to describe the swrc the van genuchten 1980 model was fitted to the data 1 Œ∏ œà Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà n 1 1 n where Œ∏ œà is the volumetric soil water content at œà kpa Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s are residual and saturated porosity soil water contents respectively on a volume basis in this study Œ∏ r was set as the air dried gravimetric water content g g 1 times the bulk density bd g cm 3 the parameter Œ± kpa 1 is inversely related to the air entry value and n is a pore size distribution index being positively related to the slope of the swrc the swrc was used to derive swsp such as field capacity fc available water content awc and permanent wilting point pwp field capacity is usually determined at a specific fixed smp e g 5 to 50 kpa assouline and or 2014 depending on laboratory conventions for example fc is typically determined at 10 kpa in uk australia and new zealand while 33 kpa is commonly used in the usa however according to assouline and or 2014 the smp at fc œà f c is related to the maximum extent of hydraulic connected pathways that conveys unsaturated capillary flow and can be derived from Œ± and n as follows 2 œà f c 1 Œ± n 1 n 1 2 n n in this study fc was calculated using œà of both 10 kpa fc10 following nz laboratory conventions and œà f c fcao calculated by eq 2 following assouline and or 2014 all other swsp were determined using these two definitions of fc and are distinguished by the subscripts 10 and ao available water content was calculated as the differences between fc and pwp defined as Œ∏ at a œà of 1500 kpa the awc was partitioned into rawc and nrawc the former represents Œ∏ between fc and Œ∏ at a œà of 100 kpa houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 taylor and ashcroft 1972 and the later represents Œ∏ between smps of 100 kpa and 1500 kpa which can be used by the plant under water stress according to the capillary rise equation vomocil 1965 the relationship between equivalent pore diameter d Œºm and œà can be written as 3 d 300 œà the volume of macro pores …õmac meso pores …õmes and micro pores …õmic corresponding to d of 30 30 5 and 5 Œºm cameron and buchan 2006 hu et al 2018 meurer et al 2020 thomas et al 2019 was calculated from the swrc 2 2 2 saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements included saturated k0 and near saturated hydraulic conductivity kns determined at smps of 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 kpa denoted as k 0 1 k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 respectively the k0 was measured using the constant head method at a pressure of 0 1 kpa klute 1965 and kns was measured under one dimensional flow at smps of 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 kpa maintained by a tension infiltrometer and hanging water column at the upper and lower surfaces respectively as described in cook et al 1993 2 3 measurements of other soil properties because of micro scale variability bd of both small and large cores was measured gradwell and birrell 1979 with the bd of the small cores used to determine the volumetric water content for the swrc data whereas those from the large cores to relate with k measurements particle density ranging from 2 44 to 2 72 g cm 3 with an average of 2 61 g cm 3 was determined for each depth increment as described in gradwell and birrell 1979 water stable aggregates were measured using a wet sieving technique adapted from beare and bruce 1993 briefly in this slaking method 75 g of the air dried soil was wet sieved 20 min 120 cycle min 1 2 cm stroke length to recover water stable aggregates in six size classes 2 5 1 2 0 5 1 0 25 0 5 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm followed by oven drying of the water stable aggregates at 50 c for at least 6 h until constant weight then their geometric mean diameter gmd was calculated following the equation adapted from kemper and rosenau 1986 4 g m d e x p w i l n x i w i where w i g is the weight of aggregate in each size fraction x i is the mean size of each aggregate size class mm the particle size distribution was measured by the pipette method as described in claydon 1989 for determining the sand 0 063 2 mm silt 0 002 0 063 mm and clay 0 002 mm contents according to the new zealand soil classification bulk soc was determined using a leco cns 2000 analyser leco corporation saint joseph michigan usa basic soil physical and chemical properties for each land use and soil type combination are given in table s1 2 4 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova within the general linear model procedure was performed to explore the impact of three fixed categorical variables land use soil type and soil depth and their interactions on shp least significant difference lsd p 0 05 was used to compare means unless otherwise stated multivariate regression analyses were used to identify the percentages of variances r2 in shp significantly p 0 05 explained by continuous and categorical variables natural log transformation of k was performed to achieve variance homogeneity before statistical analysis using genstat 18 vsn international ltd 3 results 3 1 effects of land

had similar œà f c to tem soil but a significantly lower rawcao consistent with rawc10 results in general the swsp decreased with depth with the exception of …õmac and rawcao which had the highest values at 15 30 cm depth table 1 there were significant two way and three way interactions depending on the swsp table 1 fig 2 shows the interactions between land use and soil type on awc and its components rawc and nrawc as well as œà f c overall the rawc10 of dp was higher p 0 05 than ip and ic for the three soil types whereas the awc10 was higher in dp than ip and ic only in the tem soil fig 2a and 2b although nrawc tended to be higher in ip than dp and ic for the three soils significant differences were only found between ip and dp in lis soil and between ip and ic in wat soil fig 2c significantly p 0 05 lower œà f c values under ip relative to the other two land uses e g 38 vs 10 kpa were found in wat and tem soils in lis soils ip had lower p 0 05 œà f c values than dp e g 20 vs 5 kpa fig 2d while œà f c values of the three soils were relatively constant under ic they were sensitive to soil type under ip and dp the generally lower œà f c values under ip resulted in consistently the lowest awcao and rawcao across all three soils fig 2e and 2f similar to the case for awc10 and rawc10 dp had higher p 0 05 awcao and rawcao than ip and ic for the three soil types with a few exceptions fig 2e and 2f interestingly the higher awc and rawc in dp relative to the other two land uses was much greater in tem soil than the other two soils regardless of the smp used to define them compared with ic dp had approximately 4 5 higher awc and rawc in tem soil significant interactions between land use and soil depth on swsp were also found table 1 and fig 3 while ip and dp had significantly higher awc10 than ic by 5 6 at 0 7 5 cm dp had about 3 higher awc10 than ip and ic at 7 5 15 cm and no land use effects existed at 15 30 cm fig 3a the dp had consistently higher rawc10 than ip and ic for all three depths fig 3b while ip had significantly higher rawc10 than ic at 0 7 5 cm no significant differences in rawc10 between ip and ic were observed at deeper soil depths fig 3b although the nrawc of ip was consistently higher than that of dp and both decreased with depth the nrawc of ic did not change with depth fig 3c this resulted in less differences in nrawc between ip or dp and ic with depth the land use effects on œà f c decreased with depth fig 3d significant lower œà f c values under ip than dp were found down to 15 cm depth while lower œà f c values under ip than ic were found at 0 7 5 cm only as a result of lowest œà f c values in ip and highest values in dp across all three depths fig 3d both awcao and rawcao were consistently the highest in dp and lowest in ip for all three depths fig 3e and 3f there were no significant interactions between land use and soil depth on awcao fig 3e however there was a trend that the differences in rawcao between ic and ip decreased with depth fig 3f 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivities land use affected k p 0 05 table 2 and fig 4 with the highest values under dp as smp decreased there was a trend that the order of k changed from dp ic ip at smps of 0 0 1 and 0 4 kpa to dp ip ic at smps of 0 7 and 1 0 kpa however 0 1 kpa was the only smp at which k differed significantly between all land uses there were no significant differences in k between ic and dp at saturation and between ic and ip at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa soil type affected k p 0 01 table 2 with the lis soil having the highest k values as smp decreased there was a trend that the order of k changed from lis wat tem at smps of 0 and 0 1 kpa to lis tem wat at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa however 0 7 kpa was the only smp at which k differed significantly between all soil types there were no significant differences in k between tem and wat soils at smps 0 to 0 4 kpa and between tem and lis soils at 1 0 kpa soil depth p 0 01 affected k except at a smp of 0 1 kpa k 0 1 table 2 the top layer 0 7 5 cm tended to have higher k0 and k 0 1 but lower k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 there were no significant two and three way interactions on k fig 4 3

f c with …õmic explaining about 90 of the variance in fc10 and about 50 of variance in the latter three properties table 3 note that …õmic only explained 17 of the variance in fcao while …õmes explained a high percentage of the variance in awc10 77 and rawc10 79 as expected …õmac explained most of the variance in awcao 67 and rawcao 83 note that …õmes explained only one third of the variance in awcao microporosity was significantly p 0 001 related to soc 44 followed by clay 36 content table 3 while bd had a slight influence on …õmic 15 it explained one third of the variance in …õmes in addition soc explained 17 of variance in …õmes soil attributes had limited capability in explaining variance in …õmac where 18 of the variance was explained by bd variability in fc10 was mainly affected by soc 55 table 3 bulk density was the main variable explaining variations in awc10 40 and rawc10 15 soil organic carbon explained about one third of variance in awc10 but had no influence on rawc10 variability clay content explained the comparable amount 14 of variance in rawc10 as bd did soil organic carbon 35 followed by bd 29 was the main contributor to the variations in nrawc bulk density was the most important factor in explaining variatince in fcao 70 and awcao 43 but not for rawcao soil organic carbon explained 39 of variance in fcao but explained very limited variance in awcao and rawcao multivariate regression modelling showed that three key continuous variables i e bd soc and clay content explained a significant proportion of the variability in awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by 50 39 37 74 and 44 respectively table 4 in addition to these categorical variables land use and soil type explained variations of awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by a further 10 19 13 4 and 13 respectively if their interactions with continuous variables were also included the corresponding numbers increased to 13 38 18 6 and 22 respectively in total these significant variables explained the variance of awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by 64 79 55 80 and 66 respectively 3 2 2 effects of soil organic carbon on soil water storage properties correlations between soc and water storage in different pore size ranges were analysed to evaluate how soc may contribute to water storage fig 5 soil organic carbon was best correlated with pore size ranges 0 2 3 Œºm for 0 7 5 cm and 0 2 7 5 Œºm for 7 5 15 cm and 0 30 cm equivalent to smps of 100 to 1500 kpa and 40 to 1500 kpa respectively approximating the nrawc whereas soc at 15 30 cm was best correlated with pores 0 2 Œºm equivalent to pwp at smp of 1500 kpa table 5 shows the changes in swsp for each 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc concentration from ip dp and ic land uses over the 0 30 cm depth in this study on average an increase of 1 soc resulted in increases in fc10 4 0 awc10 2 7 and pwp 1 3 which were greater than the increases recorded for fcao 2 2 and awcao 0 8 in addition while a 1 increase in soc raised rawc10 by 0 5 it reduced rawcao by 1 3 regardless of the smp used to define awc the increase in awc as a function of increasing soc was contributed mainly by the nrawc where a 2 2 average increase in nrawc was observed for each 1 increase in soc the response of awc10 rawcao and pwp to changes in soc was similar among land uses however a 1 increase in soc resulted in greater increases in fcao 3 0 awcao 1 8 and nrawc 2 8 under dp than other land uses whereas the increase in swsp in response to a 1 increase in soc tended to be greatest for fc10 and awc10 in ip soils 3 2 3 correlations and regression analyses for hydraulic conductivities despite …õmac p 0 001 explaining some variability of k this was no more than 30 table 6 interestingly variability in k 0 1 rather than k0 was affected more by …õmac r2 30 vs 18 the variability of k at each smp explained by …õmac generally increased with depth for example the r2 values between k0 and …õmac were 16 18 and 27 at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 15 30 cm depth the corresponding r2 values between k 0 1 and …õmac were 21 37 and 36 respectively hydraulic conductivity was not significantly affected by measured soil properties except that bd explained 18 20 variance in k0 and k 0 1 table 6 although soc alone explained very limited variance in k e g maximum of 5 in the case of k0 it could explain more variance in kns when both bd and soc were considered data not shown this was especially the case for k 0 1 and k 0 4 where about 10 of their variances were explained by soc much higher than the variances soc alone could explain table 6 bulk density and soc were the best combination of continuous variables for explaining variability in k and they explained 16 28 of variance in k0 k 0 1 and k 0 4 but very limited 10 amount of variance in k 0 7 and k 1 0 table 7 interestingly when both continuous variables bd and soc and categorical variables i e land use soil type and soil depth were included in the regression model significantly more variance in k could be explained especially at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa compared with the model using only continuous variables models with both continuous and categorical variables explained 25 27 more variances for k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 versus 5 9 more variances for k0 and k 0 1 overall both continuous and categorical variables explained 28 41 of variances in k much lower than the case for swsp 55 80 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 land use effects on soil hydraulic properties a key finding from this study was that long term land use affected both water storage and transport properties across three of the most productive agricultural soils on the canterbury plains compared with both irrigated pasture ip and irrigated crop ic dryland pasture dp had a higher available water content awc especially the readily available water content rawc regardless of the soil matric potential smp 10 kpa or œà f c used to define awc and this effect was greatest in tem soil dryland pasture soils also had a higher hydraulic conductivity k than ip or ic soils with no significant interaction with soil type the effects of long term land use on awc and k could have significant implications for water management practices on average the top 30 cm of dp soils maintained a rawc10 that was 10 mm greater than that of ip this number increased to 16 mm for tem soil this may imply that more water is available for uptake in dp especially in tem soil which may result in lower water storage in micropores this together with higher k may lead to lower risk of runoff and contaminant losses in dp soils interestingly the higher rawc in dp than ip after 20 years is consistent with houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 who reported that top 30 cm soils at sheep dryland had 13 mm higher rawc10 than cattle irrigated soils after four years of treatment imposition although these two studies were conducted in different regions of new zealand the similar differences in rawc between dp and ip may imply that the land use intensification effects on soil hydraulic properties of top soils can be developed in a relatively short term and maintained for long terms the higher capacity to store and supply plant available water in dryland dp than irrigated ip and ic soils was related to differences in pore size distribution that reflect the greater pressure imposed on soil structure by more intensive management under irrigation compared with ip and ic dp had significantly higher …õmes and …õmac which were the main contributors to the variances in awc10 and awcao respectively tables 1 and 3 the reduced soil aggregate stability in continuously cultivated soils hu et al 2021 might have made ic soils more vulnerable over the long term to dispersion and consolidation following tillage and therefore reduced …õmes and …õmac a recent synthesis of seven studies from new zealand showed that water stable aggregates and …õmac were both reduced by about 70 under continuous cropping 10 years relative to continuous pasture or indigenous vegetation hu et al 2021 lower …õmes and …õmac in ip soils relative to dp soils has been widely observed across new zealand hu et al 2021 the most likely explanation for this effect is compaction from dairy grazing under wetter soil conditions drewry et al 2008 drewry et al 2020 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 srinivasan and mcdowell 2009 although livestock treading also occurred under dp the lower treading pressures imposed by sheep and beef cattle grazing under drier conditions is expected to have a reduced impact on pore size distribution drewry et al 2020 thomas et al 2019 this is also supported by previous research that showed that sheep grazing under irrigated and dryland pasture resulted in comparable awc10 and rawc10 regardless of soil type houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 srinivasan and mcdowell 2009 the greater difference between ip and dp in the awc and rawc of tem soil probably reflects its greater vulnerability to compaction from cattle treading given the lower clay and sesquioxide content of tem soils compared with the lis and wat soils hewitt and shepherd 1997 the higher rawc10 in dp than ip soils was confirmed from a recent paired site study in tem soil drewry et al 2021 the decreased water holding capacity or total awc from cultivation or livestock grazing was also generally found in other studies bormann and klaassen 2008 hu et al 2018 owuor et al 2018 price et al 2010 our study highlighted that the decrease in capacity to store and supply water was also dependent on soil type this implies that land use and its interaction with soil type should be considered during soil parameterization within hydrological models which has been usually ignored the less intensive land use of dp i e less compaction and cultivation could also be the reason for the higher k of dp compared with ip and ic this result was consistent with previous studies that reported higher k or infiltration capacity for native pasture or forest relative to intensive cropland and overgrazing pasture bodhinayake and si 2004 germer et al 2010 jarvis et al 2013 kabir et al 2020 kelishadi et al 2014 however the variations in saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivities were not well explained by …õmac as reported by others centeno et al 2020 logsdon et al 1990 this may indicate that other factors such as pore shape continuity connectivity and tortuosity contribute more than macropore volume to explaining variability in k pollacco et al 2017 vervoort and cattle 2003 and some of them have been reported to improve the prediction of shp on similar soils pollacco et al 2020 the reduced macropore connectivity can be caused by shear failure as a result of pugging from livestock treading and smearing from tillage drewry et al 2008 matin et al 2016 reduced macropore continuity and connectivity under compaction has also been observed by others jegou et al 2002 pohlitz et al 2018 the lower shear failure in drier soil under dp probably resulted in consistently higher k in dp regardless of soil type previous studies usually found that the effect of land use on k increased with smp towards saturation because of greater impacts on macroporosity bodhinayake and si 2004 kabir et al 2020 kelishadi et al 2014 by contrast our study showed that the differences in k between dp and ip or ic at saturation were lower than those at near saturation 0 1 to 1 0 kpa further highlighting the importance of macropore geometry in determining water flow the definition of smp at field capacity œà f c was significantly affected by land use this study indicated that whilst 10 kpa may be an appropriate œà f c smp for many land use and soil type combinations lower smps 33 kpa on average should be used to define œà f c in less well drained soils tem and wat under ip this was also supported by the high correlation between …õmac and awcao r2 67 but low correlation between …õmac and k which implies that …õmac contributes more to the water storage than transport as a result of macropore disruption from intensive land use e g compaction and cultivation compaction from dairy grazing under ip especially in less well drained soils could decrease the smp at which œà f c is defined this was because compaction increased hydraulic continuity and unsaturated flow at certain smps lipiec and hatano 2003 fig 4 which decreases smp at which flux is negligible e g 0 01 cm day 1 the commonly used convention of defining fc at 10 kpa resulted in awc of ip soils 3 2 higher than that where œà f c was defined by the dynamic criteria of assouline and or 2014 table 1 the value of rawcao was also lower implying that ip soils in this study require more frequent irrigation return intervals than if management decisions were based on the default static smp for fc results of multivariate regression analyses indicated that 50 of land use induced changes in awc could be predicted by bd soc and clay content while they only explained variations in k to a limited extent 3 28 this result supports the inclusion of these properties in ptfs for predicting soil water storage properties minasny et al 1999 rawls et al 2003 our study also highlighted the value of including categorical variables e g land use soil type and soil depth to improve the prediction of shp consistent with the approach taken by mcneill et al 2018 for new zealand soils the inclusion of these categorical variables was more important in predicting rawc than awc as a greater proportion of the variances in rawc 22 39 versus 6 13 could be explained by these categorical variables and their interactions with continuous variables likewise these categorical variables explained more variation in k at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa than at smps of 0 and 0 1 kpa 23 28 versus 5 9 this suggests that categorical variables are more meaningful to explain extra variance in shp associated with intermediate pore sizes equivalent to smps between 1 0 and 100 kpa the smaller pores may be more controlled by inherent soil properties such as clay content and clay minerology aringhieri 2004 while larger pores are more affected by random processes such as biological activity l√©onard et al 2004 associated with bulk density and soil organic carbon table 6 whilst soil type and soil depth have been included in ptfs for predicting soil water content at different smps in new zealand land use has only rarely been considered for predicting shp in new zealand or elsewhere mcneill et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore inclusion of land use information in ptfs may potentially improve the prediction of shp given that there are many studies showing land use effects on shp and easily measured continuous variables may not explain all land use induced variance in shp houlbrooke et al 2008 jorda et al 2015 further research is needed to test and validate the application of land use in ptfs for predicting shp in new zealand and more widely 4 2 effects of soc on soil hydraulic properties while soc has previously been included in ptfs for predicting shp rawls et al 2003 saxton and rawls 2006 vereecken et al 2010 it has been rarely applied to ptfs for new zealand soils mcneill et al 2018 we found that soc explained one third of the variance in awc10 while significant positive correlations between soc and awc at constant œà f c smp of 10 or 33 kpa have been reported for a range of soil textures hudson 1994 huntington 2005 other studies have reported negative or no correlations between soc and awc huntington 2005 minasny and mcbratney 2018 the disputed relationships between soc and awc could be attributed to differences in the methods used to define awc awc10 vs awcao as well as differences in other soil properties e g soc level texture mineralogy and bulk density huntington 2005 rawls et al 2003 the positive effects of soc on awc were mainly attributed to the hydrophilic nature of organic compounds and its positive influence on the porosity in the range of pore sizes that retain plant available water huntington 2005 in this study the positive correlations between soc and …õmic r2 44 and …õmes r2 17 table 3 fig 5 supported the links between soc and water storage pores although direct evidence for their cause effect relationship is lacking the 2 7 average increase in awc10 for each 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc 0 30 cm soil was much higher than the global average increase i e 1 2 reported by minasny and mcbratney 2018 however soc did not contribute to the variability of awcao and k because they were more related to …õmac and its pore network geometry the absence of relations between soc and k may be attributed to opposing effects of soc wang et al 2009 i e both improving soil aggregate stability and reducing wettability by its hydrophobic components fu et al 2021 one of the new findings of this study was that soc mainly contributed to water stored at the drier end of the awc range i e nrawc and water that is held below pwp fig 5 in the top 30 cm of soil a 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc resulted in a 2 2 increase in nrawc while it had a negligible 0 5 effect on rawc10 and a negative effect on rawcao 1 3 this suggests that the contribution of soc to supply of plant available water is limited when soil water content is kept in the rawc range by irrigation however soc storage may be much more important to the supply of plant available water in water stressed environments this is consistent with the findings of oldfield et al 2019 who reported that an increase in soc from 5 to 8 g kg 1 0 3 c increase could potentially increase dryland crop yields by 10 as a result of improved both water retention and nutrient supply 5 conclusions significant land use effects on shp were found in this study compared with dp ip and ic soils maintained a lower available water capacity and hydraulic conductivity due to land use intensification with dairy cows grazing under irrigation and continuous cultivation respectively this may increase the risk of runoff and contaminant losses in ip and ic soils on average the absolute awc and rawc of ip and ic soils 0 30 cm was 1 5 5 40 relative difference and 3 7 29 150 relative difference lower than dp soils and the decrease was higher in tem soil possibly because of its greater inherent structural vulnerability than the other two soils while a œà f c of 10 kpa as commonly used in new zealand may be appropriate for many land use and soil type combinations 33 kpa was more appropriate for the ip soils in this study where compaction appears to have increased unsaturated hydraulic continuity the lower œà f c 33 kpa under ip implies that these soils would require more frequent irrigation return intervals than if management decisions were based on the default static smp 10 kpa our results suggest that soil macroposity contributes more to water storage than water transport particularly under intensive land uses such as grazing and cultivation likely due to lack of macropore continuity our study highlights the potential benefit of including categorical variables e g land use soil type and soil depth in pedotransfer functions for shp we also confirmed the contribution of soc in increasing awc however it contributed more to water storage at the dry end corresponding to smps of 40 to 1500 kpa of the awc range this suggests that soc storage plays a more important role in the supply of plant available water in water stressed environments our study indicates that the effects of land use and its interaction with soil type smp at field capacity and soc on soil hydraulic properties should be considered during soil parameterization of hydrological models credit authorship contribution statement zihuan fu writing original draft wei hu

4203,soil hydraulic properties shp control water movement and storage and thus affect a wide range of biogeochemical processes and ecosystem services the objectives of this study were to identify the interactions between long term land use and soil type on shp e g available water content awc hydraulic conductivity k and the effects of soil organic carbon soc content on these properties soil water release curves and near saturated hydraulic conductivity at three soil depths 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 15 30 cm were measured under three long term 20 years land uses irrigated pasture ip dryland pasture dp and irrigated cropping ic in canterbury new zealand for each land use three soil types with contrasting drainage characteristics were selected well drained lismore lis stony silt loam moderately well drained templeton tem silt loam and poorly drained waterton temuka wat clay loam compared to dp the ip and ic soils had lower awc and k significant interactions between land use and soil type were found for awc but not for k bulk density soc and clay content could explain half the variation in awc but had limited influence on k more variance in awc 6 13 and k 5 27 could be explained by including categorical variables i e land use soil type and soil depth and their interactions with continuous variables indicating the potential benefit of including these categorical variables when developing pedotransfer functions for awc and k this study suggests that many macropores 30 Œºm were poorly connected and contributed more to water storage than to conducting water the commonly used soil matric potential of 10 kpa was suitable for defining field capacity in dp and ic soils but a lower matric potential 33 kpa was more appropriate for ip soil affected by livestock treading during grazing soil organic carbon mainly increased awc by affecting water retention at soil matric potentials of between 40 and 1500 kpa equivalent to pore size 0 2 7 5 Œºm therefore soil carbon sequestration may be important to alleviating water stress in dry environments our study also suggests that the effects of land use and its interaction with soil type soil matric potential at field

intensification can have significant often adverse effects of soil physical health houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 hu et al 2021 this includes various soil hydraulic properties shp that regulate hydrological processes such as drainage nitrate leaching and runoff of sediments and contaminants jarvis et al 2013 ostad ali askari et al 2019 price et al 2010 soil hydraulic properties including both soil water storage properties swsp and hydraulic conductivity k are key parameters in many hydrologic climate land surface and crop models brisson et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 consequently they represent essential data in most global and national soil information systems and are often derived from predictive models that use readily available soil survey data such as soil texture soil structure and soil organic carbon soc content as pedo transfer functions arrouays et al 2014 mcneill et al 2018 effects of land use and agricultural intensification associated with cultivation and livestock treading on shp have been extensively investigated e g drewry et al 2008 glab 2014 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 hu et al 2009 jarvis et al 2013 for example intensive use of pasture and cropland soils is commonly reported to decrease k or infiltration rate bagarello et al 2010 bodhinayake and si 2004 bormann and klaassen 2008 germer et al 2010 jarvis et al 2013 price et al 2010 and soil water holding capacity owuor et al 2018 price et al 2010 relative to native grassland and forest dairy pasture soils typically have lower saturated hydraulic conductivity k0 and available water capacity awc than sheep grazed pastures owing to greater soil compaction from treading drewry et al 2004 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 reported that differences in awc in the top 30 cm between dairy and sheep pasture soils were greater under irrigation than without irrigation houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 a recent review showed that more intensive land uses e g grazing and cropping consistently result in more serious deterioration of shp including reduced macroporosity …õmac and k0 however previous studies on the effects of land use and intensification on shp have mainly focused on a single soil type drewry et al 2021 glab 2014 hu et al 2009 kabir et al 2020 kodesova et al 2011 and the effects of land use effects are often not consistent for example the k of grazed grassland can be higher bormann and klaassen 2008 kabir et al 2020 or lower kelishadi et al 2014 than cultivated land and the available water content awc of irrigated pastures can be higher drewry et al 2021 rickard and cossens 1966 rickard and cossens 1968 lower houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 or not different mesman 2014 to that of dryland pastures these results indicate that the land use effects on shp may depend on soil type which is an important knowledge gap among the most common shp awc and its components e g readily available water content rawc and non readily available water content nrawc are of great importance due to their controls on water uptake and evapotranspiration drewry et al 2008 reynolds et al 2009 the rawc and nrawc are defined as the differences between field capacity fc and the stress point also termed refill point and between the stress point and permanent wilting point pwp respectively however the criteria for determining fc in soil physics laboratories is typically independent of soil type instead fc œà f c is determined on soil cores using a single soil matric potential smp varying between 5 10 and 33 kpa minasny and mcbratney 2018 under field conditions fc has been defined as the water content of a soil that was saturated and allowed to drain until further drainage is negligible i e 0 01 1 mm day 1 assouline and or 2014 an alternative recently proposed method uses dynamic criteria to estimate œà f c based on each soil s individual soil water release curve assouline and or 2014 according to assouline and or 2014 drainage is negligible when soil water is maintained at fc because of a loss of hydraulic continuity this difference in the operational definition of fc also has important consequences for the determination of awc and rawc potentially leading to different conclusions regarding the effect of land use on swsp the impact of soil texture on œà fc has been explored and coarser soils tend to have higher œà f c values assouline and or 2014 however we don t know how land use affects the dynamic criteria for fc and how those criteria affect the response of swsp to differences in land use soil organic carbon is an important component of soil that affects structure bronick and lal 2005 the effect of soc on swsp and k has been much studied but there is still no consensus on the direction e g positive or negative or magnitude of the effect of soc on shp for example the effect of soc on awc has been reported as either positive hudson 1994 rawls et al 2003 or neutral eden et al 2017 and as either small minasny and mcbratney 2018 or very large hudson 1994 likewise increases in soc have been shown to increase owuor et al 2018 decrease jarvis et al 2013 wang et al 2009 or have no significant effect moragues saitua et al 2017 on k0 nevertheless soc is often included into pedotransfer function ptf models that underpin soil information systems to estimate variables in the van genuchten model e g k0 saturated and residual water content vereecken et al 1989 wosten et al 1999 or to directly predict swsp e g fc awc and pwp and k jorda et al 2015 rawls et al 2003 however improvement in shp predictions as a result of inclusion of soc in the ptf has met with variable success for example some studies have reported that soc significantly improve the prediction of water retention at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa saxton and rawls 2006 whereas others have found little improvement in the same parameters lal 1978 or only at specific smps rawls et al 2003 the inconsistent effects of soc on k are reflected in the small number of commonly used ptfs that explicitly include soc zhang et al 2020 the inconsistent role of soc in shp may imply that soc affects swsp and k only under a specific range of smp e g equivalent to different porosity combinations however the smps at which shp are most affected by soc is an important knowledge gap that needs to be understood to advance the application of ptfs in soil information systems there is some evidence from x ray ct scanning that shows a positive relationship between soc and micropore 15 Œºm volume in native grasslands ananyeva et al 2013 therefore it is expected that soc may play a more important role in soil water storage in micropores to date soc has not been included in national ptfs for new zealand mcneill et al 2018 partly due to the unconfirmed relationship between soc and shp therefore we need to confirm if soc affects shp and determine the critical range of smps at which shp are most affected by soc furthermore the effects of land use have generally not been considered in ptfs both in the new zealand mcneill et al 2018 and internationally zhang et al 2020 the objectives of our study were to a determine how long term 20 years land use interacts with soil type to affect shp using a regional study across the canterbury plains new zealand b quantify the role of soc in contributing to variability in shp and c investigate the potential of soc and categorical variables including land use to improve the prediction of shp 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description and field sampling a soil sampling campaign that targeted three common agricultural soils with contrasting drainage level was carried out across the canterbury plains new zealand fig 1 which has a warm temperate oceanic climate mean annual temperature of 11 13 mean annual rainfall of 600 650 mm three soils sampled were well drained lismore lis stony silt loam moderately well drained templeton tem silt loam and poorly drained waterton temuka wat clay loam they belong to brown pallic and gley soil orders respectively based on the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 their usda equivalents are typic dystrudept udic haplustept and mollic endoaquept smith 2014 respectively the sampled sites consisted of three long term 20 years land uses irrigated cropping ic irrigated pasture ip and dryland pasture dp the ic sites were selected to represent typical irrigated arable cropping rotations of the canterbury plains which include wheat triticum aestivum l barley hordeum vulgare l peas pisum sativum l potatoes solanum tuberosum l and herbage seed crops established with a mix of spring and autumn tillage inversion and non inversion practices to a maximum depth of 20 cm the ip sites were selected to represent high production irrigated perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l white clover trifolium repens l pastures used for dairy grazing irrigation of pasture typically extends between spring and autumn to meet the soil water requirements of high production swards the dp sites were selected to represent continuous drystock sheep and beef grazed pastures composed of perennial ryegrass white clover tall fescue festuca arundinacea sch phalaris phalaris aquatica l cocksfoot dactylis glomerata l and other common dryland pasture species each land use was represented by a total of 9 9 and 12 sites on the lis wat and tem soils respectively the majority of sites n 69 were sampled in autumn march may 2018 and a further 21 pasture sites were sampled in spring september october 2018 all of the ic sites were sampled after crop harvest and before cultivation for subsequent crops soil samples were collected for measuring k and swrc at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 15 30 cm depths at each site samples were collected from within a 2 2 m2 area in the centre of each field site to minimise the spatial variability and edge effects two sets of samples were collected at each soil depth one set of intact cores for determination of soil hydraulic properties shp and a second set of disturbed samples for the determination of other soil physical and chemical properties intact soil cores 10 cm diameter were collected at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 18 25 5 cm depths for the measurement of hydraulic conductivity k adjacent smaller intact soil cores 5 cm diameter were collected at 2 5 9 12 and 20 23 cm depths for the determination of soil water release curves swrc from which soil water storage properties swsp were obtained note that different sizes of intact cores were collected for k and swrc measurements while both were sampled from the center of their representative depths separate disturbed samples were collected by soil cores for measuring water stable aggregate distribution soil texture and soc the disturbed samples were returned to the laboratory where any surface grass or crop residues were gently removed and the samples were stored field moist at 4 c prior to processing soils were sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and coarse plant residues and air dried at 25 c before measuring soil properties 2 2 measurement and calculation 2 2 1 soil water release curves soil water release curves were derived from measurements of soil water contents at soil matric potentials smps œà of 0 4 0 7 1 5 10 20 40 100 and 1500 kpa for each intact core fig s1 measurements at smps 10 kpa were made on high flow ceramic plates using a hanging water column whilst pressure chambers were used at lower smps following the standard methods used in new zealand gradwell and birrell 1979 saturated water content was calculated from the total soil porosity derived from the bulk density and particle density refer to section 2 3 to describe the swrc the van genuchten 1980 model was fitted to the data 1 Œ∏ œà Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà n 1 1 n where Œ∏ œà is the volumetric soil water content at œà kpa Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s are residual and saturated porosity soil water contents respectively on a volume basis in this study Œ∏ r was set as the air dried gravimetric water content g g 1 times the bulk density bd g cm 3 the parameter Œ± kpa 1 is inversely related to the air entry value and n is a pore size distribution index being positively related to the slope of the swrc the swrc was used to derive swsp such as field capacity fc available water content awc and permanent wilting point pwp field capacity is usually determined at a specific fixed smp e g 5 to 50 kpa assouline and or 2014 depending on laboratory conventions for example fc is typically determined at 10 kpa in uk australia and new zealand while 33 kpa is commonly used in the usa however according to assouline and or 2014 the smp at fc œà f c is related to the maximum extent of hydraulic connected pathways that conveys unsaturated capillary flow and can be derived from Œ± and n as follows 2 œà f c 1 Œ± n 1 n 1 2 n n in this study fc was calculated using œà of both 10 kpa fc10 following nz laboratory conventions and œà f c fcao calculated by eq 2 following assouline and or 2014 all other swsp were determined using these two definitions of fc and are distinguished by the subscripts 10 and ao available water content was calculated as the differences between fc and pwp defined as Œ∏ at a œà of 1500 kpa the awc was partitioned into rawc and nrawc the former represents Œ∏ between fc and Œ∏ at a œà of 100 kpa houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 taylor and ashcroft 1972 and the later represents Œ∏ between smps of 100 kpa and 1500 kpa which can be used by the plant under water stress according to the capillary rise equation vomocil 1965 the relationship between equivalent pore diameter d Œºm and œà can be written as 3 d 300 œà the volume of macro pores …õmac meso pores …õmes and micro pores …õmic corresponding to d of 30 30 5 and 5 Œºm cameron and buchan 2006 hu et al 2018 meurer et al 2020 thomas et al 2019 was calculated from the swrc 2 2 2 saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements included saturated k0 and near saturated hydraulic conductivity kns determined at smps of 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 kpa denoted as k 0 1 k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 respectively the k0 was measured using the constant head method at a pressure of 0 1 kpa klute 1965 and kns was measured under one dimensional flow at smps of 0 1 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 kpa maintained by a tension infiltrometer and hanging water column at the upper and lower surfaces respectively as described in cook et al 1993 2 3 measurements of other soil properties because of micro scale variability bd of both small and large cores was measured gradwell and birrell 1979 with the bd of the small cores used to determine the volumetric water content for the swrc data whereas those from the large cores to relate with k measurements particle density ranging from 2 44 to 2 72 g cm 3 with an average of 2 61 g cm 3 was determined for each depth increment as described in gradwell and birrell 1979 water stable aggregates were measured using a wet sieving technique adapted from beare and bruce 1993 briefly in this slaking method 75 g of the air dried soil was wet sieved 20 min 120 cycle min 1 2 cm stroke length to recover water stable aggregates in six size classes 2 5 1 2 0 5 1 0 25 0 5 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm followed by oven drying of the water stable aggregates at 50 c for at least 6 h until constant weight then their geometric mean diameter gmd was calculated following the equation adapted from kemper and rosenau 1986 4 g m d e x p w i l n x i w i where w i g is the

the œà f c was 32 kpa under ip being lower than that under dp 10 kpa and ic 15 kpa compared with ic dp had about 3 volumetrically higher awc and rawc this corresponds to a relative difference of 16 and 40 respectively the relative increase of awc10 and rawc10 under dp relative to ip was 5 and 29 while the relative increase of awcao and rawcao under dp relative to ip was 40 and 150 respectively the ic soils had the lowest …õmes and awc10 but intermediate awcao soil type significantly affected all swsp except for Œ∏s table 1 the lis soil had the highest …õmac corresponding to the lowest fc10

and nrawc despite the lower more negative œà f c observed in tem soil than lis soil the tem soil had comparable awcao relative to lis soil but lower rawcao opposite to the rawc10 results the wat soil had similar œà f c to tem soil but a significantly lower rawcao consistent with rawc10 results in general the swsp decreased with depth with the exception of …õmac and rawcao which had the highest values at 15 30 cm depth table 1 there were significant two way and three way interactions depending on the swsp table 1 fig 2 shows the interactions between land use and soil type on awc and its components rawc and nrawc as well as œà f c overall the rawc10 of dp was higher p 0 05 than ip and ic for the three soil types whereas the awc10 was higher in dp than ip and ic only in the tem soil fig 2a and 2b although nrawc tended to be higher in ip than dp and ic for the three soils significant differences were only found between ip and dp in lis soil and between ip and ic in wat soil fig 2c significantly p 0 05 lower œà f c values under ip relative to the other two land uses e g 38 vs 10 kpa were found in wat and tem soils in lis soils ip had lower p 0 05 œà f c values than dp e g 20 vs 5 kpa fig 2d while œà f c values of the three soils were relatively constant under ic they were sensitive to soil type under ip and dp the generally lower œà f c values under ip resulted in consistently the lowest awcao and rawcao across all three soils fig 2e and 2f similar to the case for awc10 and rawc10 dp had higher p 0 05 awcao and rawcao than ip and ic for the three soil types with a few exceptions fig 2e and 2f interestingly the higher awc and rawc in dp relative to the other two land uses was much greater in tem soil than the other two soils regardless of the smp used to define them compared with ic dp had approximately 4 5 higher awc and rawc in tem soil significant interactions between land use and soil depth on swsp were also found table 1 and fig 3 while ip and dp had significantly higher awc10 than ic by 5 6 at 0 7 5 cm dp had about 3 higher awc10 than ip and ic at 7 5 15 cm and no land use effects existed at 15 30 cm fig 3a the dp had consistently higher rawc10 than ip and ic for all three depths fig 3b while ip had significantly higher rawc10 than ic at 0 7 5 cm no significant differences in rawc10 between ip and ic were observed at deeper soil depths fig 3b although the nrawc of ip was consistently higher than that of dp and both decreased with depth the nrawc of ic did not change with depth fig 3c this resulted in less differences in nrawc between ip or dp and ic with depth the land use effects on œà f c decreased with depth fig 3d significant lower œà f c values under ip than dp were found down to 15 cm depth while lower œà f c values under ip than ic were found at 0 7 5 cm only as a result of lowest œà f c values in ip and highest values in dp across all three depths fig 3d both awcao and rawcao were consistently the highest in dp and lowest in ip for all three depths fig 3e and 3f there were no significant interactions between land use and soil depth on awcao fig 3e however there was a trend that the differences in rawcao between ic and ip decreased with depth fig 3f 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivities land use affected k p 0 05 table 2 and fig 4 with the highest values under dp as smp decreased there was a trend that the order of k changed from dp ic ip at smps of 0 0 1 and 0 4 kpa to dp ip ic at smps of 0 7 and 1 0 kpa however 0 1 kpa was the only smp at which k differed significantly between all land uses there were no significant differences in k between ic and dp at saturation and between ic and ip at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa soil type affected k p 0 01 table 2 with the lis soil having the highest k values as smp decreased there was a trend that the order of k changed from lis wat tem at smps of 0 and 0 1 kpa to lis tem wat at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa however 0 7 kpa was the only smp at which k differed significantly between all soil types there were no significant differences in k between tem and wat soils at smps 0 to 0 4 kpa and between tem and lis soils at 1 0 kpa soil depth p 0 01 affected k except at a smp of 0 1 kpa k 0 1 table 2 the top layer 0 7 5 cm tended to have higher k0 and k 0 1 but lower k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 there were no significant two and three way interactions on k fig 4 3

f c with …õmic explaining about 90 of the variance in fc10 and about 50 of variance in the latter three properties table 3 note that …õmic only explained 17 of the variance in fcao while …õmes explained a high percentage of the variance in awc10 77 and rawc10 79 as expected …õmac explained most of the variance in awcao 67 and rawcao 83 note that …õmes explained only one third of the variance in awcao microporosity was significantly p 0 001 related to soc 44 followed by clay 36 content table 3 while bd had a slight influence on …õmic 15 it explained one third of the variance in …õmes in addition soc explained 17 of variance in …õmes soil attributes had limited capability in explaining variance in …õmac where 18 of the variance was explained by bd variability in fc10 was mainly affected by soc 55 table 3 bulk density was the main variable explaining variations in awc10 40 and rawc10 15 soil organic carbon explained about one third of variance in awc10 but had no influence on rawc10 variability clay content explained the comparable amount 14 of variance in rawc10 as bd did soil organic carbon 35 followed by bd 29 was the main contributor to the variations in nrawc bulk density was the most important factor in explaining variatince in fcao 70 and awcao 43 but not for rawcao soil organic carbon explained 39 of variance in fcao but explained very limited variance in awcao and rawcao multivariate regression modelling showed that three key continuous variables i e bd soc and clay content explained a significant proportion of the variability in awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by 50 39 37 74 and 44 respectively table 4 in addition to these categorical variables land use and soil type explained variations of awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by a further 10 19 13 4 and 13 respectively if their interactions with continuous variables were also included the corresponding numbers increased to 13 38 18 6 and 22 respectively in total these significant variables explained the variance of awc10 rawc10 nrawc awcao and rawcao by 64 79 55 80 and 66 respectively 3 2 2 effects of soil organic carbon on soil water storage properties correlations between soc and water storage in different pore size ranges were analysed to evaluate how soc may contribute to water storage fig 5 soil organic carbon was best correlated with pore size ranges 0 2 3 Œºm for 0 7 5 cm and 0 2 7 5 Œºm for 7 5 15 cm and 0 30 cm equivalent to smps of 100 to 1500 kpa and 40 to 1500 kpa respectively approximating the nrawc whereas soc at 15 30 cm was best correlated with pores 0 2 Œºm equivalent to pwp at smp of 1500 kpa table 5 shows the changes in swsp for each 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc concentration from ip dp and ic land uses over the 0 30 cm depth in this study on average an increase of 1 soc resulted in increases in fc10 4 0 awc10 2 7 and pwp 1 3 which were greater than the increases recorded for fcao 2 2 and awcao 0 8 in addition while a 1 increase in soc raised rawc10 by 0 5 it reduced rawcao by 1 3 regardless of the smp used to define awc the increase in awc as a function of increasing soc was contributed mainly by the nrawc where a 2 2 average increase in nrawc was observed for each 1 increase in soc the response of awc10 rawcao and pwp to changes in soc was similar among land uses however a 1 increase in soc resulted in greater increases in fcao 3 0 awcao 1 8 and nrawc 2 8 under dp than other land uses whereas the increase in swsp in response to a 1 increase in soc tended to be greatest for fc10 and awc10 in ip soils 3 2 3 correlations and regression analyses for hydraulic conductivities despite …õmac p 0 001 explaining some variability of k this was no more than 30 table 6 interestingly variability in k 0 1 rather than k0 was affected more by …õmac r2 30 vs 18 the variability of k at each smp explained by …õmac generally increased with depth for example the r2 values between k0 and …õmac were 16 18 and 27 at 0 7 5 7 5 15 and 15 30 cm depth the corresponding r2 values between k 0 1 and …õmac were 21 37 and 36 respectively hydraulic conductivity was not significantly affected by measured soil properties except that bd explained 18 20 variance in k0 and k 0 1 table 6 although soc alone explained very limited variance in k e g maximum of 5 in the case of k0 it could explain more variance in kns when both bd and soc were considered data not shown this was especially the case for k 0 1 and k 0 4 where about 10 of their variances were explained by soc much higher than the variances soc alone could explain table 6 bulk density and soc were the best combination of continuous variables for explaining variability in k and they explained 16 28 of variance in k0 k 0 1 and k 0 4 but very limited 10 amount of variance in k 0 7 and k 1 0 table 7 interestingly when both continuous variables bd and soc and categorical variables i e land use soil type and soil depth were included in the regression model significantly more variance in k could be explained especially at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa compared with the model using only continuous variables models with both continuous and categorical variables explained 25 27 more variances for k 0 4 k 0 7 and k 1 0 versus 5 9 more variances for k0 and k 0 1 overall both continuous and categorical variables explained 28 41 of variances in k much lower than the case for swsp 55 80 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 land use effects on soil hydraulic properties a key finding from this study was that long term land use affected both water storage and transport properties across three of the most productive agricultural soils on the canterbury plains compared with both irrigated pasture ip and irrigated crop ic dryland pasture dp had a higher available water content awc especially the readily available water content rawc regardless of the soil matric potential smp 10 kpa or œà f c used to define awc and this effect was greatest in tem soil dryland pasture soils also had a higher hydraulic conductivity k than ip or ic soils with no significant interaction with soil type the effects of long term land use on awc and k could have significant implications for water management practices on average the top 30 cm of dp soils maintained a rawc10 that was 10 mm greater than that of ip this number increased to 16 mm for tem soil this may imply that more water is available for uptake in dp especially in tem soil which may result in lower water storage in micropores this together with higher k may lead to lower risk of runoff and contaminant losses in dp soils interestingly the higher rawc in dp than ip after 20 years is consistent with houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 who reported that top 30 cm soils at sheep dryland had 13 mm higher rawc10 than cattle irrigated soils after four years of treatment imposition although these two studies were conducted in different regions of new zealand the similar differences in rawc between dp and ip may imply that the land use intensification effects on soil hydraulic properties of top soils can be developed in a relatively short term and maintained for long terms the higher capacity to store and supply plant available water in dryland dp than irrigated ip and ic soils was related to differences in pore size distribution that reflect the greater pressure imposed on soil structure by more intensive management under irrigation compared with ip and ic dp had significantly higher …õmes and …õmac which were the main contributors to the variances in awc10 and awcao respectively tables 1 and 3 the reduced soil aggregate stability in continuously cultivated soils hu et al 2021 might have made ic soils more vulnerable over the long term to dispersion and consolidation following tillage and therefore reduced …õmes and …õmac a recent synthesis of seven studies from new zealand showed that water stable aggregates and …õmac were both reduced by about 70 under continuous cropping 10 years relative to continuous pasture or indigenous vegetation hu et al 2021 lower …õmes and …õmac in ip soils relative to dp soils has been widely observed across new zealand hu et al 2021 the most likely explanation for this effect is compaction from dairy grazing under wetter soil conditions drewry et al 2008 drewry et al 2020 houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 srinivasan and mcdowell 2009 although livestock treading also occurred under dp the lower treading pressures imposed by sheep and beef cattle grazing under drier conditions is expected to have a reduced impact on pore size distribution drewry et al 2020 thomas et al 2019 this is also supported by previous research that showed that sheep grazing under irrigated and dryland pasture resulted in comparable awc10 and rawc10 regardless of soil type houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 srinivasan and mcdowell 2009 the greater difference between ip and dp in the awc and rawc of tem soil probably reflects its greater vulnerability to compaction from cattle treading given the lower clay and sesquioxide content of tem soils compared with the lis and wat soils hewitt and shepherd 1997 the higher rawc10 in dp than ip soils was confirmed from a recent paired site study in tem soil drewry et al 2021 the decreased water holding capacity or total awc from cultivation or livestock grazing was also generally found in other studies bormann and klaassen 2008 hu et al 2018 owuor et al 2018 price et al 2010 our study highlighted that the decrease in capacity to store and supply water was also dependent on soil type this implies that land use and its interaction with soil type should be considered during soil parameterization within hydrological models which has been usually ignored the less intensive land use of dp i e less compaction and cultivation could also be the reason for the higher k of dp compared with ip and ic this result was consistent with previous studies that reported higher k or infiltration capacity for native pasture or forest relative to intensive cropland and overgrazing pasture bodhinayake and si 2004 germer et al 2010 jarvis et al 2013 kabir et al 2020 kelishadi et al 2014 however the variations in saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivities were not well explained by …õmac as reported by others centeno et al 2020 logsdon et al 1990 this may indicate that other factors such as pore shape continuity connectivity and tortuosity contribute more than macropore volume to explaining variability in k pollacco et al 2017 vervoort and cattle 2003 and some of them have been reported to improve the prediction of shp on similar soils pollacco et al 2020 the reduced macropore connectivity can be caused by shear failure as a result of pugging from livestock treading and smearing from tillage drewry et al 2008 matin et al 2016 reduced macropore continuity and connectivity under compaction has also been observed by others jegou et al 2002 pohlitz et al 2018 the lower shear failure in drier soil under dp probably resulted in consistently higher k in dp regardless of soil type previous studies usually found that the effect of land use on k increased with smp towards saturation because of greater impacts on macroporosity bodhinayake and si 2004 kabir et al 2020 kelishadi et al 2014 by contrast our study showed that the differences in k between dp and ip or ic at saturation were lower than those at near saturation 0 1 to 1 0 kpa further highlighting the importance of macropore geometry in determining water flow the definition of smp at field capacity œà f c was significantly affected by land use this study indicated that whilst 10 kpa may be an appropriate œà f c smp for many land use and soil type combinations lower smps 33 kpa on average should be used to define œà f c in less well drained soils tem and wat under ip this was also supported by the high correlation between …õmac and awcao r2 67 but low correlation between …õmac and k which implies that …õmac contributes more to the water storage than transport as a result of macropore disruption from intensive land use e g compaction and cultivation compaction from dairy grazing under ip especially in less well drained soils could decrease the smp at which œà f c is defined this was because compaction increased hydraulic continuity and unsaturated flow at certain smps lipiec and hatano 2003 fig 4 which decreases smp at which flux is negligible e g 0 01 cm day 1 the commonly used convention of defining fc at 10 kpa resulted in awc of ip soils 3 2 higher than that where œà f c was defined by the dynamic criteria of assouline and or 2014 table 1 the value of rawcao was also lower implying that ip soils in this study require more frequent irrigation return intervals than if management decisions were based on the default static smp for fc results of multivariate regression analyses indicated that 50 of land use induced changes in awc could be predicted by bd soc and clay content while they only explained variations in k to a limited extent 3 28 this result supports the inclusion of these properties in ptfs for predicting soil water storage properties minasny et al 1999 rawls et al 2003 our study also highlighted the value of including categorical variables e g land use soil type and soil depth to improve the prediction of shp consistent with the approach taken by mcneill et al 2018 for new zealand soils the inclusion of these categorical variables was more important in predicting rawc than awc as a greater proportion of the variances in rawc 22 39 versus 6 13 could be explained by these categorical variables and their interactions with continuous variables likewise these categorical variables explained more variation in k at smps of 0 4 to 1 0 kpa than at smps of 0 and 0 1 kpa 23 28 versus 5 9 this suggests that categorical variables are more meaningful to explain extra variance in shp associated with intermediate pore sizes equivalent to smps between 1 0 and 100 kpa the smaller pores may be more controlled by inherent soil properties such as clay content and clay minerology aringhieri 2004 while larger pores are more affected by random processes such as biological activity l√©onard et al 2004 associated with bulk density and soil organic carbon table 6 whilst soil type and soil depth have been included in ptfs for predicting soil water content at different smps in new zealand land use has only rarely been considered for predicting shp in new zealand or elsewhere mcneill et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 therefore inclusion of land use information in ptfs may potentially improve the prediction of shp given that there are many studies showing land use effects on shp and easily measured continuous variables may not explain all land use induced variance in shp houlbrooke et al 2008 jorda et al 2015 further research is needed to test and validate the application of land use in ptfs for predicting shp in new zealand and more widely 4 2 effects of soc on soil hydraulic properties while soc has previously been included in ptfs for predicting shp rawls et al 2003 saxton and rawls 2006 vereecken et al 2010 it has been rarely applied to ptfs for new zealand soils mcneill et al 2018 we found that soc explained one third of the variance in awc10 while significant positive correlations between soc and awc at constant œà f c smp of 10 or 33 kpa have been reported for a range of soil textures hudson 1994 huntington 2005 other studies have reported negative or no correlations between soc and awc huntington 2005 minasny and mcbratney 2018 the disputed relationships between soc and awc could be attributed to differences in the methods used to define awc awc10 vs awcao as well as differences in other soil properties e g soc level texture mineralogy and bulk density huntington 2005 rawls et al 2003 the positive effects of soc on awc were mainly attributed to the hydrophilic nature of organic compounds and its positive influence on the porosity in the range of pore sizes that retain plant available water huntington 2005 in this study the positive correlations between soc and …õmic r2 44 and …õmes r2 17 table 3 fig 5 supported the links between soc and water storage pores although direct evidence for their cause effect relationship is lacking the 2 7 average increase in awc10 for each 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc 0 30 cm soil was much higher than the global average increase i e 1 2 reported by minasny and mcbratney 2018 however soc did not contribute to the variability of awcao and k because they were more related to …õmac and its pore network geometry the absence of relations between soc and k may be attributed to opposing effects of soc wang et al 2009 i e both improving soil aggregate stability and reducing wettability by its hydrophobic components fu et al 2021 one of the new findings of this study was that soc mainly contributed to water stored at the drier end of the awc range i e nrawc and water that is held below pwp fig 5 in the top 30 cm of soil a 1 i e 10 g kg 1 increase in soc resulted in a 2 2 increase in nrawc while it had a negligible 0 5 effect on rawc10 and a negative effect on rawcao 1 3 this suggests that the contribution of soc to supply of plant available water is limited when soil water content is kept in the rawc range by irrigation however soc storage may be much more important to the supply of plant available water in water stressed environments this is consistent with the findings of oldfield et al 2019 who reported that an increase in soc from 5 to 8 g kg 1 0 3 c increase could potentially increase dryland crop yields by 10 as a result of improved both water retention and nutrient supply 5 conclusions significant land use effects on shp were found in this study compared with dp ip and ic soils maintained a lower available water capacity and hydraulic conductivity due to land use intensification with dairy cows grazing under irrigation and continuous cultivation respectively this may increase the risk of runoff and contaminant losses in ip and ic soils on average the absolute awc and rawc of ip and ic soils 0 30 cm was 1 5 5 40 relative difference and 3 7 29 150 relative difference lower than dp soils and the decrease was higher in tem soil possibly because of its greater inherent structural vulnerability than the other two soils while a œà f c of 10 kpa as commonly used in new zealand may be appropriate for many land use and soil type combinations 33 kpa was more appropriate for the ip soils in this study where compaction appears to have increased unsaturated hydraulic continuity the lower œà f c 33 kpa under ip implies that these soils would require more frequent irrigation return intervals than if management decisions were based on the default static smp 10 kpa our results suggest that soil macroposity contributes more to water storage than water transport particularly under intensive land uses such as grazing and cultivation likely due to lack of macropore continuity our study highlights the potential benefit of including categorical variables e g land use soil type and soil depth in pedotransfer functions for shp we also confirmed the contribution of soc in increasing awc however it contributed more to water storage at the dry end corresponding to smps of 40 to 1500 kpa of the awc range this suggests that soc storage plays a more important role in the supply of plant available water in water stressed environments our study indicates that the effects of land use and its interaction with soil type smp at field capacity and soc on soil hydraulic properties should be considered during soil parameterization of hydrological models credit authorship contribution statement zihuan fu writing original draft wei hu

4204,fast ice flow and substantial surface runoff form distinct and extensive supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast greenland ice sheet gris these supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage however the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified in this study we mapped the multi temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris area 3 104 km2 using sixty five 10 m sentinel 2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer and quantified their primary hydromorphology including meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth the quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model rcm runoff the results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5 3 of the northeast gris which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest gris 7 0 as the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin 400 m to high elevations 1400 m the satellite mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the rcm surface runoff before the timing of peak melt august 1 but decreases relatively slowly by 32 45 compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff by 84 96 in august large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume high 800 1400 m elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low 400 800 m elevation bands and the 800 1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers furthermore the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes there are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow meanwhile long sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice in general this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly studied northeast gris and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes keywords supraglacial river supraglacial lake ice flow surface runoff northeast greenland 1 introduction the

correlation between the maximum total lake area and the annual surface runoff selmes et al 2011 reported that 17 of the supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris drained rapidly ign√©czi et al 2016 predicted that the increase in the number of supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris will be greater than anywhere else on the ice sheet by the end of the century b√∏ggild et al 2017 found that supraglacial rivers cover 1 2 of the area of the northeast gris ablation zone neckel et al 2020 revealed that a rapid supraglacial lake drainage event 24 h in the post melt season triggered a short term fluctuation in ice motion however these studies did not reveal the hydromorphology of the supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris especially the supraglacial rivers that control surface meltwater routing and feed or drain supraglacial lakes which are key components of the local supraglacial hydrological system pitcher and smith 2019 in addition supraglacial rivers and lakes constitute interconnected hydrologic networks but their coupled temporal evolution has not been quantified therefore the potential destination of surface meltwater and the relationship between surface meltwater routing and storage remain poorly understood as a result it is still unclear how supraglacial rivers and lakes respond to fast ice flow and increasingly strong surface melt in this study we investigated the supraglacial rivers and lakes as an integrated hydrological system during the 2017 melt season on the northeast gris using 10 m sentinel 2 images we quantified their primary hydromorphology including meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth we then analyzed the temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season finally hydromorphological comparisons were conducted for supraglacial rivers and lakes with surface runoff simulated by the mod√®le atmosph√©rique r√©gional mar regional climate model rcm fettweis et al 2017 and different ice flow regimes 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area supraglacial rivers and lakes have recently gained the attention of the scientific community with most studies focusing on the southwest gris and only a handful of studies focusing on other parts of the ice sheet box and ski 2007 mcmillan et al 2007 das et al 2008 sundal et al 2009 rennermalm et al 2013 chu 2014 pitcher and smith 2019 yang et al 2019b however recent studies revealed that from 1991 to 2017 the ablation zone expanded by 32 across the northeast gris compared to 24 on the southwest gris and surface runoff increased by 49 compared to 33 on the southwest gris khan et al 2014 hill et al 2018 mouginot et al 2019 no√´l et al 2019 tabone et al 2019 shepherd et al 2020 the northeast gris contains 13 of the total number and 15 of the total area of supraglacial lakes across the gris selmes et al 2011 but has been the focus of fewer studies compared to the southwest gris our study area is located between 77 5 n and 80 5 n and 20 7 w and 31 4 w at the margin of the northeast gris fig 1 a the end of summer snowline is located at an average elevation of 1077 m on the northeast gris ryan et al 2019 our study area comprises three drainage basins extracted from the 10 m arcticdem porter et al 2018 and truncated at higher elevations by the 1400 m contour a conservative upper limit of melt extent with a total area of 3 104 km2 below 1400 m the study area has an average ice flow velocity of 179 m year std dev 246 m year and a maximum ice velocity of 2617 m year error 18 m year joughin et al 2010 fig 1b d our study area either terminates at an elevation of about 400 m on land or at two marine terminating outlet glaciers i e zachari√¶ isstr√∏m and nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glaciers rignot and mouginot 2012 mouginot et al 2015 fig 1b d 2 2 data sources daily surface runoff data in the study area was extracted from the 7 5 km resolution mod√®le atmosph√©rique r√©gional mar v3 11 a widely used rcm for the gris fettweis et al 2017 fettweis et al 2020 we assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season surface runoff during the 2017 melt season was approximately similar to the 2010 2019 average and thus representative of typical melting conditions during the 2010 s across the northeast gris fettweis et al 2017 fig 2 sixty five sentinel 2 images were acquired for the northeast gris between june 26 and august 22 2017 these images completely covered the study area for seven days capturing the overall 2017 surface runoff period except for a short time period in early june fig 2 and table s1 sentinel 2 level 1c images with four spectral bands blue green red and near infrared at 10 m spatial resolution can delineate narrow and small supraglacial rivers and have been applied to the gris and other arctic ice masses williamson et al 2018 yang et al 2019b lu et al 2020 these images have excellent potential for investigating supraglacial hydrology over large areas yang et al 2019b the annual ice flow velocity for 2016 2017 was obtained at a resolution of 200 m from the measures greenland annual ice sheet velocity mosaics from sar and landsat datasets joughin et al 2010 the ice surface elevation and ice thickness data were obtained from the operation icebridge bedmachine v3 product archived by the national snow and ice data center nsidc morlighem et al 2017 we resampled the spatial resolutions of the ice surface elevation and ice thickness masks from 150 m to 200 m using nearest neighbor interpolation to keep their resolutions consistent with the annual ice flow velocity dataset in addition we used the arcticdem to extract the basin boundary and model supraglacial drainage patterns porter et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 extracting supraglacial rivers and lakes we followed the method of yang et al 2019b for extracting supraglacial rivers and lakes from 10 m sentinel 2 images first water features were enhanced by applying the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 which differentiated meltwater from background ice or snow second the low frequency image background and high frequency image noise were removed using a band pass filter ramped between 1 200 m 1 and 1 40 m 1 yang et al 2019b third we applied a gabor filter to enhance the cross sections of small rivers with widths 2 pixels a path opening operator which is a flexible mathematical morphology operator was then applied to improve river connectivity heijmans et al 2005 we then applied a global threshold of 20 out of 255 to the enhanced ndwi image to extract small supraglacial rivers and a threshold of 0 5 to the original ndwi image to extract large supraglacial lakes and rivers combining both extraction results yielded a final meltwater mask raster consisting of supraglacial rivers and lakes these two global thresholds were manually chosen based on the image histogram we used arcscan for arcgis extension bajjali 2018 to generate river polylines and lake polygons from the meltwater mask raster in order to better distinguish supraglacial rivers and lakes and quantify their hydromorphology the maximum line width in vectorization settings was set to 20 pixels which converted the segments 200 m into lake polygons and segments narrower than 200 m into river polylines a maximum extent meltwater mask was generated by superimposing the area of all meltwater extracted in each image to demonstrate the maximum spatial coverage of supraglacial rivers and lakes however due to the high ice flow velocity maximum 2617 m year on the northeast gris fig 1c several water pixels moved with the ice flow by more than one pixel during our study period prohibiting the direct combination of the multi temporal meltwater masks therefore multi temporal meltwater masks were registered to remove the influence of ice flow on the movement of water pixels before superposition the meltwater location on the day of year doy 213 i e august 1 was used as the reference location first the river lake points were created every 20 m along the river polylines lake outlines then the ice flow velocity for each point was extracted from the annual ice flow velocity production for 2016 2017 based on the ice flow velocity and river lake point locations we calculated the river lake point locations for doy 213 finally six meltwater masks doys 177 195 207 209 223 and 234 were registered by the original and calculated river lake points 3 2 quantifying the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes our extraction results contained meltwater masks as raster images supraglacial rivers as polyline vectors and supraglacial lakes as polygon vectors based on these extraction results we investigated the meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth to reveal the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes we selected the 50 longest river segments in each of the statistical areas i e ice flow regimes for the length and sinuosity statistical analyses the river sinuosity was calculated as the ratio between the river length and the straight line distance between river endpoints the lake related circumscribing circle rcc index baker and cai 1992 was used to describe the lake shape 1 rcc 1 s lake s circle where s lake is the lake area and s circle is the area of the smallest circle that can circumscribe the lake the rcc index varies from 0 to 1 as the lake shape approaches a circle the meltwater area fraction is the ratio between the extent of meltwater cover and the total ice surface area including the river area fraction and lake area fraction 3 3 mapping ice flow regimes we classified four ice flow regimes for the northeast gris to explore the role of ice dynamics in controlling supraglacial hydrology as described by burgess et al 2005 the four ice flow regimes were grouped according to the relationship between the ratio of surface velocity to ice thickness v h and the driving stress œÑd the driving stress is derived as follows 2 œÑ d œÅ g h s i n Œ± where œÅ is the ice density 900 kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 h is the ice thickness and Œ± is the ice surface slope in order to reduce the effects of longitudinal stress gradients the local ice surface slope was averaged using a moving window of 10 times the ice thickness flow regime 1 v h 0 075 year infers that the ice is frozen to the bed and ice motion is solely caused by deformation in flow regime 2 v h 0 075 year and 0 28 year which appears at the head of the two outlet glaciers there is a larger contribution from basal sliding to the ice flow than in flow regime 1 in flow regime 3 v h 0 28 year œÑ d 0 075 mpa basal sliding probably makes an increasingly large contribution to surface velocity in flow regime 4 v h 0 28 year œÑ d 0 075 mpa the basal friction is very low and basal sliding is the major component of ice flow velocity flow regime 4 is mainly found on the floating ice tongue of the nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier we acknowledge that applying the classification parameters obtained from the devon ice cap to the northeast gris may cause uncertainty due to the different rheological properties but we argue that this uncertainty is acceptable fig s1 this is because the sharp variation in ice flow velocity on the grounded ice and the significant decrease in the surface slope on the floating ice result in a significant variation in v h and the driving stress in our study area fig s1 furthermore the successful application of these classification parameters to the academy of sciences ice cap in the arctic s√°nchez g√°mez et al 2019 suggests that they can be adapted to arctic ice masses in general 3 4 calculating surface runoff we calculated surface runoff runoff melt rain refreezing retention on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season using the mar v3 11 at a resolution of 7 5 km fettweis et al 2017 mankoff et al 2020 to yield the total amount of daily unit mm day and cumulative surface runoff unit mm in each grid cell we clipped the mar grid cells with different vector polygon boundaries e g elevation bands and ice flow regimes and multiplied the runoff values of each grid cell by the percentage area contained within the different vector polygon boundaries e g elevation bands and ice flow regimes finally we summed the corresponding runoff values to compute the total surface runoff within different vector polygon boundaries 3 5 estimating meltwater depths and volumes surface meltwater depths were estimated from sentinel 2 images following williamson et al 2018 an empirical power law regression was used to calculate the meltwater depth from sentinel 2 images of the gris r2 0 841 and rmse 0 555 m williamson et al 2018 3 depth 0 2764 x 0 8952 where x is the reflectance of the sentinel 2 red band we used this regression to calculate the meltwater depth for each pixel containing a supraglacial river or lake the meltwater volume was then calculated as follows 4 v water a water i 1 n depth i where awater is the total meltwater area and depthi is the meltwater depth of each pixel meltwater volume uncertainty was estimated by multiplying the area of meltwater pixels by the rmse 0 555 m of meltwater depth meltwater storage unit mm was calculated as the total meltwater volume unit km3 in different vector polygons e g elevation bands and drainage basins divided by the area of each polygon unit km2 and compared with the rcm surface runoff unit mm 3 6 mapping snow cover area we delineated the snow surface from multi temporal sentinel 2 images to better illustrate the supraglacial hydrological conditions of our study area the nir band of multi spectral images can be used to separate snow from bare ice and meltwater ryan et al 2019 yang et al 2019a therefore we used a global threshold of 5800 to apply the sentinel 2 nir band digital number values the digital number values 5800 corresponding to the reflectance values of 0 58 were delineated as snow covered area 4 results 4 1 temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris were mapped using sixty five sentinel 2 images during the 2017 melt season fig 3 and table 1 maximally 5 3 of the northeast gris was occupied by meltwater at some point during the 2017 summer a normal melt year this percentage is slightly lower than that of the strongly melting southwest gris 7 during the 2015 a cold year summer yang et al 2021 supraglacial rivers and lakes in northeast greenland were found to extend from the ice sheet margin 400 m to high 1400 m elevations during the 2017 melt season fig 3 consistent with the previous findings on the southwest gris sundal et al 2009 lampkin 2011 johansson et al 2013 fitzpatrick et al 2014 lampkin and vanderberg 2014 yang et al 2021 supraglacial rivers and lakes in the northeast attained a maximum elevation of 1400 m in 2017 showing an increase of 200 m compared with the maximum elevation in 2003 2007 reported by sundal et al 2009 most supraglacial rivers and lakes formed on the bare ice surface below the snowline while a small number of supraglacial lakes and poorly channelized slush flows were distributed above the snowline fig 3 as surface runoff increased snowline and slush flows migrated to higher elevations figs 3 and 4 from doy 177 to 213 the mean elevation of snowline migrated from 416 m to 1101 m and the meltwater area fraction increased from 0 6 to 2 2 concurrently the rcm surface runoff increased from 7 7 mm day to 21 4 mm day fig 4 although the meltwater area fraction decreased after doy 213 due to surface runoff decline the snowline continued migrating to 1200 m by doy 223 figs 3 and 4 at the end of the melt season doy 234 the snowline elevation decreased to 1026 m after a snowfall event figs 4 and s2 consistent with the elevation of 1077 m derived from modis images acquired at the end of the 2017 summer ryan et al 2019 a positive linear relationship was identified between the rcm surface runoff r and the satellite mapped meltwater area fraction mf for the entire study area mf 0 11r 0 23 r 2 0 98 and p 0 01 before august 1 doy 213 see fig 5 both r and mf increased as the 2017 melt season progressed attaining peak values on august 1 r 21 4 mm day and mf 2 2 after august 1 the rcm surface runoff decreased quickly r 3 5 mm day but the satellite mapped surface meltwater still covered a considerably large area mf 1 as such the r and mf values calculated for august 11 and 23 doys 223 and 234 do not follow the linear regression function fig 5 this is because large supraglacial rivers and lakes produced during the time to peak melt before august 1 could not refreeze or be evacuated quickly in august suggesting the importance of the meltwater storage component within the supraglacial drainage system the resultant mf values therefore remained relatively large therefore we suggest that the positive linear r mf relationship exists before the peak melting time but does not hold true for the melt recession period 4 2 variations in peak meltwater extent and storage with elevation the timing of maximum meltwater extent and volume varied considerably with elevation fig 6 a d during the 2017 melt season the three highest 800 m elevation bands reached peak values over two weeks later than the two lowest 800 m elevation bands between 800 and 1000 m the meltwater area fraction achieved maximum values on doy 213 4 5 almost twice as large as that observed in any other elevation band above 1000 m the peak meltwater area fraction and storage both decreased with elevation due to the decrease in the surface meltwater runoff fig 6a d meltwater storage is dominated by supraglacial lakes below 800 m and by supraglacial rivers above 800 m however meltwater area fraction is dominated by supraglacial rivers at all elevation bands fig 6c h on average the contribution of northeast supraglacial rivers to peak meltwater area fraction is 83 8 ranging from 62 8 at 400 600 m to 99 4 at 1200 1400 m considerably higher than the contribution of their southwest counterparts 62 3 the contribution of northeast supraglacial lakes to peak meltwater storage is 36 5 ranging from 12 5 at 800 m to 75 8 at 600 800 m significantly lower than the contribution of their southwest counterparts 67 5 yang et al 2021 notably this less dominate role of northeast supraglacial lakes in meltwater storage is mainly attributed to the rare distribution of lakes at 800 m fig 3 which is constrained by surface topography there ign√©czi et al 2016 4 3 supraglacial hydrology and ice flow regimes the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes displays large variations in different ice flow regimes figs 7 and 8 meltwater area fractions in flow regimes 1 2 are slightly lower than those in flow regimes 3 4 and attain a maximum in flow regime 4 floating ice as the flow regime 4 had the highest surface runoff and lowest surface slope table 2 supraglacial river lengths decrease from flow regime 1 to flow regime 3 with faster ice flow because numerous supraglacial rivers in flow regimes 2 and 3 drain into the supraglacial lakes or abruptly terminate on the ice surface possibly draining into moulins thus they do not flow downstream fig 7a c and 8a supraglacial river sinuosity is similar in flow regimes 1 3 fig 8b but the mean river depths increase from flow regime 1 to 3 fig 8c in addition lake areas and mean depths increased from flow regime 1 to 3 fig 8d f due to the increasing number and depth of depressions and surface runoff table 2 and fig s3 moreover supraglacial lakes in flow regimes 2 and 3 are narrower i e higher rcc values than those in flow regime 1 fig 7c and 8e mainly because their shapes are stretched by fast ice flow banwell et al 2014 although the ice flow velocity is the fastest in flow regime 4 this stretching effect does not appear in the small supraglacial lakes here and the rcc values are relatively low fig 8e this regime has the longest 25 km and most sinuous 2 1 supraglacial rivers fig 8a c and table 2 this regime also exhibits very small topographic depressions and thereby small supraglacial lakes 0 1 km2 see fig 8d and s2 this finding is consistent with banwell et al 2014 and macdonald et al 2018 who demonstrated that the mean area of supraglacial lakes on floating ice flow regimes 4 is smaller than that on the grounded ice supraglacial drainage patterns strongly depend on the type of ice flow regime although the mean values of surface runoff during the 2017 summer in flow regime 2 2 6 mm day is higher than that in flow regime 1 2 3 mm day the supraglacial river area fraction decreases by 20 and the lake area fraction increases by 15 times from flow regimes 1 to 2 table 2 as sub parallel and high density supraglacial rivers converge into several large supraglacial rivers and lakes fig 9 these satellite mapped supraglacial drainage patterns are generally similar to the arcticdem modeled counterpart cumulative area threshold and minimum area of depressions are set to 0 2 km2 and 0 01 km2 respectively in flow regime 2 the supraglacial rivers are more likely to abruptly terminate at supraglacial lakes or moulins resulting in a lower satellite mapped drainage density however the arcticdem modeled drainage patterns did not accurately reflect the sizes or the locations of the terminations of supraglacial rivers e g in supraglacial lakes and moulins thus they fail to capture the sharp changes in drainage pattern at the boundary of flow regimes 1 and 2 fig 9 and overestimate the drainage density in flow regime 2 by 1 5 times 5 discussion 5 1 widespread distribution of supraglacial rivers and lakes the resultant maximum supraglacial river area fraction 4 5 was twice as large as that estimated by b√∏ggild et al 2017 in the 2006 summer 1 2 whereas the supraglacial lake area fraction 0 8 was 1 3 times larger than that reported by sundal et al 2009 during the 2003 2007 melt seasons 0 6 both studies estimated the river lake area fraction across the entire melt zone on the northeast gris for comparison we estimated the river lake area fraction with a conservative melt extent therefore our estimates are more conservative but still higher than those of both previous reports our findings suggest that supraglacial rivers and lakes are more widespread on the poorly studied northeast gris than previous estimates which is consistent with the finding that the northeast gris experienced accelerated surface runoff during this period khan et al 2014 no√´l et al 2019 shepherd et al 2020 our results confirm that supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris are now spreading inland howat et al 2013 leeson et al 2015 which is consistent with the ablation zone expansion and snowline migration toward high elevations during 2003 2017 ryan et al 2019 the maximum elevation of supraglacial rivers and lakes is 400 m lower on the northeast than that on the southwest gris fitzpatrick et al 2014 yang et al 2021 this agrees with the observation that the maximum snowline elevation of the northeast gris is 400 m lower than that of the southwest gris ryan et al 2019 5 2 implication of ice flow regimes and supraglacial hydrology the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris is poorly quantified and their response to ice flow remains unclear sundal et al 2009 selmes et al 2011 b√∏ggild et al 2017 we found that supraglacial rivers and lakes exhibit variable hydromorphology in different ice flow regimes figs 7 and 8 our results are consistent with those of wyatt and sharp 2015 who first reported the relationship between supraglacial lakes and ice flow regimes on the devon ice cap reflecting the locations at which surface meltwater can enter the glacier and potentially reach the glacier bed we additionally confirmed that supraglacial rivers dominate the surface meltwater area and their hydromorphologic characteristics are also controlled by ice flow regimes the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes varies significantly between different ice flow regimes ice flow modifies the ice surface topography by controlling the expression of the bed topography on the grounded ice surface gudmundsson et al 1998 gudmundsson 2003 lampkin and vanderberg 2011 crozier et al 2018 ign√©czi et al 2018 this expression depends on the relative importance of basal sliding which is different in flow regimes 1 3 in flow regime 1 ice flow velocity is slow 32 0 m year and mainly controlled by ice deformation burgess et al 2005 s√°nchez g√°mez et al 2019 in this regime long and continuously flowing supraglacial rivers directly drain surface meltwater off the ice sheet or route meltwater towards other regimes thus there is limited opportunity for meltwater to penetrate the ice sheet bed in contrast in flow regimes 2 and 3 ice flows velocities are relatively fast 186 3 m year and 468 5 m year and are mainly controlled by basal motion burgess et al 2005 we found that surface meltwater is mainly routed by short supraglacial rivers and then drained into the ice sheet or stored in supraglacial lakes which can potentially drain into the ice sheet as well selmes et al 2011 faster basal sliding promotes the efficient transfer of basal topography in to topographic expression at the ice surface ign√©czi et al 2018 thus forming a great number of large topographical depressions in flow regime 4 supraglacial lakes form in the depressions of viscous buckling waves associated with compressive ice stresses labarbera and macayeal 2011 the surface elevation on the floating ice flow regime 4 has low variability consequently only relatively small catchment areas are likely to develop and form small supraglacial lakes banwell et al 2014 macdonald et al 2018 besides the densely distributed supraglacial rivers also drain numerous small supraglacial lakes and reduce the area of supraglacial lakes overall we suggest that the satellite mapped hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes can reflect the characteristics of variable ice flow regimes supraglacial hydrology can also react to changing ice flow regimes and can initiate such changes surface meltwater accesses the ice bed via moulins and crevasses schoof 2010 hoffman et al 2011 andrews et al 2014 tedstone et al 2015 for example potentially fast drained lakes in flow regimes 2 and 3 can build surface to bed meltwater connections enhance basal sliding and speed up down glacier selmes et al 2011 neckel et al 2020 and up glacier christoffersen et al 2018 hoffman et al 2018 ice flow thus facilitating the transition from flow regime 1 to flow regimes 2 and 3 the changes in surface to bed meltwater connections can impact ice dynamics and potentially accelerate e g selmes et al 2011 or decrease e g tedstone et al 2015 ice sheet motion 5 3 implication of rcm surface runoff and supraglacial hydrology surface runoff is commonly estimated from rcms vernon et al 2013 fettweis et al 2017 smith et al 2017 no√´l et al 2019 although large uncertainties are associated with these outputs smith et al 2015 smith et al 2017 yang et al 2019a we found a positive linear relationship between rcm surface runoff r and satellite mapped meltwater area fraction mf for the entire study area before the time of peak melt fig 5 this is consistent with previous studies focusing on the southwest gris and the devon ice cap lu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 we suggest that this linear r mf relationship provides a promising approach to validate the accuracy of overall rcm surface runoff simulations however the applicability of this r mf relationship over space and time should be further investigated first after peak melting time surface meltwater still covers a considerably large ice surface area 1 even though surface runoff becomes very small 3 5 mm day this delay effect reflects the meltwater stored in the supraglacial lakes or routed slowly out of the snowpack firn into the supraglacial rivers and is preserved by low surface runoff or air temperature during late summer second the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and storage show large elevational variations indicating that the meltwater distribution may be influenced not only by surface runoff but also by some other factors such as the ice flow regimes discussed in this study surface topography ign√©czi et al 2018 slush saturation mikkelsen et al 2016 and dust deposition humbert et al 2020 third because of overlapping satellite orbits the ideal revisit cycle of sentinel 2a 2b is 1 2 days on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season whereas only sentinel 2a 2b images from seven cloud free days 10 days revisit were used to map the supraglacial lakes and rivers in this study future work should fuse multi source remotely sensed images especially synthetic aperture radar images e g 3 m terrasar x which can penetrate clouds and acquire high resolution images at any time of day strozzi et al 2012 to improve the temporal resolution of satellite mapped supraglacial hydrology and better integrate it with rcm surface runoff 6 conclusion in this study we mapped in detail the spatial and temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes using 10 m sentinel 2 images during the 2017 melt season on the northeast gris and quantified their primary hydromorphology the results indicate that supraglacial rivers and lakes are widely distributed on the northeast gris and maximally occupy 5 3 of the area of the northeast gris at some point during the 2017 melt season their area is positively correlated with the rcm surface runoff before the time of peak melt while their hydromorphology is controlled by variable ice flow regimes this implies that a combination of surface melt and ice flow determines the development of supraglacial hydrology conversely satellite mapped supraglacial rivers and lakes can be used as representative direct observations to investigate surface

4204,fast ice flow and substantial surface runoff form distinct and extensive supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast greenland ice sheet gris these supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage however the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified in this study we mapped the multi temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris area 3 104 km2 using sixty five 10 m sentinel 2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer and quantified their primary hydromorphology including meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth the quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model rcm runoff the results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5 3 of the northeast gris which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest gris 7 0 as the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin 400 m to high elevations 1400 m the satellite mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the rcm surface runoff before the timing of peak melt august 1 but decreases relatively slowly by 32 45 compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff by 84 96 in august large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume high 800 1400 m elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low 400 800 m elevation bands and the 800 1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers furthermore the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes there are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow meanwhile long sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice in general this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly studied northeast gris and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes keywords supraglacial river supraglacial lake ice flow surface runoff northeast greenland 1 introduction the

summer gudmundsson et al 1998 gudmundsson 2003 sundal et al 2009 lampkin and vanderberg 2011 selmes et al 2011 banwell et al 2014 crozier et al 2018 ign√©czi et al 2018 however these supraglacial features remain one of the least understood hydrological systems on earth these supraglacial features can route surface meltwater across the ice surface store considerable volumes of meltwater inject meltwater into the ice sheet via moulins or crevasses or directly drain meltwater off the ice sheet and into proglacial rivers lakes or the ocean rennermalm et al 2013 chu 2014 flowers 2018 pitcher and smith 2019 as such the northeast gris is becoming an emerging area for research in supraglacial hydrology selmes et al 2011 ign√©czi et al 2016 until now very few studies have researched supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris sundal et al 2009 investigated the supraglacial lakes during the 2003 2007 melt season on the northeast gris using modis images revealing a positive correlation between the maximum total lake area and the annual surface runoff selmes et al 2011 reported that 17 of the supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris drained rapidly ign√©czi et al 2016 predicted that the increase in the number of supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris will be greater than anywhere else on the ice sheet by the end of the century b√∏ggild et al 2017 found that supraglacial rivers cover 1 2 of the area of the northeast gris ablation zone neckel et al 2020 revealed that a rapid supraglacial lake drainage event 24 h in the post melt season triggered a short term fluctuation in ice motion however these studies did not reveal the hydromorphology of the supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris especially the supraglacial rivers that control surface meltwater routing and feed or drain supraglacial lakes which are key components of the local supraglacial hydrological system pitcher and smith 2019 in addition supraglacial rivers and lakes constitute interconnected hydrologic networks but their coupled temporal evolution has not been quantified therefore the potential destination of surface meltwater and the relationship between surface meltwater routing and storage remain poorly understood as a result it is still unclear how supraglacial rivers and lakes respond to fast ice flow and increasingly strong surface melt in this study we investigated the supraglacial rivers and lakes as an integrated hydrological system during the 2017 melt season on the northeast gris using 10 m sentinel 2 images we quantified their primary hydromorphology including meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth we then analyzed the temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season finally hydromorphological comparisons were conducted for supraglacial rivers and lakes with surface runoff simulated by the mod√®le atmosph√©rique r√©gional mar regional climate model rcm fettweis et al 2017 and different ice flow regimes 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area supraglacial rivers and lakes have recently gained the attention of the scientific community with most studies focusing on the southwest gris and only a handful of studies focusing on other parts of the ice sheet box and ski 2007 mcmillan et al 2007 das et al 2008 sundal et al 2009 rennermalm et al 2013 chu 2014 pitcher and smith 2019 yang et al 2019b however recent studies revealed that from 1991 to 2017 the ablation zone expanded by 32 across the northeast gris compared to 24 on the southwest gris and surface runoff increased by 49 compared to 33 on the southwest gris khan et al 2014 hill et al 2018 mouginot et al 2019 no√´l et al 2019 tabone et al 2019 shepherd et al 2020 the northeast gris contains 13 of the total number and 15 of the total area of supraglacial lakes across the gris selmes et al 2011 but has been the focus of fewer studies compared to the southwest gris our study area is located between 77 5 n and 80 5 n and 20 7 w and 31 4 w at the margin of the northeast gris fig 1 a the end of summer snowline is located at an average elevation of 1077 m on the northeast gris ryan et al 2019 our study area comprises three drainage basins extracted from the 10 m arcticdem porter et al 2018 and truncated at higher elevations by the 1400 m contour a conservative upper limit of melt extent with a total area of 3 104 km2 below 1400 m the study area has an average ice flow velocity of 179 m year std dev 246 m year and a maximum ice velocity of 2617 m year error 18 m year joughin et al 2010 fig 1b d our study area either terminates at an elevation of about 400 m on land or at two marine terminating outlet glaciers i e zachari√¶ isstr√∏m and nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glaciers rignot and mouginot 2012 mouginot et al 2015 fig 1b d 2 2 data sources daily surface runoff data in the study area was extracted from the 7 5 km resolution mod√®le atmosph√©rique r√©gional mar v3 11 a widely used rcm for the gris fettweis et al 2017 fettweis et al 2020 we assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season surface runoff during the 2017 melt season was approximately similar to the 2010 2019 average and thus representative of typical melting conditions during the 2010 s across the northeast gris fettweis et al 2017 fig 2 sixty five sentinel 2 images were acquired for the northeast gris between june 26 and august 22 2017 these images completely covered the study area for seven days capturing the overall 2017 surface runoff period except for a short time period in early june fig 2 and table s1 sentinel 2 level 1c images with four spectral bands blue green red and near infrared at 10 m spatial resolution can delineate narrow and small supraglacial rivers and have been applied to the gris and other arctic ice masses williamson et al 2018 yang et al 2019b lu et al 2020 these images have excellent potential for investigating supraglacial hydrology over large areas yang et al 2019b the annual ice flow velocity for 2016 2017 was obtained at a resolution of 200 m from the measures greenland annual ice sheet velocity mosaics from sar and landsat datasets joughin et al 2010 the ice surface elevation and ice thickness data were obtained from the operation icebridge bedmachine v3 product archived by the national snow and ice data center nsidc morlighem et al 2017 we resampled the spatial resolutions of the ice surface elevation and ice thickness masks from 150 m to 200 m using nearest neighbor interpolation to keep their resolutions consistent with the annual ice flow velocity dataset in addition we used the arcticdem to extract the basin boundary and model supraglacial drainage patterns porter et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 extracting supraglacial rivers and lakes we followed the method of yang et al 2019b for extracting supraglacial rivers and lakes from 10 m sentinel 2 images first water features were enhanced by applying the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 which differentiated meltwater from background ice or snow second the low frequency image background and high frequency image noise were removed using a band pass filter ramped between 1 200 m 1 and 1 40 m 1 yang et al 2019b third we applied a gabor filter to enhance the cross sections of small rivers with widths 2 pixels a path opening operator which is a flexible mathematical morphology operator was then applied to improve river connectivity heijmans et al 2005 we then applied a global threshold of 20 out of 255 to the enhanced ndwi image to extract small supraglacial rivers and a threshold of 0 5 to the original ndwi image to extract large supraglacial lakes and rivers combining both extraction results yielded a final meltwater mask raster consisting of supraglacial rivers and lakes these two global thresholds were manually chosen based on the image histogram we used arcscan for arcgis extension bajjali 2018 to generate river polylines and lake polygons from the meltwater mask raster in order to better distinguish supraglacial rivers and lakes and quantify their hydromorphology the maximum line width in vectorization settings was set to 20 pixels which converted the segments 200 m into lake polygons and segments narrower than 200 m into river polylines a maximum extent meltwater mask was generated by superimposing the area of all meltwater extracted in each image to demonstrate the maximum spatial coverage of supraglacial rivers and lakes however due to the high ice flow velocity maximum 2617 m year on the northeast gris fig 1c several water pixels moved with the ice flow by more than one pixel during our study period prohibiting the direct combination of the multi temporal meltwater masks therefore multi temporal meltwater masks were registered to remove the influence of ice flow on the movement of water pixels before superposition the meltwater location on the day of year doy 213 i e august 1 was used as the reference location first the river lake points were created every 20 m along the river polylines lake outlines then the ice flow velocity for each point was extracted from the annual ice flow velocity production for 2016 2017 based on the ice flow velocity and river lake point locations we calculated the river lake point locations for doy 213 finally six meltwater masks doys 177 195 207 209 223 and 234 were registered by the original and calculated river lake points 3 2 quantifying the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes our extraction results contained meltwater masks as raster images supraglacial rivers as polyline vectors and supraglacial lakes as polygon vectors based on these extraction results we investigated the meltwater area fraction meltwater volume supraglacial river length river sinuosity river depth supraglacial lake area lake shape and lake depth to reveal the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes we selected the 50 longest river segments in each of the statistical areas i e ice flow regimes for the length and sinuosity statistical analyses the river sinuosity was calculated as the ratio between the river length and the straight line distance between river endpoints the lake related circumscribing circle rcc index baker and cai 1992 was used to describe the lake shape 1 rcc 1 s lake s circle where s lake is the lake area and s circle is the area of the smallest circle that can circumscribe the lake the rcc index varies from 0 to 1 as the lake shape approaches a circle the meltwater area fraction is the ratio between the extent of meltwater cover and the total ice surface area including the river area fraction and lake area fraction 3 3 mapping ice flow regimes we classified four ice flow regimes for the northeast gris to explore the role of ice dynamics in controlling supraglacial hydrology as described by burgess et al 2005 the four ice flow regimes were grouped according to the relationship between the ratio of surface velocity to ice thickness v h and the driving stress œÑd the driving stress is derived as follows 2 œÑ d œÅ g h s i n Œ± where œÅ is the ice density 900 kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 h is the ice thickness and Œ± is the ice surface slope in order to reduce the effects of longitudinal stress gradients the local ice surface slope was averaged using a moving window of 10 times the ice thickness flow regime 1 v h 0 075 year infers that the ice is frozen to the bed and ice motion is solely caused by deformation in flow regime 2 v h 0 075 year and 0 28 year which appears at the head of the two outlet glaciers there is a larger contribution from basal sliding to the ice flow than in flow regime 1 in flow regime 3 v h 0 28 year œÑ d 0 075 mpa basal sliding probably makes an increasingly large contribution to surface velocity in flow regime 4 v h 0 28 year œÑ d 0 075 mpa the basal friction is very low and basal sliding is the major component of ice flow velocity flow regime 4 is mainly found on the floating ice tongue of the nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier we acknowledge that applying the classification parameters obtained from the devon ice cap to the northeast gris may cause uncertainty due to the different rheological properties but we argue that this uncertainty is acceptable fig s1 this is because the sharp variation in ice flow velocity on the grounded ice and the significant decrease in the surface slope on the floating ice result in a significant variation in v h and the driving stress in our study area fig s1 furthermore the successful application of these classification parameters to the academy of sciences ice cap in the arctic s√°nchez g√°mez et al 2019 suggests that they can be adapted to arctic ice masses in general 3 4 calculating surface runoff we calculated surface runoff runoff melt rain refreezing retention on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season using the mar v3 11 at a resolution of 7 5 km fettweis et al 2017 mankoff et al 2020 to yield the total amount of daily unit mm day and cumulative surface runoff unit mm in each grid cell we clipped the mar grid cells with different vector polygon boundaries e g elevation bands and ice flow regimes and multiplied the runoff values of each grid cell by the percentage area contained within the different vector polygon boundaries e g elevation bands and ice flow regimes finally we summed the corresponding runoff values to compute the total surface runoff within different vector polygon boundaries 3 5 estimating meltwater depths and volumes surface meltwater depths were estimated from sentinel 2 images following williamson et al 2018 an empirical power law regression was used to calculate the meltwater depth from sentinel 2 images of the gris r2 0 841 and rmse 0 555 m williamson et al 2018 3 depth 0 2764 x 0 8952 where x is the reflectance of the sentinel 2 red band we used this regression to calculate the meltwater depth for each pixel containing a supraglacial river or lake the meltwater volume was then calculated as follows 4 v water a water i 1 n depth i where awater is the total meltwater area and depthi is the meltwater depth of each pixel meltwater volume uncertainty was estimated by multiplying the area of meltwater pixels by the rmse 0 555 m of meltwater depth meltwater storage unit mm was calculated as the total meltwater volume unit km3 in different vector polygons e g elevation bands and drainage basins divided by the area of each polygon unit km2 and compared with the rcm surface runoff unit mm 3 6 mapping snow cover area we delineated the snow surface from multi temporal sentinel 2 images to better illustrate the supraglacial hydrological conditions of our study area the nir band of multi spectral images can be used to separate snow from bare ice and meltwater ryan et al 2019 yang et al 2019a therefore we used a global threshold of 5800 to apply the sentinel 2 nir band digital number values the digital number values 5800 corresponding to the reflectance values of 0 58 were delineated as snow covered area 4 results 4 1 temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris were mapped using sixty five sentinel 2 images during the 2017 melt season fig 3 and table 1 maximally 5 3 of the northeast gris was occupied by meltwater at some point during the 2017 summer a normal melt year this percentage is slightly lower than that of the strongly melting southwest gris 7 during the 2015 a cold year summer yang et al 2021 supraglacial rivers and lakes in northeast greenland were found to extend from the ice sheet margin 400 m to high 1400 m elevations during the 2017 melt season fig 3 consistent with the previous findings on the southwest gris sundal et al 2009 lampkin 2011 johansson et al 2013 fitzpatrick et al 2014 lampkin and vanderberg 2014 yang et al 2021 supraglacial rivers and lakes in the northeast attained a maximum elevation of 1400 m in 2017 showing an increase of 200 m compared with the maximum elevation in 2003 2007 reported by sundal et al 2009 most supraglacial rivers and lakes formed on the bare ice surface below the snowline while a small number of supraglacial lakes and poorly channelized slush flows were distributed above the snowline fig 3 as surface runoff increased snowline and slush flows migrated to higher elevations figs 3 and 4 from doy 177 to 213 the mean elevation of snowline migrated from 416 m to 1101 m and the meltwater area fraction increased from 0 6 to 2 2 concurrently the rcm surface runoff increased from 7 7 mm day to 21 4 mm day fig 4 although the meltwater area fraction decreased after doy 213 due to surface runoff decline the snowline continued migrating to 1200 m by doy 223 figs 3 and 4 at the end of the melt season doy 234 the snowline elevation decreased to 1026 m after a snowfall event figs 4 and s2 consistent with the elevation of 1077 m derived from modis images acquired at the end of the 2017 summer ryan et al 2019 a positive linear relationship was identified between the rcm surface runoff r and the satellite mapped meltwater area fraction mf for the entire study area mf 0 11r 0 23 r 2 0 98 and p 0 01 before august 1 doy 213 see fig 5 both r and mf increased as the 2017 melt season progressed attaining peak values on august 1 r 21 4 mm day and mf 2 2 after august 1 the rcm surface runoff decreased quickly r 3 5 mm day but the satellite mapped surface meltwater still covered a considerably large area mf 1 as such the r and mf values calculated for august 11 and 23 doys 223 and 234 do not follow the linear regression function fig 5 this is because large supraglacial rivers and lakes produced during the time to peak melt before august 1 could not refreeze or be evacuated quickly in august suggesting the importance of the meltwater storage component within the supraglacial drainage system the resultant mf values therefore remained relatively large therefore we suggest that the positive linear r mf relationship exists before the peak melting time but does not hold true for the melt recession period 4 2 variations in peak meltwater extent and storage with elevation the timing of maximum meltwater extent and volume varied considerably with elevation fig 6 a d during the 2017 melt season the three highest 800 m elevation bands reached peak values over two weeks later than the two lowest 800 m elevation bands between 800 and 1000 m the meltwater area fraction achieved maximum values on doy 213 4 5 almost twice as large as that observed in any other elevation band above 1000 m the peak meltwater area fraction and storage both decreased with elevation due to the decrease in the surface meltwater runoff fig 6a d meltwater storage is dominated by supraglacial lakes below 800 m and by supraglacial rivers above 800 m however meltwater area fraction is dominated by supraglacial rivers at all elevation bands fig 6c h on average the contribution of northeast supraglacial rivers to peak meltwater area fraction is 83 8 ranging from 62 8 at 400 600 m to 99 4 at 1200 1400 m considerably higher than the contribution of their southwest counterparts 62 3 the contribution of northeast supraglacial lakes to peak meltwater storage is 36 5 ranging from 12 5 at 800 m to 75 8 at 600 800 m significantly lower than the contribution of their southwest counterparts 67 5 yang et al 2021 notably this less dominate role of northeast supraglacial lakes in meltwater storage is mainly attributed to the rare distribution of lakes at 800 m fig 3 which is constrained by surface topography there ign√©czi et al 2016 4 3 supraglacial hydrology and ice flow regimes the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes displays large variations in different ice flow regimes figs 7 and 8 meltwater area fractions in flow regimes 1 2 are slightly lower than those in flow regimes 3 4 and attain a maximum in flow regime 4 floating ice as the flow regime 4 had the highest surface runoff and lowest surface slope table 2 supraglacial river lengths decrease from flow regime 1 to flow regime 3 with faster ice flow because numerous supraglacial rivers in flow regimes 2 and 3 drain into the supraglacial lakes or abruptly terminate on the ice surface possibly draining into moulins thus they do not flow downstream fig 7a c and 8a supraglacial river sinuosity is similar in flow regimes 1 3 fig 8b but the mean river depths increase from flow regime 1 to 3 fig 8c in addition lake areas and mean depths increased from flow regime 1 to 3 fig 8d f due to the increasing number and depth of depressions and surface runoff table 2 and fig s3 moreover supraglacial lakes in flow regimes 2 and 3 are narrower i e higher rcc values than those in flow regime 1 fig 7c and 8e mainly because their shapes are stretched by fast ice flow banwell et al 2014 although the ice flow velocity is the fastest in flow regime 4 this stretching effect does not appear in the small supraglacial lakes here and the rcc values are relatively low fig 8e this regime has the longest 25 km and most sinuous 2 1 supraglacial rivers fig 8a c and table 2 this regime also exhibits very small topographic depressions and thereby small supraglacial lakes 0 1 km2 see fig 8d and s2 this finding is consistent with banwell et al 2014 and macdonald et al 2018 who demonstrated that the mean area of supraglacial lakes on floating ice flow regimes 4 is smaller than that on the grounded ice supraglacial drainage patterns strongly depend on the type of ice flow regime although the mean values of surface runoff during the 2017 summer in flow regime 2 2 6 mm day is higher than that in flow regime 1 2 3 mm day the supraglacial river area fraction decreases by 20 and the lake area fraction increases by 15 times from flow regimes 1 to 2 table 2 as sub parallel and high density supraglacial rivers converge into several large supraglacial rivers and lakes fig 9 these satellite mapped supraglacial drainage patterns are generally similar to the arcticdem modeled counterpart cumulative area threshold and minimum area of depressions are set to 0 2 km2 and 0 01 km2 respectively in flow regime 2 the supraglacial rivers are more likely to abruptly terminate at supraglacial lakes or moulins resulting in a lower satellite mapped drainage density however the arcticdem modeled drainage patterns did not accurately reflect the sizes or the locations of the terminations of supraglacial rivers e g in supraglacial lakes and moulins thus they fail to capture the sharp changes in drainage pattern at the boundary of flow regimes 1 and 2 fig 9 and overestimate the drainage density in flow regime 2 by 1 5 times 5 discussion 5 1 widespread distribution of supraglacial rivers and lakes the resultant maximum supraglacial river area fraction 4 5 was twice as large as that estimated by b√∏ggild et al 2017 in the 2006 summer 1 2 whereas the supraglacial lake area fraction 0 8 was 1 3 times larger than that reported by sundal et al 2009 during the 2003 2007 melt seasons 0 6 both studies estimated the river lake area fraction across the entire melt zone on the northeast gris for comparison we estimated the river lake area fraction with a conservative melt extent therefore our estimates are more conservative but still higher than those of both previous reports our findings suggest that supraglacial rivers and lakes are more widespread on the poorly studied northeast gris than previous estimates which is consistent with the finding that the northeast gris experienced accelerated surface runoff during this period khan et al 2014 no√´l et al 2019 shepherd et al 2020 our results confirm that supraglacial lakes on the northeast gris are now spreading inland howat et al 2013 leeson et al 2015 which is consistent with the ablation zone expansion and snowline migration toward high elevations during 2003 2017 ryan et al 2019 the maximum elevation of supraglacial rivers and lakes is 400 m lower on the northeast than that on the southwest gris fitzpatrick et al 2014 yang et al 2021 this agrees with the observation that the maximum snowline elevation of the northeast gris is 400 m lower than that of the southwest gris ryan et al 2019 5 2 implication of ice flow regimes and supraglacial hydrology the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast gris is poorly quantified and their response to ice flow remains unclear sundal et al 2009 selmes et al 2011 b√∏ggild et al 2017 we found that supraglacial rivers and lakes exhibit variable hydromorphology in different ice flow regimes figs 7 and 8 our results are consistent with those of wyatt and sharp 2015 who first reported the relationship between supraglacial lakes and ice flow regimes on the devon ice cap reflecting the locations at which surface meltwater can enter the glacier and potentially reach the glacier bed we additionally confirmed that supraglacial rivers dominate the surface meltwater area and their hydromorphologic characteristics are also controlled by ice flow regimes the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes varies significantly between different ice flow regimes ice flow modifies the ice surface topography by controlling the expression of the bed topography on the grounded ice surface gudmundsson et al 1998 gudmundsson 2003 lampkin and vanderberg 2011 crozier et al 2018 ign√©czi et al 2018 this expression depends on the relative importance of basal sliding which is different in flow regimes 1 3 in flow regime 1 ice flow velocity is slow 32 0 m year and mainly controlled by ice deformation burgess et al 2005 s√°nchez g√°mez et al 2019 in this regime long and continuously flowing supraglacial rivers directly drain surface meltwater off the ice sheet or route meltwater towards other regimes thus there is limited opportunity for meltwater to penetrate the ice sheet bed in contrast in flow regimes 2 and 3 ice flows velocities are relatively fast 186 3 m year and 468 5 m year and are mainly controlled by basal motion burgess et al 2005 we found that surface meltwater is mainly routed by short supraglacial rivers and then drained into the ice sheet or stored in supraglacial lakes which can potentially drain into the ice sheet as well selmes et al 2011 faster basal sliding promotes the efficient transfer of basal topography in to topographic expression at the ice surface ign√©czi et al 2018 thus forming a great number of large topographical depressions in flow regime 4 supraglacial lakes form in the depressions of viscous buckling waves associated with compressive ice stresses labarbera and macayeal 2011 the surface elevation on the floating ice flow regime 4 has low variability consequently only relatively small catchment areas are likely to develop and form small supraglacial lakes banwell et al 2014 macdonald et al 2018 besides the densely distributed supraglacial rivers also drain numerous small supraglacial lakes and reduce the area of supraglacial lakes overall we suggest that the satellite mapped hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes can reflect the characteristics of variable ice flow regimes supraglacial hydrology can also react to changing ice flow regimes and can initiate such changes surface meltwater accesses the ice bed via moulins and crevasses schoof 2010 hoffman et al 2011 andrews et al 2014 tedstone et al 2015 for example potentially fast drained lakes in flow regimes 2 and 3 can build surface to bed meltwater connections enhance basal sliding and speed up down glacier selmes et al 2011 neckel et al 2020 and up glacier christoffersen et al 2018 hoffman et al 2018 ice flow thus facilitating the transition from flow regime 1 to flow regimes 2 and 3 the changes in surface to bed meltwater connections can impact ice dynamics and potentially accelerate e g selmes et al 2011 or decrease e g tedstone et al 2015 ice sheet motion 5 3 implication of rcm surface runoff and supraglacial hydrology surface runoff is commonly estimated from rcms vernon et al 2013 fettweis et al 2017 smith et al 2017 no√´l et al 2019 although large uncertainties are associated with these outputs smith et al 2015 smith et al 2017 yang et al 2019a we found a positive linear relationship between rcm surface runoff r and satellite mapped meltwater area fraction mf for the entire study area before the time of peak melt fig 5 this is consistent with previous studies focusing on the southwest gris and the devon ice cap lu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 we suggest that this linear r mf relationship provides a promising approach to validate the accuracy of overall rcm surface runoff simulations however the applicability of this r mf relationship over space and time should be further investigated first after peak melting time surface meltwater still covers a considerably large ice surface area 1 even though surface runoff becomes very small 3 5 mm day this delay effect reflects the meltwater stored in the supraglacial lakes or routed slowly out of the snowpack firn into the supraglacial rivers and is preserved by low surface runoff or air temperature during late summer second the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and storage show large elevational variations indicating that the meltwater distribution may be influenced not only by surface runoff but also by some other factors such as the ice flow regimes discussed in this study surface topography ign√©czi et al 2018 slush saturation mikkelsen et al 2016 and dust deposition humbert et al 2020 third because of overlapping satellite orbits the ideal revisit cycle of sentinel 2a 2b is 1 2 days on the northeast gris during the 2017 melt season whereas only sentinel 2a 2b images from seven cloud free days 10 days revisit were used to map the supraglacial lakes and rivers in this study future work should fuse multi source remotely sensed images especially synthetic aperture radar images e g 3 m terrasar x which can penetrate clouds and acquire high resolution images at any time of day strozzi et al 2012 to improve the temporal resolution of satellite mapped supraglacial hydrology and better integrate it with rcm surface runoff 6 conclusion in this study we mapped in detail the spatial and temporal evolution of supraglacial rivers and lakes using 10 m sentinel 2 images during the 2017 melt season on the northeast gris and quantified their primary hydromorphology the results indicate that supraglacial rivers and lakes are widely distributed on the northeast gris and maximally occupy 5 3 of the area of the northeast gris at some point during the 2017 melt season their area is positively correlated with the rcm surface runoff before the time of peak melt while their hydromorphology is controlled by variable ice flow regimes this implies that a combination of surface melt and ice flow determines the development of supraglacial hydrology conversely satellite mapped supraglacial rivers and lakes can be used as representative direct observations to investigate surface
