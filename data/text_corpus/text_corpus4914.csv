24570,recently correlations between spatial species and size diversity have been found in many forest ecosystems around the world they are likely to play a prominent role in nature s mechanisms of maintaining species and size diversity in this study we analysed the species population means of spatial species mingling and size inequality indices in 36 large forest monitoring plots from the temperate and subtropical zones in china based on the literature we included eleven diversity index combinations and considered their correlations for increasing numbers of nearest neighbours generally positive correlations are related to between species population size differences whilst negative correlations reflect within species population size differences our results showed that the selected species mingling and size inequality indices produced different correlation patterns in one and the same monitoring site we therefore defined a species mingling size inequality correlation space by computing the 0 025 and the 0 975 quantiles from the correlation data of the eleven index combinations we noticed that each observed correlation space included 1 3 combinations of five basic geometric types and can be interpreted as the unique signature of a forest ecosystem in time the correlation space allowed us to understand more clearly at which spatial scale within species correlation was more influential than between species inequality and vice versa the shape of the correlation space is interpretable and gives important clues about the forest development stage of a forest ecosystem keywords mingling size hypothesis diversity indices correlation space neighbourhood indices size dominance forest development stage diversity loss 1 introduction studying species diversity for a very long time has been the most prominent direction of biodiversity research gaston and spicer 2004 only fairly recently it has been recognised that size diversity or size inequality matters too since with some plant species such as tree species individuals can markedly differ in size ford 1975 weiner and sobrig 1984 it turned out to be even more insightful to analyse species and size diversity jointly pommerening and uria diez 2017 and wang et al 2018 independently discovered that in many forest ecosystems larger trees often tend to be surrounded by tree species different from their own and termed this the mingling size hypothesis this discovery provided incentives to study spatial species size correlations in greater detail in order to understand more clearly how species and size diversity are maintained naturally from earlier studies we reported correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality wang et al 2020 pommerening et al 2020a 2021 these correlations were discovered at forest ecosystem level and do not necessarily have to exist when analysing individual species populations if they however occurred in species populations as well this would give a vital clue as to how the natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity work and how they are broken down into small spatial units of the forest ecosystem therefore this study focused on species size correlations among nearest neighbours in species populations in pursuing this objective we applied methods of point process statistics where the variability of spatial point patterns is studied in our case the points were defined as stem centre coordinates of trees and the species and size information constituted so called marks pommerening and grabarnik 2019 i e additional information associated with the points which may help to explain the point pattern in previous studies we learned that there are often correlations between mean spatial species mingling and mean measures of spatial size inequality of the species populations in the same woodland our original idea therefore was to study these correlations for only one pair of spatial species and size inequality indices in greater detail namely eqs 1 and 4 in table 1 and to see what they imply and what they depend on while engaging in such an analysis we realised that the problem is in fact more complex since correlations as expected not only varied with the neighbourhood size but also with different index combinations in the monitoring plot at jiaohe jilin province see section 2 2 plot d fig 1 a for example using k 5 nearest neighbours the correlations of eleven species mingling size inequality index combinations from table 1 were all positive and therefore the results were fairly consistent only the strength of the relationship differed between indices this however was not the case at jingouling also jilin province plot l fig 1b where only three index combinations were positively and eight were negatively correlated the results indicated that even the general trends of species size interactions were not consistent at this site from these and similar results we concluded that correlations between diversity indices can only be fully understood if several of them were considered simultaneously such an analysis strategy is also consistent with the textbook recommendation to always apply several seemingly competitive characteristics illian et al 2008 torquato 2002 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 therefore we decided to include all known characteristics relating to spatial species mingling and size inequality as a result we obtained an area or space that includes all correlations and their dependence on distance r which in analogy to the parameter space of models we termed correlation space accordingly the objective of this study was to map as much as possible the whole correlation space of spatial species mingling and size inequality by simultaneously varying neighbourhood size and index combinations our hypotheses were that 1 this mapping would result in shapes of correlation space characterising the relationship between spatial species mingling and size inequality and 2 that these shapes can then be ecologically interpreted 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatial diversity indices based on the literature we identified three indices relating to species mingling eqs 1 3 and six indices relating to size inequality eqs 4 9 the species specific variants of each index were calculated by limiting subject trees i to the individuals of the species under consideration whilst the k nearest neighbours were the natural neighbours of each subject tree according to euclidean distance and regardless of species this definition of neighbourhood is crucial to the interpretation of the correlation results gadow 1993 defined spatial species mingling as the mean heterospecific fraction of plants among the k nearest neighbours of a subject plant i eq 1 in table 1 due to the discrete nature of outcomes for a given k there are only k 1 possible values m i can take i e 0 k 1 k k k where the number in the numerator denotes the number of neighbours with a species different from that of tree i all index values lie between 0 and 1 in analogy to pielou s segregation index pielou 1977 species segregation ψ has been suggested by pommerening and uria diez 2017 here mean population mingling m is divided by expected species mingling e m eq 2 in table 1 ψ 0 if the species marks are spatially uncorrelated if the nearest neighbours and a given tree always tend to share the same species ψ is positive with a maximum at ψ 1 if all neighbours always tend to have a species different from that of the tree under study ψ is negative with a minimum at ψ 1 hui et al 2008 and 2011 proposed the richness weighted mingling index m i eq 3 in table 1 as an extension of the original mingling index by gadow 1993 by merging the concept of species mingling with the concept of species richness accordingly each m i from eq 1 is multiplied by the species richness s i among the k nearest neighbours we amended the index definition by introducing term c in table 1 to ensure that the number of species that are theoretically possible in a group of k 1 trees are considered correctly both the species segregation and the richness weighted mingling index are less dependent on overall population species richness than the original mingling index values of m i are generally smaller and take a larger range of different values than those of m i gadow 1993 defined size differentiation eq 4 in table 1 as the mean ratio of smaller sized and larger sized marks of the k nearest neighbours subtracted from one size differentiation produces continuous results between 0 and 1 and t i increases with increasing average size difference between neighbouring trees based on size differentiation eq 4 in table 1 pommerening and uria diez 2017 proposed size segregation y eq 5 in table 1 in analogy to species segregation ψ y 0 if the size marks are independently dispersed without any spatial correlation if the sizes of nearest neighbours and a given tree are always of similar magnitude y 1 if all neighbours always tend to have size marks quite different from that of the reference tree y is negative and tends towards 1 in the extreme case the size dominance index eq 6 in table 1 was introduced by hui et al 1998 and aguirre et al 2003 and gives the proportion of k nearest neighbours dominated by tree i the index draws on similarities with the construction of the mingling index thus transforming a continuous variable into a binary one and also produces only k 1 possible u i values a new size inequality index designed in this study is the weighted size dominance u i eq 7 in table 1 in contrast to eq 6 this index takes advantage of the continuous nature of size variables here u i from eq 6 is multiplied by mark m j of the k nearest neighbours and divided by the sum of marks of all neighbours excluding that of tree i in other words u i basically is the mark percentile of tree i i e the mark proportion of trees among the k nearest neighbours that are smaller than subject tree i albert 1999 suggested a combination of differentiation and dominance index the size dominance differentiation u i eq 8 in table 1 here the size differentiation of larger neighbours relative to subject tree i is subtracted from the size differentiation of smaller neighbours relative to tree i as a consequence the continuous value of u i can be between 1 and 1 negative values of u i indicate that tree i is suppressed by its neighbours the more positive the values of u i the more dominant is tree i finally pommerening et al 2020b defined the hyperbolic tangent index t i the index is based on trigonometric principles and the simplest variant is given in eq 9 in table 1 where the mode parameter α was set to 0 5 so that the exponents of the size marks take the value of 1 and as a result the index calculation simplifies to eq 9 like most indices in table 1 the index values lie between 0 and 1 the larger the value of t i the larger the size dominance of tree i these nine species and size diversity indices were included in our correlation analyses 2 2 study area and data

separately for all species populations that have more than 20 individuals which appeared to be a reasonable lower threshold stem diameter at breast height measured at 1 3 m above soil level was used as size characteristic throughout this study however any size variable or combinations of size variables can be included in similar work in calculating the species population means we varied the number of nearest neighbours k from 1 to 50 and applied the nn1 edge correction pommerening and stoyan 2006 even k 50 did not exceed an intertree distance range of 15 m in the dense woodlands we studied see section 2 2 for each number of k we calculated pearson s correlation index for combinations of mingling and size indices and recorded the mean distance between tree i and the k th nearest neighbour the index combinations we considered were m t eqs 1 4 m t eqs 3 4 ψ y eqs 2 5 m u eqs 1 6 m u eqs 3 6 m u eqs 1 7 m u eqs 3 7 m u eqs 1 8 m u eqs 3 8 m t eqs 1 9 and m t eqs 3 9 for each of these eleven pairs we had distance dependent correlation values corresponding to 50 different values of k we used a non parametric gaussian kernel estimator with bandwidth h 2 to construct non parametric trend curves for each of the eleven index relationships to comprehensively map the total correlation space between spatial species mingling and size inequality to determine the outer contour lines of the correlation space all spatially explicit correlation results of the eleven relationships were merged and from this merged data set we computed the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles we again applied a non parametric gaussian kernel estimator this time with bandwidth h 3 to the quantile data to define the shape of the correlation space when examining the graphical results of the correlation space between spatial species mingling and size inequality for each monitoring plot we realised that the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles defined recurrent shapes that could be used for classification and interpretation the shapes shown in fig 3 represent the basic correlation patterns observed in the forest monitoring plots we studied these idealised shapes are generic and likely to apply to many other woodlands across the temperate and subtropical climate zones often the observed patterns tend to be a combination of two or more shapes and or the boundaries deviate from linearity classifying the observed patterns according to the five types of fig 3 facilitates the interpretation of ecological processes in the respective forest ecosystems in general strong positive correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality implies that specimens of different species mingle at that scale that also have very different sizes whilst the sizes within specimens of the same species do not differ much pommerening et al 2021 strong negative correlations on the other hand suggest that the sizes between specimens of different species are rather similar but that size diversity is high within specimens of the same species at that spatial scale positive and negative correlations of the same absolute magnitude therefore describe very different qualities of spatial interaction for the relationship ψ y in parts slightly different interpretations apply due to the specific definitions of the indices involved increasing distance implies that tree neighbourhoods become larger since distance and neighbourhood size in fig 3 increase vertically from the bottom up the shapes shown in figs 4 and 5 also need to be interpreted that way we found that the requirement to interpret the correlation space shapes in the direction of increasing distance markedly reduced interpretation and classification ambiguity according to this requirement we labelled mixed or transitional shapes in such a way that the first letter represents the prevailing type at short distances and the following letter s indicate the pattern at larger distances correlation shape a describes situations where correlations are initially both high and low or negative at short distances and with increasing distance neighbourhood size tend to converge towards the symmetry axis median of the correlation space which often is at r 0 but can also occur at any other positive or negative correlation value in most cases this implies that correlations are strongest or weakest when only the immediate neighbourhood involving short distances is considered shape b reverses shape a here the correlation coefficients approach the median or symmetry axis of the correlation space at short distances and as distances increase the shape then opens like a funnel implying that correlations both increase and decrease or become negative with distance this usually means that correlations between spatial species and size mingling are both stronger and weaker or negative when larger neighbourhoods are considered shapes a and b describe situations where the spatial correlation patterns at a particular distance r are not consistent across the range of spatial indices listed in table 1 in the case of shapes a and b the median the symmetry axis of the correlation space is approximately constant throughout the distance range shape c implies a gradual shift in correlation with increasing neighbourhood size and distance e g from high to low or from positive to negative correlation values this can mean that correlations between spatial species and size mingling are strong when only the immediate neighbourhood at short distances is considered and then weaken when more neighbours are involved the shape can also imply that the quality of relationship is reversed i e that predominantly positive correlations turn into negative ones shape d is the opposite of shape c implying a gradual shift from low to high or from negative to positive correlations with increasing neighbourhood size and distance shapes c and d describe situations with spatial correlations that are more or less consistent across the range of spatial indices listed in table 1 but differ with r the gradual shift also affects the median the symmetry axis of the correlation space in shapes c and d i e the median varies with increasing neighbourhood size finally shape e describes situations where the correlation space is more or less constant with increasing or decreasing neighbourhood size the median correlation coefficient the symmetry axis of the correlation space can be near 0 but can also be located elsewhere whilst being approximately constant parallel to the ordinate throughout the distance range this pattern suggests species and size correlations that are largely independent of spatial scales across all spatial indices in table 1 and across all spatial scales the correlations between species mingling and size inequality are largely consistent all calculations were carried out using our own r scripts version 3 6 3 r development core team 2020 and the spatstat baddeley et al 2016 package 3 results 3 1 basic statistics all research plots are located at upland sites and elevation varies from 600 m jd to 1880 m asl xsd densities in the 36 plots ranged from 746 in jb to 5804 trees per hectare in plot ly the minimum number of species observed was 9 in plots tfb and tfd whilst the maximum was 86 in ly mean arithmetic diameter at breast height dbh was smallest at ly 5 8 cm and largest at jc 18 3 cm the coefficient of variation had a minimum at jsb with 0 39 and a maximum at ly with 1 42 basal area ranged from 13 9 m2 tff to 45 9 m2 ly per hectare mean species mingling for both indices was lowest at jsb m 0 43 m 0 19 and highest at jc m 0 83 m 0 59 it is also at jsb where mean size differentiation is lowest t 0 33 and at tfj and tfl size differentiation is highest t 0 53 these values indicate generally high species mingling whilst size inequality is moderate 3 2 correlation space already at first glance it is evident that there is a high diversity of correlation curve shapes in some cases such as jb jgg jgi jgk ly fig 4 and tfh tfj tfh tfj xsa xsb fig 5 the correlation space is more or less fully filled with index correlation curves with other monitoring plots notably in the case of da and db there are larger gaps in the correlation space for some plots the index correlation curves largely run in parallel one to another for others they intersect while the former behaviour suggests that correlation does not depend much on distance and neighbourhood size in the latter case correlation changes with distance correlations can both increase and decrease with distance marked changes in correlation with distance are often responsible for the formation of mixed types of correlation space that include more than one letter from fig 3 in plot db fig 4 for example correlations m t and m t are very high for small distances and then dramatically decrease towards zero while r approaches 10 m for the same index correlations an opposite trend can be observed in plot da fig 4 here correlations are very low for short distances or low numbers of indices and then increase towards 0 5 at r 5 m a further increase of distance does not change the correlation strength in rare occasions initially positive correlations cross over to become negative correlations this is often associated with pattern c fig 3 see for example correlations m t and m t in tfa tfd xsa fig 5 it is also interesting to note that there is a tendency for correlation space shapes involving type c to include some strong correlations at short distances see for example jc jgh tff tfk tfl xsa xsb and xsc figs 4 and 5 the relationships m t and m t are very often involved with strong correlations in these monitoring plots as mentioned in the introduction it is not uncommon that for one and the same monitoring plot some of the index correlations are positive and some are negative e g da db jgd jge jgf jgl jsb ly fig 4 and tfa tfc tfd tfe tfk xsc xsd fig 5 there is no trend for any of the index pairings to be always at a particular location in the correlation space e g at the lower or upper boundary however the two combinations with the same size inequality index but different species mingling measures are usually quite close together hence we have always assigned the same colour to them the pairings m u m u m u m u m u m u m t and m t often occur close together this seems to suggest that the index construction is similar or highlights similar aspects of size inequality whilst combinations involving t and y often show a different behaviour in fact the former pairings apparently involve dominance indices whilst t and y include differentiation indices dominance indices attempt to express how the size of the subject tree relates to that of its neighbours whilst diversity indices focus on size diversity in the neighbourhood as a whole it is also worth noting that the selection of small k such as k 5 or k 10 is as suspected not always a choice that is located near the maximum correlation of a given index combination at this spatial location neighbourhood size correlations can be strong in the case of the be correlation space pattern see for example jgl da fig 4 tfc fig 5 fixed k 4 is a popular choice in the literature aguirre et al 2003 hui et al 2011 and often seems to miss out on stronger correlations at k 4 the most striking observation is that the shape of the correlation space differs from monitoring plot to monitoring plot whereby typical patterns are clearly recognizable fig 3 so that each plot can be assigned to one of these typical patterns or to a combination of mostly two types which supports our first hypothesis the generic types can be interpreted as explained in section 2 3 overall combinations of correlation types prevail over the basic types defined in fig 3 this implies that in the majority of cases correlations are subject to change with distance only a b c and e occur as basic types the proportions are quite evenly spread over the range of combinations see fig 6 with 5 monitoring plots out of 36 combination eb is the most common type followed by be and c combination eb implies that correlations are fairly constant with increasing neighbourhood size at first and then increase or decrease at larger distances see section 2 3 rare correlation space types are a acb bc dc and ea however the differences in absolute frequencies are comparatively small 4 discussion correlations between spatial species and size diversity are an important notion of forest ecosystems and have until recently not received much recognition they frequently occur in managed and unmanaged woodlands and form an important part of the mechanisms of natural maintenance of biodiversity in forest ecosystems these are important to understand in order to actively mitigate the adverse effect of climate change on biodiversity through appropriate forest management in pursuit of a better understanding of these natural mechanisms we analysed correlations between species population means of spatial species and size diversity that coexist in the same woodland 36 large monitoring plots from china with a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 86 species see table 2 were examined for these correlations in earlier research we learned that the interaction between conspecific and heterospecific size structure plays a crucial role in these correlations wang et al 2020 pommerening et al 2020a 2021 positive correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality imply that specimens of different species mingle at that spatial scale that also have very different sizes whilst the sizes within specimens of the same species do not differ much negative correlations on the other hand suggest that the sizes between specimens of different species are rather similar but that size diversity is high within specimens of the same species at that spatial scale we found that different species mingling and size inequality indices show different correlation patterns in the same woodland this is plausibly related to the index algorithm and the corresponding focus these diversity indices have e g size diversity as opposed to size dominance of the subject tree in future studies more attention should be paid to the distinction between these two inequality measures for understanding species mingling and size inequality correlations better we included nine different indices resulting in eleven index combinations by computing the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles from the combined correlation data we were able to define the species size inequality correlation space for each of the 36 monitoring plots when considering the shapes of these correlation spaces we realised that all of them can be described by relying on five generic types fig 3 hypothesis 1 either as single types or as a combination of 2 3 each specific shape of the correlation space of a monitoring plot can be understood as the unique signature of a forest ecosystem in time in our study there was a high diversity of different correlation space types and accordingly the proportions of plots were quite evenly spread over the range of combinations the most common type was eb implying that correlations are initially fairly constant but then increase or decrease at larger distances interestingly type c usually involved high correlations of m t and m t at short distances with the same type and relationships there were cases where initially positive correlations would cross the symmetry axis of the correlation space to eventually become negative correlations these are particularly interesting since for the same monitoring plots the quality of correlation radically changes at different spatial scales i e from between species correlations to within species correlations or vice versa these relationships highlight that the natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity are complex and can result in different patterns at different scales size differentiation t is related to the test function of the mark variogram pommerening and grabarnik 2019 and motz et al 2010 found a significant correlation between size differentiation and forest inventory design the popular choice of k 4 nearest neighbours is likely to take advantage of absolute correlation maxima only if the correlation space type is be for other types the absolute maximum is often situated at different k and r naturally it is not a requirement to select k in such a way that the correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality are maximised however since the locations of absolute correlation maxima indicate neighbourhood scales where it is very likely that important processes occur it could be helpful to choose k accordingly in this study the species mingling size inequality correlation space has emerged as a new method to identify important neighbourhood processes along with the spatial scales involved the allocation of the basic types of fig 3 is fairly straightforward although there can be ambiguous cases however the introduction of the requirement to interpret the correlation space shapes in the direction of increasing distance has greatly helped to keep ambiguity to a minimum in general the determination of correlation space type much supports the ecological interpretation hypothesis 2 the shapes of the correlation space can for example be related to specific development stages such as those defined by for example oliver and larson 1996 p 148f and emborg et al 2000 very young forest development stages stand initiation or formation phase for example can be identified from their comparatively short correlation space which often reveals a simple shape involving type e see for example tfi and tfj fig 5 often correlations here are weak and do not change much with increasing distance and neighbourhood size later forest development stages typically have a correlation space extending into the region of larger distances and often exhibit a more complex shape see for example jb jc and xsa figs 4 and 5 5 conclusions the correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality highlight that the processes causing them are scale dependent and that for different aspects of size inequality e g size diversity versus size dominance correlations can be very different the original species mingling and size differentiation indices gadow 1993 eqs 1 and 4 were often involved in the highest correlations the correlation space newly defined in this study is a promising starting point for a better understanding of natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity in forest ecosystems the concept allows us to see more clearly at which spatial scale within species size inequality is more important than between species size inequality the shape of the correlation space provides pointers as to what forest development stage a forest ecosystem is in and as a consequence what processes therefore are currently likely to be the most influential ones future studies are necessary to determine how the correlation space changes in time funding h w received funding from the

species and size diversity are maintained naturally from earlier studies we reported correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality wang et al 2020 pommerening et al 2020a 2021 these correlations were discovered at forest ecosystem level and do not necessarily have to exist when analysing individual species populations if they however occurred in species populations as well this would give a vital clue as to how the natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity work and how they are broken down into small spatial units of the forest ecosystem therefore this study focused on species size correlations among nearest neighbours in species populations in pursuing this objective we applied methods of point process statistics where the variability of spatial point patterns is studied in our case the points were defined as stem centre coordinates of trees and the species and size information constituted so called marks pommerening and grabarnik 2019 i e additional information associated with the points which may help to explain the point pattern in previous studies we learned that there are often correlations between mean spatial species mingling and mean measures of spatial size inequality of the species populations in the same woodland our original idea therefore was to study these correlations for only one pair of spatial species and size inequality indices in greater detail namely eqs 1 and 4 in table 1 and to see what they imply and what they depend on while engaging in such an analysis we realised that the problem is in fact more complex since correlations as expected not only varied with the neighbourhood size but also with different index combinations in the monitoring plot at jiaohe jilin province see section 2 2 plot d fig 1 a for example using k 5 nearest neighbours the correlations of eleven species mingling size inequality index combinations from table 1 were all positive and therefore the results were fairly consistent only the strength of the relationship differed between indices this however was not the case at jingouling also jilin province plot l fig 1b where only three index combinations were positively and eight were negatively correlated the results indicated that even the general trends of species size interactions were not consistent at this site from these and similar results we concluded that correlations between diversity indices can only be fully understood if several of them were considered simultaneously such an analysis strategy is also consistent with the textbook recommendation to always apply several seemingly competitive characteristics illian et al 2008 torquato 2002 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 therefore we decided to include all known characteristics relating to spatial species mingling and size inequality as a result we obtained an area or space that includes all correlations and their dependence on distance r which in analogy to the parameter space of models we termed correlation space accordingly the objective of this study was to map as much as possible the whole correlation space of spatial species mingling and size inequality by simultaneously varying neighbourhood size and index combinations our hypotheses were that 1 this mapping would result in shapes of correlation space characterising the relationship between spatial species mingling and size inequality and 2 that these shapes can then be ecologically interpreted 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatial diversity indices based on the literature we identified three indices relating to species mingling eqs 1 3 and six indices relating to size inequality eqs 4 9 the species specific variants of each index were calculated by limiting subject trees i to the individuals of the species under consideration whilst the k nearest neighbours were the natural neighbours of each subject tree according to euclidean distance and regardless of species this definition of neighbourhood is crucial to the interpretation of the correlation results gadow 1993 defined spatial species mingling as the mean heterospecific fraction of plants among the k nearest neighbours of a subject plant i eq 1 in table 1 due to the discrete nature of outcomes for a given k there are only k 1 possible values m i can take i e 0 k 1 k k k where the number in the numerator denotes the number of neighbours with a species different from that of tree i all index values lie between 0 and 1 in analogy to pielou s segregation index pielou 1977 species segregation ψ has been suggested by pommerening and uria diez 2017 here mean population mingling m is divided by expected species mingling e m eq 2 in table 1 ψ 0 if the species marks are spatially uncorrelated if the nearest neighbours and a given tree always tend to share the same species ψ is positive with a maximum at ψ 1 if all neighbours always tend to have a species different from that of the tree under study ψ is negative with a minimum at ψ 1 hui et al 2008 and 2011 proposed the richness weighted mingling index m i eq 3 in table 1 as an extension of the original mingling index by gadow 1993 by merging the concept of species mingling with the concept of species richness accordingly each m i from eq 1 is multiplied by the species richness s i among the k nearest neighbours we amended the index definition by introducing term c in table 1 to ensure that the number of species that are theoretically possible in a group of k 1 trees are considered correctly both the species segregation and the richness weighted mingling index are less dependent on overall population species richness than the original mingling index values of m i are generally smaller and take a larger range of different values than those of m i gadow 1993 defined size differentiation eq 4 in table 1 as the mean ratio of smaller sized and larger sized marks of the k nearest neighbours subtracted from one size differentiation produces continuous results between 0 and 1 and t i increases with increasing average size difference between neighbouring trees based on size differentiation eq 4 in table 1 pommerening and uria diez 2017 proposed size segregation y eq 5 in table 1 in analogy to species segregation ψ y 0 if the size marks are independently dispersed without any spatial correlation if the sizes of nearest neighbours and a given tree are always of similar magnitude y 1 if all neighbours always tend to have size marks quite different from that of the reference tree y is negative and tends towards 1 in the extreme case the size dominance index eq 6 in table 1 was introduced by hui et al 1998 and aguirre et al 2003 and gives the proportion of k nearest neighbours dominated by tree i the index draws on similarities with the construction of the mingling index thus transforming a continuous variable into a binary one and also produces only k 1 possible u i values a new size inequality index designed in this study is the weighted size dominance u i eq 7 in table 1 in contrast to eq 6 this index takes advantage of the continuous nature of size variables here u i from eq 6 is multiplied by mark m j of the k nearest neighbours and divided by the sum of marks of all neighbours excluding that of tree i in other words u i basically is the mark percentile of tree i i e the mark proportion of trees among the k nearest neighbours that are smaller than subject tree i albert 1999 suggested a combination of differentiation and dominance index the size dominance differentiation u i eq 8 in table 1 here the size differentiation of larger neighbours relative to subject tree i is subtracted from the size differentiation of smaller neighbours relative to tree i as a consequence the continuous value of u i can be between 1 and 1 negative values of u i indicate that tree i is suppressed by its neighbours the more positive the values of u i the more dominant is tree i finally pommerening et al 2020b defined the hyperbolic tangent index t i the index is based on trigonometric principles and the simplest variant is given in eq 9 in table 1 where the mode parameter α was set to 0 5 so that the exponents of the size marks take the value of 1 and as a result the index calculation simplifies to eq 9 like most indices in table 1 the index values lie between 0 and 1 the larger the value of t i the larger the size dominance of tree i these nine species and size diversity indices were included in our correlation analyses 2 2 study area and data

separately for all species populations that have more than 20 individuals which appeared to be a reasonable lower threshold stem diameter at breast height measured at 1 3 m above soil level was used as size characteristic throughout this study however any size variable or combinations of size variables can be included in similar work in calculating the species population means we varied the number of nearest neighbours k from 1 to 50 and applied the nn1 edge correction pommerening and stoyan 2006 even k 50 did not exceed an intertree distance range of 15 m in the dense woodlands we studied see section 2 2 for each number of k we calculated pearson s correlation index for combinations of mingling and size indices and recorded the mean distance between tree i and the k th nearest neighbour the index combinations we considered were m t eqs 1 4 m t eqs 3 4 ψ y eqs 2 5 m u eqs 1 6 m u eqs 3 6 m u eqs 1 7 m u eqs 3 7 m u eqs 1 8 m u eqs 3 8 m t eqs 1 9 and m t eqs 3 9 for each of these eleven pairs we had distance dependent correlation values corresponding to 50 different values of k we used a non parametric gaussian kernel estimator with bandwidth h 2 to construct non parametric trend curves for each of the eleven index relationships to comprehensively map the total correlation space between spatial species mingling and size inequality to determine the outer contour lines of the correlation space all spatially explicit correlation results of the eleven relationships were merged and from this merged data set we computed the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles we again applied a non parametric gaussian kernel estimator this time with bandwidth h 3 to the quantile data to define the shape of the correlation space when examining the graphical results of the correlation space between spatial species mingling and size inequality for each monitoring plot we realised that the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles defined recurrent shapes that could be used for classification and interpretation the shapes shown in fig 3 represent the basic correlation patterns observed in the forest monitoring plots we studied these idealised shapes are generic and likely to apply to many other woodlands across the temperate and subtropical climate zones often the observed patterns tend to be a combination of two or more shapes and or the boundaries deviate from linearity classifying the observed patterns according to the five types of fig 3 facilitates the interpretation of ecological processes in the respective forest ecosystems in general strong positive correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality implies that specimens of different species mingle at that scale that also have very different sizes whilst the sizes within specimens of the same species do not differ much pommerening et al 2021 strong negative correlations on the other hand suggest that the sizes between specimens of different species are rather similar but that size diversity is high within specimens of the same species at that spatial scale positive and negative correlations of the same absolute magnitude therefore describe very different qualities of spatial interaction for the relationship ψ y in parts slightly different interpretations apply due to the specific definitions of the indices involved increasing distance implies that tree neighbourhoods become larger since distance and neighbourhood size in fig 3 increase vertically from the bottom up the shapes shown in figs 4 and 5 also need to be interpreted that way we found that the requirement to interpret the correlation space shapes in the direction of increasing distance markedly reduced interpretation and classification ambiguity according to this requirement we labelled mixed or transitional shapes in such a way that the first letter represents the prevailing type at short distances and the following letter s indicate the pattern at larger distances correlation shape a describes situations where correlations are initially both high and low or negative at short distances and with increasing distance neighbourhood size tend to converge towards the symmetry axis median of the correlation space which often is at r 0 but can also occur at any other positive or negative correlation value in most cases this implies that correlations are strongest or weakest when only the immediate neighbourhood involving short distances is considered shape b reverses shape a here the correlation coefficients approach the median or symmetry axis of the correlation space at short distances and as distances increase the shape then opens like a funnel implying that correlations both increase and decrease or become negative with distance this usually means that correlations between spatial species and size mingling are both stronger and weaker or negative when larger neighbourhoods are considered shapes a and b describe situations where the spatial correlation patterns at a particular distance r are not consistent across the range of spatial indices listed in table 1 in the case of shapes a and b the median the symmetry axis of the correlation space is approximately constant throughout the distance range shape c implies a gradual shift in correlation with increasing neighbourhood size and distance e g from high to low or from positive to negative correlation values this can mean that correlations between spatial species and size mingling are strong when only the immediate neighbourhood at short distances is considered and then weaken when more neighbours are involved the shape can also imply that the quality of relationship is reversed i e that predominantly positive correlations turn into negative ones shape d is the opposite of shape c implying a gradual shift from low to high or from negative to positive correlations with increasing neighbourhood size and distance shapes c and d describe situations with spatial correlations that are more or less consistent across the range of spatial indices listed in table 1 but differ with r the gradual shift also affects the median the symmetry axis of the correlation space in shapes c and d i e the median varies with increasing neighbourhood size finally shape e describes situations where the correlation space is more or less constant with increasing or decreasing neighbourhood size the median correlation coefficient the symmetry axis of the correlation space can be near 0 but can also be located elsewhere whilst being approximately constant parallel to the ordinate throughout the distance range this pattern suggests species and size correlations that are largely independent of spatial scales across all spatial indices in table 1 and across all spatial scales the correlations between species mingling and size inequality are largely consistent all calculations were carried out using our own r scripts version 3 6 3 r development core team 2020 and the spatstat baddeley et al 2016 package 3 results 3 1 basic statistics all research plots are located at upland sites and elevation varies from 600 m jd to 1880 m asl xsd densities in the 36 plots ranged from 746 in jb to 5804 trees per hectare in plot ly the minimum number of species observed was 9 in plots tfb and tfd whilst the maximum was 86 in ly mean arithmetic diameter at breast height dbh was smallest at ly 5 8 cm and largest at jc 18 3 cm the coefficient of variation had a minimum at jsb with 0 39 and a maximum at ly with 1 42 basal area ranged from 13 9 m2 tff to 45 9 m2 ly per hectare mean species mingling for both indices was lowest at jsb m 0 43 m 0 19 and highest at jc m 0 83 m 0 59 it is also at jsb where mean size differentiation is lowest t 0 33 and at tfj and tfl size differentiation is highest t 0 53 these values indicate generally high species mingling whilst size inequality is moderate 3 2 correlation space already at first glance it is evident that there is a high diversity of correlation curve shapes in some cases such as jb jgg jgi jgk ly fig 4 and tfh tfj tfh tfj xsa xsb fig 5 the correlation space is more or less fully filled with index correlation curves with other monitoring plots notably in the case of da and db there are larger gaps in the correlation space for some plots the index correlation curves largely run in parallel one to another for others they intersect while the former behaviour suggests that correlation does not depend much on distance and neighbourhood size in the latter case correlation changes with distance correlations can both increase and decrease with distance marked changes in correlation with distance are often responsible for the formation of mixed types of correlation space that include more than one letter from fig 3 in plot db fig 4 for example correlations m t and m t are very high for small distances and then dramatically decrease towards zero while r approaches 10 m for the same index correlations an opposite trend can be observed in plot da fig 4 here correlations are very low for short distances or low numbers of indices and then increase towards 0 5 at r 5 m a further increase of distance does not change the correlation strength in rare occasions initially positive correlations cross over to become negative correlations this is often associated with pattern c fig 3 see for example correlations m t and m t in tfa tfd xsa fig 5 it is also interesting to note that there is a tendency for correlation space shapes involving type c to include some strong correlations at short distances see for example jc jgh tff tfk tfl xsa xsb and xsc figs 4 and 5 the relationships m t and m t are very often involved with strong correlations in these monitoring plots as mentioned in the introduction it is not uncommon that for one and the same monitoring plot some of the index correlations are positive and some are negative e g da db jgd jge jgf jgl jsb ly fig 4 and tfa tfc tfd tfe tfk xsc xsd fig 5 there is no trend for any of the index pairings to be always at a particular location in the correlation space e g at the lower or upper boundary however the two combinations with the same size inequality index but different species mingling measures are usually quite close together hence we have always assigned the same colour to them the pairings m u m u m u m u m u m u m t and m t often occur close together this seems to suggest that the index construction is similar or highlights similar aspects of size inequality whilst combinations involving t and y often show a different behaviour in fact the former pairings apparently involve dominance indices whilst t and y include differentiation indices dominance indices attempt to express how the size of the subject tree relates to that of its neighbours whilst diversity indices focus on size diversity in the neighbourhood as a whole it is also worth noting that the selection of small k such as k 5 or k 10 is as suspected not always a choice that is located near the maximum correlation of a given index combination at this spatial location neighbourhood size correlations can be strong in the case of the be correlation space pattern see for example jgl da fig 4 tfc fig 5 fixed k 4 is a popular choice in the literature aguirre et al 2003 hui et al 2011 and often seems to miss out on stronger correlations at k 4 the most striking observation is that the shape of the correlation space differs from monitoring plot to monitoring plot whereby typical patterns are clearly recognizable fig 3 so that each plot can be assigned to one of these typical patterns or to a combination of mostly two types which supports our first hypothesis the generic types can be interpreted as explained in section 2 3 overall combinations of correlation types prevail over the basic types defined in fig 3 this implies that in the majority of cases correlations are subject to change with distance only a b c and e occur as basic types the proportions are quite evenly spread over the range of combinations see fig 6 with 5 monitoring plots out of 36 combination eb is the most common type followed by be and c combination eb implies that correlations are fairly constant with increasing neighbourhood size at first and then increase or decrease at larger distances see section 2 3 rare correlation space types are a acb bc dc and ea however the differences in absolute frequencies are comparatively small 4 discussion correlations between spatial species and size diversity are an important notion of forest ecosystems and have until recently not received much recognition they frequently occur in managed and unmanaged woodlands and form an important part of the mechanisms of natural maintenance of biodiversity in forest ecosystems these are important to understand in order to actively mitigate the adverse effect of climate change on biodiversity through appropriate forest management in pursuit of a better understanding of these natural mechanisms we analysed correlations between species population means of spatial species and size diversity that coexist in the same woodland 36 large monitoring plots from china with a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 86 species see table 2 were examined for these correlations in earlier research we learned that the interaction between conspecific and heterospecific size structure plays a crucial role in these correlations wang et al 2020 pommerening et al 2020a 2021 positive correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality imply that specimens of different species mingle at that spatial scale that also have very different sizes whilst the sizes within specimens of the same species do not differ much negative correlations on the other hand suggest that the sizes between specimens of different species are rather similar but that size diversity is high within specimens of the same species at that spatial scale we found that different species mingling and size inequality indices show different correlation patterns in the same woodland this is plausibly related to the index algorithm and the corresponding focus these diversity indices have e g size diversity as opposed to size dominance of the subject tree in future studies more attention should be paid to the distinction between these two inequality measures for understanding species mingling and size inequality correlations better we included nine different indices resulting in eleven index combinations by computing the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles from the combined correlation data we were able to define the species size inequality correlation space for each of the 36 monitoring plots when considering the shapes of these correlation spaces we realised that all of them can be described by relying on five generic types fig 3 hypothesis 1 either as single types or as a combination of 2 3 each specific shape of the correlation space of a monitoring plot can be understood as the unique signature of a forest ecosystem in time in our study there was a high diversity of different correlation space types and accordingly the proportions of plots were quite evenly spread over the range of combinations the most common type was eb implying that correlations are initially fairly constant but then increase or decrease at larger distances interestingly type c usually involved high correlations of m t and m t at short distances with the same type and relationships there were cases where initially positive correlations would cross the symmetry axis of the correlation space to eventually become negative correlations these are particularly interesting since for the same monitoring plots the quality of correlation radically changes at different spatial scales i e from between species correlations to within species correlations or vice versa these relationships highlight that the natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity are complex and can result in different patterns at different scales size differentiation t is related to the test function of the mark variogram pommerening and grabarnik 2019 and motz et al 2010 found a significant correlation between size differentiation and forest inventory design the popular choice of k 4 nearest neighbours is likely to take advantage of absolute correlation maxima only if the correlation space type is be for other types the absolute maximum is often situated at different k and r naturally it is not a requirement to select k in such a way that the correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality are maximised however since the locations of absolute correlation maxima indicate neighbourhood scales where it is very likely that important processes occur it could be helpful to choose k accordingly in this study the species mingling size inequality correlation space has emerged as a new method to identify important neighbourhood processes along with the spatial scales involved the allocation of the basic types of fig 3 is fairly straightforward although there can be ambiguous cases however the introduction of the requirement to interpret the correlation space shapes in the direction of increasing distance has greatly helped to keep ambiguity to a minimum in general the determination of correlation space type much supports the ecological interpretation hypothesis 2 the shapes of the correlation space can for example be related to specific development stages such as those defined by for example oliver and larson 1996 p 148f and emborg et al 2000 very young forest development stages stand initiation or formation phase for example can be identified from their comparatively short correlation space which often reveals a simple shape involving type e see for example tfi and tfj fig 5 often correlations here are weak and do not change much with increasing distance and neighbourhood size later forest development stages typically have a correlation space extending into the region of larger distances and often exhibit a more complex shape see for example jb jc and xsa figs 4 and 5 5 conclusions the correlations between spatial species mingling and size inequality highlight that the processes causing them are scale dependent and that for different aspects of size inequality e g size diversity versus size dominance correlations can be very different the original species mingling and size differentiation indices gadow 1993 eqs 1 and 4 were often involved in the highest correlations the correlation space newly defined in this study is a promising starting point for a better understanding of natural mechanisms of maintaining tree diversity in forest ecosystems the concept allows us to see more clearly at which spatial scale within species size inequality is more important than between species size inequality the shape of the correlation space provides pointers as to what forest development stage a forest ecosystem is in and as a consequence what processes therefore are currently likely to be the most influential ones future studies are necessary to determine how the correlation space changes in time funding h w received funding from the

24571,species area curve is widely used to describe biological diversity across spatial scales however there are major ecological and statistical limitations in its application and inference such as sampling methods species area scales and statistical functions that must be considered in diversity assessment this study aimed to explain relations among sampling methods species area curve scales and statistical functions in the perk forested catchment zagros forests western iran we studied plant diversity during the peak of the growing season from early april to late may 2019 the stratified random sampling was applied to collect species richness data on the same sized plots 4m2 the mean of data from noncontiguous plots was used to construct scheiner s type iiib curve a comprehensive set of species area models including five convex and three sigmoid models were tested akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were used to choose the best fitted function model furthermore the log error of extrapolation lee was used to assess the reliability of extrapolation both aic and bic results suggested that the lomolino and cumulative weibull functions as the best fit curves for extrapolating species richness beyond sampling area however the lee showed the superiority of the rational function this discrepancy between lee and both aic and bic introduced models originates from the lee limitation of application to tenfold of the sampling area this study showed that the sampling scheme and the study scale are the two important factors in the shape of statistical function convex or sigmoid which is using in constructing species area curves in contrast to the prevailing use of power function the results showed that in a broader scale like the landscape scale the lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are superior in estimating species richness in zagros forests western iran keywords curve fitting species area functions species richness

rosenzweig 1995 scheiner 2004 has attributed the earliest published instance to de candole 1855 one of the species area curve applications is to describe the biological diversity over spatial scales it explains how the total number of species can rise by adding more sampling units to the sampling area the increase in the total number of species arises from two reasons 1 it is more likely to find more species when the searching area enlarge and consequently the number of individuals increases 2 a larger sample area may include a more heterogeneous environment that supports more niches for different species especially when the sample area is very large the species area curve has common uses in ecology 1 it can improve our basic understanding of biodiversity i e estimation of diversity via extrapolation he et al 1996 2 it can be used for establishing a common grain for analysis scheiner et al 2000 whittaker et al 2001 and 3 it can improve our ability to conserve biodiversity

curve is built from a set of strictly nested blocks a type ii curve is based on an area divided into contiguous blocks and then recombined into sets of different areas type iia and iib are distinguished by whether the concatenation is done with adjacent blocks only or with any blocks in both cases the curve is constructed using multiple blocks of the same area type iiia and iiib curves are similar to type ii curves except that the constituent blocks are not contiguous finally a type iv curve is based on islands that differ in the area with each island appearing only once and never combined with other islands to form units of larger size this variety in sampling patterns and application of derived data in making species area curves needs careful attention in the choice of statistical function extrapolation beyond the sampling area is a prominent application of the species area curve however goodness of fit within a fitted range of areas does not necessarily guarantee a good extrapolation capability there is a substantial uncertainty in selecting the best species area curve model for a given dataset guilhaumon et al 2008 stiles and scheiner 2007 several models have been proposed by ecologists and conservationists for constructing species area curves including power exponential negative exponential monod rational logistic and lomolino guilhaumon et al 2010 tjørve 2003 tjørve 2009 table 2 the power model has been used more than other models hubbell et al 2008 kier et al 2005 ulrich 2005 but it often overestimates the number of species over a large area many reasons contribute to this failure including varying plot shape e g rectangles vs squares method of scoring species use of the disjunctive plots vs nested plots and plot arrangement dengler 2008 there is no single best statistical model to fit the plant species area curve guilhaumon et al 2008 so conservation biologists faced uncertainty when they try to upscale diversity at a larger scale without independently estimating values at larger scales to corroborate the up scaled species area curve smith 2010 there is no common agreement on how to select the best model for the species area curve connor and mccoy 1979 fattorini 2007 a statistical test has been proposed by dengler 2009 to assess the reliability of extrapolation the log error of extrapolation which is based on the discrepancy between diversity predicted by a statistical model and actual diversity at the largest scale the visual inspection of a lack of fit is also frequently applied in species area curves literature it is done by viewing the original graphs connor and mccoy 1979 or the plots of the residuals flather 1996 fattorini 2007 visual categorization based on subjective inspection is the weakest possible goodness of fit test mcgill 2003 however no metric ensures accuracy when models are extrapolated far beyond the range of the data dolnik 2003 introduced a few but unsystematic approaches to test which regression model is the most suitable for extrapolating species richness recently some attempts have been made in zagros forests to recognize representative areas hot spots based on plant diversity in order to select some areas as forest reserves pilehvar et al 2010 species richness threatened species number endemic species number and exotic species invasion have been used as indicators for conservation among them species richness is the most common pilehvar et al 2010 asaad et al 2017 the central zagros mountains are covered by scattered forests mainly coppice oak trees quercus brantii that constitute degraded low forests other companion trees and shrubs include pistacia spp rhamnus spp and amygdalus spp the understory herbaceous vegetation cover is diverse owing to scattered tree distribution these forests suffering the anthropogenic disturbances including firewood harvesting non wood product utilization farming and livestock grazing the zagros forests are publicly owned and managed by the government the livelihood of local communities depends on forest resources and their income mainly comes from farming and cattle husbandry in forest ecosystems these semi mediterranean forests are valuable sites for testing the idea of construction species area curves due to their heterogeneity and diverse plant species the main focus of this study is to find the best statistical function for upscaling herbaceous richness on a relatively large spatial scale at zagros forests western iran this study sought to reveal the effects of sampling schemes and species area scales on the statistical function shape we hypothesized that there will be a variety of statistical functions that fit the species area curve the best based on the study scale and the sampling scheme 2 methods 2 1 study area the perk forested catchment is located in the southeast of khorramabad the center of lorestan province zagros mountain western iran 33 13 33 16 n 48 30 48 37 e and covers an area of 2920 ha mainly at altitudes of 1695 2528 m above msl the mean annual precipitation and temperature are about 504 mm and 17 1 c respectively islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo 1951 2019 we selected this catchment for this study because of its relatively intact nature 2 2 field sampling the stratified random sampling was chosen to collect data on plant species richness in the herbaceous layer as recommended by various studies for example scheiner 2003 2004 chong stohlgren 2007 pilehvar et al 2010 regarding the altitude gradient four quercus graminae quercus acer pyrus quercus astragalus daphne and quercus achantolimon lonicera vegetation types based on dominant species can be defined the altitude influences these vegetation types but not at an exact order in elevation fig 1 noncontiguous plots of the same area type iii b scheiner 2003 or disjunctive sar smith 2010 in a stratified random sampling were applied to collect data on species richness pilehvar et al 2010 each vegetation type was considered as one stratum and plots were distributed randomly on them sampling was performed from early april to late may 2019 and 40 plots 4 m2 were distributed randomly in the four vegetation types table 1 scientific and common names appendix and the cover percent of vascular plant species in each plot were recorded the coordinates x y and z of plots were also marked by gps for gis mapping 2 3 data analysis we construct species area curves based on scheme presented by scheiner 2003 because it reflects many of the designs commonly used in conservation biology based on this scheme division the mean value of data from noncontiguous plots is used to construct a type iiib curve and spatial information is ignored on a broad scale this type has been frequently used in determining species richness assessment the mean number of species in noncontiguous plots was computed by pc ord for windows version 4 20 mccune and mefford 1999 eight species area models including five convex models power exponential negative exponential monod and rational function and three sigmoid models logistic lomolino and cumulative weibull were fitted to data set using r ver 3 0 2 software table 2 2 4 model evaluation model evaluation criteria are figures of merit or performance measures for competing models we used akaike information criterion aic to select the best fitted function to species area curves many model selection procedures that take the form of a penalized likelihood a negative log likelihood plus a penalty term is proposed by akaike akaike 1973 the aic is a model selection criterion that estimates kullback leibler information and is widely used in ecological studies burnham and anderson 2002 the best fitted function has the least value of the aic since simply increasing parameters tends to improve the statistical fit of functions to data as an artifact of their formulation the aic provides a means to compensate for this tendency the bayesian information criterion bic is another criterion for model evaluation that has been introduced by schwarz 1978 they share the same goodness of fit term but the penalty term of bic k ln n is potentially much more stringent than the penalty term of aic 2k 1 a i c d θ m l e 2 k 2 b i c d θ m l e k ln n where the function d θ m l e represents the deviance function twice the negative log likelihood the vector of maximum likelihood parameter estimates mles k represents the number of model parameters and n represents the sample size the best function for estimating species richness has the lowest values in the full range model we also used the log error of extrapolation lee dengler 2009 to assess the accuracy of species area curves for extrapolating species richness beyond the sample area this procedure was done by using only 10 percent of data for constructing the species area curve then we compared the predicted richness values by using these new species area curves with the actual species richness in the whole sampling area this study uses a sampling method in which plots were located randomly and far apart in this case computing actual species richness values is not simple because the richness values for the sample area usually deviate from average curve owing to the non average environmental condition finally the deviation between predicted and actual species richness for the whole sample area was calculated on a log s scale 3 results we found 145 species belonging to 110 genera and 32 families in 40 plots in four distinct vegetation types of the studied catchment the most dominant life forms in the study area were therophytes 47 6 geophytes 18 62 chamaephytes 15 86 hemicryptophytes 11 72 and phanerophytes 6 2 appendix the r2 values for all functions were statistically significant p 0 05 the exponential function had the lowest r2 value 96 among the functions table 3 the aic and bic showed the lowest value for lomolino function cumulative weibull function possesses the second place and they provide the best fit for this data orderly but it seems that cumulative weibull function underestimates species richness in the study area the calculated values of the lee using only 10 percent of the sample area for seven of eight functions are shown in table 4 the rational function had the lowest value of lee and according to dengler 2002 it is therefore the most suitable function for predicting species richness over perk forest catchment r 3 0 2 software failed to compute monod function parameters because of insufficient data we used four plot data to construct each function and this amount of data did not provide enough data for the monod function but other function parameters were calculated and the deviation between predicted and actual species richness in the whole sampling area was computed by these functions on log s scale 4 discussion sampling scheme for plant species diversity assessment considerably depends on the aim of the study vegetation types financial resources and time the comparison of previous floristic studies pilehvar et al 2010 abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 in the neighborhood of perk forested catchment with the sampling scheme used in this study indicated that the noncontiguous plots of the same area type iii b scheiner 2003 in a stratified random sampling can find the majority of plant species in the area pilehvar et al 2010 used 21 250 m2 multiscale modified whittaker plots in the hashtad pahloo forest in the central zagros western iran in the vicinity of the perk forested catchment with similar site conditions and found 211 species abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 found 205 species by using surveying method in the hashtad pahloo forest whereas in the present study 145 species were found using only 40 plots with an area of 4m2 these similar findings show the capability of stratified random sampling with relatively small plots for estimating total species richness over the landscape level there is always a tradeoff between alpha and beta diversity owing to plot size in the same sampling area increasing plot size can increase alpha diversity while decreasing plot size leads to an increase in plot numbers and consequently beta diversity will be increased crist and veech 2006 smith 2010 since species overlap among plots decreases with distance tjørve and turner 2009 the differences of distance caused by this sampling scheme affect the beta diversity and hence species area curve several factors can influence species area curves including random placement coleman 1981 habitat diversity williams 1943 minimum area effects tjørve and turner 2009 and evolutionary independence of biogeographic provinces rosenzweig 1995 the latter was not considered in this study but the other factors especially habitat diversity played a major role in producing the shape of the species area curve beyond choosing an appropriate sampling scheme for extrapolating species richness on a vast area finding the best fitted function is necessary many functions can be fitted to a data set therefore to discover the optimal fitted function among many function models we need to compare and analyze multiple functions to compare different models with unequal numbers of parameters it is necessary to use a goodness of fit measure that adequately penalizes for the extra parameters quinn and keough 2002 the values of the aic and bic showed that lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are superior to power function for estimating species richness over a larger area although all of them have the same value of r2 0 99 this is in contradiction to the findings of many studies for example hubbell et al 2008 kier et al 2005 and ulrich 2005 that have introduced power function as the best for upscaling species richness in smaller scales species area curves like a forest stand the convex function can better fit to data and can estimate more accurate species richness while in larger scales species area curves like a landscape with different vegetation types sigmoid functions fit better to data and predict species richness more accurately convex functions like power function lack an asymptote williams 1995 and species richness increase unlimitedly with increasing area leading to unrealistic high estimation of total species richness at landscape area gleason 1922 krishnamani et al 2004 ugland et al 2003 it seems that this overestimation may have negligible effects on a small scale or intermediate scale stiles and scheiner 2007 species abundance and spatial distribution are the two most important factors in interpreting species diversity and determining the relationship between area and the expected number of species to be found in that area he and legendre 2002 plotkin et al 2000 fridley et al 2006 argued that at the fine spatial scales accumulation of species richness with area follows a power law these are common species that raise the species area curve most strongly whereas rare species add to the curve at coarser scales the effect of aggregation on the curvature of the species area curve is greatest with rare species tjørve 2003 by moving from one vegetation type to another and on a coarser scale rare species are expected to be found increasingly and uneven abundance contributed to lower curvature of the species area curve the interpretation of type iii b scheiner 2003 species area curve depends on the area extent hui 2008 and plot size palmer and white 1994 in a large area like a forest landscape more species are expected to be observed where distances among plots increase an increase in space between two plots results in a decrease in species overlap between the two plots of different vegetation types palmer and white 1994 the flora of two earlier performed studies in the neighborhood of the perk forested catchment abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 and pilehvar et al 2010 have identified 205 and 211 plant species respectively these results indicate the similarity of predicted species richness by lomolino function with the actual species richness while power function predicts species richness far beyond actual value introducing new species from different vegetation types leads to a steep slope curve in the power function species area curve on the other hand as the plot size decreases the number of species for a given area increases smith 2010 the large area of perk forested catchment and small size of plots 4 m2 may lead to overestimation of species richness by power function while the r2 value is high tjørve 2003 states that convex functions should best describe type iii b curves and sigmoid functions should best fit type iv curves while the results of this study showed that in contradiction to tjørve 2003 sigmoid functions fit better to type iii b curves this may be due to the effect of habitat heterogeneity of the perk forested catchment on curve shape as the combined effect of spatial patterns and species abundances tjørve and turner 2009 it has been shown that aggregation and uneven abundances depress the species area curve between their endpoints he and legendre 2002 lomolino 2000 that may produce sigmoid shape species area curves the results of computing lee showed that the rational function has the least lee value and based on dengler 2009 it is the most suitable function for predicting species richness over perk forested catchment this is in contradiction to the aforementioned results based on aic and bic as stated in dengler 2009 extrapolation by the lee method is proper for tenfold of the sample area and beyond this area it is deficient this can be a good reason for the failure of the lee method in determining the best function for extrapolating species richness at the landscape scale in conclusion in contrast to many studies ulrich and buszko 2003 drakare et al 2006 surendra et al 2009 azovsky 2011 van der merwe and van rooyen 2011 mashayekhi et al 2014 that introduce the power function family as the best function to describe the species area relationship many factors such as sampling scale and study scale can play major roles in the shape of the species area curve and proper function to describe it according to the results functions with convex shapes such as the power function are more appropriate for small to intermediate scales whereas sigmoid functions like lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are more accurate for larger scales generally this method of study can be used in zagros oak

24571,species area curve is widely used to describe biological diversity across spatial scales however there are major ecological and statistical limitations in its application and inference such as sampling methods species area scales and statistical functions that must be considered in diversity assessment this study aimed to explain relations among sampling methods species area curve scales and statistical functions in the perk forested catchment zagros forests western iran we studied plant diversity during the peak of the growing season from early april to late may 2019 the stratified random sampling was applied to collect species richness data on the same sized plots 4m2 the mean of data from noncontiguous plots was used to construct scheiner s type iiib curve a comprehensive set of species area models including five convex and three sigmoid models were tested akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were used to choose the best fitted function model furthermore the log error of extrapolation lee was used to assess the reliability of extrapolation both aic and bic results suggested that the lomolino and cumulative weibull functions as the best fit curves for extrapolating species richness beyond sampling area however the lee showed the superiority of the rational function this discrepancy between lee and both aic and bic introduced models originates from the lee limitation of application to tenfold of the sampling area this study showed that the sampling scheme and the study scale are the two important factors in the shape of statistical function convex or sigmoid which is using in constructing species area curves in contrast to the prevailing use of power function the results showed that in a broader scale like the landscape scale the lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are superior in estimating species richness in zagros forests western iran keywords curve fitting species area functions species richness zagros forest coppice oak forest nomenclature the international plant names index 2012 1 introduction species area curve has a long history in ecological studies connor and mccoy 1979 macarthur 1967 rosenzweig 1995 scheiner 2004 has attributed the earliest published instance to de candole 1855 one of the species area curve applications is to describe the biological diversity over spatial scales it explains how the total number of species can rise by adding more sampling units to the sampling area the increase in the total number of species arises from two reasons 1 it is more likely to find more species when the searching area enlarge and consequently the number of individuals increases 2 a larger sample area may include a more heterogeneous environment that supports more niches for different species especially when the sample area is very large the species area curve has common uses in ecology 1 it can improve our basic understanding of biodiversity i e estimation of diversity via extrapolation he et al 1996 2 it can be used for establishing a common grain for analysis scheiner et al 2000 whittaker et al 2001 and 3 it can improve our ability to conserve biodiversity conservation biologists use the species area curve to attain several goals including finding species richness at regional scales from sample plots chong and stohlgren 2007 colwell and coddington 1994 pilehvar et al 2010 plotkin et al 2000 estimating species extinction rate due to habitat conversion ney nifle and mangel 2000 pimm et al 2006 producing biodiversity maps kier et al 2005 and identifying biodiversity hotspots at small scales for priority setting in biodiversity conservation fattorini 2007 guilhaumon et al 2008 veech 2000 species area curve has extensive application for both animal and plant diversity studies scheiner 2004 divided species area curve into six types based on the pattern of sampling nested contiguous noncontiguous or island and how the data are combined to form relationship curves whether successively larger area are constructed in a spatially explicit fashion or not and whether the curve is constructed from a single value or mean value a type i curve is built from a set of strictly nested blocks a type ii curve is based on an area divided into contiguous blocks and then recombined into sets of different areas type iia and iib are distinguished by whether the concatenation is done with adjacent blocks only or with any blocks in both cases the curve is constructed using multiple blocks of the same area type iiia and iiib curves are similar to type ii curves except that the constituent blocks are not contiguous finally a type iv curve is based on islands that differ in the area with each island appearing only once and never combined with other islands to form units of larger size this variety in sampling patterns and application of derived data in making species area curves needs careful attention in the choice of statistical function extrapolation beyond the sampling area is a prominent application of the species area curve however goodness of fit within a fitted range of areas does not necessarily guarantee a good extrapolation capability there is a substantial uncertainty in selecting the best species area curve model for a given dataset guilhaumon et al 2008 stiles and scheiner 2007 several models have been proposed by ecologists and conservationists for constructing species area curves including power exponential negative exponential monod rational logistic and lomolino guilhaumon et al 2010 tjørve 2003 tjørve 2009 table 2 the power model has been used more than other models hubbell et al 2008 kier et al 2005 ulrich 2005 but it often overestimates the number of species over a large area many reasons contribute to this failure including varying plot shape e g rectangles vs squares method of scoring species use of the disjunctive plots vs nested plots and plot arrangement dengler 2008 there is no single best statistical model to fit the plant species area curve guilhaumon et al 2008 so conservation biologists faced uncertainty when they try to upscale diversity at a larger scale without independently estimating values at larger scales to corroborate the up scaled species area curve smith 2010 there is no common agreement on how to select the best model for the species area curve connor and mccoy 1979 fattorini 2007 a statistical test has been proposed by dengler 2009 to assess the reliability of extrapolation the log error of extrapolation which is based on the discrepancy between diversity predicted by a statistical model and actual diversity at the largest scale the visual inspection of a lack of fit is also frequently applied in species area curves literature it is done by viewing the original graphs connor and mccoy 1979 or the plots of the residuals flather 1996 fattorini 2007 visual categorization based on subjective inspection is the weakest possible goodness of fit test mcgill 2003 however no metric ensures accuracy when models are extrapolated far beyond the range of the data dolnik 2003 introduced a few but unsystematic approaches to test which

order to select some areas as forest reserves pilehvar et al 2010 species richness threatened species number endemic species number and exotic species invasion have been used as indicators for conservation among them species richness is the most common pilehvar et al 2010 asaad et al 2017 the central zagros mountains are covered by scattered forests mainly coppice oak trees quercus brantii

quercus astragalus daphne and quercus achantolimon lonicera vegetation types based on dominant species can be defined the altitude influences these vegetation types but not at an exact order in elevation fig 1 noncontiguous plots of the same area type iii b scheiner 2003 or disjunctive sar smith 2010 in a stratified random sampling were applied to collect data on species richness pilehvar et al 2010 each vegetation type was considered as one stratum and plots were distributed randomly on them sampling was performed from early april to late may 2019 and 40 plots 4 m2 were distributed randomly in the four vegetation types table 1 scientific and common names appendix and the cover percent of vascular plant species in each plot were recorded the coordinates x y and z of plots were also marked by gps for gis mapping 2 3 data analysis we construct species area curves based on scheme presented by scheiner 2003 because it reflects many of the designs commonly used in conservation biology based on this scheme division the mean value of data from noncontiguous plots is used to construct a type iiib curve and spatial information is ignored on a broad scale this type has been frequently used in determining species richness assessment the mean number of species in noncontiguous plots was computed by pc ord for windows version 4 20 mccune and mefford 1999 eight species area models including five convex models power exponential negative exponential monod and rational function and three sigmoid models logistic lomolino and cumulative weibull were fitted to data set using r ver 3 0 2 software table 2 2 4 model evaluation model evaluation criteria are figures of merit or performance measures for competing models we used akaike information criterion aic to select the best fitted function to species area curves many model selection procedures that take the form of a penalized likelihood a negative log likelihood plus a penalty term is proposed by akaike akaike 1973 the aic is a model selection criterion that estimates kullback leibler information and is widely used in ecological studies burnham and anderson 2002 the best fitted function has the least value of the aic since simply increasing parameters tends to improve the statistical fit of functions to data as an artifact of their formulation the aic provides a means to compensate for this tendency the bayesian information criterion bic is another criterion for model evaluation that has been introduced by schwarz 1978 they share the same goodness of fit term but the penalty term of bic k ln n is potentially much more stringent than the penalty term of aic 2k 1 a i c d θ m l e 2 k 2 b i c d θ m l e k ln n where the function d θ m l e represents the deviance function twice the negative log likelihood the vector of maximum likelihood parameter estimates mles k represents the number of model parameters and n represents the sample size the best function for estimating species richness has the lowest values in the full range model we also used the log error of extrapolation lee dengler 2009 to assess the accuracy of species area curves for extrapolating species richness beyond the sample area this procedure was done by using only 10 percent of data for constructing the species area curve then we compared the predicted richness values by using these new species area curves with the actual species richness in the whole sampling area this study uses a sampling method in which plots were located randomly and far apart in this case computing actual species richness values is not simple because the richness values for the sample area usually deviate from average curve owing to the non average environmental condition finally the deviation between predicted and actual species richness for the whole sample area was calculated on a log s scale 3 results we found 145 species belonging to 110 genera and 32 families in 40 plots in four distinct vegetation types of the studied catchment the most dominant life forms in the study area were therophytes 47 6 geophytes 18 62 chamaephytes 15 86 hemicryptophytes 11 72 and phanerophytes 6 2 appendix the r2 values for all functions were statistically significant p 0 05 the exponential function had the lowest r2 value 96 among the functions table 3 the aic and bic showed the lowest value for lomolino function cumulative weibull function possesses the second place and they provide the best fit for this data orderly but it seems that cumulative weibull function underestimates species richness in the study area the calculated values of the lee using only 10 percent of the sample area for seven of eight functions are shown in table 4 the rational function had the lowest value of lee and according to dengler 2002 it is therefore the most suitable function for predicting species richness over perk forest catchment r 3 0 2 software failed to compute monod function parameters because of insufficient data we used four plot data to construct each function and this amount of data did not provide enough data for the monod function but other function parameters were calculated and the deviation between predicted and actual species richness in the whole sampling area was computed by these functions on log s scale 4 discussion sampling scheme for plant species diversity assessment considerably depends on the aim of the study vegetation types financial resources and time the comparison of previous floristic studies pilehvar et al 2010 abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 in the neighborhood of perk forested catchment with the sampling scheme used in this study indicated that the noncontiguous plots of the same area type iii b scheiner 2003 in a stratified random sampling can find the majority of plant species in the area pilehvar et al 2010 used 21 250 m2 multiscale modified whittaker plots in the hashtad pahloo forest in the central zagros western iran in the vicinity of the perk forested catchment with similar site conditions and found 211 species abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 found 205 species by using surveying method in the hashtad pahloo forest whereas in the present study 145 species were found using only 40 plots with an area of 4m2 these similar findings show the capability of stratified random sampling with relatively small plots for estimating total species richness over the landscape level there is always a tradeoff between alpha and beta diversity owing to plot size in the same sampling area increasing plot size can increase alpha diversity while decreasing plot size leads to an increase in plot numbers and consequently beta diversity will be increased crist and veech 2006 smith 2010 since species overlap among plots decreases with distance tjørve and turner 2009 the differences of distance caused by this sampling scheme affect the beta diversity and hence species area curve several factors can influence species area curves including random placement coleman 1981 habitat diversity williams 1943 minimum area effects tjørve and turner 2009 and evolutionary independence of biogeographic provinces rosenzweig 1995 the latter was not considered in this study but the other factors especially habitat diversity played a major role in producing the shape of the species area curve beyond choosing an appropriate sampling scheme for extrapolating species richness on a vast area finding the best fitted function is necessary many functions can be fitted to a data set therefore to discover the optimal fitted function among many function models we need to compare and analyze multiple functions to compare different models with unequal numbers of parameters it is necessary to use a goodness of fit measure that adequately penalizes for the extra parameters quinn and keough 2002 the values of the aic and bic showed that lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are superior to power function for estimating species richness over a larger area although all of them have the same value of r2 0 99 this is in contradiction to the findings of many studies for example hubbell et al 2008 kier et al 2005 and ulrich 2005 that have introduced power function as the best for upscaling species richness in smaller scales species area curves like a forest stand the convex function can better fit to data and can estimate more accurate species richness while in larger scales species area curves like a landscape with different vegetation types sigmoid functions fit better to data and predict species richness more accurately convex functions like power function lack an asymptote williams 1995 and species richness increase unlimitedly with increasing area leading to unrealistic high estimation of total species richness at landscape area gleason 1922 krishnamani et al 2004 ugland et al 2003 it seems that this overestimation may have negligible effects on a small scale or intermediate scale stiles and scheiner 2007 species abundance and spatial distribution are the two most important factors in interpreting species diversity and determining the relationship between area and the expected number of species to be found in that area he and legendre 2002 plotkin et al 2000 fridley et al 2006 argued that at the fine spatial scales accumulation of species richness with area follows a power law these are common species that raise the species area curve most strongly whereas rare species add to the curve at coarser scales the effect of aggregation on the curvature of the species area curve is greatest with rare species tjørve 2003 by moving from one vegetation type to another and on a coarser scale rare species are expected to be found increasingly and uneven abundance contributed to lower curvature of the species area curve the interpretation of type iii b scheiner 2003 species area curve depends on the area extent hui 2008 and plot size palmer and white 1994 in a large area like a forest landscape more species are expected to be observed where distances among plots increase an increase in space between two plots results in a decrease in species overlap between the two plots of different vegetation types palmer and white 1994 the flora of two earlier performed studies in the neighborhood of the perk forested catchment abrari vajari and veiskarami 2005 and pilehvar et al 2010 have identified 205 and 211 plant species respectively these results indicate the similarity of predicted species richness by lomolino function with the actual species richness while power function predicts species richness far beyond actual value introducing new species from different vegetation types leads to a steep slope curve in the power function species area curve on the other hand as the plot size decreases the number of species for a given area increases smith 2010 the large area of perk forested catchment and small size of plots 4 m2 may lead to overestimation of species richness by power function while the r2 value is high tjørve 2003 states that convex functions should best describe type iii b curves and sigmoid functions should best fit type iv curves while the results of this study showed that in contradiction to tjørve 2003 sigmoid functions fit better to type iii b curves this may be due to the effect of habitat heterogeneity of the perk forested catchment on curve shape as the combined effect of spatial patterns and species abundances tjørve and turner 2009 it has been shown that aggregation and uneven abundances depress the species area curve between their endpoints he and legendre 2002 lomolino 2000 that may produce sigmoid shape species area curves the results of computing lee showed that the rational function has the least lee value and based on dengler 2009 it is the most suitable function for predicting species richness over perk forested catchment this is in contradiction to the aforementioned results based on aic and bic as stated in dengler 2009 extrapolation by the lee method is proper for tenfold of the sample area and beyond this area it is deficient this can be a good reason for the failure of the lee method in determining the best function for extrapolating species richness at the landscape scale in conclusion in contrast to many studies ulrich and buszko 2003 drakare et al 2006 surendra et al 2009 azovsky 2011 van der merwe and van rooyen 2011 mashayekhi et al 2014 that introduce the power function family as the best function to describe the species area relationship many factors such as sampling scale and study scale can play major roles in the shape of the species area curve and proper function to describe it according to the results functions with convex shapes such as the power function are more appropriate for small to intermediate scales whereas sigmoid functions like lomolino and cumulative weibull functions are more accurate for larger scales generally this method of study can be used in zagros oak forest not only in finding hot spots for forest reserves but also in monitoring the effects of management plans on vegetation composition and ecosystem integrity author contributions zahra vieskarami

24572,in the face of accelerating climate change economic instability and limited resources it is essential to find indicators that better measure the sustainable development of territorial units despite ambiguous definitions of sustainable development numerous studies describe quantitative indicators of sustainable development main methodological problems include data availability and their use spatial and time scales selection of indicators and their aggregation usually analysts and decision makers apply well known conventional methods that have numerous limitations these methods in many cases cause excessive simplification of the real phenomena and relations between their determinants moreover variables describing the development of territorial units especially the environmental pillar are often characterized by strong asymmetry or extreme observations even a single outlier for a given territorial unit may significantly affect the analysis and the resulting conclusions the objective of this paper is to present the application potential of a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach with an optimal tail selection to assess the sustainable development of territorial units the proposed approach is based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and different methods of optimal tail selection of variable distribution the oja s spatial median and the optimal tail selection methods are used to reduce the impact of strong asymmetry and extreme values of variables moreover the measure of cluster compactness is proposed for the evaluation of the proposed method the proposed approach was used to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 we found that the automated eye ball method and the guillou and hall s method enabled correct identification of extreme values of variables describing the economic social and environmental development of municipalities this made it possible to distinguish the types of sustainable development level and its pillars and enabled to provide the statuses of the sustainable development level of the examined municipalities with respect to other municipalities in poland graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mcdm topsis extreme values sustainable development 1 introduction the concept of sustainable development is relevant in the 21st century in the world conservation strategy published in 1980 development is defined as the modification of the biosphere and the application of human financial living and non living resources to satisfy human needs and improve the quality of human life this document states that for development to be sustainable it must take account of social and ecological factors as well as economic ones of the living and non living resource base and of the long term as well as the short term advantages and disadvantages of alternative actions it influenced the brundtland report and gave rise to the establishment of the principles of sustainable development this report includes one of the most popular definitions of sustainable development which states that it is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs wced 1987 this definition is connected with two principal concepts the first one is needs especially the elementary needs of the poorest in the world which should be prioritized the latter is limitations i e the imposed ability of the environment to meet current and future needs through the level of technology and social organization this report suggests that the achieved level of civilization can be maintained on condition of suitable management in the domain of environment social welfare and economics sztangret 2020 already in the early 1970s the club of rome in the published limits to growth indicated how fragile the planet is due to the irrational use of resources de mendonca and laques 2017 in 1992 the united nations made critical considerations about the decision making process of organizations and countries which separated in their analysis projects and actions the environmental social and economic factors un 1992 taking this into account the un in agenda 21 defined sustainable development as a process that has to consider environmental social and economic issues as fully integrated components which will require a broader range of public participation un 1992 agenda 21 defines for the first time 27 principles and an action program to help governments achieve sustainable development however putting agenda 21 into practice has proved difficult recently the new vision of development outlined in the 2030 agenda it focuses on 5 great transformational changes defined as the 5p principle people planet prosperity peace partnership this document contains 17 sustainable development goals no poverty zero hunger good health and well being quality education gender equality clean water and sanitation affordable and clean energy decent work and economic growth industry innovation and infrastructure reduced inequalities sustainable cities and communities responsible consumption and production climate action life below water life on land peace justice and strong institutions and partnerships for the goals un 2015 it should be noted that there are more concepts of sustainable development alaimo and maggino 2020 de mendonca and laques 2017 holden et al 2017 kates et al 2005 parris and kates 2003 in an interesting way alaimo 2018 summed up the definitions of sustainable development he stated that sustainable development can be considered a three way holistic framework involving three complex systems economic social and environmental interacting with each other however all definitions combine conscious socioeconomic development with care for the environment despite ambiguous definitions of sustainable development numerous studies described quantitative indicators of sustainable development maggino and alaimo 2021 indicate that measurement is one of the fundamental activities for understanding and explaining social phenomena indicators play an increasing role in characterizing complex systems and to some degree in decision problems when a ranking is thought of as an intermediate step for a selection of optimal or depending on external constraints suboptimal options maggino et al 2021 ciegis et al 2009 emphasized that assessment of sustainable development involves an integrated approach based on a set of multidimensional indicators maggino et al 2021 confirmed that we need a set of indicators called a multi indicator system however giannetti et al 2019 added that sustainability process becomes more complex the more indicators are considered moreover they found that many different methods are used for sustainable development assessment although the terminology is often inconsistent and discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative methods is somewhat limited it should be stressed that the complexity and importance of the issue require continuous improvement of the methods of measuring sustainable development thus proving that it is an important theoretical and empirical topic piwowarski et al 2018 alaimo et al 2020a added that measurement of complex phenomena like sustainable development means dealing with synthesis and the traditional and dominant approach to the synthesis of multi indicator systems of cardinal variables is the use of the aggregative compensative approach despite the advantages of this approach it has been criticized main methodological problems of traditional and dominant approaches include issues of data availability and their use spatial and time scales selection of indicators and their aggregation and interpretation of the results lior et al 2018 in particular these problems relate to the environmental aspect where there are insufficient data and the problem with their quality the lack of scientific and political consensus on the relative importance of sub areas such as climate change biodiversity and waste jesinghaus 2012 problems emerging in studies on sustainable development are often difficult to overcome due to their complexity and multidimensional character they comprise different issues including environmental social and economic which are sometimes challenging to define and quantify one of the key problems is maintaining an appropriate balance among environmental social and economic aspects the analysis and understanding of the issue of sustainable development requires the adoption of an approach that takes into account its complexity and multidimensionality which may be the basis for strategic planning for the most desirable events and states of territorial units it is worth emphasizing that complex systems e g sustainable development socioeconomic phenomena should be described by systemic approaches alaimo and maggino 2020 maggino and alaimo 2021 maggino et al 2021 sustainable development is a process that cannot be measured directly it is only feasible to describe it with certain quantitative variables using adequate measurement methods and tools different quantitative methods are used in research to assess sustainable development cf cohon 2003 however there is no standard model used to evaluate the sustainable development of territorial units many publications consider the problem of multidimensional analysis of complex phenomena i e sustainable development maggino 2017 presents synthetic indicator construction developments for quantifying complex phenomena and focuses on the notion of complexity in social sciences horn 1993 also discusses the role of indicators in social sciences including economics in turn dahl 2012 notes that in the face of accelerating climate change economic instability and resource limits it is essential to find indicators that better describe sustainable development of different units multi criteria decision making mcdm methods are suitable for complex issues which are characterized by uncertainty and often contain conflicting objectives and different types of data wang et al 2009 there are two groups of mcdm multi attribute decision making madm and multi objective decision making modm in the first one the number of alternatives is finite the latter includes an infinite number of alternatives generally problems related to the choice and assessment of alternative solutions is finite hwang and yoon 1981 reviewed the literature on madm methods and applications mcdm methods used by researchers in studies of sustainable development have numerous limitations firstly these methods often cause excessive simplification of the real phenomena and relations between their determinants sustainable development is a complex phenomenon and its assessment requires taking into account many determinants secondly these variables are often characterized by strong asymmetry or extreme observations especially variables describing the environmental aspect even a single outlier for a given territorial unit may significantly affect the analysis and the resulting conclusions given the above researchers should pay closer attention to outlier robust methods to solve this problem we propose to use the potential of a multi criteria decision making approach with an optimal tail selection of variable distribution to assess the sustainable development of territorial units the proposed approach is based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 i e the most suitable technique for solving mcdm problems the topsis method is very useful in constructing a synthetic measure index and ranking territorial units described by many variables in data sets with unusual values of variables the assumption that the maximum and minimum values of the variables are model values a positive ideal solution and a negative ideal solution leads to excessive remoteness from typical values of the variables consequently it narrows the range of variability of the constructed synthetic measure the problem may be solved by applying methods based on the extreme value theory evt evt is a powerful and robust theory for studying the tail behavior of the distribution of variables different approaches are used in evt to model extreme values scarrott and macdonald 2012 in the most straightforward and frequently used approaches the threshold variable value which separates the distribution tail from its middle part is the fixed quantile of the empirical distribution usually of the order of 0 9 mcneil and frey 2000 or 0 95 bee et al 2016 some approaches are based on convenient visual tools coles 2001 łuczak and just 2020a used the graph of the mean excess function mef together with the topsis to assess the economic development level of units at different government levels they also used a similar approach to assess the socioeconomic development level of rural municipalities just and łuczak 2019 in another study the stability of the estimated parameters of the generalized pareto distribution gpd was analyzed to limit the impact of extreme values on the assessment of financial self sufficiency of local administrative units laus łuczak et al 2018 however the graphical based threshold choice procedures require identifying stable regions in the graphs and thus are highly subjective as a way to overcome this drawback the source literature proposes optimal tail selection procedures that correspond to the application of automated methods caeiro and gomes 2016 danielsson et al 2016 gomes and oliveira 2001 however none of these conceptions outperforms other methods in all situations thus we analyze various methods to indicate which one may be used in practice for the establishment of development documents we used eight methods to describe the tails of the variable distribution i e the distance metric method with the mean absolute and kolmogorov smirnov penalty functions danielsson et al 2016 the reiss and thomas procedures reiss and thomas 2007 the path stability algorithm caeiro and gomes 2016 the automated eye ball method resnick and stărică 1997 the minimization of mean squared error mse estimates introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 and the guillou and hall s procedure guillou and hall 2001 as a result the influence of extreme values was reduced moreover in this paper we propose applying the topsis method that utilizes the spatial median of oja oja 1983 ronkainen et al 2002 that is used to limit the impact of strong asymmetry łuczak and just 2020b the proposed approach was used in the assessment of sustainable development of polish municipalities in 2018 the main objective of this paper is to present the application possibilities of a multi criteria decision making approach with an optimal tail selection to assess the sustainable development of territorial units we have also set two additional objectives the first one concerns determining the development levels in the economic social and environmental fields and the sustainable development levels of municipalities in poland in 2018 the second one involves assessing the sustainable development statuses of municipalities in poland in 2018 based on a broad review of the source literature research gaps have been identified as well as the following research questions being formulated q1 which method for identification of the tails of variable distribution is best suited for limiting the influence of extreme values of variables in the process of constructing a synthetic measure concerning sustainable development q2 what was the differentiation in the level of sustainable development and its pillars among the municipalities in poland in 2018 q3 what were the statuses and levels of sustainable development and its pillars for municipalities in poland in 2018 q4 which clusters of municipalities in poland in 2018 are the most compact in terms of sustainable development and its pillars the authors contribution to developing a methodological approach to evaluate sustainable development of units includes a proposal of a hybrid multi criteria decision making procedure based on positional topsis with optimal tail selection method secondly the authors proposed a measure for assessing cluster compactness the proposed approach expands possibilities of research in terms of sustainable development and its pillars using various methods the research results are crucial for decision makers at all levels of government and self government who participate in creating strategic documents development strategies plans and programs and establishing environmental economic and social policies the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides a brief literature review section 3 describes the methods and data used in the empirical study sections 4 and 5 present the results of research including a discussion while sections 6 and 7 summarize the study and include conclusions and recommendations 2 brief literature review sustainable development is a multidimensional phenomenon finding appropriate indices to measure the development level of a given region using various sustainable development dimensions poses a significant issue in addressing sustainability the review indicates that there are multiple indices available for its assessment different tools statistics measures indices indicators and variables 1 1 ciegis et al 2009 defined in general terms an indicator as a quantitative or a qualitative measure that can show relative positions of a territorial unit in contrast an index is a combination of indicators variables in other words aggregated indicators are an index indicators are reduced to one factor this factor constitutes an index of different levels of complex phenomena e g sustainable development tong et al 2006 bartelmus 2008 mori and christodoulou 2012 used an interchangeable terms index and indicator are considered applied and proposed to assess sustainability alaimo 2018 alaimo et al 2020a 2020b bartelmus 2008 braulio gonzalo et al 2015 ciegis et al 2009 hiremath et al 2013 mori and christodoulou 2012 munier 2011 nijkamp and ouwersloot 1998 parris and kates 2003 pearce et al 1998 pupphachai and zuidema 2017 rosales 2011 shen et al 2011 steurer and hametner 2013 tong et al 2006 verbruggen and kuik 1991 summarizing general recommendations for the indicators point out that they have a scientific basis e g indicator concept measuring units and sources of data correspond to policy goals must be representative and measurable quantitative character provide significant information about the territorial units in terms of sustainability should describe the environment economic and social phenomena and sometimes institutions should present a given system as a whole can inform about the state of the system support rational decision making verbruggen and kuik 1991 emphasized that indicators are a compromise between scientific accuracy and the demand for concise information moreover they discussed other four crucial features of indicators i e type dimensions scope and construction ciegis et al 2009 also emphasized that indicators are needed as methodological compromise among technical feasibility public availability to use and systemic consistency furthermore parris and kates 2003 added that the key problems of indicators are associated with data availability and use spatial and temporal scale selection of indicators and the aggregation of indicators steurer and hametner 2013 noted that indicators have three main functions i e they reduce the number of measurements simplify the communication of positive and negative developments and provide crucial guidance for policy making different methods techniques and instruments for sustainable development assessment are presented in available research rosales 2011 many researchers recommend and use the gross domestic product gdp gross national product gnp or gross national income gni as common indicators for measuring sustainable development dos santos gaspar et al 2017 hirai 2017 opschoor 1991 it is well known that the aforementioned economic indicators include only social or human aspects of development and do not reflect the condition of the environment therefore these indicators may not be sufficient to assess sustainable development the index of sustainable economic welfare isew constitutes an alternative to them since its definition comprises of variables that are not included in the conventional national accounts such as environmental and social variables chelli et al 2013 dos santos gaspar et al 2017 pointed out that this index can be used to control the way in which countries use the available resources balancing ecological development environmental damage and income distribution using the isew they also compared the sustainable development approach with the traditional economic growth approach based on gdp and its relationship with energy consumption in the 1990s the human development index hdi was introduced which constitutes an objective measure of human development hickel 2020 pointed out that it was an important step towards a more sensible measure of progress one defined less by gdp growth and more by social goals however hdi has some significant limitations that were revealed in the 21st century against the background of many ecological problems and increasing crisis of climate change human development index ignores the main sustainability principles because it is based on high levels of income and does not include the ecological dimension it is worth noting that some attempts at combining the hdi with the environmental dimension appear in the source literature biggeri and mauro 2018 bravo 2014 hirai 2017 togtokh and gaffney 2010 türe 2013 hickel 2020 proposed an alternative the sustainable development index sdi which is an indicator of strong sustainability the sdi corrects ecological problems while retaining the basic formula of the hdi that measure nations ecological efficiency in delivering human development rockström et al 2009 and steffen et al 2015 indicate problems in the ecological sphere by showing the planetary boundary pb concept they point out four critical world problems climate change biodiversity loss chemical loading by nitrogen and phosphorous and land system change crossing a boundary can cause permanent changes to the earth system steffen et al 2015 concluded that pbs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation and the pb framework can make a valuable contribution to decision makers in charting desirable courses for societal development on the other hand it should also be noted that in terms of the social sphere the greatest problems are still material and financial issues łuczak and kalinowski 2020 researchers most often evaluate sustainable development using traditional methods szopik depczyńska et al 2018 conducted a comparative analysis of european union countries based on a taxonomic measure of sustainable development using the weber median vector the sustainable development indicators published by eurostat were used in the study these indicators were divided into 17 thematic areas connected to 17 objectives of the sustainable development strategy according to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development bolcárová and kološta 2015 also created an aggregated index for sustainable development from the eu set of indicators for each of the 27 eu countries based on the principal component analysis pca in their study sustainable development indicators were taken from social economic and environmental fields however economic growth was not considered piwowarski et al 2018 used alternative methods i e topsis and vikor višekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno rešenje which means multicriteria optimization and compromise solution to study the level of sustainable development of the eu countries yang et al 2017 assessed sustainable urban development levels and trends in chinese cities using the linear dimensionless analysis method they conducted a quantitative analysis of the main factors influencing sustainable development in 287 cities in the eastern central and western regions of china liao et al 2020 also studied sustainable development in china they evaluated the level of sustainable development of provinces in china from 2012 to 2018 using the improved entropy coefficient topsis in comparison tang et al 2019 proposed the modified topsis method based on the gray relational analysis for the sustainability evaluation of 16 cities in anhui province china in this approach the entropy method was used to assign weights to each index according to its evaluation score in turn gray relation analysis was applied to reduce the uncertainty existing in the process of evaluation tran 2016 proposed a method for selecting a set of sustainable development indicators that can be used for various sustainability related tasks including assessment of current condition sustainable urban development this approach is established on clustering of variables selecting cluster representative and also multivariate linear regression it should also be added that kwatra et al 2020 noted that there are various indices on different aspects of sustainability available at the global scale for countries but only a limited number of studies have been concerned with this issue at a regional scale alaimo 2018 presented the composite indicators approach to build a synthetic index to compare different european union countries in terms of their level of economic sustainability he used a set including 23 basic indicators from 2010 to 2016 in another article alaimo and maggino 2020 studied sustainable development at regional level they stated that aggregating is useful in order to simplify the complexity and allow an immediate representation of the phenomena however it does not allow a precise analysis they criticized the results obtained through syntheses based on compensative aggregation which generate the so called flattening effect another interesting tool for sustainability assessment was proposed by giannetti et al 2019 it is based on the five sector sustainability 5sensu model and use of goal programming as a multicriteria method the advantage of this model is that it makes it possible to show the relationships between humans and the natural environment moreover this tool forms a clear criterion in choosing indicators supported by the 5sensu model and in effect leads to constructing an easy understanding of the sustainability synthetic index of systems alaimo et al 2020a proposed a method of synthesizing multi indicator systems over time based on the partial order theory in another paper alaimo et al 2020b presented two methods of synthesis a non aggregative approach based on the theory of the poset they emphasized advantages of the presented approach such as the possibility that the definition of the structure of cooperabilities underling multi indicators systems as well as indicated possibility not only to investigate the nature of the phenomenon in more detail but also to help policy makers in their assessments the review reveals that most studies have focused on the assessment of the current state of sustainable development with conventional methods that are not robust to outliers of indicators this is an important problem in most of the conducted analyzes and it affects the interpretation of the results 3 data and methods in the paper we proposed a hybrid mcdm procedure for assessing the sustainable development of local administrative units it includes ten stages presented in fig 1 stage 1 selection of variables of the sustainable development of laus e g municipalities in the economic social and environmental fields three independent sets of variables are used to describe the economic social and environmental aspects sub criteria in laus when choosing the variables a decisive role should be played by substantive grounds supported by statistical analysis stage 2 identification of extreme values selecting the optimal threshold which determines the beginning of the tail of the variable distribution we used eight methods i e mean absolute deviation distance metric method mad dis 2 2 abbreviations given in brackets are used in the article kolmogorov smirnov distance metric method ks dis reiss and thomas procedure with two different rt expressions rt1 and rt2 path stability method ps automated eye ball method eye ball minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error method damse guillou and hall s procedure gh estimating the threshold is equivalent to choosing the extreme values of the variable below we present the methods used 3 1 mean absolute deviation distance metric mad distance metric and kolmogorov smirnov distance metric ks distance metric methods the mad distance metric mad dis and ks distance metric ks dis approaches presented by danielsson et al 2016 are based on minimizing the distance between the largest upper order statistics of the dataset i e the distance between the empirical tail and the theoretical tail of a pareto distribution the tail index α of this distribution is estimated using the hill estimator hill 1975 ξ k n h 1 α 1 k i 0 k 1 log x n i n log x n k n where k is the number of upper order statistics used for estimation of the parameter α the distance which is measured in the quantile dimension is minimized with respect to k the optimal number of upper order statistics k is called k0 determining k0 is equivalent to specifying the number of extreme values or the number of data in the tail the mad distance metric method uses the mean absolute deviation penalty function q n mad 1 t j 1 t x n j n q j k and the ks distance metric takes the maximum absolute deviation penalty function q n ks in f k su p j x n j n q j k j 1 t where t k is the region over which distance metric is measured x n j n the empirical quantile q j k the quantile estimated by x n k 1 n k j 1 α k with the hill estimator α k in these algorithms the size of the upper tail is denoted by ts 3 2 reiss and thomas rt procedure reiss and thomas 2007 proposed an alternative procedure for choosing the optimal number of data in the tail k0 this procedure selects the lowest upper order statistic by minimizing the expression rt1 1 k i 1 k i β ξ i h median ξ i h ξ k h or expression rt2 1 k i 1 k i β ξ i h ξ k h 2 where ξ i h is the hill estimator and the tuning parameter satisfies 0 β 0 5 in practice the minimum value of k i e kmin is usually used scarrott and macdonald 2012 3 3 path stability ps method the path stability method is a heuristic algorithm introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 the algorithm is used to find a stable region of the path stability i e the hill plot of a tail index with respect to k the optimal number of data in the tail k0 is identified by the algorithm that consists of six steps step 1 ps given an observed data x 1 x n compute t k ξ k n h k 1 n 1 using the hill estimator step 2 ps take j0 as a minimum value of j a non negative integer such that the rounded values to j decimal places of the estimates in the first step are distinct define a k t j round t k j k 1 n 1 the rounded values of t k

respectively of the set with the broadest range the largest run size is l t k m a x t k m i n t step 4 ps consider all those estimates t k k m i n t k k m a x t now with two additional decimal places

n h in the ps it is assumed that j 0 or j 1 3 4 automated eye ball method eye ball the automated eye ball method is used to find a stable region in the hill plot by defining a moving window danielsson et al 2016 resnick and stărică 1997 this method is based on an algorithm that looks for a substantial drop in the variance of the hill plot as k is increased the following estimator is used to select the optimal number of data in the tail k 0 e y e min k 2 n w h 1 w i 1 w i α k ε α k i α k ε where w is the size of the moving window usually 1 of the full sample n the number of positive data ε the size of the range in which estimates may vary e g 0 3 h the percentage of data inside the moving window which should occur in the tolerable range usually around 90 3 5 minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error damse method the minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error method was introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 the optimal number of data in the tail k0 in the damse method is identified by minimizing the asymptotic mean squared error amse of the hill estimator with respect to k this algorithm consists of five steps step 1 damse given an observed data x 1 x n calculate for the tuning parameters τ 0 and τ 1 the values of ρ τ k that have the form ρ τ k 3 w k n τ 1 w k n τ 3 dependent on the statistics w k n τ m k n 1 τ m k n 2 2 τ 2 m k n 2 2 τ 2 m k n 3 6 τ 3 if τ 0 log m k n 1 log m k n 2 2 2 log m k n 2 2 2 log m k n 3 6 3 if τ 0 where m k n j 1 k i 1 k log x n i 1 n log x n k n j j 1 2 3 step 2 damse consider k n 0 995 n 0 999 calculate the median of ρ τ k k k denoted χ τ and compute i τ k k ρ τ k χ τ 2 τ 0 1 then select the tuning parameter τ 0 if i 0 i 1 otherwise select τ 1 step 3 damse work with ρ ρ τ k ρ τ k 01 and β β τ k β ρ τ k 01 with k 01 n 0 999 and β ρ k k n ρ d k ρ d k 0 d k ρ d k ρ d k ρ d k 2 ρ dependent on the estimator ρ ρ τ k 01 and where for any α 0 d k α 1 k i 1 k i k α d k α 1 k i 1 k i k α u i with u i i log x n i 1 n log x n i n 1 i k n the scaled log spacings step 4 damse based on estimators β and ρ calculate k 0 h 1 ρ 2 n 2 ρ 2 ρ β 2 1 1 2 ρ step 5 damse finally compute ξ h ξ k 0 h n h 3 6 guillou and hall s gh procedure guillou and hall 2001 proposed a procedure based on bias reduction for choosing the optimal threshold when fitting the hill estimator of a tail exponent to extreme value data the optimal number data in the tail k0 in this method is identified by the procedure which consists of three steps see e g caeiro and gomes 2016 step 1 gh given an observed data x 1 x n compute q n k 1 2 k 2 1 j k k 2 k k 2 t n 2 j 1 2 1 k and k k 2 n where q n k 3 k 3 i 1 k k 2 i 1 u i 1 k i 1 k u i u i i i 1 k log x n i 1 n log x n i n 1 i k n step 2 gh given c c r i t 1 25 consider k 0 gh inf k q n j c crit j k step 3 gh next obtain ξ g h ξ k 0 g h n g h stage 3 winsorization of data winsorization is the transformation of the variable by limiting its extreme values in the process of winsorization a specified number of extreme values of the variable are replaced with a constant smaller or larger value the constants are established based on the optimal thresholds stage 4 determination of the nature of variables in relation to the main criterion this stage consists of determining the way each variable affects the sub criterion considered hence the variables selected are classified as stimulants destimulants and nominants stimulant is a variable that has a stimulating effect contributes to increasing the level of the phenomenon while destimulant is a variable that has a destimulating effect decreasing the level of the phenomenon nominant is a variable type that is a destimulant in some variable range and a stimulant in another one the nominant optimal desirable value should be defined variables considered to be destimulants may be converted into stimulants with the use of a negative coefficient transformation stage 5 normalization of the values of variables using the oja s spatial median in the case of assessing sustainable development of laus variables with extreme values or characterized by an asymmetrical distribution of their values are often observed therefore to solve this problem the modified median standardization was proposed using oja s spatial median cf lira et al 2002 oja s spatial median is resistant to variables with strong asymmetry ronkainen et al 2002 oja 1983 additionally for limiting the influence of extreme values of variables threshold values of variables llk and ulk llk is the threshold value for left tail ulk is the threshold value for right tail k 1 k means e for the economic field s for the social field and n for the environmental field were applied in the formula of the modified median standardization łuczak and just 2020b 1 z ik l l k m e d x

from the median component of the k th variable 1 4826 a constant scaling factor corresponding to normally distributed data see e g młodak 2006 stage 6 calculation of the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution the positive ideal solution pis a and the negative ideal solution nis a were calculated hwang and yoon 1981 as follows 2 a max z 11 z n 1 max z 12 z n 2 max z 1 k z n k z 1 z 2 z k 3 a min z 11 z n 1 min z 12 z n 2 min z 1 k z n k z 1 z 2 z k stage 7 calculation of the distance of each lau from positive and negative ideal solutions manhattan distances l1 distances for each object from the pis d i and the nis d i were calculated based on 4 d i k 1 k z ik z k 5 d i k 1 k z ik z k stage 8 calculation of the three synthetic sub measures for the levels of economic social and environmental development respectively and the general synthetic measure of the sustainable development level the construction of synthetic sub measures based on the topsis aggregation formula hwang and yoon 1981 6 s i d i d i d i i 1 n the general measure of the level of sustainable development is calculated as follows 7 s i s i e s i s s i n 3 the values of synthetic index si range from 0 to 1 the higher the synthetic measure of development the higher the development level of the lau concerned stage 9 linear ordering and determination of the levels of sustainable development once linearly ordered the values of the synthetic measure provide a basis for the creation of typological classes these can be created using statistical methods or defined arbitrarily this study used the arbitral approach based on a division of synthetic measures into eight classes table 1 we propose a cluster compactness measure to assess the quality of the classification each class of the level of development was evaluated using this measure the idea of a cluster compactness measure is based on distances between linearly ordered values of synthetic measure index for units form the best to the worst it is assumed that the mean distance between the values of the synthetic measure in class c should be smaller than the mean distances between the standard values of the synthetic measure in the range from 0 to 1 standard range of value variation of the synthetic measure then the cluster is characterized by strong compactness i e 8 1 n c 1 i 1 n c 1 s i c s i 1 c 1 n 1 for n c 1 where s i c is the value of the synthetic measure i in cluster c n the number of all units n c the number of units in the c th class hence 9 1 n 1 1 n c 1 i 1 n c 1 s i c s i 1 c 0 10 1 n 1 1 n c 1 s 1 c s 2 c s 2 c s 3 c s n c 2 c s n c 1 c s n c 1 c s n c c 0 then after simplification the formula takes the following form 11 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c n c 1 0 12 n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c n 1 n c 1 0 13 n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c 0 thus the newly proposed cluster compactness measure can be calculated using the following formula 14 c m c c n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c if c m c c 0 then class c has strong compactness a higher value of c m c c means greater compactness of cluster c stage 10 identification of the types of sustainable development status the method proposed allows determining the development status of laus in relation to other laus and identifying their sustainable development types in this approach the coordinates of location relative to the economic social and environmental fields can be calculated as follows 15 c e i s i e i e c s i s i s i s c n i s i n i n where ie is and in are the reference values for the economic social and environmental fields respectively which can be calculated as the mean median of sub measures for fields eight main types of sustainable development status can be identified depending on which of the values of synthetic measures prevail table 2 the proposed approach was used to assess the sustainable development of laus at the national level in poland in 2018 the national level includes 2478 municipalities the 1st level of administrative division in poland the study was based on statistical data from 2018 obtained from statistics poland local data bank 2020 seventeen indicators variables were selected based on a substantive and statistical analysis stage 1 including the following economic dimension x 1 the share of people using a sewage system in the total population x 2 the share of people using a gas system in the total population x 3 the share of people using wastewater treatment plants in the total population x 4 the share of own incomes of municipality budgets in total incomes x 5 investment property expenditure per capita pln x 6 entities entered in the regon register per 10 thousand of the population social dimension x 7 the share of the registered unemployed persons in the working age population x 8 the average useful floor area of dwelling m2 x 9 pupils per section in primary schools x 10 children aged 3 5 years per one place in preschool educational establishments x 11 population per generally available pharmacy x 12 foundations associations and social organizations per 1000 population environmental dimension x 13 emissions of air pollutants gasses t km2 year x 14 emissions of air pollutants particulates t km2 year x 15 the share of legally protected areas in the total area x 16 the share of parks lawns and green areas of the housing estate areas in the total area x 17 monuments of nature per 10 km2 five year 2014 2018 means were calculated for variable x 5 representing the investment expenditure per capita table a1 in appendix section shows descriptive statistics for selected variables moreover fig a1 in appendix section presents box plots they allow to visually present input data through their quartiles the set of variables retained for the study included variables that demonstrate strong asymmetry and outlying observations 4 results of research this study proposed and used a procedure to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 we assumed that the stimulants are x 1 x 6 x 8 x 12 x 15 x 17 and destimulants are x 7 x 9 x 11 x 13 x 14 it also identified one nominant x 10 almost half of the variable distributions describing municipalities demonstrated strong positive skewness x 5 x 6 x 10 x 13 x 14 x 16 x 17 appendix table a1 fig a1 extreme values were observed in the right tails of distribution for half of the variables describing the economic pillar and for most of the variables describing the social and environmental pillars we used eight methods to select the optimal threshold which determines the beginning of the tail of the variable distribution stage 2 this allowed identifying the extreme values of the variables the obtained results are presented in table 3 comparing the threshold values for the variables we found that the four methods the reiss and thomas procedures the path stability algorithm the minimization of the amse method for certain variables cut the threshold values too low in turn the kolmogorov smirnov distance metric method for some variables cut the threshold too high next winsorization was performed and destimulants and nominant were converted into stimulants stages 3 4 following this the variables were normalized with the use of the oja s spatial median standardization stage 5 then absolute deviations from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution were used to calculate the synthetic sub measures of the levels of economic social and environmental development stages 6 8 we compared the results obtained using the proposed mcdm method for different tail selection procedures fig 2 for the sake of brevity we do not report results for the levels of economic social and environmental development particularly large differences in classifications were observed for the environmental pillar earlier studies by łuczak and just 2020a 2020b showed that the use of the well known topsis method as well as its combination with standardization based on the oja or weber median does not give the correct classification of results for all analyzed pillars as well as sustainable development similar results were obtained using the automated eye ball and guillou and hall s methods fig 2 given that two criteria threshold values and classification results the eye ball and gh methods are recommended for analysis these methods enabled the correct classifications of municipalities fig 3 the synthetic sub measures of the levels of economic social and environmental development and the general synthetic measure of the level of sustainable development were presented for the eye ball method this allowed us to identify sustainable development levels stage 9 tables 4 5 figs 5 8 the method proposed is also suitable for determining the development status of municipalities in relation to each other this allowed identifying the relevant types of sustainable development by calculating the coordinates of the location of municipalities in relation to the economic e social s and environmental n fields the deviations of synthetic sub measures from the mean value expressed as the median were used to determine the development statuses of municipalities in relation to the fields considered stage 10 table 6 in the case selected approach the obtained values of the synthetic measure covered a greater part of the potential range of its variation defined by the 0 1 interval as a result they provided more accurate identification of sustainable development types in municipalities this is also evidenced by the identification of classes of municipalities with extreme high and extreme low levels of economic development and environmental development figs 5 and 7 in contrast to the level of social development which was not very diverse fig 6 values of cluster compactness measure for the sub measures and the total measure of sustainable development level indicated that greatest compactness was exhibited by classes of a medium level of social environmental and sustainable development and a low level of economic development fig 4 in stage 9 five types of development for municipalities in poland were distinguished with regard to social development ranging from low to very high levels table 5 fig 6 the level of social development is less different from that of other types of development and shows a higher level of influence of urban agglomerations decreasing with growing distance from them the average value of the measure s i s was 0 556 eight types were distinguished with regard to economic and environmental development ranging from extreme low to extreme high levels table 5 figs 5 and 7 as far as the level of economic development is concerned the municipalities best developed in 2018 included those influenced by metropolitan centers i e warsaw cracow wroclaw poznan lodz gdansk sopot and gdynia upper silesian metropolitan area whose center is located in katowice bydgoszcz szczecin and rzeszow the average value of the synthetic measure for the economic development s i e in 2018 was 0 390 and the average level of environmental development was 0 600 the values of sub measures concerning different pillars of development were the basis for constructing a synthetic measure describing the level of sustainable development the synthetic measure of the sustainable development level of municipalities in poland was determined by averaging three sub measures its values ranged from 0 345 to 0 842 in 2018 this allowed defining five types of development for municipalities in poland ranging from having low to a very high development level tables 4 and 5 fig 8 in the last stage types of sustainable development statues of municipalities were identified table 6 fig 9 depending on the predominance of the development type eight main types of sustainability development statues were identified in 2018 only 300 municipalities in poland belonged to the integrated development type s e n these were mainly municipalities located in the western part of the country on the coast and those influenced by larger cities such as warsaw and poznan at the same time these municipalities were characterized by a very high high and medium high level of development table 6 the largest number of municipalities had the following two statuses i e economically and environmentally beneficial e s n and socially beneficial e s n 439 and 449 municipalities respectively mainly at a medium development level the smallest number of municipalities was classified as having economically and socially beneficial e s n and environmentally beneficial e s n statuses 198 and 208 respectively the remaining three types of socially and environmentally beneficial e s n economically beneficial e s n and economically socially and environmentally less beneficial e s n statuses applied to between 290 and 302 municipalities and their level of development was mostly medium or low table 6 5 discussion the idea of the approach proposed is based on the comparability and transparency of the measures constructed we developed a multidimensional sustainable development index and three sub indices for the following domains environment society and economy moreover our research showed the possibility of establishing statuses of sustainable development it is worth noting that a status shows the development position in comparison with other territorial units it is the state of development of a territorial unit at a given moment which is defined in terms of the environmental social and economic dimensions on the other hand the level of development indicates the grade of development it is worth emphasizing that the indices proposed in the literature rarely include all three main pillars of sustainable development i e environment society and economy some studies raise the problem of multidimensional assessment of the sustainable development of territorial units but do not pay attention to the distribution of the variables adopted in the research lemke and bastini 2020 developed the comprehensive and comparable multilevel sustainable development index mlsdi covering the environmental social and economic dimensions barrera roldán and saldı var valdés 2002 showed a different approach and used the multi attribute decision theory methodology applying 21 indicators in the construction of the sustainable development index the indicators included the environmental social and economic variables but the index was only applied to seven municipalities salvati et al 2016 proposed a sustainable development index based on 99 individual variables for 8101 municipalities in italy the number of variables used by o regan et al 2009 is surprising more than 300 economic social and environmental attributes for 79 irish villages these examples are thought provoking it is worth considering whether the use of a higher number of variables in the research is better there is also the question of what kind of territorial units are studied and whether the entire population was examined in our opinion the type and number of territorial units determine the choice of methods first it should be emphasized that our research covers a wider spectrum of territorial units surveyed we conducted complex studies on all 2478 municipalities in poland secondly another significant problem concerns the correlation of the value of the variables it is especially visible when the number of examined units is small the introduction of an excessive number of variables to research variables correlated with each other leads to the introduction of the same information by them in our study we avoided this problem by eliminating the over correlated variables we used 17 features that carry important information for the territorial units surveyed thirdly some data sets especially for small territorial units considered at the macro level show highly diversified values of variables in these data sets the variables usually have not normal distributions and may appear extreme values of variables especially in the environmental sphere almost all variables related to the environmental sphere variables connected with emissions of air pollutants gasses and particulates the share of parks lawns and green areas of the housing estate areas in the total area and number of monuments of nature per 10 km2 used in our study were characterized by extreme asymmetry and high kurtosis values therefore these types of data cause many problems with the proper assessment of the level of development and the correct typology of objects in our research we introduced eight advanced methods from the extreme value theory to limit the influence of extreme values of variables szopik depczyńska et al 2018 used the weber median vector to calculate the taxonomic measure of sustainable development for the european union it should be underlined that the weber median is useful for limiting the impact of variables with non normal distribution and helps in more correct analysis but it does not solve the whole problem of extreme values in data sets for complex phenomena describing territorial units łuczak and just 2020a point out that the weber median only restricts the impact of strong asymmetry but does not deal with the problem of extreme values łuczak and just 2019 2020a 2020b showed some solution to this problem they combined the multidimensional spatial median with some basic methods from the evt to limit the impact of extreme values against the background of a broad literature review we do not find any studies which show all of these problems and solve them comprehensively the research enabled the assessment of the levels of sustainable development and its partial measures for the environmental social and economic pillars as indicated by lemke and bastini 2020 sustainability indicators and indices are useful analytical tools indices proposed in literature rarely comprise all three contentual domains of sustainable development environment society and economy fail to enable comparisons of agents at multiple levels and exhibit methodological shortcomings 6 conclusions this paper proposed an approach of multidimensional analysis of sustainable development based on mcdm methods with optimal tail selection the proposed method using the positional topsis with the oja s spatial median and the eye ball method reduces the impact of strong asymmetry and extreme values of variables describing laus which often appear in the case of variables describing the development of laus especially environmental development this method was used to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 in the case of linear ordering the occurrence of even one extreme value e g very large for an lau can significantly affect the assignment of an excessively high or low rank in the final classification of laus using the positional topsis with standardization based on oja s spatial median for winsorized data improves the classification of objects similar rankings and classifications of objects gave the positional topsis combined with the automated eye ball method or the guillou and hall s method the eye ball method was used to identify extreme values in the proposed approach the typology of municipalities in poland in 2018 created on the positional topsis with eye ball method basis reflects well the inter class differences in the sustainable development of municipalities with these methods it was possible to determine the development levels in the economic social and environmental fields and the sustainable development levels eight grades ranging from extreme low to extreme high based on research eight types of polish municipalities were identified in 2018 environmental social and economic development levels were found to vary significantly across municipalities the highest levels of social and economic development were recorded in municipalities located near urban centers while the lowest levels were reported by remote rural municipalities in contrast to the environmental development level the highest levels of environmental development were recorded in remote rural municipalities while the lowest levels were reported by urban municipalities this method also enables us to determine the position of the municipalities and allows to identify their types of sustainable development the rule of deviations of the values of synthetic partial value from their mean value was used to determine the developmental positions of municipalities analysis has shown that the most significant integration of three orders was demonstrated by urban and urban rural municipalities in the western part of poland while non integrated municipalities were predominantly remote rural municipalities this method is universal and can also be used in analyzing the level of sustainable development of other units e g regions countries 7 recommendations the authors recommend using the positional topsis method with optimal tail selection for assessing sustainable development of territorial units described by variables with extreme values in order to establish limits of winsorization the authors recommend using the automated eye ball method or the guillou and hall s method to determine the extreme values along with other statistical procedures and substantive criteria to avoid mechanical and excessive winsorization winsorization based on only one criterion can lead to improper placement of objects in classes the proposed approach to assess the sustainable development levels of laus is a universal technique that may be used for other administrative units the proposed research approach may also be the basis for preparing development documents e g development programs and strategies credit authorship contribution statement aleksandra łuczak

24572,in the face of accelerating climate change economic instability and limited resources it is essential to find indicators that better measure the sustainable development of territorial units despite ambiguous definitions of sustainable development numerous studies describe quantitative indicators of sustainable development main methodological problems include data availability and their use spatial and time scales selection of indicators and their aggregation usually analysts and decision makers apply well known conventional methods that have numerous limitations these methods in many cases cause excessive simplification of the real phenomena and relations between their determinants moreover variables describing the development of territorial units especially the environmental pillar are often characterized by strong asymmetry or extreme observations even a single outlier for a given territorial unit may significantly affect the analysis and the resulting conclusions the objective of this paper is to present the application potential of a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach with an optimal tail selection to assess the sustainable development of territorial units the proposed approach is based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and different methods of optimal tail selection of variable distribution the oja s spatial median and the optimal tail selection methods are used to reduce the impact of strong asymmetry and extreme values of variables moreover the measure of cluster compactness is proposed for the evaluation of the proposed method the proposed approach was used to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 we found that the automated eye ball method and the guillou and hall s method enabled correct identification of extreme values of variables describing the economic social and environmental development of municipalities this made it possible to distinguish the types of sustainable development level and its pillars and enabled to provide the statuses of the sustainable development level of the examined municipalities with respect to other municipalities in poland graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mcdm topsis extreme values sustainable development 1 introduction the concept of sustainable development is relevant in the 21st century in the world conservation strategy published in 1980 development is defined as the modification of the biosphere and the application of human financial living and non living resources to satisfy human needs and improve the quality of human life this document states that for development to be sustainable it must take account of social and ecological factors as well as economic ones of the living and non living resource base and of the long term as well as the short term advantages and disadvantages of alternative actions it influenced the brundtland report and gave rise to the establishment of the principles of sustainable development this report includes one of the most popular definitions of sustainable development which states that it is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs wced 1987 this definition is connected with two principal concepts the first one is needs especially the elementary needs of the poorest in the world which should be prioritized the latter is limitations i e the imposed ability of the environment to meet current and future needs through the level of technology and social organization this report suggests that the achieved level of civilization can be maintained on condition of suitable management in the domain of environment social welfare and economics sztangret 2020 already in the early 1970s the club of rome in the published limits to growth indicated how fragile the planet is due to the irrational use of resources de mendonca and laques 2017 in 1992 the united nations made critical considerations about the decision making process of organizations and countries which separated in their analysis projects and actions the environmental social and economic factors un 1992 taking this into account the un in agenda 21 defined sustainable development as a process that has to consider environmental social and economic issues as fully integrated components which will require a broader range of public participation un 1992 agenda 21 defines for the first time 27 principles and an action program to help governments achieve sustainable development however putting agenda 21 into practice has proved difficult recently the new vision of development outlined in the 2030 agenda it focuses on 5 great transformational changes defined as the 5p principle people planet prosperity peace partnership this document contains 17 sustainable development goals no poverty zero hunger good health and well being quality education gender equality clean water and sanitation affordable and clean energy decent work and economic growth industry innovation and infrastructure reduced inequalities sustainable cities and communities responsible consumption and production climate action life below water life on land peace justice and strong institutions and partnerships for the goals un 2015 it should be noted that there are more concepts of sustainable development alaimo and maggino 2020 de mendonca and laques 2017 holden et al 2017 kates et al 2005 parris and kates 2003 in an interesting way alaimo 2018 summed up the definitions of sustainable development he stated that sustainable development can be considered a three way holistic framework involving three complex systems economic social and environmental interacting with each other however all definitions combine conscious socioeconomic development with care for the environment despite ambiguous definitions of sustainable development numerous studies described quantitative indicators of sustainable development maggino and alaimo 2021 indicate that measurement is one of the fundamental activities for understanding and explaining social phenomena indicators play an increasing role in characterizing complex systems and to some degree in decision problems when a ranking is thought of as an intermediate step for a selection of optimal or depending on external constraints suboptimal options maggino et al 2021 ciegis et al 2009 emphasized that assessment of sustainable development involves an integrated approach based on a set of multidimensional indicators maggino et al 2021 confirmed that we need a set of indicators called a multi indicator system however giannetti et al 2019 added that sustainability process becomes more complex the more indicators are considered moreover they found that many different methods are used for sustainable development assessment although the terminology is often inconsistent and discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative methods is somewhat limited it should be stressed that the complexity and importance of the issue require continuous improvement of the methods of measuring sustainable development thus proving that it is an important theoretical and empirical topic piwowarski et al 2018 alaimo et al 2020a added that measurement of complex phenomena like sustainable development means dealing with synthesis and the traditional and dominant approach to the synthesis of multi indicator systems of cardinal variables is the use of the aggregative compensative approach despite the advantages of this approach it has been criticized main methodological problems of traditional and dominant approaches include issues of data availability and their use spatial and time scales selection of indicators and their aggregation and interpretation of the results lior et al 2018 in particular these problems relate to the environmental aspect where there are insufficient data and the problem with their quality the lack of scientific and political consensus on the relative importance of sub areas such as climate change biodiversity and waste jesinghaus 2012 problems emerging in studies on sustainable development are often difficult to overcome due to their complexity and multidimensional character they comprise different issues including environmental social and economic which are sometimes challenging to define and quantify one of the key problems is maintaining an appropriate balance among environmental social and economic aspects the analysis and understanding of the issue of sustainable development requires the adoption of an approach that takes into account its complexity and multidimensionality which may be the basis for strategic planning for the most desirable events and states of territorial units it is worth emphasizing that complex systems e g sustainable development socioeconomic phenomena should be described by systemic approaches alaimo and maggino 2020 maggino and alaimo 2021 maggino et al 2021 sustainable development is a process that cannot be measured directly it is only feasible to describe it with certain quantitative variables using adequate measurement methods and tools different quantitative methods are used in research to assess sustainable development cf cohon 2003 however there is no standard model used to evaluate the sustainable development of territorial units many publications consider the problem of multidimensional analysis of complex phenomena i e sustainable development maggino 2017 presents synthetic indicator construction developments for quantifying complex phenomena and focuses on the notion of complexity in social sciences horn 1993 also discusses the role of indicators in social sciences including economics in turn dahl 2012 notes that in the face of accelerating climate change economic instability and resource limits it is essential to find indicators that better describe sustainable development of different units multi criteria decision making mcdm methods are suitable for complex issues which are characterized by uncertainty and often contain conflicting objectives and different types of data wang et al 2009 there are two groups of mcdm multi attribute decision making madm and multi objective decision making modm in the first one the number of alternatives is finite the latter includes an infinite number of alternatives generally problems related to the choice and assessment of alternative solutions is finite hwang and yoon 1981 reviewed the literature on madm methods and applications mcdm methods used by researchers in studies of sustainable development have numerous limitations firstly these methods often cause excessive simplification of the real phenomena and relations between their determinants sustainable development is a complex phenomenon and its assessment requires taking into account many determinants secondly these variables are often characterized by strong asymmetry or extreme observations especially variables describing the environmental aspect even a single outlier for a given territorial unit may significantly affect the analysis and the resulting conclusions given the above researchers should pay closer attention to outlier robust methods to solve this problem we propose to use the potential of a multi criteria decision making approach with an optimal tail selection of variable distribution to assess the sustainable development of territorial units the proposed approach is based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 i e the most suitable technique for solving mcdm problems the topsis method is very useful in constructing a synthetic measure index and ranking territorial units described by many variables in data sets with unusual values of variables the assumption that the maximum and minimum values of the variables are model values a positive ideal solution and a negative ideal solution leads to excessive remoteness from typical values of the variables consequently it narrows the range of variability of the constructed synthetic measure the problem may be solved by applying methods based on the extreme value theory evt evt is a powerful and robust theory for studying the tail behavior of the distribution of variables different approaches are used in evt to model extreme values scarrott and macdonald 2012 in the most straightforward and frequently used approaches the threshold variable value which separates the distribution tail from its middle part is the fixed quantile of the empirical distribution usually of the order of 0 9 mcneil and frey 2000 or 0 95 bee et al 2016 some approaches are based on convenient visual tools coles 2001 łuczak and just 2020a used the graph of the mean excess function mef together with the topsis to assess the economic development level of units at different government levels they also used a similar approach to assess the socioeconomic development level of rural municipalities just and łuczak 2019 in another study the stability of the estimated parameters of the generalized pareto distribution gpd was analyzed to limit the impact of extreme values on the assessment of financial self sufficiency of local administrative units laus łuczak et al 2018 however the graphical based threshold choice procedures require identifying stable regions in the graphs and thus are highly subjective as a way to overcome this drawback the source literature proposes optimal tail selection procedures that correspond to the application of automated methods caeiro and gomes 2016 danielsson et al 2016 gomes and oliveira 2001 however none of these conceptions outperforms other methods in all situations thus we analyze various methods to indicate which one may be used in practice for the establishment of development documents we used eight methods to describe the tails of the variable distribution i e the distance metric method with the mean absolute and kolmogorov smirnov penalty functions danielsson et al 2016 the reiss and thomas procedures reiss and thomas 2007 the path stability algorithm caeiro and gomes 2016 the automated eye ball method resnick and stărică 1997 the minimization of mean squared error mse estimates introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 and the guillou and hall s procedure guillou and hall 2001 as a result the influence of extreme values was reduced moreover in this paper we propose applying the topsis method that utilizes the spatial median of oja oja 1983 ronkainen et al 2002 that is used to limit the impact of strong asymmetry łuczak and just 2020b the proposed approach was used in the assessment of sustainable development of polish municipalities in 2018 the main objective of this paper is to present the application possibilities of a multi criteria decision making approach with an optimal tail selection to assess the sustainable development of territorial units we have also set two additional objectives the first one concerns determining the development levels in the economic social and environmental fields and the sustainable development levels of municipalities in poland in 2018 the second one involves assessing the sustainable development statuses of municipalities in poland in 2018 based on a broad review of the source literature research gaps have been identified as well as the following research questions being formulated q1 which method for identification of the tails of variable distribution is best suited for limiting the influence of extreme values of variables in the process of constructing a synthetic measure concerning sustainable development q2 what was the differentiation in the level of sustainable development and its pillars among the municipalities in poland in 2018 q3 what were the statuses and levels of sustainable development and its pillars for municipalities in poland in 2018 q4 which clusters of municipalities in poland in 2018 are the most compact in terms of sustainable development and its pillars the authors contribution to developing a methodological approach to evaluate sustainable development of units includes a proposal of a hybrid multi criteria decision making procedure based on positional topsis with optimal tail selection method secondly the authors proposed a measure for assessing cluster compactness the proposed approach expands possibilities of research in terms of sustainable development and its pillars using various methods the research results are crucial for decision makers at all levels of government and self government who participate in creating strategic documents development strategies plans and programs and establishing environmental economic and social policies the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides a brief literature review section 3 describes the methods and data used in the empirical study sections 4 and 5 present the results of research including a discussion while sections 6 and 7 summarize the study and include conclusions and recommendations 2 brief literature review sustainable development is a multidimensional phenomenon finding appropriate indices to measure the development level of a given region using various sustainable development dimensions poses a significant issue in addressing sustainability the review indicates that there are multiple indices available for its assessment different tools statistics measures indices indicators and variables 1 1 ciegis et al 2009 defined in general terms an indicator as a quantitative or a qualitative measure that can show relative positions of a territorial unit in contrast an index is a combination of indicators variables in other words aggregated indicators are an index indicators are reduced to one factor this factor constitutes an index of different levels of complex phenomena e g sustainable development tong et al 2006 bartelmus 2008 mori and christodoulou 2012 used an interchangeable terms index and indicator are considered applied and proposed to assess sustainability alaimo 2018 alaimo et al 2020a 2020b bartelmus 2008 braulio gonzalo et al 2015 ciegis et al 2009 hiremath et al 2013 mori and christodoulou 2012 munier 2011 nijkamp and ouwersloot 1998 parris and kates 2003 pearce et al 1998 pupphachai and zuidema 2017 rosales 2011 shen et al 2011 steurer and hametner 2013 tong et al 2006 verbruggen and kuik 1991 summarizing general recommendations for the indicators point out that they have a scientific basis e g indicator concept measuring units and sources of data correspond to policy goals must be representative and measurable quantitative character provide significant information about the territorial units in terms of sustainability should describe the environment economic and social phenomena and sometimes institutions should present a given system as a whole can inform about the state of the system support rational decision making verbruggen and kuik 1991 emphasized that indicators are a compromise between scientific accuracy and the demand for concise information moreover they discussed other four crucial features of indicators i e type dimensions scope and construction ciegis et al 2009 also emphasized that indicators are needed as methodological compromise among technical feasibility public availability to use and systemic consistency furthermore parris and kates 2003 added that the key problems of indicators are associated with data availability and use spatial and temporal scale selection of indicators and the aggregation of indicators steurer and hametner 2013 noted that indicators have three main functions i e they reduce the number of measurements simplify the communication of positive and negative developments and provide crucial guidance for policy making different methods techniques and instruments for sustainable development assessment are presented in available research rosales 2011 many researchers recommend and use the gross domestic product gdp gross national product gnp or gross national income gni as common indicators for measuring sustainable development dos santos gaspar et al 2017 hirai 2017 opschoor 1991 it is well known that the aforementioned economic indicators include only social or human aspects of development and do not reflect the condition of the environment therefore these indicators may not be sufficient to assess sustainable development the index of sustainable economic welfare isew constitutes an alternative to them since its definition comprises of variables that are not included in the conventional national accounts such as environmental and social variables chelli et al 2013 dos santos gaspar et al 2017 pointed out that this index can be used to control the way in which countries use the available resources balancing ecological development environmental damage and income distribution using the isew they also compared the sustainable development approach with the traditional economic growth approach based on gdp and its relationship with energy consumption in the 1990s the human development index hdi was introduced which constitutes an objective measure of human development hickel 2020 pointed out that it was an important step towards a more sensible measure of progress one defined less by gdp growth and more by social goals however hdi has some significant limitations that were revealed in the 21st century against the background of many ecological problems and increasing crisis of climate change human development index ignores the main sustainability principles because it is based on high levels of income and does not include the ecological dimension it is worth noting that some attempts at combining the hdi with the environmental dimension appear in the source literature biggeri and mauro 2018 bravo 2014 hirai 2017 togtokh and gaffney 2010 türe 2013 hickel 2020 proposed an alternative the sustainable development index sdi which is an indicator of strong sustainability the sdi corrects ecological problems while retaining the basic formula of the hdi that measure nations ecological efficiency in delivering human development rockström et al 2009 and steffen et al 2015 indicate problems in the ecological sphere by showing the planetary boundary pb concept they point out four critical world problems climate change biodiversity loss chemical loading by nitrogen and phosphorous and land system change crossing a boundary can cause permanent changes to the earth system steffen et al 2015 concluded that pbs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation and the pb framework can make a valuable contribution to decision makers in charting desirable courses for societal development on the other hand it should also be noted that in terms of the social sphere the greatest problems are still material and financial issues łuczak and kalinowski 2020 researchers most often evaluate sustainable development using traditional methods szopik depczyńska et al 2018 conducted a comparative analysis of european union countries based on a taxonomic measure of sustainable development using the weber median vector the sustainable development indicators published by eurostat were used in the study these indicators were divided into 17 thematic areas connected to 17 objectives of the sustainable development strategy according to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development bolcárová and kološta 2015 also created an aggregated index for sustainable development from the eu set of indicators for each of the 27 eu countries based on the principal component analysis pca in their study sustainable development indicators were taken from social economic and environmental fields however economic growth was not considered piwowarski et al 2018 used alternative methods i e topsis and vikor višekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno rešenje which means multicriteria optimization and compromise solution to study the level of sustainable development of the eu countries yang et al 2017 assessed sustainable urban development levels and trends in chinese cities using the linear dimensionless analysis method they conducted a quantitative analysis of the main factors influencing sustainable development in 287 cities in the eastern central and western regions of china liao et al 2020 also studied sustainable development in china they evaluated the level of sustainable development of provinces in china from 2012 to 2018 using the improved entropy coefficient topsis in comparison tang et al 2019 proposed the modified topsis method based on the gray relational analysis for the sustainability evaluation of 16 cities in anhui province china in this approach the entropy method was used to assign weights to each index according to its evaluation score in turn gray relation analysis was applied to reduce the uncertainty existing in the process of evaluation tran 2016 proposed a method for selecting a set of sustainable development indicators that can be used for various sustainability related tasks including assessment of current condition sustainable urban development this approach is established on clustering of variables selecting cluster representative and also multivariate linear regression it should also be added that kwatra et al 2020 noted that there are various indices on different aspects of sustainability available at the global scale for countries but only a limited number of studies have been concerned with this issue at a regional scale alaimo 2018 presented the composite indicators approach to build a synthetic index to compare different european union countries in terms of their level of economic sustainability he used a set including 23 basic indicators from 2010 to 2016 in another article alaimo and maggino 2020 studied sustainable development at regional level they stated that aggregating is useful in order to simplify the complexity and allow an immediate representation of the phenomena however it does not allow a precise analysis they criticized the results obtained through syntheses based on compensative aggregation which generate the so called flattening effect another interesting tool for sustainability assessment was proposed by giannetti et al 2019 it is based on the five sector sustainability 5sensu model and use of goal programming as a multicriteria method the advantage of this model is that it makes it possible to show the relationships between humans and the natural environment moreover this tool forms a clear criterion in choosing indicators supported by the 5sensu model and in effect leads to constructing an easy understanding of the sustainability synthetic index of systems alaimo et al 2020a proposed a method of synthesizing multi indicator systems over time based on the partial order theory in another paper alaimo et al 2020b presented two methods of synthesis a non aggregative approach based on the theory of the poset they emphasized advantages of the presented approach such as the possibility that the definition of the structure of cooperabilities underling multi indicators systems as well as indicated possibility not only to investigate the nature of the phenomenon in more detail but also to help policy makers in their assessments the review reveals that most studies have focused on the assessment of the current state of sustainable development with conventional methods that are not robust to outliers of indicators this is an important problem in most of the conducted analyzes and it affects the interpretation of the results 3 data and methods in the paper we proposed a hybrid mcdm procedure for assessing the sustainable development of local administrative units it includes ten stages presented in fig 1 stage 1 selection of variables of the sustainable development of laus e g municipalities in the economic social and environmental fields three independent sets of variables are used to describe the economic social and environmental aspects sub criteria in laus when choosing the variables a decisive role should be played by substantive grounds supported by statistical analysis stage 2 identification of extreme values selecting the optimal threshold which determines the beginning of the tail of the variable distribution we used eight methods i e mean absolute deviation distance metric method mad dis 2 2 abbreviations given in brackets are used in the article kolmogorov smirnov distance metric method ks dis reiss and thomas procedure with two different rt expressions rt1 and rt2 path stability method ps automated eye ball method eye ball minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error method damse guillou and hall s procedure gh estimating the threshold is equivalent to choosing the extreme values of the variable below we present the methods used 3 1 mean absolute deviation distance metric mad distance metric and kolmogorov smirnov distance metric ks distance metric methods the mad distance metric mad dis and ks distance metric ks dis approaches presented by danielsson et al 2016 are based on minimizing the distance between the largest upper order statistics of the dataset i e the distance between the empirical tail and the theoretical tail of a pareto distribution the tail index α of this distribution is estimated using the hill estimator hill 1975 ξ k n h 1 α 1 k i 0 k 1 log x n i n log x n k n where k is the number of upper order statistics used for estimation of the parameter α the distance which is measured in the quantile dimension is minimized with respect to k the optimal number of upper order statistics k is called k0 determining k0 is equivalent to specifying the number of extreme values or the number of data in the tail the mad distance metric method uses the mean absolute deviation penalty function q n mad 1 t j 1 t x n j n q j k and the ks distance metric takes the maximum absolute deviation penalty function q n ks in f k su p j x n j n q j k j 1 t where t k is the region over which distance metric is measured x n j n the empirical quantile q j k the quantile estimated by x n k 1 n k j 1 α k with the hill estimator α k in these algorithms the size of the upper tail is denoted by ts 3 2 reiss and thomas rt procedure reiss and thomas 2007 proposed an alternative procedure for choosing the optimal number of data in the tail k0 this procedure selects the lowest upper order statistic by minimizing the expression rt1 1 k i 1 k i β ξ i h median ξ i h ξ k h or expression rt2 1 k i 1 k i β ξ i h ξ k h 2 where ξ i h is the hill estimator and the tuning parameter satisfies 0 β 0 5 in practice the minimum value of k i e kmin is usually used scarrott and macdonald 2012 3 3 path stability ps method the path stability method is a heuristic algorithm introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 the algorithm is used to find a stable region of the path stability i e the hill plot of a tail index with respect to k the optimal number of data in the tail k0 is identified by the algorithm that consists of six steps step 1 ps given an observed data x 1 x n compute t k ξ k n h k 1 n 1 using the hill estimator step 2 ps take j0 as a minimum value of j a non negative integer such that the rounded values to j decimal places of the estimates in the first step are distinct define a k t j round t k j k 1 n 1 the rounded values of t k

respectively of the set with the broadest range the largest run size is l t k m a x t k m i n t step 4 ps consider all those estimates t k k m i n t k k m a x t now with two additional decimal places

n h in the ps it is assumed that j 0 or j 1 3 4 automated eye ball method eye ball the automated eye ball method is used to find a stable region in the hill plot by defining a moving window danielsson et al 2016 resnick and stărică 1997 this method is based on an algorithm that looks for a substantial drop in the variance of the hill plot as k is increased the following estimator is used to select the optimal number of data in the tail k 0 e y e min k 2 n w h 1 w i 1 w i α k ε α k i α k ε where w is the size of the moving window usually 1 of the full sample n the number of positive data ε the size of the range in which estimates may vary e g 0 3 h the percentage of data inside the moving window which should occur in the tolerable range usually around 90 3 5 minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error damse method the minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error method was introduced by caeiro and gomes 2016 the optimal number of data in the tail k0 in the damse method is identified by minimizing the asymptotic mean squared error amse of the hill estimator with respect to k this algorithm consists of five steps step 1 damse given an observed data x 1 x n calculate for the tuning parameters τ 0 and τ 1 the values of ρ τ k that have the form ρ τ k 3 w k n τ 1 w k n τ 3 dependent on the statistics w k n τ m k n 1 τ m k n 2 2 τ 2 m k n 2 2 τ 2 m k n 3 6 τ 3 if τ 0 log

guillou and hall 2001 proposed a procedure based on bias reduction for choosing the optimal threshold when fitting the hill estimator of a tail exponent to extreme value data the optimal number data

gh next obtain ξ g h ξ k 0 g h n g h stage 3 winsorization of data winsorization is the transformation of the variable by limiting its extreme values in the process of winsorization a specified number of extreme values of the variable are replaced with a constant smaller or larger value the constants are established based on the optimal thresholds stage 4 determination of the nature of variables in relation to the main criterion this stage consists of determining the way each variable affects the sub criterion considered hence the variables selected are classified as stimulants destimulants and nominants stimulant is a variable that has a stimulating effect contributes to increasing the level of the phenomenon while destimulant is a variable that has a destimulating effect decreasing the level of the phenomenon nominant is a variable type that is a destimulant in some variable range and a stimulant in another one the nominant optimal desirable value should be defined variables considered to be destimulants may be converted into stimulants with the use of a negative coefficient transformation stage 5 normalization of the values of variables using the oja s spatial median in the case of assessing sustainable development of laus variables with extreme values or characterized by an asymmetrical distribution of their values are often observed therefore to solve this problem the modified median standardization was proposed using oja s spatial median cf lira et al 2002 oja s spatial median is resistant to variables with strong asymmetry ronkainen et al 2002 oja 1983 additionally for limiting the influence of extreme values of variables threshold values of variables llk and ulk llk is the threshold value for left tail ulk is the threshold value for right tail k 1 k means e for the economic field s for the social field and n for the environmental field were applied in the formula of the modified median standardization łuczak and just 2020b 1 z ik l l k m e d x

social and environmental development respectively and the general synthetic measure of the sustainable development level the construction of synthetic sub measures based on the topsis aggregation formula hwang and yoon 1981 6 s i d i d i d i i 1 n the general measure of the level of sustainable development is calculated as follows 7 s i s i e s i s s i n 3 the values of synthetic index si range from 0 to 1 the higher the synthetic measure of development the higher the development level of the lau concerned stage 9 linear ordering and determination of the levels of sustainable development once linearly ordered the values of the synthetic measure provide a basis for the creation of typological classes these can be created using statistical methods or defined arbitrarily this study used the arbitral approach based on a division of synthetic measures into eight classes table 1 we propose a cluster compactness measure to assess the quality of the classification each class of the level of development was evaluated using this measure the idea of a cluster compactness measure is based on distances between linearly ordered values of synthetic measure index for units form the best to the worst it is assumed that the mean distance between the values of the synthetic measure in class c should be smaller than the mean distances between the standard values of the synthetic measure in the range from 0 to 1 standard range of value variation of the synthetic measure then the cluster is characterized by strong compactness i e 8 1 n c 1 i 1 n c 1 s i c s i 1 c 1 n 1 for n c 1 where s i c is the value of the synthetic measure i in cluster c n the number of all units n c the number of units in the c th class hence 9 1 n 1 1 n c 1 i 1 n c 1 s i c s i 1 c 0 10 1 n 1 1 n c 1 s 1 c s 2 c s 2 c s 3 c s n c 2 c s n c 1 c s n c 1 c s n c c 0 then after simplification the formula takes the following form 11 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c n c 1 0 12 n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c n 1 n c 1 0 13 n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c 0 thus the newly proposed cluster compactness measure can be calculated using the following formula 14 c m c c n c 1 n 1 s 1 c s n c c if c m c c 0 then class c has strong compactness a higher value of c m c c means greater compactness of cluster c stage 10 identification of the types of sustainable development status the method proposed allows determining the development status of laus in relation to other laus and identifying their sustainable development types in this approach the coordinates of location relative to the economic social and environmental fields can be calculated as follows 15 c e i s i e i e c s i s i s i s c n i s i n i n where ie is and in are the reference values for the economic social and environmental fields respectively which can be calculated as the mean median of sub measures for fields eight main types of sustainable development status can be identified depending on which of the values of synthetic measures prevail table 2 the proposed approach was used to assess the sustainable development of laus at the national level in poland in 2018 the national level includes 2478 municipalities the 1st level of administrative division in poland the study was based on statistical data from 2018 obtained from statistics poland local data bank 2020 seventeen indicators variables were selected based on a substantive and statistical analysis stage 1 including the following economic dimension x 1 the share of people using a sewage system in the total population x 2 the share of people using a gas system in the total population x 3 the share of people using wastewater treatment plants in the total population x 4 the share of own incomes of municipality budgets in total incomes x 5 investment property expenditure per capita pln x 6 entities entered in the regon register per 10 thousand of the population social dimension x 7 the share of the registered unemployed persons in the working age population x 8 the average useful floor area of dwelling m2 x 9 pupils per section in primary schools x 10 children aged 3 5 years per one place in preschool educational establishments x 11 population per generally available pharmacy x 12 foundations associations and social organizations per 1000 population environmental dimension x 13 emissions of air pollutants gasses t km2 year x 14 emissions of air pollutants particulates t km2 year x 15 the share of legally protected areas in the total area x 16 the share of parks lawns and green areas of the housing estate areas in the total area x 17 monuments of nature per 10 km2 five year 2014 2018 means were calculated for variable x 5 representing the investment expenditure per capita table a1 in appendix section shows descriptive statistics for selected variables moreover fig a1 in appendix section presents box plots they allow to visually present input data through their quartiles the set of variables retained for the study included variables that demonstrate strong asymmetry and outlying observations 4 results of research this study proposed and used a procedure to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 we assumed that the stimulants are x 1 x 6 x 8 x 12 x 15 x 17 and destimulants are x 7 x 9 x 11 x 13 x 14 it also identified one nominant x 10 almost half of the variable distributions describing municipalities demonstrated strong positive skewness x 5 x 6 x 10 x 13 x 14 x 16 x 17 appendix table a1 fig a1 extreme values were observed in the right tails of distribution for half of the variables describing the economic pillar and for most of the variables describing the social and environmental pillars we used eight methods to select the optimal threshold which determines the beginning of the tail of the variable distribution stage 2 this allowed identifying the extreme values of the variables the obtained results are presented in table 3 comparing the threshold values for the variables we found that the four methods the reiss and thomas procedures the path stability algorithm the minimization of the amse method for certain variables cut the threshold values too low in turn the kolmogorov smirnov distance metric method for some variables cut the threshold too high next winsorization was performed and destimulants and nominant were converted into stimulants stages 3 4 following this the variables were normalized with the use of the oja s spatial median standardization stage 5 then absolute deviations from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution were used to calculate the synthetic sub measures of the levels of economic social and environmental development stages 6 8 we compared the results obtained using the proposed mcdm method for different tail selection procedures fig 2 for the sake of brevity we do not report results for the levels of economic social and environmental development particularly large differences in classifications were observed for the environmental pillar earlier studies by łuczak and just 2020a 2020b showed that the use of the well known topsis method as well as its combination with standardization based on the oja or weber median does not give the correct classification of results for all analyzed pillars as well as sustainable development similar results were obtained using the automated eye ball and guillou and hall s methods fig 2 given that two criteria threshold values and classification results the eye ball and gh methods are recommended for analysis these methods enabled the correct classifications of municipalities fig 3 the synthetic sub measures of the levels of economic social and environmental development and the general synthetic measure of the level of sustainable development were presented for the eye ball method this allowed us to identify sustainable development levels stage 9 tables 4 5 figs 5 8 the method proposed is also suitable for determining the development status of municipalities in relation to each other this allowed identifying the relevant types of sustainable development by calculating the coordinates of the location of municipalities in relation to the economic e social s and environmental n fields the deviations of synthetic sub measures from the mean value expressed as the median were used to determine the development statuses of municipalities in relation to the fields considered stage 10 table 6 in the case selected approach the obtained values of the synthetic measure covered a greater part of the potential range of its variation defined by the 0 1 interval as a result they provided more accurate identification of sustainable development types in municipalities this is also evidenced by the identification of classes of municipalities with extreme high and extreme low levels of economic development and environmental development figs 5 and 7 in contrast to the level of social development which was not very diverse fig 6 values of cluster compactness measure for the sub measures and the total measure of sustainable development level indicated that greatest compactness was exhibited by classes of a medium level of social environmental and sustainable development and a low level of economic development fig 4 in stage 9 five types of development for municipalities in poland were distinguished with regard to social development ranging from low to very high levels table 5 fig 6 the level of social development is less different from that of other types of development and shows a higher level of influence of urban agglomerations decreasing with growing distance from them the average value of the measure s i s was 0 556 eight types were distinguished with regard to economic and environmental development ranging from extreme low to extreme high levels table 5 figs 5 and 7 as far as the level of economic development is concerned the municipalities best developed in 2018 included those influenced by metropolitan centers i e warsaw cracow wroclaw poznan lodz gdansk sopot and gdynia upper silesian metropolitan area whose center is located in katowice bydgoszcz szczecin and rzeszow the average value of the synthetic measure for the economic development s i e in 2018 was 0 390 and the average level of environmental development was 0 600 the values of sub measures concerning different pillars of development were the basis for constructing a synthetic measure describing the level of sustainable development the synthetic measure of the sustainable development level of municipalities in poland was determined by averaging three sub measures its values ranged from 0 345 to 0 842 in 2018 this allowed defining five types of development for municipalities in poland ranging from having low to a very high development level tables 4 and 5 fig 8 in the last stage types of sustainable development statues of municipalities were identified table 6 fig 9 depending on the predominance of the development type eight main types of sustainability development statues were identified in 2018 only 300 municipalities in poland belonged to the integrated development type s e n these were mainly municipalities located in the western part of the country on the coast and those influenced by larger cities such as warsaw and poznan at the same time these municipalities were characterized by a very high high and medium high level of development table 6 the largest number of municipalities had the following two statuses i e economically and environmentally beneficial e s n and socially beneficial e s n 439 and 449 municipalities respectively mainly at a medium development level the smallest number of municipalities was classified as having economically and socially beneficial e s n and environmentally beneficial e s n statuses 198 and 208 respectively the remaining three types of socially and environmentally beneficial e s n economically beneficial e s n and economically socially and environmentally less beneficial e s n statuses applied to between 290 and 302 municipalities and their level of development was mostly medium or low table 6 5 discussion the idea of the approach proposed is based on the comparability and transparency of the measures constructed we developed a multidimensional sustainable development index and three sub indices for the following domains environment society and economy moreover our research showed the possibility of establishing statuses of sustainable development it is worth noting that a status shows the development position in comparison with other territorial units it is the state of development of a territorial unit at a given moment which is defined in terms of the environmental social and economic dimensions on the other hand the level of development indicates the grade of development it is worth emphasizing that the indices proposed in the literature rarely include all three main pillars of sustainable development i e environment society and economy some studies raise the problem of multidimensional assessment of the sustainable development of territorial units but do not pay attention to the distribution of the variables adopted in the research lemke and bastini 2020 developed the comprehensive and comparable multilevel sustainable development index mlsdi covering the environmental social and economic dimensions barrera roldán and saldı var valdés 2002 showed a different approach and used the multi attribute decision theory methodology applying 21 indicators in the construction of the sustainable development index the indicators included the environmental social and economic variables but the index was only applied to seven municipalities salvati et al 2016 proposed a sustainable development index based on 99 individual variables for 8101 municipalities in italy the number of variables used by o regan et al 2009 is surprising more than 300 economic social and environmental attributes for 79 irish villages these examples are thought provoking it is worth considering whether the use of a higher number of variables in the research is better there is also the question of what kind of territorial units are studied and whether the entire population was examined in our opinion the type and number of territorial units determine the choice of methods first it should be emphasized that our research covers a wider spectrum of territorial units surveyed we conducted complex studies on all 2478 municipalities in poland secondly another significant problem concerns the correlation of the value of the variables it is especially visible when the number of examined units is small the introduction of an excessive number of variables to research variables correlated with each other leads to the introduction of the same information by them in our study we avoided this problem by eliminating the over correlated variables we used 17 features that carry important information for the territorial units surveyed thirdly some data sets especially for small territorial units considered at the macro level show highly diversified values of variables in these data sets the variables usually have not normal distributions and may appear extreme values of variables especially in the environmental sphere almost all variables related to the environmental sphere variables connected with emissions of air pollutants gasses and particulates the share of parks lawns and green areas of the housing estate areas in the total area and number of monuments of nature per 10 km2 used in our study were characterized by extreme asymmetry and high kurtosis values therefore these types of data cause many problems with the proper assessment of the level of development and the correct typology of objects in our research we introduced eight advanced methods from the extreme value theory to limit the influence of extreme values of variables szopik depczyńska et al 2018 used the weber median vector to calculate the taxonomic measure of sustainable development for the european union it should be underlined that the weber median is useful for limiting the impact of variables with non normal distribution and helps in more correct analysis but it does not solve the whole problem of extreme values in data sets for complex phenomena describing territorial units łuczak and just 2020a point out that the weber median only restricts the impact of strong asymmetry but does not deal with the problem of extreme values łuczak and just 2019 2020a 2020b showed some solution to this problem they combined the multidimensional spatial median with some basic methods from the evt to limit the impact of extreme values against the background of a broad literature review we do not find any studies which show all of these problems and solve them comprehensively the research enabled the assessment of the levels of sustainable development and its partial measures for the environmental social and economic pillars as indicated by lemke and bastini 2020 sustainability indicators and indices are useful analytical tools indices proposed in literature rarely comprise all three contentual domains of sustainable development environment society and economy fail to enable comparisons of agents at multiple levels and exhibit methodological shortcomings 6 conclusions this paper proposed an approach of multidimensional analysis of sustainable development based on mcdm methods with optimal tail selection the proposed method using the positional topsis with the oja s spatial median and the eye ball method reduces the impact of strong asymmetry and extreme values of variables describing laus which often appear in the case of variables describing the development of laus especially environmental development this method was used to assess the sustainable development of municipalities in poland in 2018 in the case of linear ordering the occurrence of even one extreme value e g very large for an lau can significantly affect the assignment of an excessively high or low rank in the final classification of laus using the positional topsis with standardization based on oja s spatial median for winsorized data improves the classification of objects similar rankings and classifications of objects gave the positional topsis combined with the automated eye ball method or the guillou and hall s method the eye ball method was used to identify extreme values in the proposed approach the typology of municipalities in poland in 2018 created on the positional topsis with eye ball method basis reflects well the inter class differences in the sustainable development of municipalities with these methods it was possible to determine the development levels in the economic social and environmental fields and the sustainable development levels eight grades ranging from extreme low to extreme high based on research eight types of polish municipalities were identified in 2018 environmental social and economic development levels were found to vary significantly across municipalities the highest levels of social and economic development were recorded in municipalities located near urban centers while the lowest levels were reported by remote rural municipalities in contrast to the environmental development level the highest levels of environmental development were recorded in remote rural municipalities while the lowest levels were reported by urban municipalities this method also enables us to determine the position of the municipalities and allows to identify their types of sustainable development the rule of deviations of the values of synthetic partial value from their mean value was used to determine the developmental positions of municipalities analysis has shown that the most significant integration of three orders was demonstrated by urban and urban rural municipalities in the western part of poland while non integrated municipalities were predominantly remote rural municipalities this method is universal and can also be used in analyzing the level of sustainable development of other units e g regions countries 7 recommendations the authors recommend using the positional topsis method with optimal tail selection for assessing sustainable development of territorial units described by variables with extreme values in order to establish limits of winsorization the authors recommend using the automated eye ball method or the guillou and hall s method to determine the extreme values along with other statistical procedures and substantive criteria to avoid mechanical and excessive winsorization winsorization based on only one criterion can lead to improper placement of objects in classes the proposed approach to assess the sustainable development levels of laus is a universal technique that may be used for other administrative units

24573,visual encounter distance models are important tools for predicting how light and water clarity mediate visual predator prey interactions that affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems at multiple spatial temporal and organizational scales the two main varieties of visual encounter distance models mechanistic and empirical are used for similar purposes but take fundamentally different approaches to model development and have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of predictive accuracy physical and biological interpretability of parameters ability to incorporate outside information and utility for knowledge transfer to overcome weaknesses of existing mechanistic and empirical models and bridge the gap between approaches we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model that relaxes assumptions of a widely used mechanistic model that are violated in real predator prey interactions we compared the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to a widely used mechanistic model and an empirical visual encounter distance model by fitting models to data from four predator prey experiments the generalized visual reaction distance model substantially outperformed the other models in all cases based on fit to reaction distance data and presents an attractive alternative to prior models based on comparatively

interactions affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems visual encounter distance models link conditions in the visual environment light and water clarity to the distance at which predator prey interactions are initiated aksnes and giske 1993 aksnes and utne 1997 mazur and beauchamp 2003 vogel and beauchamp 1999 wright and o brien 1984 the models provide a basis for answering

range reaction distance and encounter distance visual range is the distance at which an object prey is detectable to an animal predator based on visual sensory input exceeding the minimum threshold of

visual range to data from predator prey visual foraging experiments e g aksnes and utne 1997 meager et al 2010 reaction distance is the distance at which an animal exhibits a behavioral reaction towards a stimulus in predator prey interactions reaction distance is the result of both detection and co evolved dynamics of predator prey interactions that determine whether a predator responds given detection of a stimulus reaction distances are quantified using predator prey experiments or in situ observations of predator prey interactions we define encounter distance as the distance where a predator initiates a predator prey interaction within the context of a model encounter distance can be synonymous with visual range or reaction distance depending on how a visual encounter distance model is constructed some approaches for calculating visual range based on minimum detection criteria can combine information from physiological experiments histological studies and behavioral conditioning studies but do not account for behavior visual encounter distance models are a key component of coupled visual foraging models that predict prey encounter and consumption rates of predators as a function of light and water clarity prey distribution and density and predator distribution two main varieties of visual encounter distance models are used to characterize visual reactions of predators to prey mechanistic and empirical i e phenomenological mechanistic and empirical models take fundamentally different approaches to model development and parameterization mechanistic models characterize visual range as a proxy for encounter distance based on individual physical and biological components of a predator prey system mechanistic models are parameterized by statistically fitting models to reaction distance data from visual foraging experiments e g aksnes and utne 1997 meager et al 2010 or using morphological and functional traits of predators and prey giske et al 1994 lovvorn et al 2001 nilsson et al 2014 ruxton and johnsen 2016 mechanistic models have a tendency to produce unrealistically large estimates of reaction distance under conditions of low water clarity that are common in marine ecosystems as such mechanistic models often impose generic and un validated constraints on visual range such as setting a minimum contrast threshold to avoid unrealistically low signal detection thresholds for photoreceptors e g ruxton and johnsen 2016 or setting maximum encounter distance equal to one predator body length e g fiksen et al 2002 langbehn and varpe 2017 varpe and fiksen 2010 empirical models are developed by fitting generic functional forms e g polynomial sigmoidal piecewise polynomial to reaction distance data from visual foraging experiments with the best fitting model used to predict visual encounter distances hansen et al 2013 holbrook et al 2013 keyler et al 2019 mechanistic and empirical encounter distance models have different strengths and weaknesses owing to different assumptions about how to represent processes that regulate visual predator prey interactions by using specific functional representations of physical and biological processes mechanistic models assume that functional representations accurately represent the physical process by which image forming light propagates through water and the physiological behavioral process of vision and reaction aksnes and giske 1993 aksnes and utne 1997 the strength of mechanistic models is that they use physically interpretable parameters which allows them to incorporate information beyond what may be available for a single experiment predator or prey this is useful because it is infeasible to conduct experiments with every predator prey system lythgoe 1972 however a weakness is that if assumptions of mechanistic models are not met they have limited ability to fit empirical data and may produce biased estimates of parameters and encounter distances in contrast to mechanistic models empirical models make few assumptions about how physical or physiological behavioral processes should be functionally represented consequently empirical models may be more flexible and thereby provide a better fit to the data a weakness is that model terms do not always have a physical or biological interpretation outside the context of a specific predator prey system and parameters are not necessarily comparable among predators prey or experiments the lack of a consistent structure and physically or biologically interpretable parameters makes it challenging or even impossible to apply empirical models to novel predator prey systems or in some cases beyond the range of experimental treatments this is an important limitation because it is not feasible to conduct experiments with every predator prey system of interest despite the different approaches to model development and parameterization mechanistic and empirical visual encounter distance models are used to address similar questions for example a mechanistic model showed how reduced water clarity caused by eutrophication can allow tactile feeding jellyfish to gain a competitive advantage over visually feeding fish larvae reducing the productivity of marine fish stocks eiane et al 1999 while an empirical model demonstrated how reduced water clarity can reduce predation risk and increase foraging opportunity and productivity of lake dwelling planktivorous fishes hansen and beauchamp 2015 similarly a mechanistic model suggested how the loss of arctic sea ice due to climate change may increase light and enhance the productivity of visually foraging pelagic fish stocks langbehn and varpe 2017 while an empirical model showed how increases in light due to anthropogenic light pollution can increase visual predation mortality for planktivorous fishes mazur and beauchamp 2006 ideally visual encounter distance models should have physically and biologically interpretable parameters and apply consistent representations of the physical process of visual image transfer and the physiological behavioral process of vision and reaction but do so under a broader range of assumptions to improve model fits in this way a more standardized approach can be used to estimate visual parameters from experimental data thereby facilitating the transfer and generalization of knowledge bouchet et al 2019 yates et al 2018 moreover models that use explicit structural representations of physiological behavioral and physical processes represent specific mechanistic hypotheses about how processes work thus lack of fit can provide insight into why a hypothesis failed and guide refinement or generation of new hypotheses hilborn and mangel 1997 it would be beneficial to develop a visual encounter distance model that mechanistically characterizes physical and biological relationships in the visual encounter process fits visual reaction distance data well can incorporate outside information and facilitate knowledge transfer to that end we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model that bridges the gap between mechanistic and empirical modeling approaches by relaxing assumptions of the widely used aksnes and utne 1997 mechanistic model of visual range that appear to be violated in real predator prey interactions the aksnes and utne 1997 model has seen widespread use because it can be fitted to data from visual reaction distance experiments and uses parameters that are physically and biologically interpretable because it uses physically and biological interpretable parameters the aksnes and utne model can be used to model predator prey systems where experimental data are not available e g aksnes and giske 1993 langbehn and varpe 2017 lovvorn et al 2001 using data from four published experimental visual foraging studies we then compare the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical model that had the best fit among multiple candidate empirical models in a visual reaction distance study hansen et al 2013 we chose these comparisons because they are representative of modeling options that are available to experimentalists we chose studies to provide a representative set of predator prey systems planktivorous and piscivorous fish sensory modes of foraging visual and non visual environmental conditions light and water clarity and experimental configurations our primary aims were to evaluate whether assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were met compare the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to empirical models and examine how different modeling approaches affect parameter estimates and the precision and accuracy of predicted reaction distances we show that the generalized visual reaction distance model fits reaction distance data better than the aksnes and utne model but it retains physically and biologically interpretable parameters that are crucial for transferring information among predator prey systems and allow the model to be used for predator prey systems lacking experimental reaction distance data 2 materials and methods we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model for aquatic predator prey interactions by relaxing structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne model of visual range aksnes and utne 1997 by applying the model to a series of cases from the literature we then compared the performance of various formulations of the generalized visual reaction distance model to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical visual encounter distance model table 1 parameters associated with these models are defined in table 2 2 1 aksnes and utne model of visual range the

encounter distance between a predator and prey the aksnes and utne model makes five key assumptions that when violated result in a lack of fit to reaction distance data from visual foraging

reactions occur at the distance where apparent contrast of the object exceeds the minimum contrast threshold of the predator and 5 the retinal neural behavioral response to changes in environmental light follows a naka rushton function with α 1 there is evidence that real predator prey interactions routinely violate the first four assumptions of the aksnes and utne model the first assumption of the aksnes and utne model can be violated because predators use senses other than vision to detect prey when light levels fall below the minimum for visual detection of prey reaction distances can approach an asymptote for some predator prey systems e g hansen et al 2013 richmond et al 2004 filtering data a priori to ensure the model is only fit to visual reactions can prevent a violation of model assumptions although the threshold light level between visual and non visual reactions may not be obvious the second assumption that predators view prey along a horizontal plane is almost certainly violated in many real predator prey interactions in visual search it is advantageous for predators to search for prey from below because downwelling light increases the luminance of the background increasing the contrast of prey e g thetmeyer and kils 1995 to avoid issues of angular dependence and allow measurement of reaction distance at low light levels some visual reaction distance experiments have constrained predator viewing angles by using shallow experimental arenas adding angular dependence to the aksnes and utne model would improve the flexibility of the model the third and fourth assumptions regarding contrast reduction and contrast thresholds can be violated in several ways but reasons for a violation are inseparable based solely on predator behavior as turbidity increases from clear water conditions fishes exhibit an increase or no change in reaction distance to prey at low levels of turbidity followed by a decrease at higher levels of turbidity hansen et al 2013 mazur and beauchamp 2003 utne palm 2002 vogel and beauchamp 1999 hypotheses to explain a lack of fit to turbidity are that suspendoids increase the visual contrast of prey against the background by affecting color and brightness contrast physical effects hypothesis utne palm 2002 that feeding motivation of predators increases at specific levels of turbidity due to acclimation feeding motivation hypothesis boehlert and morgan 1985 utne palm 2002 or that reactions depend on a predator recognizing an object as prey based on apparent size shape and movement ideal stimulus hypothesis hairston jr et al 1982 semmelhack et al 2014 the third assumption may be violated because the law of contrast reduction may not apply to underwater visual foraging appendix a the law of contrast reduction was originally derived for the atmosphere where objects are visible at long distances lee et al 2015 a key assumption used to analytically derive the law of contrast reduction for the atmosphere is that targets can be treated as point sources this is likely violated in many underwater visibility applications because underwater objects become visible at distances that are orders of magnitude shorter distances than in air lee et al 2015 the fourth assumption that reactions occur at the point where the apparent contrast of prey exceeds the minimum detectable contrast threshold can be violated because detection precedes recognition and reaction and detection and recognition of prey does not guarantee a reaction an object becomes detectable i e is within visual range when image forming light radiating from the object reaches an observer s photoreceptors and initiates a retinal neural signaling response phototransduction cascade that exceeds some minimum threshold for detection dowling 2012 signals are processed in the retina and brain leading to recognition and reaction semmelhack et al 2014 however detection and recognition does not necessarily lead to reaction because reactions are mediated by the physiological state of a predator e g hunger stress learning and co evolved dynamics of predator attack and prey defense factors that may be considered extensions of the ideal stimulus and feeding motivation hypotheses moreover an object moving through the visual field of a predator presents an attentive cue that can play a role in detection recognition and reaction consequently visual predators may react to mobile prey at greater distances than stationary prey utne palm 1999 which is not explicitly represented in the aksnes and utne model 2 2 generalized visual reaction distance model gvrdm we developed various formulations of a generalized visual reaction distance model to relax structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne model that appear violated in real predator prey interactions table 1 and define the parameters associated with these models table 2 starting from the aksnes and utne model aum 1 we added a non visual reaction distance component to the model to relax the first assumption as 3 r v 2 exp r v c c 0 a p e p r i m e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q where d is non visual reaction distance m and q is the light intensity threshold μmol photons m 2 s 1 below which non visual reaction distance exceeds visual reaction distance hereafter we refer to this version of the aksnes and utne model with a non visual reaction as aum 2 we relaxed the second assumption of the aksnes and utne model by incorporating duntley s angular contrast reduction equation duntley 1952 into the model to allow non horizontal viewing angles as 4 r v 2 exp r v c k d cos θ c 0 a p e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q where kd is the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient m 1 and θ is the nadir viewing angle up 0 down 180 to address the violation of the law of contrast reduction in underwater visibility applications we replaced the beam attenuation coefficient c with the effective attenuation coefficient κ m 1 based on the contrast reduction equation from lee et al s 2015 underwater visibility theory appendix a however for cases described below we interchangeably used the effective attenuation coefficient κ beam attenuation coefficient c and experimentally measured absorption coefficients based on availability of experimental data although the coefficients characterize light transmission differently in terms of geometry finally we relaxed the third and fourth assumptions that turbidity has a monotonic effect on reaction distance and reactions occur at a specific contrast threshold by including a dynamic scaling function ω 5 r v 2 exp r v κ k d cos θ ω κ c 0 a p e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q the dynamic scaling function models the effect of turbidity e g effective attenuation coefficient κ as a function of shape parameters β δ h 6 ω κ β δ h κ h 1 exp δ κ γ h the β parameter is dimensionless but represents a turbidity dependent change in contrast i e convergence to a new inherent contrast as turbidity increases the h and δ parameters are dimensionless and do not have a direct physical or biological interpretation outside of the context of the dynamic scaling function rather the parameters give the dynamic scaling function the flexibility to take functional forms that represent hypotheses concerning the lack of fit of the aksnes and utne model the model does not address specific violations of the fourth assumption however in case 3 subsection 2 4 3 we examine how prey movement a factor in the ideal stimulus hypothesis can be accounted for in the generalized visual reaction distance model the generalized visual reaction distance model does not provide a basis to test mechanistic hypotheses about the lack of fit of the aksnes and utne model rather it provides a framework for testing whether structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne are violated in visual foraging experiments for plausible values of the effective attenuation coefficient κ the aksnes and utne model is a special case of the generalized visual reaction distance model where θ 90 q 0 β 1 h 0 δ 0 and ε 0 or bf 0 2 3 parameterization for model evaluation we used the generalized visual reaction distance model aksnes and utne model and an empirical broken stick model for our cases tables 1 2 appendix b we reparameterized the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model for our cases using the composite predator prey interaction term t m2 to simplify the aksnes and utne model to 7 r 2 exp c r t e b k e e b and the visual component of the generalized visual reaction distance model to 8 r v 2 exp r v κ k d cos θ ω κ t e b k e e b i f e b q 2 4 evaluation of models we evaluated the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model relative to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical encounter distance model specifically we sought to evaluate whether assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated in real predator prey interactions whether the generalized visual reaction distance model performs as well as empirical models and which version of the dynamic scaling function with or without β had the best performance in the generalized visual reaction distance model we reviewed 32 visual foraging studies 65 predator prey combinations among experiments that involved manipulation of the visual environment and measurements of reaction distance table b2 and screened studies for inclusion in model evaluation based on suitability criteria table b1 based on the screening criteria we selected cases from four visual foraging studies for model evaluation based on our goal to include a representative set of predators planktivores and piscivores prey fish and zooplankton individuals and aggregations and sensory modes of prey detection visual and non visual information about studies we reviewed and details of experimental designs from cases are described in appendix b specific objectives and models used for each case are described below 2 4 1 case 1 piscivore reacting to fish prey we evaluated model performance for a piscivore system that may involve a non visual reaction to prey at low light levels we fit models to data from an experiment where yearling chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha reacted to juvenile rainbow trout o mykiss under varying levels of light and turbidity hansen et al 2013 appendix b in the experiments chinook salmon reaction distances approached an asymptote at 50 cm at low light levels potentially owing to a response to non visual stimulus or an unexplained artifact of the experimental design because there was evidence of non visual reaction we used versions of the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model that included a non visual reaction distance component aum 2 gvrdm 1 gvrdm 2 table 1 we also fit a version of the best fit empirical model broken stick model bsm from the original study to the data appendix c attack angles were not measured during the study so we assumed the nadir viewing angle was horizontal θ 90 under this assumption the diffuse attenuation coefficient kd is irrelevant because k d cos 90 always equals zero 2 4 2 case 2 planktivore reacting to group of ten zooplankton prey we evaluated whether the dynamics governing detection of prey aggregations were the same as for detection of individual prey and estimated model parameters for case 3 to do so for case 2 we fit models to data from an experiment where two spotted goby gobius flavescens reacted to aggregations of ten calanus finmarchicus a transparent calanoid copepod copepod aggregations were retained in 10 cm 3 cm vials under varying levels of light and turbidity utne 1997 no non visual reactions were reported i e no asymptote at low light levels so we used formulations of the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model without a non visual reaction aum 1 gvrdm 3 gvrdm 4 attack angles were not reported so we assumed θ 90 because the aksnes and utne model uses beam attenuation c rather than effective attenuation coefficient κ we also evaluated whether this difference affected model performance aksnes and utne 1997 appendix e attenuation coefficients 2 4 3 case 3 planktivore reacting to single zooplankton we evaluated model performance for a planktivore reacting to individual prey to assess if models could be used to simultaneously characterize the relative visibility of multiple prey types from the perspective of a predator and determine if the generalized visual reaction distance model and aksnes and utne model predicted similar visibility relationships among prey we fit models to data from an experiment where two spotted goby reacted to individual copepod c finmarchicus c helgolandicus prey across a range of turbidities but only one light level 20 μe m 2 s 1 utne palm 1999 appendix b treatments used mobile transparent immobile transparent or mobile red colored prey no non visual reactions were reported so we used models formulations without a non visual reaction aum 1 gvrdm 3 gvrdm 4 attack angles were not reported so we assumed θ 90 we included a different t parameter for each prey type ttm transparent mobile tti transparent immobile trm red mobile because experimental light levels were constant we could not estimate ke using only case 3 data instead we parameterized models using the maximum likelihood estimates of ke from case 2 2 4 4 case 4 planktivore reacting to single zooplankton with angular dependence we evaluated whether information about nadir viewing angle improved model fit to reaction distance data to do so we fit models to data from a planktivore experiment where stone moroko pseudorasbora parva reacted to daphnia pulex under varying levels of light and turbidity asaeda et al 2002 appendix b the study was the only one we are aware of where both nadir viewing angles and reaction distances were reported no non visual reactions were reported so we used versions of the models without a non visual component aum 1 gvrdm 3 and gvrdm 4 table 1 to evaluate whether nadir viewing angle improved model fit we compared models with nadir viewing angle to models where nadir viewing angle equaled 90 appendix e angular dependence 2 5 model fitting and comparison for each case subsections 2 4 1 2 4 4 variance in reaction distance increased as reaction distance increased so we fit models assuming reaction distances had log normally distributed error we estimated separate variances for visual σv and non visual σnv components of models because they involve different predator sensory processes that would presumably have different residual error structures additional details about model fitting are provided in appendix b we used bias corrected akaike s information criterion aicc for model comparison and evaluated model fit and evidence for violations of assumptions based on visual inspection of q q plots and residual plots 3 results 3 1 overall the generalized visual reaction distance model substantially outperformed the aksnes and utne model in all cases based on aicc table 3 and turbidity did not have a monotonic effect on reaction distance for any of the cases which is shown by the dynamic scaling functions fig 2 this suggests assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated in all of our cases the aksnes and utne model had a lack of fit to turbidity as shown by model fits across ranges of effective attenuation coefficient κ figs 3 a 4 a 5 a and patterns in model residuals in relation to κ figs d1 d4 which also suggests assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated the generalized visual reaction distance model had comparable or better fit than the aksnes and utne model across gradients of light figs 3b 4b compared to the aksnes and utne model the generalized visual reaction distance model tended to estimate that predators were less dark adapted higher ke figs 4d 6 c and could process more light or had higher contrast sensitivity higher t figs 3d 4d 5c 6c the higher half saturation level for retinal irradiance processing ke predicted by the generalized visual reaction distance model for cases 2 4 indicates that more light was necessary to stimulate a physiological behavioral response to light higher values of the composite predator prey interaction term t indicate a higher maximum retinal radiance processing capability emax or lower threshold for the predator s vision system to detect changes in irradiance between the target and the background δse the latter is analogous to contrast sensitivity appendix a there was no evidence of turbidity induced changes in prey contrast as versions of the generalized visual reaction distance model without a β parameter outperformed versions with a β parameter in all cases table 3 additionally for cases 2 4 versions of the model with a β parameter had wider confidence intervals for parameters than models without β indicating that inclusion of β inflated uncertainty in estimates of other parameters figs 3d 4d 5c 6c thus we focused on versions of the model without β across gradients of light and turbidity reaction distances predicted by the generalized visual reaction distance model differed from the aksnes and utne model as shown by fitted reaction distance surfaces for cases 1 3 figs 3c 4c 5b this is important because visual encounter distance models are often used to predict encounter distances well outside the range of experimental observations 3 2 cases for case 1 the generalized visual reaction distance model outperformed the broken stick model based on aicc indicating that it can perform at least as well as empirical models table 3 despite the better fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model predictions were generally similar between the generalized visual reaction distance model and broken stick model within the range of experimental conditions fig 3a b however beyond the range of experimental conditions there were considerable differences in predicted reaction distances between the models for case 1 fig 3c for case 2 fitting models to adjusted beam attenuation c instead of the effective attenuation coefficient κ improved the fit of the aksnes and utne model and worsened the fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model table e1 still the generalized visual reaction distance model outperformed the aksnes and utne model based on aicc for the aksnes and utne model ke and t parameter estimates were 2 1 and 1 6 times higher than for the model with κ respectively fig e2 for the generalized visual reaction distance model ke did not change but t was 10 6 times higher than for models with κ fig e2 higher t indicates higher light processing capability or higher contrast sensitivity while higher ke indicate lower dark adaptation because light intensity responses vary over orders of magnitude small variations in ke and t for the aksnes and utne model and ke for the generalized visual reaction distance model would not substantially affect the predictive performance of models processes regulating visual reactions of two spotted goby to aggregations of ten copepods case 2 may have differed from those regulating reactions to individual copepods case 3 this is suggested by qualitative differences in the contour shapes between reaction distance surfaces for ten copepods fig 4c versus single copepods fig 5b and differences in dynamic scaling function parameters fig 2 4d 5c this difference may be an artifact of the experimental approach the different levels at which data were aggregated for the cases or because mechanisms that regulate visual reactions are functionally different between aggregations and individuals for case 3 the generalized visual reaction distance model and aksnes and utne model both predicted that red mobile copepods rm were the most visible followed by transparent mobile tm then transparent immobile ti copepods as shown by fitted reaction distances fig 5a b and the rank order of t parameters for different prey trm ttm tti fig 5c the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model estimated nearly identical relative visibility relationships among prey as trm ttm tti was approximately 1 00 0 66 0 33 for both models for the highest turbidity treatment highest κ predator reactions to transparent immobile prey were based on a single observation whereas all other observations were the mean of multiple reactions utne palm 1999 this likely explains the single large outlier residual for transparent immobile prey for the generalized visual reaction distance model fig d6 in case 4 the only case where viewing angles were observed reaction distance was affected by nadir viewing angle θ the fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model was better using observed θ instead of θ 90 as indicated by the lower aicc table f3 viewing angle had a larger effect on reaction distance at higher turbidity higher κ when compared to low turbidity fig 6a b the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model had similar trends in residual error across the range of θ but the magnitude of residuals was much lower for the generalized visual reaction distance model fig d7 based on residuals of the generalized visual reaction distance model for θ 100 the assumed angular relationship of the generalized visual reaction distance model may have been violated in case 4 fig d7 however other factors may have affected the fit such as the experiment design our digitization of plots with high point densities our conversion of body lengths to meters or our conversion of ntu to κ 4 discussion overall the generalized visual reaction distance model provides a balance between model fit and characterization of physical and biological relationships that is advantageous for modeling predator prey interactions the generalized visual reaction distance model fit better in all cases and is an attractive alternative to the aksnes and utne model and empirical models the generalized visual reaction distance model is continuous and uses physically and biologically interpretable parameters this allows the model to accommodate new information and extend to novel circumstances unlike the aksnes and utne model the generalized visual reaction distance model is not entirely based on measureable physical and biological properties because the dynamic scaling function does not represent a specific mechanism instead the generalized visual reaction distance model provides a heuristic representation of multiple hypotheses physical effects hypothesis feeding motivation hypothesis ideal stimulus hypothesis by using the dynamic scaling function the generalized visual reaction distance model overcomes an important assumption of the aksnes and utne model that visual range and encounter distance decreases monotonically with turbidity this assumption is violated in real predator prey interactions see review by utne palm 2002 and may cause the aksnes and utne model to predict unreasonably high reaction distances at the low attenuation values that are common in marine ecosystems as a solution some studies have imposed a reaction distance constraint on the aksnes and utne model such as setting the maximum reaction distance equal to one predator body length e g fiksen et al 2002 langbehn and varpe 2017 varpe and fiksen 2010 although the maximum reaction distance for some predator prey interactions may approximately equal one predator body length richmond et al 2004 schwalbe and webb 2015 utne 1997 this cannot be considered a norm many predators react to prey at distances far exceeding one predator body length asaeda et al 2002 blaxter 1966 hansen et al 2013 holbrook et al 2013 mazur and beauchamp 2003 schmidt and o brien 1982 vinyard and o brien 1976 in visual foraging models constraining reaction distance to one body length may severely underestimate consumption rates because the models estimate consumption rates as a function of prey densities handling time and search volumes i e volume searched per unit time the latter of which is a function of reaction distance squared search volume swimming speed time elapsed πr 2 the dynamic scaling function of the generalized visual reaction distance model imposes an empirically derived constraint on reaction distance obviating the need to impose arbitrary constraints further if the generalized visual reaction distance model can fit reaction distance data as well as empirical visual encounter distance models it may alleviate the need to use experimental designs that carefully stagger turbidity treatments to identify critical thresholds for turbidity dependent reaction distance a primary design consideration for some visual reaction distance experiments comparing the relative visibility of multiple prey types in case 3 illustrates an advantage of using visual encounter distance models to characterize visibility traditionally differences in apparent size and contrast of prey have often been inferred from human measurements of prey e g contrast estimated from a photograph and thus may be prone to measurement error and methodological biases by contrast we used the generalized visual reaction distance model to estimate the relative visibility of multiple prey types from the perspective of a predator using a single model that had a much better fit to the data than the aksnes and utne model but the same relative visibility relationship among prey as in the aksnes and utne model as such the generalized visual reaction distance model can be used to validate human derived measures that characterize relative visibility e g contrast estimated from a photograph and due to the use of physically and biologically interpretable terms improves our knowledge transfer about the relative visibility of prey to other systems this is important because the core question for many visual foraging studies is how prey visibility size and contrast interacts with the visual environment light and water clarity to affect predator prey linkages and ecosystem structure e g hansen and beauchamp 2014 lovvorn et al 2001 rosland and giske 1994 the generalized visual reaction distance model can accommodate information about the visual encounter process that is not explicitly included in the physical and biological terms in case 3 for example mobile and immobile transparent copepods would not have differences in c0 or ap so the difference between tmt and tti is a movement effect that was not explicitly represented in the model the ratio ttm tti 1 5 can be interpreted as the proportional increase in visibility due to movement 50 although it is not clear how ttm and tti are functionally related because there is no generalizable relationship between motion and detection and we did not have any information on movement speeds of mobile copepods from case 3 experiments the model structure could be extended to accommodate known or hypothesized relationships for example reaction distances can increase as a function of predator size mazur and beauchamp 2003 schmidt and o brien 1982 due to ontogenetic changes in visual acuity spectral sensitivity light sensitivity or higher probability of capture success that increases the profitability of longer distance attacks breck and gitter 1983 britt et al 2001 hairston jr et al 1982 depending on what mechanism drives size dependent variation in reaction distance the parameters ke δse e emax or t could be modeled as a function of predator size as suggested by aksnes and giske 1993 in case 1 the asymptotic reaction distance of adolescent chinook salmon to juvenile rainbow trout at low light levels may have resulted from a scale dependent artifact of the experimental design or a behaviorally mediated change in visual prey detection rather than being a result of different responses to visual and non visual stimuli regardless other studies have shown that predators forage non visually when light is limiting e g ryer et al 2002 and that non visual reactions occur at distances greater than zero richmond et al 2004 unfortunately we were unable to fit the generalized visual reaction distance model to data from other studies where non visual reactions may have occurred because they did not have adequate sample sizes or include a sufficient range of variation in light levels much of the data we used were not independent and we did not account for pseudoreplication in our primary analyses doing so would have underestimated the variability of individual reactions to prey i e low σv σnv and σ further the digitized data did not allow identification of unique predators or treatments for cases 2 4 for case 1 we could identify individual experimental trials in the original experimental data to evaluate whether pseudoreplication affected our conclusions we fit models to the mean reaction distances of trials for case 1 taking this approach the generalized visual reaction distance model still outperformed the aksnes and utne model and empirical broken stick model appendix e pseudoreplication our approach to model fitting does not provide direct insight into the visual range of the predators because reaction distance is an indirect measure of visual range acknowledging the difference between visual range and reaction distance aksnes and utne 1997 fit their model to data by first calculating the mean and standard deviation of reaction distance for each experimental light and turbidity treatment level then fit their model to a visual range which they defined as the mean plus two standard deviations while this approach may be reasonable there is no inherent justification for such a definition of visual range multiple factors can drive variation in reaction distance such as viewing angle prey movement prey orientation relative to the predator spatial variation in the predator s visual acuity feeding motivation of the predator learning social factors and co evolved attack defense dynamics of a predator prey system rather than accounting for differences between visual range and reaction distance a priori we suggest a model with a well behaved error structure could produce post hoc estimates of visual range that are conceptually similar to the visual range definition of aksnes and utne 1997 such an approach would likely reduce the number of observations needed at each experimental treatment level although our statistical analyses of cases suggests that four assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated there was reasonable support for the fifth assumption that the light intensity response for a predator reacting to prey is well approximated by the naka ruston function appendix a other studies also support that the naka ruston function affords a good fit to experimental visual reaction distance data along a gradient of light albeit using different names symbols and quantities for functional representation in the appendix f asymptotic equivalence between empirical and mechanistic models we demonstrate that over short distances and with low attenuation empirical visual encounter distance models with naka rushton dynamics are asymptotically equivalent to the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model many studies we reviewed did not meet our screening criteria for cases because key information was missing one particularly common reason for exclusion was that turbidity was reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntus based on measurements from a nephelometric turbidimeters table b2 b3 which cannot be readily converted to an optical property that characterizes light transmission e g beam attenuation absorbance unlike beam transmissometers and spectrophotometers that measure a reduction in light of known intensity spectrum and intensity over a known distance turbidimeters measure white i e broad spectrum light scattered from a transmitted beam at a wide angle typically centered at 90 which does not provide a direct measure of light transmission along a path davies colley and smith 2001 kirk 2011 at best ntus are a relative measure of the volume scattering function at the angle of the turbidimeter detector ntus tend to be closely correlated with beam attenuation for highly scattering suspended solids e g kaolin bentonite diatomaceous earth but not highly absorbing media e g chlorophyll kirk 2011 and are therefore not particularly useful for characterizing differences in light transmission for different media e g kaolin versus chlorophyll we therefore encourage experimentalists to measure absorbance or beam attenuation use suspensions with known optical properties in known concentrations or report relationships between ntu and beam attenuation or absorbance in experiments although the experiments spanned ranges generating the most dynamic visual responses appendix b we had limited ability to assess model performance across a broad environmental gradient because simultaneous manipulation of light and turbidity only occurred in case 2 we suggest that future visual reaction distance experiments be conducted across wider ranges of light and turbidity i e employ greater environmental heterogeneity in experimental designs to allow better assessment of model performance acoustic technologies such as dual frequency identification sonar overcome limitations of video in real predator prey interactions there is stochastic variation in visual reaction distance whereas the gvrdm predicts reaction distance as a threshold function of light turbidity viewing angle and traits of predators and prey a possible way to extend the model to produce more realistic characterizations of predator prey interactions would be to modify the model to predict the probability of reaction conditional on the distance between the predator and prey this potential extension could be examined using continuous particle tracking approaches in experiments that allow continuous tracking of individual animals from video recordings such approaches have shown promise for elucidating state dependent probabilities of behavioural transitions for interacting animals under experimental conditions bod ová et al 2018 a similar approach may be useful for characterizing probabilities of a predator reacting to prey in visual foraging experiments 5 conclusions visual encounter distance models provide valuable insights into how visual processes affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems the generalized visual reaction distance appears to be an attractive alternative to empirical models of reaction distance because it provides a good fit to reaction distance data from predator prey systems within a single framework it improves upon the aksnes and utne model by providing a better fit to empirical data when statistical analyses suggest assumptions of the aksnes and utne model are violated although it does not provide a means to test hypotheses concerning why assumptions may be violated we speculate that testing these hypotheses will require improvements to the model based on a deeper integration of dynamics involved in predator prey interactions that arise from physics physiology and

24573,visual encounter distance models are important tools for predicting how light and water clarity mediate visual predator prey interactions that affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems at multiple spatial temporal and organizational scales the two main varieties of visual encounter distance models mechanistic and empirical are used for similar purposes but take fundamentally different approaches to model development and have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of predictive accuracy physical and biological interpretability of parameters ability to incorporate outside information and utility for knowledge transfer to overcome weaknesses of existing mechanistic and empirical models and bridge the gap between approaches we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model that relaxes assumptions of a widely used mechanistic model that are violated in real predator prey interactions we compared the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to a widely used mechanistic model and an empirical visual encounter distance model by fitting models to data from four predator prey experiments the generalized visual reaction distance model substantially outperformed the other models in all cases based on fit to reaction distance data and presents an attractive alternative to prior models based on comparatively

low water clarity that are common in marine ecosystems as such mechanistic models often impose generic and un validated constraints on visual range such as setting a minimum contrast threshold to avoid unrealistically low signal detection thresholds for photoreceptors e g ruxton and johnsen 2016 or setting maximum encounter distance equal to one predator body length e g fiksen et al 2002 langbehn and varpe 2017 varpe and fiksen 2010 empirical models are developed by fitting generic functional forms e g polynomial sigmoidal piecewise polynomial to reaction distance data from visual foraging experiments with the best fitting model used to predict visual encounter distances hansen et al 2013 holbrook et al 2013 keyler et al 2019 mechanistic and empirical encounter distance models have different strengths and weaknesses owing to different assumptions about how to represent processes that regulate visual predator prey interactions by using specific functional representations of physical and biological processes mechanistic models assume that functional representations accurately represent the physical process by which image forming light propagates through water and the physiological behavioral process of vision and reaction aksnes and giske 1993 aksnes and utne 1997 the strength of mechanistic models is that they use physically interpretable parameters which allows them to incorporate information beyond what may be available for a single experiment predator or prey this is useful because it is infeasible to conduct experiments with every predator prey system lythgoe 1972 however a weakness is that if assumptions of mechanistic models are not met they have limited ability to fit empirical data and may produce biased estimates of parameters and encounter distances in contrast to mechanistic models empirical models make few assumptions about how physical or physiological behavioral processes should be functionally represented consequently empirical models may be more flexible and thereby provide a better fit to the data a weakness is that model terms do not always have a physical or biological interpretation outside the context of a specific predator prey system and parameters are not necessarily comparable among predators prey or experiments the lack of a consistent structure and physically or biologically interpretable parameters makes it challenging or even impossible to apply empirical models to novel predator prey systems or in some cases beyond the range of experimental treatments this is an important limitation because it is not feasible to conduct experiments with every predator prey system of interest despite the different approaches to model development and parameterization mechanistic and empirical visual encounter distance models are used to address similar questions for example a mechanistic model showed how reduced water clarity caused by eutrophication can allow tactile feeding jellyfish to gain a competitive advantage over visually feeding fish larvae reducing the productivity of marine fish stocks eiane et al 1999 while an empirical model demonstrated how reduced water clarity can reduce predation risk and increase foraging opportunity and productivity of lake dwelling planktivorous fishes hansen and beauchamp 2015 similarly a mechanistic model suggested how the loss of arctic sea ice due to climate change may increase light and enhance the productivity of visually foraging pelagic fish stocks langbehn and varpe 2017 while an empirical model showed how increases in light due to anthropogenic light pollution can increase visual predation mortality for planktivorous fishes mazur and beauchamp 2006 ideally visual encounter distance models should have physically and biologically interpretable parameters and apply consistent representations of the physical process of visual image transfer and the physiological behavioral process of vision and reaction but do so under a broader range of assumptions to improve model fits in this way a more standardized approach can be used to estimate visual parameters from experimental data thereby facilitating the transfer and generalization of knowledge bouchet et al 2019 yates et al 2018 moreover models that use explicit structural representations of physiological behavioral and physical processes represent specific mechanistic hypotheses about how processes work thus lack of fit can provide insight into why a hypothesis failed and guide refinement or generation of new hypotheses hilborn and mangel 1997 it would be beneficial to develop a visual encounter distance model that mechanistically characterizes physical and biological relationships in the visual encounter process fits visual reaction distance data well can incorporate outside information and facilitate knowledge transfer to that end we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model that bridges the gap between mechanistic and empirical modeling approaches by relaxing assumptions of the widely used aksnes and utne 1997 mechanistic model of visual range that appear to be violated in real predator prey interactions the aksnes and utne 1997 model has seen widespread use because it can be fitted to data from visual reaction distance experiments and uses parameters that are physically and biologically interpretable because it uses physically and biological interpretable parameters the aksnes and utne model can be used to model predator prey systems where experimental data are not available e g aksnes and giske 1993 langbehn and varpe 2017 lovvorn et al 2001 using data from four published experimental visual foraging studies we then compare the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical model that had the best fit among multiple candidate empirical models in a visual reaction distance study hansen et al 2013 we chose these comparisons because they are representative of modeling options that are available to experimentalists we chose studies to provide a representative set of predator prey systems planktivorous and piscivorous fish sensory modes of foraging visual and non visual environmental conditions light and water clarity and experimental configurations our primary aims were to evaluate whether assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were met compare the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model to empirical models and examine how different modeling approaches affect parameter estimates and the precision and accuracy of predicted reaction distances we show that the generalized visual reaction distance model fits reaction distance data better than the aksnes and utne model but it retains physically and biologically interpretable parameters that are crucial for transferring information among predator prey systems and allow the model to be used for predator prey systems lacking experimental reaction distance data 2 materials and methods we developed a generalized visual reaction distance model for aquatic predator prey interactions by relaxing structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne model of visual range aksnes and utne 1997 by applying the model to a series of cases from the literature we then compared the performance of various formulations of the generalized visual reaction distance model to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical visual encounter distance model table 1 parameters associated with these models are defined in table 2 2 1 aksnes and utne model of visual range the aksnes and utne model combines mechanistic relationships from physics and physiology the law of contrast reduction and naka rushton function appendix a to predict visual range as a proxy for visual encounter distance based on the visual environment functional light sensitivity of predator vision systems and morphological traits of prey table 1 table 2 in the aksnes and utne model the condition

vision system and spectral characteristics of the light field thus c0 ap and e are generally estimated as composite predator prey interaction term t m2 where t c 0 ape when used to predict visual encounter distance between a predator and prey the aksnes and utne model makes five key assumptions that when violated result in a lack of fit to reaction distance data from visual foraging experiments 1 predators detect prey visually 2 predators view the object along a horizontal plane 3 apparent contrast of an object decreases monotonically according to the law of contrast reduction 4 reactions occur at the distance where apparent contrast of the object exceeds the minimum contrast threshold of the predator and 5 the retinal neural behavioral response to changes in environmental light follows a naka rushton function with α 1 there is evidence that real predator prey interactions routinely violate the first four assumptions of the aksnes and utne model the first assumption of the aksnes and utne model can be violated because predators use senses other than vision to detect prey when light levels fall below the minimum for visual detection of prey reaction distances can approach an asymptote for some predator prey systems e g hansen et al 2013 richmond et al 2004 filtering data a priori to ensure the model is only fit to visual reactions can prevent a violation of model assumptions although the threshold light level between visual and non visual reactions may not be obvious the second assumption that predators view prey along a horizontal plane is almost certainly violated in many real predator prey interactions in visual search it is advantageous for predators to search for prey from below because downwelling light increases the luminance of the background increasing the contrast of prey e g thetmeyer and kils 1995 to avoid issues of angular dependence and allow measurement of reaction distance at low light levels some visual reaction distance experiments have constrained predator viewing angles by using shallow experimental arenas adding angular dependence to the aksnes and utne model would improve the flexibility of the model the third and fourth assumptions regarding contrast reduction and contrast thresholds can be violated in several ways but reasons for a violation are inseparable based solely on predator behavior as turbidity increases from clear water conditions fishes exhibit an increase or no change in reaction distance to prey at low levels of turbidity followed by a decrease at higher levels of turbidity hansen et al 2013 mazur and beauchamp 2003 utne palm 2002 vogel and beauchamp 1999 hypotheses to explain a lack of fit to turbidity are that suspendoids increase the visual contrast of prey against the background by affecting color and brightness contrast physical effects hypothesis utne palm 2002 that feeding motivation of predators increases at specific levels of turbidity due to acclimation feeding motivation hypothesis boehlert and morgan 1985 utne palm 2002 or that reactions depend on a predator recognizing an object as prey based on apparent size shape and movement ideal stimulus hypothesis hairston jr et al 1982 semmelhack et al 2014 the third assumption may be violated because the law of contrast reduction may not apply to underwater visual foraging appendix a the law of contrast reduction was originally derived for the atmosphere where objects are visible at long distances lee et al 2015 a key assumption used to analytically derive the law of contrast reduction for the atmosphere is that targets can be treated as point sources this is likely violated in many underwater visibility applications because underwater objects become visible at distances that are orders of magnitude shorter distances than in air lee et al 2015 the fourth assumption that reactions occur at the point where the apparent contrast of prey exceeds the minimum detectable contrast threshold can be violated because detection precedes recognition and reaction and detection and recognition of prey does not guarantee a reaction an object becomes detectable i e is within visual range when image forming light radiating from the object reaches an observer s photoreceptors and initiates a retinal neural signaling response phototransduction cascade that exceeds some minimum threshold for detection dowling 2012 signals are processed in the retina and brain leading to recognition and reaction semmelhack et al 2014 however detection and recognition does not necessarily lead to reaction because reactions are mediated by the physiological state of a predator e g hunger stress learning and co evolved dynamics of predator attack and prey defense factors that may be considered extensions of the ideal stimulus and feeding motivation hypotheses moreover an object moving through the visual field of a predator presents an attentive cue that can play a role in detection recognition and reaction consequently visual predators may react to mobile prey at greater distances than stationary prey utne palm 1999 which is not explicitly represented in the aksnes and utne model 2 2 generalized visual reaction distance model gvrdm we developed various formulations of a generalized visual reaction distance model to relax structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne model that appear violated in real predator prey interactions table 1 and define the parameters associated with these models table 2 starting from the aksnes and utne model aum 1 we added a non visual reaction distance component to the model to relax the first assumption as 3 r v 2 exp r v c c 0 a p e p r i m e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q where d is non visual reaction distance m and q is the light intensity threshold μmol photons m 2 s 1 below which non visual reaction distance exceeds visual reaction distance hereafter we refer to this version of the aksnes and utne model with a non visual reaction as aum 2 we relaxed the second assumption of the aksnes and utne model by incorporating duntley s angular contrast reduction equation duntley 1952 into the model to allow non horizontal viewing angles as 4 r v 2 exp r v c k d cos θ c 0 a p e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q where kd is the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient m 1 and θ is the nadir viewing angle up 0 down 180 to address the violation of the law of contrast reduction in underwater visibility applications we replaced the beam attenuation coefficient c with the effective attenuation coefficient κ m 1 based on the contrast reduction equation from lee et al s 2015 underwater visibility theory appendix a however for cases described below we interchangeably used the effective attenuation coefficient κ beam attenuation coefficient c and experimentally measured absorption coefficients based on availability of experimental data although the coefficients characterize light transmission differently in terms of geometry finally we relaxed the third and fourth assumptions that turbidity has a monotonic effect on reaction distance and reactions occur at a specific contrast threshold by including a dynamic scaling function ω 5 r v 2 exp r v κ k d cos θ ω κ c 0 a p e e b k e e b i f e b q r n v d i f e b q the dynamic scaling function models the effect of turbidity e g effective attenuation coefficient κ as a function of shape parameters β δ h 6 ω κ β δ h κ h 1 exp δ κ γ h the β parameter is dimensionless but represents a turbidity dependent change in contrast i e convergence to a new inherent contrast as turbidity increases the h and δ parameters are dimensionless and do not have a direct physical or biological interpretation outside of the context of the dynamic scaling function rather the parameters give the dynamic scaling function the flexibility to take functional forms that represent hypotheses concerning the lack of fit of the aksnes and utne model the model does not address specific violations of the fourth assumption however in case 3 subsection 2 4 3 we examine how prey movement a factor in the ideal stimulus hypothesis can be accounted for in the generalized visual reaction distance model the generalized visual reaction distance model does not provide a basis to test mechanistic hypotheses about the lack of fit of the aksnes and utne model rather it provides a framework for testing whether structural assumptions of the aksnes and utne are violated in visual foraging experiments for plausible values of the effective attenuation coefficient κ the aksnes and utne model is a special case of the generalized visual reaction distance model where θ 90 q 0 β 1 h 0 δ 0 and ε 0 or bf 0 2 3 parameterization for model evaluation we used the generalized visual reaction distance model aksnes and utne model and an empirical broken stick model for our cases tables 1 2 appendix b we reparameterized the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model for our cases using the composite predator prey interaction term t m2 to simplify the aksnes and utne model to 7 r 2 exp c r t e b k e e b and the visual component of the generalized visual reaction distance model to 8 r v 2 exp r v κ k d cos θ ω κ t e b k e e b i f e b q 2 4 evaluation of models we evaluated the performance of the generalized visual reaction distance model relative to the aksnes and utne model and an empirical encounter distance model specifically we sought to evaluate whether assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated in real predator prey interactions whether the generalized visual reaction distance model performs as well as empirical models and which version of the dynamic scaling function with or without β had the best performance in the generalized visual reaction distance model we reviewed 32 visual foraging studies 65 predator prey combinations among experiments that involved manipulation of the visual environment and measurements of reaction distance table b2 and screened studies for inclusion in model evaluation based on suitability criteria table b1 based on the screening criteria we selected cases from four visual foraging studies for model evaluation based on our goal to include a representative set of predators planktivores and piscivores prey fish and zooplankton individuals and aggregations and sensory modes of prey detection visual and non visual information about studies we reviewed and details of experimental designs from cases are described in appendix b specific objectives and models used for each case are described below 2 4 1 case 1 piscivore reacting to fish prey we evaluated model performance for a piscivore system that may involve a non visual reaction to prey at low light levels we fit models to data from an experiment where yearling chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha reacted to juvenile rainbow trout o mykiss under varying levels of light and turbidity hansen et al 2013 appendix b in the experiments chinook salmon reaction distances approached an asymptote at 50 cm at low light levels potentially owing to a response to non visual stimulus or an unexplained artifact of the experimental design because there was evidence of non visual reaction we used versions of the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model that included a non visual reaction distance component aum 2 gvrdm 1 gvrdm 2 table 1 we also fit a version of the best fit empirical model broken stick model bsm from the original study to the data appendix c attack angles were not measured during the study so we assumed the nadir viewing angle was horizontal θ 90 under this assumption the diffuse attenuation coefficient kd is irrelevant because k d cos 90 always equals zero 2 4 2 case 2 planktivore reacting to group of ten zooplankton prey we evaluated whether the dynamics governing detection of prey aggregations were the same as for detection of individual prey and estimated model parameters for case 3 to do so for case 2 we fit models to data from an experiment where two spotted goby gobius flavescens reacted to aggregations of ten calanus finmarchicus a transparent calanoid copepod copepod aggregations were retained in 10 cm 3 cm vials under varying levels of light and turbidity utne 1997 no non visual reactions were reported i e no asymptote at low light levels so we used formulations of the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model without a non visual reaction aum 1 gvrdm 3 gvrdm 4 attack angles were not reported so we assumed θ 90 because the aksnes and utne model uses beam attenuation c rather than effective attenuation coefficient κ we also evaluated whether this difference affected model performance aksnes and utne 1997 appendix e attenuation coefficients 2 4 3 case 3 planktivore reacting to single zooplankton we evaluated model performance for a planktivore reacting to individual prey to assess if models could be used to simultaneously characterize the relative visibility of multiple prey types from the perspective of a predator and determine if the generalized visual reaction distance model and aksnes and utne model predicted similar visibility relationships among prey we fit models to data from an experiment where two spotted goby reacted to individual copepod c finmarchicus c helgolandicus prey across a range of turbidities but only one light level 20 μe m 2 s 1 utne palm 1999 appendix b treatments used mobile transparent immobile transparent or mobile red colored prey no non visual reactions were reported so we used models formulations without a non visual reaction aum 1 gvrdm 3 gvrdm 4 attack angles were not reported so we assumed θ 90 we included a different t parameter for each prey type ttm transparent mobile tti transparent immobile trm red mobile because experimental light levels were constant we could not estimate ke using only case 3 data instead we parameterized models using the maximum likelihood estimates of ke from case 2 2 4 4 case 4 planktivore reacting to single zooplankton with angular dependence we evaluated whether information about nadir viewing angle improved model fit to reaction distance data to do so we fit models to data from a planktivore experiment where stone moroko pseudorasbora parva reacted to daphnia pulex under varying levels of light and turbidity asaeda et al 2002 appendix b the study was the only one we are aware of where both nadir viewing angles and reaction distances were reported no non visual reactions were reported so we used versions of the models without a non visual component aum 1 gvrdm 3 and gvrdm 4 table 1 to evaluate whether nadir viewing angle improved model fit we compared models with nadir viewing angle to models where nadir viewing angle equaled 90 appendix e angular dependence 2 5 model fitting and comparison for each case subsections 2 4 1 2 4 4 variance in reaction distance increased as reaction distance increased so we fit models assuming reaction distances had log normally distributed error we estimated separate variances for visual σv and non visual σnv components of models because they involve different predator sensory processes that would presumably have different residual error structures additional details about model fitting are provided in appendix b we used bias corrected akaike s information criterion aicc for model comparison and evaluated model fit and evidence for violations of assumptions based on visual inspection of q q plots and residual plots 3 results 3 1 overall the generalized visual reaction distance model substantially outperformed the aksnes and utne model in all cases based on aicc table 3 and turbidity did not have a monotonic effect on reaction distance for any of the cases which is shown by the dynamic scaling functions fig 2 this suggests assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated in all of our cases the aksnes and utne model had a lack of fit to turbidity as shown by model fits across ranges of effective attenuation coefficient κ figs 3 a 4 a 5 a and patterns in model residuals in relation to κ figs d1 d4 which also suggests assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated the generalized visual reaction distance model had comparable or better fit than the aksnes and utne model across gradients of light figs 3b 4b compared to the aksnes and utne model the generalized visual reaction distance model tended to estimate that predators were less dark adapted higher ke figs 4d 6 c and could process more light or had higher contrast sensitivity higher t figs 3d 4d 5c 6c the higher half saturation level for retinal irradiance processing ke predicted by the generalized visual reaction distance model for cases 2 4 indicates that more light was necessary to stimulate a physiological behavioral response to light higher values of the composite predator prey interaction term t indicate a higher maximum retinal radiance processing capability emax or lower threshold for the predator s vision system to detect changes in irradiance between the target and the background δse the latter is analogous to contrast sensitivity appendix a there was no evidence of turbidity induced changes in prey contrast as versions of the generalized visual reaction distance model without a β parameter outperformed versions with a β parameter in all cases table 3 additionally for cases 2 4 versions of the model with a β parameter had wider confidence intervals for parameters than models without β indicating that inclusion of β inflated uncertainty in estimates of other parameters figs 3d 4d 5c 6c thus we focused on versions of the model without β across gradients of light and turbidity reaction distances predicted by the generalized visual reaction distance model differed from the aksnes and utne model as shown by fitted reaction distance surfaces for cases 1 3 figs 3c 4c 5b this is important because visual encounter distance models are often used to predict encounter distances well outside the range of experimental observations 3 2 cases for case 1 the generalized visual reaction distance model outperformed the broken stick model based on aicc indicating that it can perform at least as well as empirical models table 3 despite the better fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model predictions were generally similar between the generalized visual reaction distance model and broken stick model within the range of experimental conditions fig 3a b however beyond the range of experimental conditions there were considerable differences in predicted reaction distances between the models for case 1 fig 3c for case 2 fitting models to adjusted beam attenuation c instead of the effective attenuation coefficient κ improved the fit of the aksnes and utne model and worsened the fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model table e1 still the generalized visual reaction distance model outperformed the aksnes and utne model based on aicc for the aksnes and utne model ke and t parameter estimates were 2 1 and 1 6 times higher than for the model with κ respectively fig e2 for the generalized visual reaction distance model ke did not change but t was 10 6 times higher than for models with κ fig e2 higher t indicates higher light processing capability or higher contrast sensitivity while higher ke indicate lower dark adaptation because light intensity responses vary over orders of magnitude small variations in ke and t for the aksnes and utne model and ke for the generalized visual reaction distance model would not substantially affect the predictive performance of models processes regulating visual reactions of two spotted goby to aggregations of ten copepods case 2 may have differed from those regulating reactions to individual copepods case 3 this is suggested by qualitative differences in the contour shapes between reaction distance surfaces for ten copepods fig 4c versus single copepods fig 5b and differences in dynamic scaling function parameters fig 2 4d 5c this difference may be an artifact of the experimental approach the different levels at which data were aggregated for the cases or because mechanisms that regulate visual reactions are functionally different between aggregations and individuals for case 3 the generalized visual reaction distance model and aksnes and utne model both predicted that red mobile copepods rm were the most visible followed by transparent mobile tm then transparent immobile ti copepods as shown by fitted reaction distances fig 5a b and the rank order of t parameters for different prey trm ttm tti fig 5c the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model estimated nearly identical relative visibility relationships among prey as trm ttm tti was approximately 1 00 0 66 0 33 for both models for the highest turbidity treatment highest κ predator reactions to transparent immobile prey were based on a single observation whereas all other observations were the mean of multiple reactions utne palm 1999 this likely explains the single large outlier residual for transparent immobile prey for the generalized visual reaction distance model fig d6 in case 4 the only case where viewing angles were observed reaction distance was affected by nadir viewing angle θ the fit of the generalized visual reaction distance model was better using observed θ instead of θ 90 as indicated by the lower aicc table f3 viewing angle had a larger effect on reaction distance at higher turbidity higher κ when compared to low turbidity fig 6a b the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model had similar trends in residual error across the range of θ but the magnitude of residuals was much lower for the generalized visual reaction distance model fig d7 based on residuals of the generalized visual reaction distance model for θ 100 the assumed angular relationship of the generalized visual reaction distance model may have been violated in case 4 fig d7 however other factors may have affected the fit such as the experiment design our digitization of plots with high point densities our conversion of body lengths to meters or our conversion of ntu to κ 4 discussion overall the generalized visual reaction distance model provides a balance between model fit and characterization of physical and biological relationships that is advantageous for modeling predator prey interactions the generalized visual reaction distance model fit better in all cases and is an attractive alternative to the aksnes and utne model and empirical models the generalized visual reaction distance model is continuous and uses physically and biologically interpretable parameters this allows the model to accommodate new information and extend to novel circumstances unlike the aksnes and utne model the generalized visual reaction distance model is not entirely based on measureable physical and biological properties because the dynamic scaling function does not represent a specific mechanism instead the generalized visual reaction distance model provides a heuristic representation of multiple hypotheses physical effects hypothesis feeding motivation hypothesis ideal stimulus hypothesis by using the dynamic scaling function the generalized visual reaction distance model overcomes an important assumption of the aksnes and utne model that visual range and encounter distance decreases monotonically with turbidity this assumption is violated in real predator prey interactions see review by utne palm 2002 and may cause the aksnes and utne model to predict unreasonably high reaction distances at the low attenuation values that are common in marine ecosystems as a solution some studies have imposed a reaction distance constraint on the aksnes and utne model such as setting the maximum reaction distance equal to one predator body length e g fiksen et al 2002 langbehn and varpe 2017 varpe and fiksen 2010 although the maximum reaction distance for some predator prey interactions may approximately equal one predator body length richmond et al 2004 schwalbe and webb 2015 utne 1997 this cannot be considered a norm many predators react to prey at distances far exceeding one predator body length asaeda et al 2002 blaxter 1966 hansen et al 2013 holbrook et al 2013 mazur and beauchamp 2003 schmidt and o brien 1982 vinyard and o brien 1976 in visual foraging models constraining reaction distance to one body length may severely underestimate consumption rates because the models estimate consumption rates as a function of prey densities handling time and search volumes i e volume searched per unit time the latter of which is a function of reaction distance squared search volume swimming speed time elapsed πr 2 the dynamic scaling function of the generalized visual reaction distance model imposes an empirically derived constraint on reaction distance obviating the need to impose arbitrary constraints further if the generalized visual reaction distance model can fit reaction distance data as well as empirical visual encounter distance models it may alleviate the need to use experimental designs that carefully stagger turbidity treatments to identify critical thresholds for turbidity dependent reaction distance a primary design consideration for some visual reaction distance experiments comparing the relative visibility of multiple prey types in case 3 illustrates an advantage of using visual encounter distance models to characterize visibility traditionally differences in apparent size and contrast of prey have often been inferred from human measurements of prey e g contrast estimated from a photograph and thus may be prone to measurement error and methodological biases by contrast we used the generalized visual reaction distance model to estimate the relative visibility of multiple prey types from the perspective of a predator using a single model that had a much better fit to the data than the aksnes and utne model but the same relative visibility relationship among prey as in the aksnes and utne model as such the generalized visual reaction distance model can be used to validate human derived measures that characterize relative visibility e g contrast estimated from a photograph and due to the use of physically and biologically interpretable terms improves our knowledge transfer about the relative visibility of prey to other systems this is important because the core question for many visual foraging studies is how prey visibility size and contrast interacts with the visual environment light and water clarity to affect predator prey linkages and ecosystem structure e g hansen and beauchamp 2014 lovvorn et al 2001 rosland and giske 1994 the generalized visual reaction distance model can accommodate information about the visual encounter process that is not explicitly included in the physical and biological terms in case 3 for example mobile and immobile transparent copepods would not have differences in c0 or ap so the difference between tmt and tti is a movement effect that was not explicitly represented in the model the ratio ttm tti 1 5 can be interpreted as the proportional increase in visibility due to movement 50 although it is not clear how ttm and tti are functionally related because there is no generalizable relationship between motion and detection and we did not have any information on movement speeds of mobile copepods from case 3 experiments the model structure could be extended to accommodate known or hypothesized relationships for example reaction distances can increase as a function of predator size mazur and beauchamp 2003 schmidt and o brien 1982 due to ontogenetic changes in visual acuity spectral sensitivity light sensitivity or higher probability of capture success that increases the profitability of longer distance attacks breck and gitter 1983 britt et al 2001 hairston jr et al 1982 depending on what mechanism drives size dependent variation in reaction distance the parameters ke δse e emax or t could be modeled as a function of predator size as suggested by aksnes and giske 1993 in case 1 the asymptotic reaction distance of adolescent chinook salmon to juvenile rainbow trout at low light levels may have resulted from a scale dependent artifact of the experimental design or a behaviorally mediated change in visual prey detection rather than being a result of different responses to visual and non visual stimuli regardless other studies have shown that predators forage non visually when light is limiting e g ryer et al 2002 and that non visual reactions occur at distances greater than zero richmond et al 2004 unfortunately we were unable to fit the generalized visual reaction distance model to data from other studies where non visual reactions may have occurred because they did not have adequate sample sizes or include a sufficient range of variation in light levels much of the data we used were not independent and we did not account for pseudoreplication in our primary analyses doing so would have underestimated the variability of individual reactions to prey i e low σv σnv and σ further the digitized data did not allow identification of unique predators or treatments for cases 2 4 for case 1 we could identify individual experimental trials in the original experimental data to evaluate whether pseudoreplication affected our conclusions we fit models to the mean reaction distances of trials for case 1 taking this approach the generalized visual reaction distance model still outperformed the aksnes and utne model and empirical broken stick model appendix e pseudoreplication our approach to model fitting does not provide direct insight into the visual range of the predators because reaction distance is an indirect measure of visual range acknowledging the difference between visual range and reaction distance aksnes and utne 1997 fit their model to data by first calculating the mean and standard deviation of reaction distance for each experimental light and turbidity treatment level then fit their model to a visual range which they defined as the mean plus two standard deviations while this approach may be reasonable there is no inherent justification for such a definition of visual range multiple factors can drive variation in reaction distance such as viewing angle prey movement prey orientation relative to the predator spatial variation in the predator s visual acuity feeding motivation of the predator learning social factors and co evolved attack defense dynamics of a predator prey system rather than accounting for differences between visual range and reaction distance a priori we suggest a model with a well behaved error structure could produce post hoc estimates of visual range that are conceptually similar to the visual range definition of aksnes and utne 1997 such an approach would likely reduce the number of observations needed at each experimental treatment level although our statistical analyses of cases suggests that four assumptions of the aksnes and utne model were violated there was reasonable support for the fifth assumption that the light intensity response for a predator reacting to prey is well approximated by the naka ruston function appendix a other studies also support that the naka ruston function affords a good fit to experimental visual reaction distance data along a gradient of light albeit using different names symbols and quantities for functional representation in the appendix f asymptotic equivalence between empirical and mechanistic models we demonstrate that over short distances and with low attenuation empirical visual encounter distance models with naka rushton dynamics are asymptotically equivalent to the aksnes and utne model and generalized visual reaction distance model many studies we reviewed did not meet our screening criteria for cases because key information was missing one particularly common reason for exclusion was that turbidity was reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntus based on measurements from a nephelometric turbidimeters table b2 b3 which cannot be readily converted to an optical property that characterizes light transmission e g beam attenuation absorbance unlike beam transmissometers and spectrophotometers that measure a reduction in light of known intensity spectrum and intensity over a known distance turbidimeters measure white i e broad spectrum light scattered from a transmitted beam at a wide angle typically centered at 90 which does not provide a direct measure of light transmission along a path davies colley and smith 2001 kirk 2011 at best ntus are a relative measure of the volume scattering function at the angle of the turbidimeter detector ntus tend to be closely correlated with beam attenuation for highly scattering suspended solids e g kaolin bentonite diatomaceous earth but not highly absorbing media e g chlorophyll kirk 2011 and are therefore not particularly useful for characterizing differences in light transmission for different media e g kaolin versus chlorophyll we therefore encourage experimentalists to measure absorbance or beam attenuation use suspensions with known optical properties in known concentrations or report relationships between ntu and beam attenuation or absorbance in experiments although the experiments spanned ranges generating the most dynamic visual responses appendix b we had limited ability to assess model performance across a broad environmental gradient because simultaneous manipulation of light and turbidity only occurred in case 2 we suggest that future visual reaction distance experiments be conducted across wider ranges of light and turbidity i e employ greater environmental heterogeneity in experimental designs to allow better assessment of model performance acoustic technologies such as dual frequency identification sonar overcome limitations of video in real predator prey interactions there is stochastic variation in visual reaction distance whereas the gvrdm predicts reaction distance as a threshold function of light turbidity viewing angle and traits of predators and prey a possible way to extend the model to produce more realistic characterizations of predator prey interactions would be to modify the model to predict the probability of reaction conditional on the distance between the predator and prey this potential extension could be examined using continuous particle tracking approaches in experiments that allow continuous tracking of individual animals from video recordings such approaches have shown promise for elucidating state dependent probabilities of behavioural transitions for interacting animals under experimental conditions bod ová et al 2018 a similar approach may be useful for characterizing probabilities of a predator reacting to prey in visual foraging experiments 5 conclusions visual encounter distance models provide valuable insights into how visual processes affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems the generalized visual reaction distance appears to be an attractive alternative to empirical models of reaction distance because it provides a good fit to reaction distance data from predator prey systems within a single framework it improves upon the aksnes and utne model by providing a better fit to empirical data when statistical analyses suggest assumptions of the aksnes and utne model are violated although it does not provide a means to test hypotheses concerning why assumptions may be violated we speculate that testing these hypotheses will require improvements to the model based on a deeper integration of dynamics involved in predator prey interactions that arise from physics physiology and

24574,discrete time models are the traditional approach for capturing population dynamics of insects living in the temperate regions of the world we revisit classical discrete time models of host parasitoid population dynamics and provide novel results on the stability of the population dynamics discrete time host parasitoid models are characterized by update functions that connect the population densities from one year to the next and a host escape response the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism each year for a general class of models we show that the stability can be simply characterized in terms of two quantities the rate at which the host equilibrium changes with the host s growth rate and the sensitivity of the host s escape response to the host density interestingly stability is more likely to arise when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density rather than an increasing function moreover if the host s escape response only depends on the parasitoid population density then the stability condition is further simplified to the host equilibrium density being an increasing function of the host s reproduction rate we interpret several mechanisms known for stabilizing host parasitoid population dynamics in the context of these generalized stability conditions next we introduce a hybrid approach for obtaining the update functions by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically capture the ecological interactions between the host and the parasitoid this hybrid approach is used to study the suppression of host density by a parasitoid our analysis shows that when the parasitoid attacks the host at a constant rate then the host density cannot be suppressed beyond a certain point without making the population dynamics unstable in contrast when the parasitoid s attack rate increases with increasing host density type iii functional response then the host population density can be suppressed to arbitrarily low levels while maintaining system stability these results have important implications for biological control where parasitoids are introduced to eliminate a pest that is the host species for the parasitoid keywords nicholson bailey model discrete time models host parasitoid interactions biological control hybrid modeling 1 introduction insect population dynamics has been extensively studied using two different approaches continuous time and discrete time models the continuous time framework is generally used to model populations with overlapping generations and all year round reproduction in contrast discrete time models are more suited for populations in temperate regions of the world that have non overlapping generations and reproduce in a discrete pulse determined by season murdoch et al 2003 here we revisit discrete time models capturing the antagonistic interaction between two insect species a host and a parasitoid a typical life cycle of the host and the parasitoid is shown in fig 1 and consists of adult hosts emerging during spring laying eggs that hatch into larvae host larvae then overwinter in the pupal stage and metamorphosize as adults the following year as adult hosts die after laying eggs there is no overlap between generations across years the host becomes vulnerable to attacks by a parasitoid wasp at one stage of its life cycle for the sake of convenience we assume the host s vulnerable stage to be the larval stage adult female parasitoids emerge during spring search and attack hosts by laying an egg into the body of the host while adult parasitoids die after this time window the parasitoid egg hatches into a juvenile parasitoid that grows at the host s expense by using it as a food source and this ultimately results in the death of the host the juvenile parasitoids pupate overwinter and emerge as adult parasitoids the following year there are more than 65 000 different species of parasitoid wasps and we refer the reader to hajek 2004 godfray 1994 and waage and greathead 1986 for fascinating details on parasitoid classification life history and behavior synchronized life cycles with no overlap of generations in both the host and the parasitoid makes discrete time models highly appropriate for these systems we provide novel results on the stability of a general class of discrete time models describing host parasitoid interactions following a rich tradition of using hybrid or semi discrete approaches to model ecological population dynamics pachepsky et al 2008 eskola and geritz 2007 dugaw et al 2004 bonsall and hassell 1999 briggs and godfray 1996 geritz and kisdi 2004 we discuss a hybrid formulation that solves a nonlinear differential equation to obtain discrete time models for host parasitoid systems importantly this mechanistic derivation of models using the hybrid approach can provide qualitatively different results compared to earlier phenomenological approaches finally in the context of biological control of pests we investigate different forms of parasitoid attack rates that lead to efficient suppression of the host population 2 host parasitoid model formulation a model describing host parasitoid dynamics in discrete time is given by 1a h t 1 r h t f r h t p t 1b p t 1 k r h t 1 f r h t p t where h t and p t are the adult host and the adult parasitoid densities respectively at the start of year t hassell 2000a gurney and nisbet 1998 singh et al 2009 marcinko and kot 2020 schreiber 2006 livadiotis et al 2015 if the host is vulnerable to the parasitoid at its larval stage then r h t is the host larval density exposed to parasitoid attacks at the start of the vulnerable stage where r 1 denotes the number of viable eggs produced by each adult host parasitoids attack host larvae during the vulnerable period leading to two populations of hosts parasitized and un parasitized larvae the function 0 f r h t p t 1 is the fraction of host larvae escaping parasitism and can depend on both h t and p t we assume f to be a continuously differentiable function in both arguments and refer to it as the escape response in the absence of the parasitoid 2 f r h t 0 1 and the host population grows unboundedly as 3 h t 1 r h t where r can be interpreted as the host s growth rate to be ecologically relevant f is a monotonically decreasing function with respect to p t but can vary arbitrarily with respect to r h t in 1 r h t f r h t p t is the total larval density escaping parasitism to become adult hosts for next year finally r h t 1 f r h t p t is the net density of parasitized larvae with each larva giving rise to k adult female parasitoids in the next generation it is important to point out that while in this framework r h t denotes the host larval density a simple change in variable where now h t denotes the host larval density results in 1 being rewritten as hassell 2000a gurney and nisbet 1998 4a h t 1 r h t f h t p t 4b p t 1 k h t 1 f h t p t while both forms of the model have appeared in literature without loss of any generality we will focus our analysis on 1 the simplest formulation of 1 is the classical nicholson bailey model 5a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 5b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c t p t where c 0 represents the rate at which parasitoids attack hosts and t is the duration of the host vulnerable stage nicholson and bailey 1935 the model assumes that parasitoids search for hosts randomly are never egg limited and have quick handling times if the number of parasitoid attacks per host follows a poisson distribution with mean c t p t then the escape response f r h t p t exp c t p t is the probability of zero attacks in the poisson distribution in section 4 we provide another mechanistic interpretation of the nicholson bailey model a typical time series of the nicholson bailey model is shown in fig 2 top panel both populations grow at low densities but at large host densities the parasitoid begins to overexploit the host this leads to a crash in the host population followed by a crash of the parasitoids these cycles of overexploitation and crashes result in an unstable interaction with both populations exhibiting diverging oscillations interestingly these diverging oscillations have been recapitulated in several laboratory studies of specific host parasitoid species providing some model validation at least in controlled lab settings hassell 2000b several mechanisms have been proposed in literature that can stabilize the host parasitoid population dynamics one such mechanism is a host refuge where a constant fraction of hosts are protected from parasitism a constant host fraction μ in the refuge leads to the following model murdoch et al 2003 6a h t 1 r h t μ 1 μ exp c t p t 6b p t 1 k 1 μ r h t 1 exp c t p t while a weak refuge results in bounded oscillations a moderate refuge stabilizes the population dynamics fig 2 middle panel however stability is again lost for a strong refuge with both hosts and parasitoids growing unboundedly in reality there is a carrying capacity for the host population density that prevents this unbounded growth next we provide some novel results on the stability of the discrete time model 1 3 general stability analysis the fixed point of the discrete time model 1 are the population densities that remain constant across years substituting p t 1 p t p and h t 1 h t h in 1 shows that apart from the trivial fixed point p h 0 the non trivial equilibrium is the solution to the following equations 7 1 r f r h p p k r 1 h where h and p denote the host and parasitoid densities at equilibrium respectively for small perturbations close to p h 0 the host dynamics in 1a reduces to 3 resulting in an unstable trivial fixed point given r 1 solving 14 for the nicholson bailey model yields a single non trivial equilibrium point 8 h ln r r 1 k c t p ln r c t note that the host equilibrium levels decrease while the parasitoid equilibrium levels increase with increasing host growth rate r considering small perturbations h t and p t 9 h t h t h p t p t p and linearizing model nonlinearities in 1 around the equilibrium results in the following linear discrete time system 10 h t 1 p t 1 a h t p t a a 00 a 01 a 10 a 11 where the entries of the jacobian matrix a are given by a 00 1 r h f r h t p t h t h t h p t p a 01 r h f r h t p t p t h t h p t p a 10 k r 1 k r h f r h t p t h t h t h p t p a 11 k r h f r h t p t p t h t h p t p here f r h t p t h t h t h p t p represents the partial derivative of the escape response with respect to the host density evaluated at the equilibrium point standard stability analysis shows that the non trivial equilibrium point is stable if and only if the following three conditions hold 11a 1 t r a d e t a 0 11b 1 t r a d e t a 0 11c 1 d e t a 0 where the trace and determinant of the a matrix are 12 t r a a 00 a 11 d e t a a 00 a 11 a 01 a 10 respectively elaydi 1996 3 1 stability condition for host independent escape responses it turns out that in some cases these stability conditions can be remarkably simplified for example consider the discrete time model 13a h t 1 r h t f p t 13b p t 1 k r h t 1 f p t where the escape response f p t is a monotonically decreasing function of the parasitoid density only with f 0 1 then the model has a unique non trivial fixed point given by the solution to the equation 14 1 r f p p k r 1 h and this fixed point is stable if and only if see appendix a for a detailed proof 15 d h d r 0 briefly if the escape response f p t only depends on parasitoid density then the first two conditions in 11 always hold and stability is completely determined by the third inequality 1 d e t a 0 which can be rewritten as 15 recall that h in the nicholson bailey model is decreasing with r and its instability is reflective of this simplified stability criterion using the fact that p k r 1 h the above condition on h can also be written in terms of the parasitoid equilibrium density 16 r p d p d r r r 1 note that the right hand side of 16 is the dimensionless log sensitivity of the parasitoid equilibrium p in terms of r and stability requires parasitoid densities to increase sufficiently fast with increasing r applying the stability criterion 15 to the host refuge model 6 we obtain the following equilibrium host density 17 h ln 1 μ r 1 μ r r 1 k c t that is only defined for μ 1 r fig 3 plots h as a function of r for different values of the refuge fraction μ the plots shows that initially h decreases with increasing r hence an unstable equilibrium but beyond a critical host growth rate h increases with increasing r leading to stability as seen in fig 2 for example when μ 0 4 equilibrium 17 only exists for r 2 5 and is stabilized when r 1 375 the stability arising from a host refuge can be generalized under the concept of variation in risk the nicholson bailey model assumes that all hosts are identical in terms of their vulnerability to parasitism perhaps a more realistic scenario is individual hosts differing in their risk of parasitism due to genetic factors spatial heterogeneities or are exposed to parasitoids for different durations and at different times okuyama 2019 cobbold et al 2009 liere et al 2012 zoroa et al 2017 in essence the product c t in 5 represents the attack rate integrated over time and by transforming it into a random variable we obtain 18a h t 1 r h t x 0 p x exp x p t 18b p t 1 k r h t 1 x 0 p x exp x p t where p x is the distribution of risk across hosts singh et al 2009 a key assumption in this formulation is that risk is independent of the local host density if hosts are non uniformly distributed in space prior work on this topic has assumed p x follows a gamma distribution with mean c and coefficient of variation c v hassell et al 1991 pacala and hassell 1991 singh et al 2009 for which 19 x 0 p x exp x p t 1 1 c c v 2 p t 1 c v 2 in 18 yielding the following equilibrium host density 20 h r c v 2 1 c c v 2 r 1 here h is a monotonically decreasing function of r for c v 1 an unstable equilibrium but stability arises for c v 1 when h becomes a monotonically increasing function of r may 1978 taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 pacala and hassell 1991 singh et al 2009 another mechanism know to stabilize host parasitoid interactions is when the parasitoid s attack rate c in 5 decreases with increasing parasitoid density due to interference between parasitoids murdoch et al 2003 jervis 2007 rewriting c c 1 p t m where c 1 0 and 0 m 1 results in the following discrete time model 21a h t 1 r h t exp c 1 t p t 1 m 21b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c 1 t p t 1 m a straightforward application of the stability criterion 15 shows that the model 21 is stable for sufficiently large value of m given by 22 r ln r 1 r r ln r m 1 which corresponds to 0 28 m 1 for r 2 and 0 5 m 1 for r 5 3 2 stability condition for general escape responses it is important to emphasize that condition 15 can only to be used for a host independent escape response the above result begs the question can this simple stability criterion be generalized when f r h t p t depends on both populations it turns out that in this case the stability conditions 11 can be graphically represented in terms of two biologically relevant dimensionless quantities r h d h d r log sensitivity of the adult host equilibrium to the host growth rate h f r h p f r h p h log sensitivity of the escape response to the host density our analysis shows the host parasitoid equilibrium of the general model 1 is stable if and only if the above two quantities are in the yellow color region on fig 4 see appendix b for derivations and stability is more likely to occur when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density rather than an increasing function interestingly stability can be lost if the escape response decreases too rapidly with respect to the host density fig 4 the nicholson bailey model for which f h 0 and d h d r 0 is marked in the unstable region an interesting insight from this figure is that stability can arise via two orthogonal mechanisms mechanisms such as the host refuge variation in risk parasitoid interference for which f h 0 stability arises by shifting the nicholson bailey point upwards by making d h d r 0 mechanisms such as a type iii functional response drive stability by moving the nicholson bailey point leftwards by making f h 0 without appreciably changing d h d r we discuss type iii functional responses in further detail in the next section while the stability regions in fig 4 is independent of the parameter k in 1 our analysis found it to be quite insensitive to the value of r for example a tenfold change in r from 2 to 20 only resulted in the stability region moving slightly upwards and towards the right 4 hybrid formulation of update functions for a majority of host parasitoid models the escape response f in 1 is phenomenologically chosen or designed to recapitulate field observations recent work has proposed a mechanistic hybrid framework for deriving the discrete time model where ordinary differential equations are used to track population densities within the host vulnerable period of a given year singh and nisbet 2008 emerick and singh 2016 singh and nisbet 2007 singh and emerick 2020 the solution of the differential equations at the end of the vulnerable period predicts the population densities for next year we discuss this semi discrete formulation in further detail below let τ denote the time within the host vulnerable stage that varies from 0 to t corresponding to the start and end of the vulnerable stage the densities of parasitoids un parasitized and parasitized host larvae at time τ within the vulnerable stage of year t are represented by p τ t l τ t i τ t respectively these densities evolve as per the dynamical system 23a d p τ t d τ γ p p τ t 23b d l τ t d τ c p τ t l τ t γ l l τ t 23c d i τ t d τ c p τ t l τ t γ i i τ t where c represent the parasitoid s attack rate per host and γ p γ l γ i are the death rates of the respective species assuming p t parasitoids r h t host larvae and no parasitized larvae at the start of the vulnerable period τ 0 solving the above differential equations with initial conditions 24 l 0 t r h t p 0 t p t i 0 t 0 predicts the parasitized and unparasitized larval population at the end of the season τ t this leads to a more general discrete time model 25a h t 1 f r h t p t 25b p t 1 g r h t p t where update functions are obtained by setting 26a f r h t p t l t t 26b g r h t p t k i t t solving 23 for a constant attack rate c with no mortalities γ p γ l γ i 0 yields 27a p τ t p t 27b l τ t r h t exp c τ p t 27c i τ t r h t 1 exp c τ p t which using 26 yields the nicholson bailey model 5 it can also be shown analytically that nonzero constant mortality rates in each population yield discrete time models with an unstable coexistence fixed point similar to the nicholson bailey model see appendix c for a detailed analysis of a few cases therefore we seek stabilizing mechanisms that can be implemented in this hybrid format interestingly it turns out that discrete time models formulated using the hybrid approach can give qualitatively different results than phenomenologically designed updated functions we illustrate this point with host dependent parasitoid attack rates and connect them to the stability regions in fig 4 4 1 functional responses our analysis in 21 considered a parasitoid attack rate that decreases with increasing parasitoid density here we consider a host dependent attack rate 28 c c 1 l τ t q for positive constants c 1 q that monotonically increases with the host density since the vulnerable larval density l τ t continually changes within the season the hybrid formulation based on solving the differential equation 23 is vital in deriving the corresponding update function in the absence of mortalities γ p γ l γ i 0 the attack rate 28 results in the discrete time model 1 with the escape response 29 f r h t p t 1 1 c 1 t q r h t q p t 1 q and the corresponding equilibrium h r q 1 k c 1 t q r q r 1 1 q 1 p k r 1 h our prior analysis has shown that this model is neutrally stable for q 1 and stable for q 1 singh and nisbet 2007 interestingly the escape response is now a decreasing function of the host density and the host equilibrium is also a decreasing function of the host growth rate as in the nicholson bailey model thus in the context of fig 4 stability arises by shifting the nicholson bailey point to the left into the stability region where f r h p h 0 in contrast a phenomenologically chosen escape response where one simply substitutes c for c 1 r h t q in 5 yields 30 f r h t p t exp c 1 t r h t q p t it turns out that the escape response 30 in 1 results in an unstable model equilibrium for all values of q 0 singh and nisbet 2007 with both f r h p h and d h d r negative as in the mechanistic hybrid formulation but d h d r is sufficiently negative to fall in the unstable region of fig 4 these results can be generalized to type ii and iii functional responses 31 c c 1 l τ t q 1 c 1 t h l τ t q 1 where t h is interpreted as the parasitoid handling time a type iii functional response q 1 results in a stable equilibrium when the discrete time model is formulated using the hybrid approach as long as the handling time is significantly shorter than the vulnerable stage duration t h t singh and nisbet 2007 in contrast a type ii functional response q 0 always results in an unstable interaction by moving the nicholson bailey point to the right in fig 4 to further destabilize the population dynamics several prior works incorporated functional responses phenomenologically by simply substituting 32 c c 1 r h t q 1 c 1 t h r h t q 1 in the nicholson bailey model 5 and the resulting discrete time model is unstable for all values of q 0 hassell and comins 1978 in summary a type iii functional response q 1 stabilizes the population interaction in the mechanistically formulated hybrid approach but not in the phenomenological approach 5 limits of host suppression by parasitoids we next use the hybrid formulation to investigate the suppression of host population density by a parasitoid as done in other models neubert and kot 1992 hassell and varley 1969b may et al 1981 our previous work singh and nisbet 2007 considered a self limitation in the hosts ability to grow due to finite food resources or attacks by other nature enemies by considering a host mortality rate γ l c h l τ t in 23 that is proportional to the host density for a constant parasitoid attack rate c and γ p γ i 0 the above hybrid approach yields 33a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 1 c h r h t 1 exp c t p t c p t 33b p t 1 k c p t c h ln 1 c h r h t 1 exp c t p t c p t as expected in the limit c h 0 this model converges back to the nicholson bailey model in the absence of parasitoids this leads to 34 h t 1 r h t 1 c h t r h t which has a stable fixed point 35 h r 1 c h t r representing the host population before the introduction of the parasitoid in addition to this no parasitoid equilibrium the other fixed point of 33 is given by 36 h exp c h k c 1 1 exp c h k c r c p c h r p ln r c h k c c t and is stable for 37 z c h k c ln r where z is the solution to 38 z 1 r ln r z r exp z we refer the reader to singh and nisbet 2007 for details of the analysis leading to 36 38 the quantity 39 r exp c h k c 1 ln r c h k c r 1 r exp c h k c represents the ratio of the host equilibrium with parasitoids and without parasitoids as given by 35 and 36 respectively as one varies c h c in the stability region 37 the maximum host suppression while ensuring the stability of the fixed point 36 is given by r exp z 1 ln r z r 1 r exp z and is computed to be 0 34 and 0 29 for r 2 and 10 respectively thus for a constant parasitoid attack rate the host population density cannot be suppressed more than 30 below its density in the absence of the parasitoid can host suppression be more efficient with a density dependent parasitoid attack rate to address this question we consider a type iii functional response where the attack rate takes the form 31 for simplicity we consider the case of q 1 and fast handling times t h 0 which reduce 31 to 40 c c 1 l τ t in essence the ability of a parasitoid to locate attack and parasitize a host increases with increasing host density using 40 γ l c h l τ t γ p γ i 0 in 23 yields 41a h t 1 r h t 1 c h t r h t c t r h t p t 41b p t 1 k c t r 2 h t 2 p t 1 c h t r h t c t r h t p t the model again has two non trivial equilibriums the first is when the parasitoid is absent and the host density converges to 35 the second fixed point where both species coexist is given by 42 h 1 c 1 t r k p r 1 k c 1 t r c h c 1 stability analysis as outlined in section 3 shows that 42 is stable as long as 43 c 1 c h 2 r t k r 1 2 this implies that the ratio of host density with and without parasitoids 44 c h t r r 1 c 1 k can be made arbitrarily small with increasing attack rate parameter c 1 but with a dependence that scales as 1 c 1 k this point is illustrated in fig 5 where the time evolution of host densities are shown for increasing values of c 1 6 conclusion in this contribution we have focused on the ecological interaction between hosts and parasitoids that holds tremendous potential in biological control of pests abram et al 2016 jervis et al 1996 ueno 1998 reeve and murdoch 1985 jang and yu 2012 hassell and varley 1969a kaser et al 2018 bompard et al 2013 we provide novel results on the stability of host parasitoid interactions modeled as per 1 and characterized by an arbitrary escape response f r h t p t which to be ecologically relevant satisfies the conditions discussed around 2 the result is graphically illustrated in fig 4 in terms of two quantities the rate at which the host equilibrium changes with the host s growth rate d h d r and the sensitivity of the escape response to the host density at equilibrium f h for several models such as 5 6 18 21 the escape response is invariant of the host density in which case the stability reduces to the host density being an increasing function of the host growth rate another key insight that can be tested with field observations is that stability is more likely to emerge when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density i e a larger fraction of hosts get parasitized at higher host densities as in the case of the type iii functional response rather than an increasing function we want to emphasize that this is the first work of its kind in a century of host parasitoid modeling that generalizes the stability conditions and graphically depicts them as in fig 4 we also introduced a hybrid approach for deriving the discrete time model by solving a set of nonlinear differential equations describing the population dynamics during the host s vulnerable stage the hybrid approach was used to study the limit of host suppression while still keeping the host parasitoid interaction stable our prior work had shown that for a constant parasitoid attack rate the host cannot be suppressed beyond a certain limit singh and nisbet 2007 interestingly our analysis here shows that an attack rate proportional to the host density can lead to arbitrary low host suppression fig 5 in future work we will investigate host suppression with other stabilizing mechanisms such as host refuge variation of risk across the host population taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 and parasitoid aggregation reeve et al 1994 rohani et al 1994 may 1978 another aspect to explore using the hybrid formulation is spatial dynamics where host parasitoid can move between patches rohani and miramontes 1995 cronin and reeve 2005 adler 1993 comins et al 1992 our preliminary work on this topic has been quite promising and shows that density dependent movement between patches can have a stabilizing effect on the population dynamics emerick et al 2020 credit

in 59 one can express f r h p p as functions of f r h p h and d h d r next we define two log sensitivities 61 s r h r h d h d r s h f h f r h p f r h p h with the above substitutions the stability

a given value of r these stability conditions can be graphically represented as a function of s r h and s h f as in fig 4 if s h f 0 host independent escape response the above conditions reduce to 65 r 1 r 1 s r h r 0 1 2 r 1 s r h 3 r r 1 s r h r 0 s r h r 1 r 1 s r h r 0 since r 1 and the escape response being a decreasing function of the parasitoid density results in r 1 s r h r 0 the first two inequalities in 65 are always satisfied and the stability condition is given by the third inequality leading to s r h 0 appendix c for model 23 we consider several cases of the hybrid approach that include nonzero constant mortality rates we assume that at least one of the mortality rates γ p γ l or γ i is nonzero when a combination of nonzero parameters is assumed a different discrete time model is formed each time for each case we present the resulting discrete time model the coexistence equilibrium point and a brief linear stability analysis let γ p 0 and γ l γ i 0 then the discrete time model is identical to model 1 with host independent escape response 66 f p t exp c p t 1 e γ p t γ p and the corresponding equilibrium is 67 h γ p ln r c k 1 e γ p t r 1 p k r 1 h using eq 15 we have 68 d h d r γ p 1 1 r ln r c k 1 e γ p t 0 for all r 1 and for all positive parameter values hence the coexistence equilibrium is unstable let γ l 0 and γ p γ i 0 then the discrete time model

discrete time model takes the form 75 h t 1 r h t exp c p t 1 e γ t γ e γ t 76 p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c p t 1 e γ t γ and the corresponding equilibrium is h ln r γ t γ c k 1 e γ t r e γ t p k r e γ t h the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point is given by 77 a 1 ln r γ t k r e γ t k r e γ t e γ t ln r γ t r e γ t and we find that the jury conditions in 11 are not satisfied for all r 1 and γ l

numerically and it can be verified by constructing trajectories that the dynamics exhibit diverging oscillations similar to that of the nicholson bailey model 
24574,discrete time models are the traditional approach for capturing population dynamics of insects living in the temperate regions of the world we revisit classical discrete time models of host parasitoid population dynamics and provide novel results on the stability of the population dynamics discrete time host parasitoid models are characterized by update functions that connect the population densities from one year to the next and a host escape response the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism each year for a general class of models we show that the stability can be simply characterized in terms of two quantities the rate at which the host equilibrium changes with the host s growth rate and the sensitivity of the host s escape response to the host density interestingly stability is more likely to arise when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density rather than an increasing function moreover if the host s escape response only depends on the parasitoid population density then the stability condition is further simplified to the host equilibrium density being an increasing function of the host s reproduction rate we interpret several mechanisms known for stabilizing host parasitoid population dynamics in the context of these generalized stability conditions next we introduce a hybrid approach for obtaining the update functions by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically capture the ecological interactions between the host and the parasitoid this hybrid approach is used to study the suppression of host density by a parasitoid our analysis shows that when the parasitoid attacks the host at a constant rate then the host density cannot be suppressed beyond a certain point without making the population dynamics unstable in contrast when the parasitoid s attack rate increases with increasing host density type iii functional response then the host population density can be suppressed to arbitrarily low levels while maintaining system stability these results have important implications for biological control where parasitoids are introduced to eliminate a pest that is the host species for the parasitoid keywords nicholson bailey model discrete time models host parasitoid interactions biological control hybrid modeling 1 introduction insect population dynamics has been extensively studied using two different approaches continuous time and discrete time models the continuous time framework is generally used to model populations with overlapping generations and all year round reproduction in contrast discrete time models are more suited for populations in temperate regions of the world that have non overlapping generations and reproduce in a discrete pulse determined by season murdoch et al 2003 here we revisit discrete time models capturing the antagonistic interaction between two insect species a host and a parasitoid a typical life cycle of the host and the parasitoid is shown in fig 1 and consists of adult hosts emerging during spring laying eggs that hatch into larvae host larvae then overwinter in the pupal stage and metamorphosize as adults the following year as adult hosts die after laying eggs there is no overlap between generations across years the host becomes vulnerable to attacks by a parasitoid wasp at one stage of its life cycle for the sake of convenience we assume the host s vulnerable stage to be the larval stage adult female parasitoids emerge during spring search and attack hosts by laying an egg into the body of the host while adult parasitoids die after this time window the parasitoid egg hatches into a juvenile parasitoid that grows at the host s expense by using it as a food source and this ultimately results in the death of the host the juvenile parasitoids pupate overwinter and emerge as adult parasitoids the following year there are more than 65 000 different species of parasitoid wasps and we refer the reader to hajek 2004 godfray 1994 and waage and greathead 1986 for fascinating details on parasitoid classification life history and behavior synchronized life cycles with no overlap of generations in both the host and the parasitoid makes discrete time models highly appropriate for these systems we provide novel results on the stability of a general class of discrete time models describing host parasitoid interactions following a rich tradition of using hybrid or semi discrete approaches to model ecological population dynamics pachepsky et al 2008 eskola and geritz 2007 dugaw et al 2004 bonsall and hassell 1999 briggs and godfray 1996 geritz and kisdi 2004 we discuss a hybrid formulation that solves a nonlinear differential equation to obtain discrete time models for host parasitoid systems importantly this mechanistic derivation of models using the hybrid approach can provide qualitatively different results compared to earlier phenomenological approaches finally in the context of biological control of pests we investigate different forms of parasitoid attack rates that lead to efficient suppression of the host population 2 host parasitoid model formulation a model describing host parasitoid dynamics in discrete time is given by 1a h t 1 r h t f r h t p t 1b p t 1 k r h t 1 f r h t p t where h t and p t are the adult host and the adult parasitoid densities respectively at the start of year t hassell 2000a gurney and nisbet 1998 singh et al 2009 marcinko and kot 2020 schreiber 2006 livadiotis et al 2015 if the host is vulnerable to the parasitoid at its larval stage then r h t is the host larval density exposed to parasitoid attacks at the start of the vulnerable stage where r 1 denotes the number of viable eggs produced by each adult host parasitoids attack host larvae during the vulnerable period leading to two populations of hosts parasitized and un parasitized larvae the function 0 f r h t p t 1 is the fraction of host larvae escaping parasitism and can depend on both h t and p t we assume f to be a continuously differentiable function in both arguments and refer to it as the escape response in the absence of the parasitoid 2 f r h t 0 1 and the host population grows unboundedly as 3 h t 1 r h t where r can be interpreted as the host s growth rate to be ecologically relevant f is a monotonically decreasing function with respect to p t but can vary arbitrarily with respect to r h t in 1 r h t f r h t p t is the total larval density escaping parasitism to become adult hosts for next year finally r h t 1 f r h t p t is the net density of parasitized larvae with each larva giving rise to k adult female parasitoids in the next generation it is important to point out that while in this framework r h t denotes the host larval density a simple change in variable where now h t denotes the host larval density results in 1 being rewritten as hassell 2000a gurney and nisbet 1998 4a h t 1 r h t f h t p t 4b p t 1 k h t 1 f h t p t while both forms of the model have appeared in literature without loss of any generality we will focus our analysis on 1 the simplest formulation of 1 is the classical nicholson bailey model 5a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 5b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c t p t where c 0 represents the rate at which parasitoids attack hosts and t is the duration of the host vulnerable stage nicholson and bailey 1935 the model assumes that parasitoids search for hosts randomly are never egg limited and have quick handling times if the number of parasitoid attacks per host follows a poisson distribution with mean c t p t then the escape response f r h t p t exp c t p t is the probability of zero attacks in the poisson distribution in section 4 we provide another mechanistic interpretation of the nicholson bailey model a typical time series of the nicholson bailey model is shown in fig 2 top panel both populations grow at low densities but at large host densities the parasitoid begins to overexploit the host this leads to a crash in the host population followed by a crash of the parasitoids these cycles of overexploitation and crashes result in an unstable interaction with both populations exhibiting diverging oscillations interestingly these diverging oscillations have been recapitulated in several laboratory studies of specific host parasitoid species providing some model validation at least in controlled lab settings hassell 2000b several mechanisms have been proposed in literature that can stabilize the host parasitoid population dynamics one such mechanism is a host refuge where a constant fraction of hosts are protected from parasitism a constant host fraction μ in the refuge leads to the following model murdoch et al 2003 6a h t 1 r h t μ 1 μ exp c t p t 6b p t 1 k 1 μ r h t 1 exp c t p t while a weak refuge results in bounded oscillations a moderate refuge stabilizes the population dynamics fig 2 middle panel however stability is again lost for a strong refuge with both hosts and parasitoids growing unboundedly in reality there is a carrying capacity for the host population density that prevents this unbounded growth next we provide some novel results on the stability of the discrete time model 1 3 general stability analysis the fixed point of the discrete time model 1 are the population densities that remain constant across years substituting p t 1 p t p and h t 1 h t h in 1 shows that apart from the trivial fixed point p h 0 the non trivial equilibrium is the solution to the following equations 7 1 r f r h p p k r 1 h where h and p denote the host and parasitoid densities at equilibrium respectively for small perturbations close to p h 0 the host dynamics in 1a reduces to 3 resulting in an unstable trivial fixed point given r 1 solving 14 for the nicholson bailey model yields a single non trivial equilibrium point 8 h ln r r 1 k c t p ln r c t note that the host equilibrium levels decrease while the parasitoid equilibrium levels increase with increasing host growth rate r considering small perturbations h t and p t 9 h t h t h p t p t p and linearizing model nonlinearities in 1 around the equilibrium results in the following linear discrete time system 10 h t 1 p t 1 a h t p t a a 00 a 01 a 10 a 11 where the entries of the jacobian matrix a are given by a 00 1 r h f r h t p t h t h t h p t p a 01 r h f r h t p t p t h t h p t p a 10 k r 1 k r h f r h t p t h t h t h p t p a 11 k r h f r h t p t p t h t h p t p here f r h t p t h t h t h p t p represents the partial derivative of the escape response with respect to the host density evaluated at the equilibrium point standard stability analysis shows that the non trivial equilibrium point is stable if and only if the following three conditions hold 11a 1 t r a d e t a 0 11b 1 t r a d e t a 0 11c 1 d e t a 0 where the trace and determinant of the a matrix are 12 t r a a 00 a 11 d e t a a 00 a 11 a 01 a 10 respectively elaydi 1996 3 1 stability condition for host independent escape responses it turns out that in some cases these stability conditions can be remarkably simplified for example consider the discrete time model 13a h t 1 r h t f p t 13b p t 1 k r h t 1 f p t where the escape response f p t is a monotonically decreasing function of the parasitoid density only with f 0 1 then the model has a unique non trivial fixed point given by the solution to the equation 14 1 r f p p k r 1 h and this fixed point is stable if and only if see appendix a for a detailed proof 15 d h d r 0 briefly if the escape response f p t only depends on parasitoid density then the first two conditions in 11 always hold and stability is completely determined by the third inequality 1 d e t a 0 which can be rewritten as 15 recall that h in the nicholson bailey model is decreasing with r and its instability is reflective of this simplified stability criterion using the fact that p k r 1 h the above condition on h can also be written in terms of the parasitoid equilibrium density 16 r p d p d r r r 1 note that the right hand side of 16 is the dimensionless log sensitivity of the parasitoid equilibrium p in terms of r and stability requires parasitoid densities to increase sufficiently fast with increasing r applying the stability criterion 15 to the host refuge model 6 we obtain the following equilibrium host density 17 h ln 1 μ r 1 μ r r 1 k c t that is only defined for μ 1 r fig 3 plots h as a function of r for different values of the refuge fraction μ the plots shows that initially h decreases with increasing r hence an unstable equilibrium but beyond a critical host growth rate h increases with increasing r leading to stability as seen in fig 2 for example when μ 0 4 equilibrium 17 only exists for r 2 5 and is stabilized when r 1 375 the stability arising from a host refuge can be generalized under the concept of variation in risk the nicholson bailey model assumes that all hosts are identical in terms of their vulnerability to parasitism perhaps a more realistic scenario is individual hosts differing in their risk of parasitism due to genetic factors spatial heterogeneities or are exposed to parasitoids for different durations and at different times okuyama 2019 cobbold et al 2009 liere et al 2012 zoroa et al 2017 in essence the product c t in 5 represents the attack rate integrated over time and by transforming it into a random variable we obtain 18a h t 1 r h t x 0 p x exp x p t 18b p t 1 k r h t 1 x 0 p x exp x p t where p x is the distribution of risk across hosts singh et al 2009 a key assumption in this formulation is that risk is independent of the local host density if hosts are non uniformly distributed in space prior work on this topic has assumed p x follows a gamma distribution with mean c and coefficient of variation c v hassell et al 1991 pacala and hassell 1991 singh et al 2009 for which 19 x 0 p x exp x p t 1 1 c c v 2 p t 1 c v 2 in 18 yielding the following equilibrium host density 20 h r c v 2 1 c c v 2 r 1 here h is a monotonically decreasing function of r for c v 1 an unstable equilibrium but stability arises for c v 1 when h becomes a monotonically increasing function of r may 1978 taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 pacala and hassell 1991 singh et al 2009 another mechanism know to stabilize host parasitoid interactions is when the parasitoid s attack rate c in 5 decreases with increasing parasitoid density due to interference between parasitoids murdoch et al 2003 jervis 2007 rewriting c c 1 p t m where c 1 0 and 0 m 1 results in the following discrete time model 21a h t 1 r h t exp c 1 t p t 1 m 21b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c 1 t p t 1 m a straightforward application of the stability criterion 15 shows that the model 21 is stable for sufficiently large value of m given by 22 r ln r 1 r r ln r m 1 which corresponds to 0 28 m 1 for r 2 and 0 5 m 1 for r 5 3 2 stability condition for general escape responses it is important to emphasize that condition 15 can only to be used for a host independent escape response the above result begs the question can this simple stability criterion be generalized when f r h t p t depends on both populations it turns out that in this case the stability conditions 11 can be graphically represented in terms of two biologically relevant dimensionless quantities r h d h d r log sensitivity of the adult host equilibrium to the host growth rate h f r h p f r h p h log sensitivity of the escape response to the host density our analysis shows the host parasitoid equilibrium of the general model 1 is stable if and only if the above two quantities are in the yellow color region on fig 4 see appendix b for derivations and stability is more likely to occur when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density rather than an increasing function interestingly stability can be lost if the escape response decreases too rapidly with respect to the host density fig 4 the nicholson bailey model for which f h 0 and d h d r 0 is marked in the unstable region an interesting insight from this figure is that stability can arise via two orthogonal mechanisms mechanisms such as the host refuge variation in risk parasitoid interference for which f h 0 stability arises by shifting the nicholson bailey point upwards by making d h d r 0 mechanisms such as a type iii functional response drive stability by moving the nicholson bailey point leftwards by making f h 0 without appreciably changing d h d r we discuss type iii functional responses in further detail in the next section while the stability regions in fig 4 is independent of the parameter k in 1 our analysis found it to be quite insensitive to the value of r for example a tenfold change in r from 2 to 20 only resulted in the stability region moving slightly upwards and towards the right 4 hybrid formulation of update functions for a majority of host parasitoid models the escape response f in 1 is phenomenologically chosen or designed to recapitulate field observations recent work has proposed a mechanistic hybrid framework for deriving the discrete time model where ordinary differential equations are used to track population densities within the host vulnerable period of a given year singh and nisbet 2008 emerick and singh 2016 singh and nisbet 2007 singh and emerick 2020 the solution of the differential equations at the end of the vulnerable period predicts the population densities for next year we discuss this semi discrete formulation in further detail below let τ denote the time within the host vulnerable stage that varies from 0 to t corresponding to the start and end of the vulnerable stage the densities of parasitoids un parasitized and parasitized host larvae at time τ within the vulnerable stage of year t are represented by p τ t l τ t i τ t respectively these densities evolve as per the dynamical system 23a d p τ t d τ γ p p τ t 23b d l τ t d τ c p τ t l τ t γ l l τ t 23c d i τ t d τ c p τ t l τ t γ i i τ t where c represent the parasitoid s attack rate per host and γ p γ l γ i are the death rates of the respective species assuming p t parasitoids r h t host larvae and no parasitized larvae at the start of the vulnerable period τ 0 solving the above differential equations with initial conditions 24 l 0 t r h t p 0 t p t i 0 t 0 predicts the parasitized and unparasitized larval population at the end of the season τ t this leads to a more general discrete time model 25a h t 1 f r h t p t 25b p t 1 g r h t p t where update functions are obtained by setting 26a f r h t p t l t t 26b g r h t p t k i t t solving 23 for a constant attack rate c with no mortalities γ p γ l γ i 0 yields 27a p τ t p t 27b l τ t r h t exp c τ p t 27c i τ t r h t 1 exp c τ p t which using 26 yields the nicholson bailey model 5 it can also be shown analytically that nonzero constant mortality rates in each population yield discrete time models with an unstable coexistence fixed point similar to the nicholson bailey model see appendix c for a detailed analysis of a few cases therefore we seek stabilizing mechanisms that can be implemented in this hybrid format interestingly it turns out that discrete time models formulated using the hybrid approach can give qualitatively different results than phenomenologically designed updated functions we illustrate this point with host dependent parasitoid attack rates and connect them to the stability regions in fig 4 4 1 functional responses our analysis in 21 considered a parasitoid attack rate that decreases with increasing parasitoid density here we consider a host dependent attack rate 28 c c 1 l τ t q for positive constants c 1 q that monotonically increases with the host density since the vulnerable larval density l τ t continually changes within the season the hybrid formulation based on solving the differential equation 23 is vital in deriving the corresponding update function in the absence of mortalities γ p γ l γ i 0 the attack rate 28 results in the discrete time model 1 with the escape response 29 f r h t p t 1 1 c 1 t q r h t q p t 1 q and the corresponding equilibrium h r q 1 k c 1 t q r q r 1 1 q 1 p k r 1 h our prior analysis has shown that this model is neutrally stable for q 1 and stable for q 1 singh and nisbet 2007 interestingly the escape response is now a decreasing function of the host density and the host equilibrium is also a decreasing function of the host growth rate as in the nicholson bailey model thus in the context of fig 4 stability arises by shifting the nicholson bailey point to the left into the stability region where f r h p h 0 in contrast a phenomenologically chosen escape response where one simply substitutes c for c 1 r h t q in 5 yields 30 f r h t p t exp c 1 t r h t q p t it turns out that the escape response 30 in 1 results in an unstable model equilibrium for all values of q 0 singh and nisbet 2007 with both f r h p h and d h d r negative as in the mechanistic hybrid formulation but d h d r is sufficiently negative to fall in the unstable region of fig 4 these results can be generalized to type ii and iii functional responses 31 c c 1 l τ t q 1 c 1 t h l τ t q 1 where t h is interpreted as the parasitoid handling time a type iii functional response q 1 results in a stable equilibrium when the discrete time model is formulated using the hybrid approach as long as the handling time is significantly shorter than the vulnerable stage duration t h t singh and nisbet 2007 in contrast a type ii functional response q 0 always results in an unstable interaction by moving the nicholson bailey point to the right in fig 4 to further destabilize the population dynamics several prior works incorporated functional responses phenomenologically by simply substituting 32 c c 1 r h t q 1 c 1 t h r h t q 1 in the nicholson bailey model 5 and the resulting discrete time model is unstable for all values of q 0 hassell and comins 1978 in summary a type iii functional response q 1 stabilizes the population interaction in the mechanistically formulated hybrid approach but not in the phenomenological approach 5 limits of host suppression by parasitoids we next use the hybrid formulation to investigate the suppression of host population density by a parasitoid as done in other models neubert and kot 1992 hassell and varley 1969b may et al 1981 our previous work singh and nisbet 2007 considered a self limitation in the hosts ability to grow due to finite food resources or attacks by other nature enemies by considering a host mortality rate γ l c h l τ t in 23 that is proportional to the host density for a constant parasitoid attack rate c and γ p γ i 0 the above hybrid approach yields 33a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 1 c h r h t 1 exp c t p t c p t 33b p t 1 k c p t c h ln 1 c h r h t 1 exp c t p t c p t as expected in the limit c h 0 this model converges back to the nicholson bailey model in the absence of parasitoids this leads to 34 h t 1 r h t 1 c h t r h t which has a stable fixed point 35 h r 1 c h t r representing the host population before the introduction of the parasitoid in addition to this no parasitoid equilibrium the other fixed point of 33 is given by 36 h exp c h k c 1 1 exp c h k c r c p c h r p ln r c h k c c t and is stable for 37 z c h k c ln r where z is the solution to 38 z 1 r ln r z r exp z we refer the reader to singh and nisbet 2007 for details of the analysis leading to 36 38 the quantity 39 r exp c h k c 1 ln r c h k c r 1 r exp c h k c represents the ratio of the host equilibrium with parasitoids and without parasitoids as given by 35 and 36 respectively as one varies c h c in the stability region 37 the maximum host suppression while ensuring the stability of the fixed point 36 is given by r exp z 1 ln r z r 1 r exp z and is computed to be 0 34 and 0 29 for r 2 and 10 respectively thus for a constant parasitoid attack rate the host population density cannot be suppressed more than 30 below its density in the absence of the parasitoid can host suppression be more efficient with a density dependent parasitoid attack rate to address this question we consider a type iii functional response where the attack rate takes the form 31 for simplicity we consider the case of q 1 and fast handling times t h 0 which reduce 31 to 40 c c 1 l τ t in essence the ability of a parasitoid to locate attack and parasitize a host increases with increasing host density using 40 γ l c h l τ t γ p γ i 0 in 23 yields 41a h t 1 r h t 1 c h t r h t c t r h t p t 41b p t 1 k c t r 2 h t 2 p t 1 c h t r h t c t r h t p t the model again has two non trivial equilibriums the first is when the parasitoid is absent and the host density converges to 35 the second fixed point where both species coexist is given by 42 h 1 c 1 t r k p r 1 k c 1 t r c h c 1 stability analysis as outlined in section 3 shows that 42 is stable as long as 43 c 1 c h 2 r t k r 1 2 this implies that the ratio of host density with and without parasitoids 44 c h t r r 1 c 1 k can be made arbitrarily small with increasing attack rate parameter c 1 but with a dependence that scales as 1 c 1 k this point is illustrated in fig 5 where the time evolution of host densities are shown for increasing values of c 1 6 conclusion in this contribution we have focused on the ecological interaction between hosts and parasitoids that holds tremendous potential in biological control of pests abram et al 2016 jervis et al 1996 ueno 1998 reeve and murdoch 1985 jang and yu 2012 hassell and varley 1969a kaser et al 2018 bompard et al 2013 we provide novel results on the stability of host parasitoid interactions modeled as per 1 and characterized by an arbitrary escape response f r h t p t which to be ecologically relevant satisfies the conditions discussed around 2 the result is graphically illustrated in fig 4 in terms of two quantities the rate at which the host equilibrium changes with the host s growth rate d h d r and the sensitivity of the escape response to the host density at equilibrium f h for several models such as 5 6 18 21 the escape response is invariant of the host density in which case the stability reduces to the host density being an increasing function of the host growth rate another key insight that can be tested with field observations is that stability is more likely to emerge when the escape response is a decreasing function of the host density i e a larger fraction of hosts get parasitized at higher host densities as in the case of the type iii functional response rather than an increasing function we want to emphasize that this is the first work of its kind in a century of host parasitoid modeling that generalizes the stability conditions and graphically depicts them as in fig 4 we also introduced a hybrid approach for deriving the discrete time model by solving a set of nonlinear differential equations describing the population dynamics during the host s vulnerable stage the hybrid approach was used to study the limit of host suppression while still keeping the host parasitoid interaction stable our prior work had shown that for a constant parasitoid attack rate the host cannot be suppressed beyond a certain limit singh and nisbet 2007 interestingly our analysis here shows that an attack rate proportional to the host density can lead to arbitrary low host suppression fig 5 in future work we will investigate host suppression with other stabilizing mechanisms such as host refuge variation of risk across the host population taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 and parasitoid aggregation reeve et al 1994 rohani et al 1994 may 1978 another aspect to explore using the hybrid formulation is spatial dynamics where host parasitoid can move between patches rohani and miramontes 1995 cronin and reeve 2005 adler 1993 comins et al 1992 our preliminary work on this topic has been quite promising and shows that density dependent movement between patches can have a stabilizing effect on the population dynamics emerick et al 2020 credit

paper appendix a consider the discrete time model 13 whose unique non trivial fixed point is given by 45 1 r f p p k r 1 h denoting small fluctuation around the equilibrium h and p by h t h t h and p t p t p respectively one obtains using linearization the following linear discrete system 46 h t 1 p t 1 a h t p t with 47 a 1 r h f p k r 1 k r h f p where 48 f p d f x d x x p 0 the stability conditions 11 applied to 47 shows the model fixed point is stable if and only if the following inequalities hold 49 k r r 1 h f p 0 50 2 k r h f p 0 51 1 k r 2 h f p 0 given that r 1 and the fact that f p 0 f is a monotonically decreasing function inequalities 49 50 always hold and the stability condition is given by inequality 51 which using p k r 1 h becomes 52 p f p 1 r 1 r 2 differentiating the first equation in 45 with respect to r we have 53 1 r 2 f p d p d r which using p k r 1 h can be written as 54 1 p d p d r 1 r 1 1 h d h d r substituting 54 in 53 gives us 55 1 r 1 r 2 p f p 1 r 1 1 h d h d r which using the stability condition 52 reduce to 56 d h d r 0 appendix b for model 1 the non trivial fixed point is given as the solution to 57 1 r f r h p p k r 1 h and the function f is assumed to have a form such that the non trivial fixed point is unique linearizing the right hand side of 1 yields the a matrix in 47 58 a 1 r h f r h p h r h f r h p p k r 1 r h f r h p h k r h f r h p p differentiating the first and the second equations in 57 with respect to r we have 59 1 r 2 f r h p r h h r d h d r f r h p p d p d r and 60 d p d r k r 1 d h d r k h respectively substituting 60 in 59 one can express f r h p p as functions of f r h p h and d h d r next we define two log sensitivities 61 s r h r h d h d r s h f h f r h p f r h p h with the above substitutions the stability conditions 11 can be written in term of these sensitivities as 62 r 1 s h f r 1 s r h r 0 63 1 s h f 2 s r h r 3 2 s r h 2 s h f 1 s r h r 1 s r h r 0 64 s r h r s h f s h f 1 s r h r 1 s r h r 0 for a given value of r these stability conditions can be graphically represented as a function of s r h and s h f as in fig 4 if s h f 0 host independent escape response the above conditions reduce to 65 r 1 r 1 s r h r 0 1 2 r 1 s r h 3 r r 1 s r h r 0 s r h r 1 r 1 s r h r 0 since r 1 and the escape response being a decreasing function of the parasitoid density results in r 1 s r h r 0 the first two inequalities in 65 are always satisfied and the stability condition is given by the third inequality leading to s r h 0 appendix c for model 23 we consider several cases of the hybrid approach that include nonzero constant mortality rates we assume that at least one of the mortality rates γ p γ l or γ i is nonzero when a combination of nonzero parameters is assumed a different discrete time model is formed each time for each case we present the resulting discrete time model the coexistence equilibrium point and a brief linear stability analysis let γ p 0 and γ l γ i 0 then the discrete time model is identical to model 1 with host independent escape response 66 f p t exp c p t 1 e γ p t γ p and the corresponding equilibrium is 67 h γ p ln r c k 1 e γ p t r 1 p k r 1 h using eq 15 we have 68 d h d r γ p 1 1 r ln r c k 1 e γ p t 0 for all r 1 and for all positive parameter values hence the coexistence equilibrium is unstable let γ l 0 and γ p γ i 0 then the discrete time model takes the form 69 h t 1 r h t e c p t γ l t 70 p t 1 c k r h t p t c p t γ l 1 e c p t γ l t and the corresponding equilibrium is h ln r c k t r 1 p ln r γ l t c t the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point is 71 a 1 ln r k r 1 k r 1 ln r γ l t ln r γ l t ln r ln r γ l t r 1 and we find that the jury conditions in 11 are not satisfied for all r 1 and γ l 0 indeed 1 t r a d e t a 0 and 1 d e t a 0 cannot be satisfied simultaneously let γ i 0 and γ p γ l 0 then the discrete time model takes the form 72 h t 1 r h t e c p t t 73 p t 1 c k r h t p t γ i c p t e c p t t e γ i t and the corresponding equilibrium is h γ i t ln r c k t 1 r e γ i t p ln r c t the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point is given by 74 a 1 γ i t ln r k 1 r e γ i t k 1 r e γ i t ln r γ i t ln r ln r 1 r e γ i t γ i t γ i t ln r we find that the third jury condition namely 1 d e t a 0 is never satisfied for all r 1 and for all positive values for γ i let γ p 0 γ l 0 γ i 0 with γ p γ γ l then the discrete time model takes the form 75 h t 1 r h t exp c p t 1 e γ t γ e γ t 76 p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c p t 1 e γ t γ and the corresponding equilibrium is h ln r γ t γ c k 1 e γ t r e γ t p k r e γ t h the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point is given by 77 a 1 ln r γ t k r e γ t k r e γ t e γ t ln r γ t r e γ t and we find that the jury conditions in 11 are not satisfied for all r 1 and γ l 0 in fact 1 t r a d e t a 0 and 1 d e t a 0 cannot be satisfied simultaneously let γ l 0 γ i 0 and γ p 0 then the discrete time model takes the form 78 h t 1 r h t e c p t γ l t 79 p t 1 c k r h t p t γ i c p t γ l e c p t γ l t e γ i t and the corresponding equilibrium is h ln r γ l t γ p c k r e γ i t e γ l t 1 e γ p t p k r e γ i t e γ l t h the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point is given by 80 a 1 ln r γ i t k 1 r e γ i t k 1 r e γ i t ln r γ l t 1 r e γ i t γ i γ l γ i t ln r and we find that the first and third jury conditions are never satisfied for all r 1 γ l and γ i that yield positive fixed point values the above models can be examined analytically using the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point other combinations of nonzero mortalities can be examined numerically and it can be verified by constructing trajectories that the dynamics exhibit diverging oscillations similar to that of the nicholson bailey model
