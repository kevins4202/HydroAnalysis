7430,the utilization of ecosystem services in flood management is challenged by the complexity of human nature interactions and practical implementation barriers towards more ecosystem based solutions such as riverine urban areas or technical infrastructure this paper analyses how flood management has dealt with trade offs between ecosystem services and practical constrains towards more ecosystem based solutions to this end we study the evolution of flood management in four case studies in the dutch and german rhine the hungarian tisza and the chinese yangtze basins during the last decades focusing on the development and implementation of institutions and their link to ecosystem services the complexity of human nature interactions is addressed by exploring the impacts on ecosystem services through the lens of three management paradigms 1 the control paradigm 2 the ecosystem based paradigm and 3 the stakeholder involvement paradigm case study data from expert interviews and a literature search were structured using a database approach prior to qualitative interpretation results show the growing importance of the ecosystem based and stakeholder involvement paradigms which has led to the consideration of a range of regulating and cultural ecosystem services that had previously been neglected we detected a trend in flood management practice towards the combination of the different paradigms under the umbrella of integrated flood management which aims at finding the most suitable solution depending on the respective regional conditions keywords flood management ecosystem services paradigms institutional analysis 1 introduction in recent years the limitations of engineering approaches controlling rivers through technical measures e g dams and reservoirs dikes and bypass channels became more obvious for example due to the adverse environmental effects associated with large scale infrastructure pahl wostl et al 2013 alternative approaches have been developed utilizing the natural retention capacity of river floodplains thorpe et al 2010 and including stakeholders through participatory and collaborative processes pahl wostl et al 2013 alternative flood management approaches can face substantial barriers in practice though most rivers such as the rhine tisza and yangtze have been strongly modified through human interventions which put constrains on the partial restoration of the original river landscape basically this can be related to the lack of space e g in urban areas and competition over land uses instead of following a pure structural engineering floodplain restoration or participatory approach flood management has to deal with the topographical social economic and ecological circumstances of individual cases in this context the concept of ecosystem services ess plays a beneficial role in incorporating alternative flood management approaches for several reasons first ess demonstrate the value of river floodplains for flood protection at the local and regional levels barbedo et al 2014 second ess facilitate transparency in the decision making process supporting consensus and trust building among stakeholders bryan et al 2010 and third ess reveal trade offs and allow for the identification of synergies rodríguez et al 2006 while significant progress has been made in the conceptualization and modelling of trade offs and synergies between ess bennett et al 2009 little is known about their management in practice we utilize the concept of management paradigms to untangle the effects of different flood management approaches on ecosystem services management paradigms characterize the underlying rationale of flood management consisting of i a particular system perspective e g main water course of a river or floodplain ii preferred solution strategies e g building dikes or retention areas and iii the way how to deal with risk and uncertainty e g uncertainty reduction or acceptance halbe et al 2013 here we focus on three paradigms the control paradigm the ecosystem based paradigm and the stakeholder involvement paradigm table 1 to explore and understand shifts in flood management paradigms one needs to analyse several years or decades of flood management the research questions addressed in this study are what are the direct or indirect impacts of management paradigms on ess and their trade offs and synergies and how can flood management deal with practical constraints in the implementation of ecosystem based solutions in answering these questions we make a distinction between effects of management paradigms on flood management institutions e g change in the management of ess due to new legislation and actual effects on ess through the operative implementation of institutions e g shift from intensive to extensive farming practices the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section two introduces the concepts of ess and management paradigms as well as requirements for an integrated flood management approach section three presents the methodology to understand identify and analyse paradigm changes and their effect on ecosystem services case studies and the findings are outlined in section four which is followed by a discussion in section five there we identify five steps towards integrated flood management that balances trade offs and fosters synergies between ess the paper closes with conclusions and possible directions for future work 2 theoretical and conceptual research design 2 1 ecosystem services in the context of flood management there is widespread recognition that river landscapes provide a range of ess which can be defined as quantifiable or qualitative benefits of ecosystem functioning to the overall environment including the products services and other benefits humans receive from natural regulated or otherwise perturbed ecosystems thorpe et al 2010 p 67 ess can be grouped into three broad categories i provisioning e g food and timber ii regulating e g nutrient cycling and water flow regulation and iii cultural and social ess e g recreational activities ma 2005 in degraded river landscapes many ess e g primary production nutrient and water cycling are negatively affected in particular regulating ess such as biodiversity and habitat have been diminished to increase provisioning ess such as food production and transportation ecosystem management can reduce such trade offs by fostering synergies between multiple ess and thereby harmonizing the multi functionality of river landscapes raudsepp hearne et al 2010 most flood prone areas are nowadays characterized by structural flood protection measures such as dikes and dams which are often associated with detrimental effects on ess e g decreased habitat connectivity water flow regulation constitutes a particularly important ess for flood management as it addresses the ecosystem s capacity to prevent and mitigate flood hazards following heavy precipitation events by reducing the runoff fraction stürck et al 2014 the growing emphasis on the relevance of water flow regulation for flood prevention is extensively discussed as an ecosystem based flood management measure in the literature barbedo et al 2014 a major challenge of implementing such an ecosystem based approach is the prevalence of a command and control paradigm see section 2 2 in natural resources management in general and flood management in particular that focuses on technical solutions holling and meffe 1996 sendzimir et al 2010 halbe et al 2013 2 2 management paradigms the history of flood management is characterized by the goal to mitigate and control flood risks that were formerly predetermined by the flow regime and fluvial morphology khatibi 2011 however flood disasters in the past have repeatedly revealed negative side effects of an engineering approach solely relying on technical flood protection measures for instance the reduction of the natural retention capacities of floodplains through the construction of dikes can ultimately result in higher water levels and velocities sendzimir et al 2010 dikes also facilitate the spreading of agricultural and residential areas into the floodplain leading to higher potential damages in case of floods as a response alternative flood management approaches have been developed that stress the importance of the natural retention capacities of floodplains and the involvement of stakeholders a more ecosystem based approach has been promoted since the 1990s that urges for a shift from defensive action against hazards to management of the risk khatibi 2011 and living with floods sendzimir et al 2010 furthermore as floods pose a direct threat to property economic activity and human life management must raise awareness and receive the support of stakeholders to implement flood management measures participatory and collaborative approaches aim to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of flood risk management by involving stakeholders in planning and decision making challi et al 2016 management paradigms sort the various goals measures and instruments of natural resources management approaches into a coherent whole and thus support a systematic analysis of human nature interactions management paradigms are defined as a set of basic assumptions about the nature of the system to be managed the goals of managing the system and the ways in which these goals can be achieved pahl wostl et al 2011 p 840 the concept of management paradigms provides an encompassing picture on different solution strategies in flood management e g technical or ecosystem based approaches by addressing the chosen system perspective and the approach to risk and uncertainty see halbe et al 2013 table 1 lists these different characteristics for each of the paradigms under investigation 2 3 integrated flood management there is a lack of research on the interplay of different management paradigms in specific case studies instead publications often highlight the strength of a single paradigm and limitations of others e g sultana et al 2008 however each paradigm has strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered for an effective flood management thus a control paradigm allows a diverse usage of diked floodplains for economic activities such as agriculture and industrial settlements but can also give a false sense of security and increase potential damage from flooding sendzimir et al 2010 viglione et al 2014 the ecosystem based paradigm supports ecological processes and functions within the river landscape rouquette et al 2011 but requires space and land uses that allow for temporary flooding which is limited in urban industrial and intensive agricultural areas stakeholder involvement can provide a greater legitimacy of planning processes newig et al 2016 but its success depends upon various factors such as facilitation skills stakeholder selection and institutional embedment cf roth et al 2017 an integrated flood management approach facilitates a tailored application of paradigms based upon topographical social economic and ecological circumstances this includes that trade offs and synergies between ess are explicitly considered as well as the strengths and limitations of each paradigm fig 1 depicts the conceptual linkages between management paradigms river landscape ess and trade offs and synergies thus flood management is guided by paradigms which are interpreted as cultural cognitive institutions halbe et al 2013 flood management shapes the river landscape through operational measures e g renaturation of retention areas or heightening of dikes which follow the development and implementation of institutions e g development of area development plans or more indirectly through the production and dissemination of knowledge e g hydrological studies that inform the design of stream works or awareness campaigns that influence the behavior of stakeholders changes in the river landscape have an effect on ess and their trade offs and synergies which can be induced in a purposeful or unconscious way a purposeful balance of ess requires that ess are explicitly considered in flood management institutions such as policies regulations and guidelines the effects of flood management on ess trade offs and synergies can finally influence the choice for a specific management paradigm thus persistent issues are expected to induce a reflection on the currently held paradigm and eventually experimentation with alternatives 3 methodological and analytical approach we applied a case study research method to better understand the evolution of management paradigms in specific case studies and their link to ess more specifically we investigated how flood management processes evolved in the last decades and how they influenced the management of ess in four cases the areas of the rhine basin in north rhine westphalia nrw germany and the netherlands the hungarian part of the tisza basin and the yangtze basin in china we preferred qualitative research because it allows taking into account the peculiarities of each case study which is important for analysing the management of ess in a specific regional context 3 1 data collection first we conducted a literature review including scientific articles policy reports and legal requirements related to water flood and environmental management relevant to the four case studies the literature review was conducted to i summarize the dominant management paradigm as well as development trajectories at different spatial levels to ii assess how institutions e g policies and legal requirements consider and support ess and to iii identify as far as possible whether the implementation of these institutions impacting the state of ess in the river landscape the latter is difficult to identify due to mismatches between ecological and political scales as well as the time lag between a cause management action and its resulting change alteration in ess while the literature review gave general insight into policy measures and management trajectories expert interviews provided more specific insights on flood management processes and ess to conduct expert interviews the case study areas in germany seven interviews the netherlands seven interviews and hungary eighteen interviews were visited in the period from summer 2014 to autumn 2015 the exploration of the chinese case was conducted without a case study visit nevertheless we include the chinese case as its high level of flood risk and its engineering mega projects make it interesting for comparison the findings of the chinese case are based on a literature review and were afterwards reviewed by two chinese flood management experts for each of the three other case studies semi structured interviews were carried out the selection of experts was based upon their involvement and knowledge regarding flood management and ess in order to elicit different perspectives we interviewed experts with different professional backgrounds politics and administration consulting agriculture nature conservation and research the duration of each interview varied between 60 and 90 min and addressed the topics of a integrated water resources and flood management b barriers towards more ecosystem based solutions and c major future challenges to the institutionalization of integrated flood risk management 3 2 data analyses case study data were structured and analysed according to the management and transition framework mtf pahl wostl et al 2010 pahl wostl 2015 the mtf is an interdisciplinary framework to analyse complex water management processes based upon the theoretical concepts related to water governance and management social learning processes and overall system transformation processes pahl wostl 2015 to operationalize the mtf and to facilitate case study analyses we made use of a relational database knüppe and knieper 2016 knieper et al 2010 the mtf database allows to structure flood management processes which are represented as a network of action situations as for each of the four cases the concept of as was originally developed by ostrom 2005 and describes a structured social interaction that leads to identifiable outcomes pahl wostl 2015 action situations can take place at different spatial levels e g national regional and involve various actors which can be individuals or collectives e g water authorities organized interest groups companies action situations are connected to each other through outcome s that are produced in an as and influence other as an outcome can be 1 an institution e g water acts 2 knowledge i e meaningful information and experience or 3 an operational outcome referring to concrete physical measurable effects e g improvement of water quality land use changes the linkages between as and outcomes allow to derive statements about the management implications linked to ess for example farmers decide to change cultivation practices as and thereby increase soil quality operational outcome this in turn can have a positive impact on water flow regulation ess the characteristics of management paradigms in table 1 are used as a coding scheme to link one or several paradigms to each as thus each outcome of an action situation i e institution knowledge or operational outcome is examined with respect to its underlying system perspective solution strategy and risk and uncertainty management approach thereby the different kinds of outcomes allow identifying paradigm shifts occurring in the evolution of flood management this allows highlighting dominant paradigm s as well as a potential shift over a certain period of time in the last step of the analysis we sort as according to their institutional level cf iad framework ostrom 2005 which can be the operational level i e activities that affect the world directly such as building of a reservoir or land use changes collective choice level i e decision makers create rules to impact operational level activities such as rules how to allocate water to different uses and constitutional level decision makers introduce collective choice bodies such as a basin commission or water user association or determine how collective choice participants will be selected and formal relationships among members of the collective choice body 4 results 4 1 case studies fig 2 shows a map for each of the four case studies the cases have in common that they face a high level of flood exposure their river flow regimes and floodplains are influenced by large scale engineering interventions and high competition among land uses is likely to further increase in the future for a consistent presentation the results for each case are structured in the following order a general case study description and b evolution of management paradigms and effects on ess trade offs and synergies as the collected case study information is very comprehensive we refer to the supplemental material for detailed information tables 1a 4a which shows for each case study the respective network of as the outcomes influencing as and produced by as the management paradigms and institutional level assigned to as as well as a short description of main impacts of management changes to facilitate the reading flow and allow for easy navigation of the supplemental material we use a coding system referring to the individual as of the four case studies 4 1 1 rhine basin in north rhine westphalia germany 4 1 1 1 case study description the rhine is a central european river which originates in the swiss alps and enters the north sea after a total length of 1233 km icpr 2015 in the german federal state of north rhine westphalia nrw the rhine basin covers an area of 21 025 km2 with about 13 million inhabitants icpr 2015 this densely populated area it is one of the most economically important regions in germany comprising the ruhr area as well as major cities along the lower rhine such as cologne dusseldorf and germany s former capital bonn in germany flood management policies and management plans are shaped at the federal state bundesland level in nrw the main authority responsible for flood management is the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture nature and consumer protection north rhine westphalia s water and flood legislation remains subordinated under federal and european law at the local level flood management is assigned to municipalities as well as water and dike boards thomas and knüppe 2016 the rhine and its floodplains in nrw have been strongly modified sänger and schrickel 2010 due to the traditional dominance of large scale engineering interventions in water and flood management 4 1 2 management paradigms and ess the control paradigm has resulted in the modification of the rhine for the benefit of provisioning ess in nrw since the 16th and 17th century functional wetlands in the former floodplains were reduced by 80 and today 70 of the main course of the rhine is diked sänger and schrickel 2010 for nrw and bordering federal states and countries the transportation of goods intensive agricultural activities in the floodplains and the industrial sector using rhine water for cooling processes are of significant economic importance technical measures were often favoured by flood managers farmers and industries in the last centuries to secure the supply of provisioning ess mentioned above this means that the construction of dikes and reclamation of agricultural land in former floodplains diminished multiple regulating ess such as water flow regulation and habitat biodiversity for instance the lateral migration of fish was significantly reduced or lost in approximately 70 of the nrw s portion of the rhine thomas and knüppe 2016 major flood events along the rhine in 1993 and 1995 and along the elbe river in 2002 triggered a modification of flood management in germany pahl wostl et al 2013 the network of as for the rhine basin in nrw indicates an increasing trend towards the ecosystem based paradigm see e g nrw 01 04 nrw 07 10 table 1a however one has to be careful with the interpretation of this finding as most as are only part of strategic flood management processes this includes the development of the blue guideline aiming at the protection and near natural development of rivers streams and floodplains the rhine action plan on flood defence or european and national institutions e g eu floods directive federal flood protection act effects on the ground are still modest given a long history of building technical structures for flood protection which has resulted in a river landscape that leaves little space for natural inundation and associated ess in the densely populated region for example only 2 4 of additional natural retention areas were restored in nrw since 1990 bfn 2014 hence statements about measurable impacts of the ecosystem based paradigm on the state of ess can only be made to a limited extent one example is the implementation of the rhine action programme implemented from 1987 to 2000 which has had a positive impact on the hydrological biological and morphological conditions of the rhine and its landscape through a number of measures such as the extensification of farming practices in certain areas and the improvement of structural diversity of the river and floodplains nrw 02 table 1a notably habitat connectivity and the ecological patency up and downstream migration of the rhine from lake constance to the north sea improved icpr 2015 this in turn fostered synergies between regulating services e g floodplain restoration supporting water flow regulation and natural flood mitigation recovery of endangered species provisioning ess e g fishing and cultural social ess e g attractiveness for leisure and touristic activities the stakeholder involvement paradigm made local and regional knowledge about ess utilizable this kind of knowledge was used during consensus finding processes like the agreement to coordinate flood protection across federal states nrw 04 table 1a legislation process of eu water framework directive nrw 07 table 1a and establishment of the german dutch working group on floods nrw 08 table 1a these as are basically shaped by governmental actors water authorities at higher management levels to better coordinate strategic flood management the implementation of the project living rhine river of thousand islands nrw 10 table 1a is characterized by multiple actors though both governmental and non governmental from higher and lower management levels nabu 2010 multiple measurable impacts of these collaborative processes on regulating services were identified e g natural water flow regulation habitat structures and recovery of endangered fish species 4 1 3 rhine basin in the netherlands 4 1 3 1 case study description the dutch part of the rhine basin is home to about 12 million inhabitants and covers an area of 25 390 km2 icpr 2015 here the main river splits into several streams that drain into the north sea major dutch cities such as amsterdam rotterdam the hague and utrecht are located in this area since 60 of the dutch area is vulnerable to floods from rivers the sea or lakes flood protection is a significant societal task in the netherlands delta programme commissioner 2014 the large population in the dutch rhine basin and its highly advanced economy imply considerable pressure on the river as well as numerous stakeholders with diverse interests in the netherlands water management primarily resides at the national level in close interaction with regional provincial and municipal levels oecd 2014 the national ministry of infrastructure and environment is responsible for the development of national policies and the coordination with other policy arenas such as spatial planning land use environment and agriculture rijkswaterstaat a national water authority is an executive body of the ministry of infrastructure and environment and responsible for the design construction management and maintenance of main infrastructure facilities provinces supervise regional water authorities and are responsible for integrated spatial and environmental planning and groundwater regulation regional water authorities deal with the operative management of regional water systems including flood defence as well as water quality and quantity management finally municipalities perform several tasks and public services such as urban drainage and stormwater collection oecd 2014 4 1 3 2 management paradigms and ess after the devastating flood in 1953 the delta plan was designed that based upon a structural engineering approach including dike extensions and dam construction projects nl 01 table 2a besides improving flood protection further benefits related to provisioning ess such as fishing agriculture and transport as well as cultural social services such as recreation were sought in the 1970s the plan to construct a further impervious dam that completely blocks the scheldt estuary from the inflow of brackish water was opposed by the public which exemplifies a changing public opinion towards more environmental values nl 02 table 2a a compromise was found by building a pervious dam with gates that can be closed in case of storm surges but stay open at all other times goemans and visser 1987 this technical solution supports provisioning ess through an improved controllability of flooding events as well as regulating services by protecting the original brackish water ecosystem and its biodiversity in the 1980s and early 1990s the dutch water policy shifted towards a more integrated approach that still focuses on flood control but complements it with ecological and participatory elements cf wesselink 2007 de jonge 2009 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 nl 03 04 table 2a however major flooding events in 1993 and 1995 caused a step backwards towards structural engineering with only minimal opportunities for stakeholder participation nl 06 table 2a thus dike reinforcements were accomplished without conducting rigorous environmental impact assessments and stakeholder consultations wiering and drissen 2001 after this immediate response the trend towards a more integrated approach nevertheless continued in the netherlands the room for the river programme was a central process that mainstreamed a floodplain approach through 30 individual projects in the netherlands nl 12 table 2a the programme combined an increase in flood safety with increased spatial quality of landscape nature and culture van herk et al 2015 today an integrated flood management approach is applied that combines the control ecosystem based and stakeholder involvement paradigms and seeks to support multiple ess cf delta programme e g nl 10 nl 14 table 2a the benefits of such an integrated approach are reflected in the diversity of flood management measures which increased the water retention volume in the whole rhine catchment between 1995 and 2010 icpr 2013 due to the fact that the netherlands are densely populated a control paradigm is still widely applied to protect residential and agricultural areas nevertheless the limitations of this paradigm are clearly stated in official policy documents flood management in the netherlands has experimented with various forms of participatory approaches edelenbos et al 2016 roth et al 2017 to involve local knowledge define common goals and assure transparency and democratic decision making slomp 2012 water boards have traditionally played a key role in inclusive water governance by involving organized interest groups e g farmer or business organizations and environmentalists in decision making roth et al 2017 in the past a large number of local water boards around 3500 existed which by today were merged into a lower number of regional water authorities 21 by now in a process of centralization and professionalization toonen et al 2006 besides such a strongly institutionalized involvement of organized interest groups there is a trend towards more open participatory processes facilitated by governmental actors as well as the formation of bottom up action groups to oppose governmental plans e g related to flood defence infrastructure or calamity polders e g roth and warner 2007 warner 2011 roth et al 2017 the case study analysis confirms that the implementation of the stakeholder involvement paradigm includes various forms of stakeholder participation first stakeholder involvement in water management is formally required through stakeholder representation in regional water authorities oecd 2014 as well as participation requirements defined in national and international legislations such as the dutch water policy e g nl 10 table 2a the eu water framework directive nl 07 table 2a and the eu floods directive nl13 table 2a second local stakeholder initiatives can generate an impact on flood infrastructure projects and policies as shown in the example of the opposition against the closing of the scheldt estuary nl 02 table 2a the stakeholder involvement paradigm induces a balancing effect on ess trade offs as can generally be seen in various as that include this paradigm e g nl 02 nl 03 nl 07 nl 10 nl 12 nl 14 table 2a thus all these as address a range of provisioning ess e g food production transportation as well as some form of nature protection which support regulating ess e g biodiversity water quality however the selection of stakeholders clearly influences which ess are particularly addressed in the participatory process for instance opposition towards the closing of the scheldt estuary involved the fishing industry and environmentalists so that fishing as a provisioning ess as well as habitat as a regulating ess were promoted nl 02 table 2a roth et al 2017 highlight that there are still several issues related to participatory water governance in the netherlands though such as the instrumental use of stakeholder participation to legitimize decisions by governmental agencies delay of decision making due to a multitude of interests and unclear responsibilities or the strategic use of public fora by interest groups 4 1 4 tisza basin hungary 4 1 4 1 case study description the tisza river originates in the ukrainian carpathian mountains and drains into the danube in serbia after a total length of 966 km icpdr 2010 with an area of 157 186 km2 the tisza basin is the largest sub basin of the danube and is home to about 14 million inhabitants the tisza basin in hungary has been characterized by the occurrence of severe flood events and by a strong modification of the river and its floodplains through technical interventions to improve flood control and navigation pahl wostl et al 2013 and to gain land for settlements and agriculture sendzimir et al 2010 this led to the loss of natural floodplains and wetlands as well as structural changes of the river morphology pinke 2014 water management in hungary faced profound changes in boundary conditions due to the transition from a communist state with a centrally planned economy to a market based democracy water policies are formulated at the national level the general directorate of water management is a central government body under the direction and supervision of the minister of interior it coordinates flood management as well as agricultural water supply and urban water management ovf 2014 in hungary twelve regional water directorates exist that are responsible for daily operational activities such as the maintenance of the state owned infrastructure e g dams weirs and floodgates 4 1 4 2 management paradigms and ess flood protection in the hungarian tisza basin is organized in a centralized way characterized by large scale flood defence infrastructure solutions sendzimir et al 2010 over centuries the control paradigm allowed for navigation and intensification of agriculture activities and settlements in the floodplains by constructing dikes that cut the wetlands off from the main river pinke 2014 especially provisioning ess such as freshwater for croplands were traded off against a variety of regulating ess in particular the natural flood buffer capacity of the floodplains furthermore cultural social ess were negatively diminished such as aesthetic values including a visual diversity of the landscape but also other provisioning ess were degraded due to the grain monoculture development e g raw materials such as timber reed sallow harvest medical resources such as medicinal plants petz et al 2012 poor environmental conditions of the river and its floodplains as well as major floods during the 1990s and 2000s led to strategic changes in flood management at international national and sub basin levels since the 1990s the ecosystem based as well as the stakeholder involvement paradigms have received more attention in the hungarian tisza basin the as development of the danube river protection convention legislation process of the european water framework directive and floods directive and implementation of unpd gef tisza project are some examples of how ess are strategically incorporated in flood management hu 01 02 07 08 table 3a the aim of these as has been to reverse the degradation of the tisza s floodplains e g water flow regulation habitat and climate regulation while meeting the inhabitant s increasing demand for provisioning ess water for irrigation and possibilities for shipping derts and koncsos 2012 found that the flood levels of the tisza could be mitigated by approximately one meter if operative measures like deep floodplain reservoirs were used furthermore national institutions such as the new vásárhelyi plan aimed at the restoration of the multi functional land uses acknowledging that flood protection and nature conservation can benefit from the reintroduction and utilization of natural floodplains hu 03 table 3a werners et al 2010 highlighted that the implementation of the new vásárhelyi plan was delayed due to budgetary problems tensions among different lobbies and unclear property rights hence implications for ess on the ground have not been observed until now albeit a strategic re thinking can be noted in most of the as in table 3a very few non technical measures were implemented such as trainings for water authorities on flood prevention e g hu 07 table 3a the stakeholder involvement paradigm plays a minor role in the tisza basin nevertheless we found that especially at basin and sub basin levels hu 04 and 05 table 3a transboundary and regional cooperation between different stakeholders e g water authorities local communities farmers ngos successfully introduced floodplain rehabilitation into the water policy arena the development of living tisza alliance promoted development and implementation of pilot experiments with floodplain restoration traditional agriculture and tourism sendzimir et al 2010 besides provisioning ess these pilot experiments also consider regulating and cultural social ess 4 1 5 yangtze basin china 4 1 5 1 case study description with 6300 km the yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest in the world yu et al 2009 with more that 400 million people living in the yangtze basin this area is densely populated and largely urbanized the river provides major resources for irrigation food production and hydroelectric power including the three gorges dam te boekhorst et al 2010 deforestation agricultural land expansion urbanization construction of roads and strengthening of embankments of the river have been progressing in the last 50 years due to growing population increase in food demand and industrial and municipal development gemmer et al 2008 the ministry of water resources mwr is an authorized body to oversee china s water resource management including surface and ground water river basin management flood control and water and soil conservation the mwr has water bureaus and departments at both the provincial and county levels at the yangtze basin level the changjiang water resources commission a subordinated agency of the mwr is responsible for water administration and law enforcement including amongst others flood control mwr n d 4 1 5 2 management paradigms and ess until the 1990s the network of as indicates a dominance of a flood control paradigm table 4a driven by economic development

water storage capacity and water flow regulation gemmer et al 2008 trade offs between technical flood control and almost all other ess occurred habitats for fish birds and mammals decreased micro climate regulation was diminished fertile soils woodlands and villages were flooded algae blooms and malarial mosquitoes emerged as a consequence of reduced water flow and the changing chemical composition of the river which was caused by a shift of land use structures ye at al 2006 only few ess were positively influenced such as the suitability for navigation on the river and the production of hydro power in 1998 a devastating flood in the yangtze basin led to 3600 deaths made 13 2 million people homeless and caused estimated economic losses of 36 billion us ye and glantz 2005 this disaster triggered the awareness of the weaknesses of flood control based on technical measures and the mwr initiated an action programme prc 06 table 4a that included various non structural measures such as the reforestation of uplands change in agricultural practices and resettlement from flood prone areas apart from the construction of the three gorges dam different as indicate the increasing significance of the ecosystem based paradigm both from a strategic and operative point of view the partnership for a living yangtze prc 07 table 4a and the restoring the web of life prc 11 table 4a achieved increasing environmental awareness of stakeholders and also an improvement of multiple ess for example lake and wetland areas were restored supporting habitat ess as well as water flow regulation furthermore to improve rural livelihoods sustainable farming and fishing approaches were implemented in cooperation with the local residents along the yangtze te boekhorst et al 2010 at the national level strategic planning highlights a policy shift towards a re thinking of flood protection and prevention as 06 08 and 13 of less significance to flood management in the yangtze basin is the stakeholder involvement paradigm only during the programmes partnership for a living yangtze and restoring the web of life prc 07 and prc 11 governmental and non governmental actors collaborated and developed jointly new visions for the yangtze as these programmes fostered by the international ngo wwf strongly rely on local knowledge and incorporate different values multi stakeholder processes were organized the main objective was to introduce a new decision making process at the local level and to eliminate the structural obstacles currently hindering river and floodplain conservation wwf n d for the implementation of these projects pilot sites were selected to initiate bottom up and co production processes involving local stakeholders governmental water authorities from national and regional level and ngos these programmes achieved synergies between water flow regulation natural flood control habitat diversity and increasing environment friendly farms and fisheries for food production te boekhorst et al 2010 4 2 synthesis fig 3 shows a graphical representation of the dynamics of action situations through time sorted according to their institutional levels in all case studies the evolution of paradigms is not a linear process instead action situations emerge that set impulses by introducing a new paradigm e g nrw 01 nl 03 or combining different sets of paradigms e g hu 01 prc 10 setbacks can be provoked by flooding disasters that may cause a return to conventional flood defence approaches as happened in the netherlands nl 06 in addition the step from developing innovative policies such as the integrated tisza river basin management plan hu 10 towards their implementation in practice hu 11 can also dilute the influence of alternative paradigms all cases show the general trend that new paradigms are introduced at the constitutional collective choice levels and trickle down to the operational level however experimentation with new paradigms did also happen at the operational level even when such paradigms have not yet become evident at the constitutional collective choice levels e g prc 07 for instance the opposition against the closure of the scheldt estuary in the netherlands nl 02 changed the original plan to construct an impermeable dam towards a pervious dam thus a purely flood control approach i e control paradigm was revised towards a more ecosystem based solution that resonated with an increased environmental awareness of citizens in all case studies international pilot projects e g nrw 02 nl 05 prc 11 and hu 07 set impulses for alternative flood management approaches action situations linked to a single paradigm continue to occur after the introduction of a new paradigm however integrative action situations that combine the two alternative paradigms i e ecosystem based and stakeholder participation with the control paradigm turn out to be critical for integrated flood management such integrative action situations were found in the dutch 6 german 3 and hungarian 2 case studies these include european and national policy initiatives as well as the bottom up processes led by action groups despite substantial socio economic differences all cases show a general trend from a flood control paradigm towards a more integrated approach that also considers ecosystem based solutions and stronger participation of stakeholders nevertheless the level of policy coherence as well as implementation in practice varies between case studies in the dutch flood management system all paradigms are largely integrated from a strategical i e water policies as well as operational viewpoint which has been demonstrated in several policy documents e g dutch water act delta programme as well as innovative projects that provide more room for the river the german case also showed several innovative elements at the constitutional collective choice level but implementation on the ground has only appeared to a limited extent in the hungarian tisza case study transition of flood management towards including the ecosystem based paradigm even seems to have stalled between the constitutional collective choice and operational levels as constant leadership was lacking sendzimir et al 2010 the yangtze case study in china shows a quite incoherent picture as innovative projects and discourses about alternatives as well as engineering mega projects are taking place at the same time nevertheless the ecosystem based paradigm has received a higher relevance in the chinese water policy and management practice due to the experience of major floods that showed the limitations of the flood control paradigm the case study analyses show consistent results with regard to the direct or indirect impacts of management paradigms on ess and their trade offs and synergies thus the flood control paradigm mainly supports provisioning ess in all case studies including transportation possibilities for intensive agriculture cooling water for industries fishing freshwater and hydro power however this paradigm has also caused several trade offs between provisioning and regulating ess such as habitat services soil fertility water flow regulation micro climate regulation in addition the aesthetic value of the river landscape can be impacted due to massive infrastructure and intensive agriculture the construction of the three gorges dam demonstrates the huge impact of the control paradigm on the flow regime the water chemistry riverine ecosystems and even broader socio economic developments potential trade offs between provisioning ess were revealed in the case study research as well while the control paradigm supports the industrial usage of provisioning ess e g intensive agriculture more extensive forms of production such as near natural forests or medicinal plants can be negatively affected nevertheless the control paradigm also supports synergies namely between provisioning and cultural ess such as tourism as an example long stretches of river dikes support transportation and tourism in the form of bicycle paths along the river case study results also consistently show that the ecosystem based paradigm supports regulating ess such as habitat services soil fertility water flow regulation and climate regulation trade offs mainly relate to the industrialized utilization of provisioning ess that are predominantly supported by the control paradigm nevertheless the ecosystem based paradigm is also compatible with provisioning ess but balances them with other service categories thus extensive forms of agricultural production that utilize flood resistant crops as well as natural tourism are still supported by an ecosystem based paradigm the case studies showed several opportunities to implement the ecosystem based paradigm such as the dutch room for the rivers program that includes measures such as lowering floodplains and groins dike replacement and excavating secondary channels amongst others another example is the programme living rhine river of thousand islands in germany which achieved synergies between provisioning ess such as shipping transportation and agricultural production schemes and regulating ess such as an improvement of habitat structures across all case studies the stakeholder involvement paradigm showed an increasing significance the inclusion of stakeholders emerged through bottom up initiatives as a reaction to infrastructure projects e g closing of the scheldt estuary in the dutch case study legislative demands e g the european water framework directive and floods directive or requirements of international projects e g wwf project in china the level of involvement in flood management varies between information consultation and active participation of the public there are examples of participatory processes that included horizontal integration by involving stakeholders from different sectors but the same spatial level e g cooperation between water managers and ministers at the state level to coordinate flood protection in germany while other processes included stakeholders from different spatial levels and thus supported vertical integration e g redesign of the new vásárhelyi plan in hungary the influence of the stakeholder involvement paradigm on ess trade offs and synergies mainly depends upon participating stakeholders and their level of involvement 5 discussion a general barrier towards implementing an integrated approach at the operational level might be organizational and institutional routines including human behaviour another contributing factor for the gap between strategic and operational flood management could be the fact that major flood events in our case studies occurred more than ten to almost twenty years ago in contrast to the dutch case study where flooding has always been high on the political agenda due to the particular exposure of the country the social memory in the other cases might have diminished with respect to the urgency for implementing alternatives each case study shows signs of flood management developing in the direction of such an integrated approach that utilizes a diverse set of paradigms and ess tailored to respective regional conditions even though the development of each case has its particular characteristics we could identify a five step pathway towards integrated flood management in the first step awareness for limitations of the control paradigm were experienced in all case studies through major flood events and failure of flood defence infrastructure the highest pressure to act can be identified in the netherlands due its particular exposure to riverine and storm surges in the second step bottom up pressures emerged due to stakeholder frustration about the limitations of the conventional control paradigm and its huge impact on riverine ecosystems these stakeholder initiatives promote more ecosystem based approaches and opportunities for participation in flood management e g opposition against the closing of the scheldt estuary in the netherlands in the third step top down pressures joined these bottom up initiatives through policy changes at the strategic level which were related to national flood policies or international legislation in the european cases the water framework and floods directives have had a major influence in promoting ecosystem based and participatory approaches in addition international working groups e g the german dutch working group on floods can also support integrated flood management in the fourth step innovative flood management approaches have been tested in pilot projects such as the rhine action program in germany or the room for the river program in the netherlands international organizations such as the wwf can have an important role in the experimentation with new ideas as it has been the case in china i e partnership for a living yangtze in the fifth step an integrated approach towards flood management should be mainstreamed at the strategic and operational level based upon experiences from pilot projects this process usually requires a longer period of time as new institutions and capacities need to be developed we suggest that future research has a closer look at action situations that integrate all three of the management paradigms in order to understand coordination mechanisms between paradigms in more detail instead of a temporal analysis to analyse the evolution of paradigms a structural institutional analysis can specify how a flood management regime functions at a specific point in time cf halbe et al 2013 such an analysis can identify social interaction contexts i e action situations and critical system elements i e institutions knowledge operational outcomes that foster a synergetic application of paradigms and minimizes trade offs between ess in addition the step from the inclusion of alternative paradigms and ess in policy documents at the strategic level towards its operationalization requires further research to identify suitable measures that allow for an efficient and effective application in practice thus the existence of all paradigms does not imply an effective flood management practice per se see roth et al 2017 instead fostering synergies and avoiding conflicts between paradigms in specific regional contexts requires iterative improvement of policies and management practice 6 conclusions in this paper we presented a qualitative research perspective on how flood management paradigms evolved in four case studies and how ess are influenced by these developments we found that the control paradigm increases trade offs between ess by mainly supporting the intensive usage of provisioning ess that people obtain from river landscapes such as using the floodplains for crop cultivation the ecosystem based paradigm fosters synergies between ess by supporting multiple ess such as regulating e g habitat services provisioning e g flood resistant crops and cultural social ess e g tourism the stakeholder involvement paradigm is important to balance the interests of various people in planning and decision processes but may have an ambiguous influence on ess depending on participating stakeholders and the design of the process the specific manifestation of trade offs and synergies arising from management choices always depends on respective regional conditions following tompkins and adger 2004 adaptation to climate extremes such as floods is rooted in case individual culture and traditions hence instead of presenting a blueprint for flood management the results highlight the different strengths and limitations of flood management paradigms in relation to ess all cases show a general trend from a flood control paradigm towards a more integrated approach that also considers ecosystem based solutions and stronger participation of stakeholders as floods are likely to increase in the future new strategies and solutions are necessary to deal with uncertainties and risks against the background of these future development trends and experiences from the past a general conclusion about the superiority of a single flood management paradigm cannot be drawn instead our findings support a more differentiated approach in which the application of a flood management paradigm or a combination of paradigms is adapted to the specific topographical social economic and ecological conditions acknowledgements this

7430,the utilization of ecosystem services in flood management is challenged by the complexity of human nature interactions and practical implementation barriers towards more ecosystem based solutions such as riverine urban areas or technical infrastructure this paper analyses how flood management has dealt with trade offs between ecosystem services and practical constrains towards more ecosystem based solutions to this end we study the evolution of flood management in four case studies in the dutch and german rhine the hungarian tisza and the chinese yangtze basins during the last decades focusing on the development and implementation of institutions and their link to ecosystem services the complexity of human nature interactions is addressed by exploring the impacts on ecosystem services through the lens of three management paradigms 1 the control paradigm 2 the ecosystem based paradigm and 3 the stakeholder involvement paradigm case study data from expert interviews and a literature search were structured using a database approach prior to qualitative interpretation results show the growing importance of the ecosystem based and stakeholder involvement paradigms which has led to the consideration of a range of regulating and cultural ecosystem services that had previously been neglected we detected a trend in flood management practice towards the combination of the different paradigms under the umbrella of integrated flood management which aims at finding the most suitable solution depending on the respective regional conditions keywords flood management ecosystem services paradigms institutional analysis 1 introduction in recent years the limitations of engineering approaches controlling rivers through technical measures e g dams and reservoirs dikes and bypass channels became more obvious for example due to the adverse environmental effects associated with large scale infrastructure pahl wostl et al 2013 alternative approaches have been developed utilizing the natural retention capacity of river floodplains thorpe et al 2010 and including stakeholders through participatory and collaborative processes pahl wostl et al 2013 alternative flood management approaches can face substantial barriers in practice though most rivers such as the rhine tisza and yangtze have been strongly modified through human interventions which put constrains on the partial restoration of the original river landscape basically this can be related to the lack of space e g in urban areas and competition over land uses instead of following a pure structural engineering floodplain restoration or participatory approach flood management has to deal with the topographical social economic and ecological circumstances of individual cases in this context the concept of ecosystem services ess plays a beneficial role in incorporating alternative flood management approaches for several reasons first ess demonstrate the value of river floodplains for flood protection at the local and regional levels barbedo et al 2014 second ess facilitate transparency in the decision making process supporting consensus and trust building among stakeholders bryan et al 2010 and third ess reveal trade offs and allow for the identification of synergies rodríguez et al 2006 while significant progress has been made in the conceptualization and modelling of trade offs and synergies between ess bennett et al 2009 little is known about their management in practice we utilize the concept of management paradigms to untangle the effects of different flood management approaches on ecosystem services management paradigms characterize the underlying rationale of flood management consisting of i a particular system perspective e g main water course of a river or floodplain ii preferred solution strategies e g building dikes or retention areas and iii the way how to deal with risk and uncertainty e g uncertainty reduction or acceptance halbe et al 2013 here we focus on three paradigms the control paradigm the ecosystem based paradigm and the stakeholder involvement paradigm table 1 to explore and understand shifts in flood management paradigms one needs to analyse several years or decades of flood management the research questions addressed in this study are what are the direct or indirect impacts of management paradigms on ess and their trade offs and synergies and how can flood management deal with practical constraints in the implementation of ecosystem based solutions in answering these questions we make a distinction between effects of management paradigms on flood management institutions e g change in the management of ess due to new legislation and actual effects on ess through the operative implementation of institutions e g shift from intensive to extensive farming practices the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section two introduces the concepts of ess and management paradigms as well as requirements for an integrated flood management approach section three presents the methodology to understand identify and analyse paradigm changes and their effect on ecosystem services case studies and the findings are outlined in section four which is followed by a discussion in section five there we identify five steps towards integrated flood management that balances trade offs and fosters synergies between ess the paper closes with conclusions and possible directions for future work 2 theoretical and conceptual research design 2 1 ecosystem services in the context of flood management there is widespread recognition that river landscapes provide a range of ess which can be defined as quantifiable or qualitative benefits of ecosystem functioning to the overall environment including the products services and other benefits humans receive from natural regulated or otherwise perturbed ecosystems thorpe et al 2010 p 67 ess can be grouped into three broad categories i provisioning e g food and timber ii regulating e g nutrient cycling and water flow regulation and iii cultural and social ess e g recreational activities ma 2005 in degraded river landscapes many ess e g primary production nutrient and water cycling are negatively affected in particular regulating ess such as biodiversity and habitat have been diminished to increase provisioning ess such as food production and transportation ecosystem management can reduce such trade offs by fostering synergies between multiple ess and thereby harmonizing the multi functionality of river landscapes raudsepp hearne et al 2010 most flood prone areas are nowadays characterized by structural flood protection measures such as dikes and dams which are often associated with detrimental effects on ess e g decreased habitat connectivity water flow regulation constitutes a particularly important ess for flood management as it addresses the ecosystem s capacity to prevent and mitigate flood hazards following heavy precipitation events by reducing the runoff fraction stürck et al 2014 the growing emphasis on the relevance of water flow regulation for flood prevention is extensively discussed as an ecosystem based flood management measure in the literature barbedo et al 2014 a major challenge of implementing such an ecosystem based approach is the prevalence of a command and control paradigm see section 2 2 in natural resources management in general and flood management in particular that focuses on technical solutions holling and meffe 1996 sendzimir et al 2010 halbe et al 2013 2 2 management paradigms the history of flood management is characterized by the goal to mitigate and control flood risks that were formerly predetermined by the flow regime and fluvial morphology khatibi 2011 however flood disasters in the past have repeatedly revealed negative side effects of an engineering approach solely relying on technical flood protection measures for instance the reduction of the natural retention capacities of floodplains through the construction of dikes can ultimately result in higher water levels and velocities sendzimir et al 2010 dikes also facilitate the spreading of agricultural and residential areas into the floodplain leading to higher potential damages in case of floods as a response alternative flood management approaches have been developed that stress the importance of the natural retention capacities of floodplains and the involvement of stakeholders a more ecosystem based approach has been promoted since the 1990s that urges for a shift from defensive action against hazards to management of the risk khatibi 2011 and living with floods sendzimir et al 2010 furthermore as floods pose a direct threat to property economic activity and human life management must raise awareness and receive the support of stakeholders to implement flood management measures participatory and collaborative approaches aim to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of flood risk management by involving stakeholders in planning and decision making challi et al 2016 management paradigms sort the various goals measures and instruments of natural resources management approaches into a coherent whole and thus support a systematic analysis of human nature interactions management paradigms are defined as a set of basic assumptions about the nature of the system to be managed the goals of managing the system and the ways in which these goals can be achieved pahl wostl et al 2011 p 840 the concept of management paradigms provides an encompassing picture on different solution strategies in flood management e g technical or ecosystem based approaches by addressing the chosen system perspective and the approach to risk and uncertainty see halbe et al 2013 table 1 lists these different characteristics for each of the paradigms under investigation 2 3 integrated flood management there is a lack of research on the interplay of different management paradigms in specific case studies instead publications often highlight the strength of a single paradigm and limitations of others e g sultana et al 2008 however each paradigm has strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered for an effective flood management thus a control paradigm allows a diverse usage of diked floodplains for economic activities such as agriculture and industrial settlements but can also give a false sense of security and increase potential damage from flooding sendzimir et al 2010 viglione et al 2014 the ecosystem based paradigm supports ecological processes and functions within the river landscape rouquette et al 2011 but requires space and land uses that allow for temporary flooding which is limited in urban industrial and intensive agricultural areas stakeholder involvement can provide a greater legitimacy of planning processes newig et al 2016 but its success depends upon various factors such as facilitation skills stakeholder selection and institutional embedment cf roth et al 2017 an integrated flood management approach facilitates a tailored application of paradigms based upon topographical social economic and ecological circumstances this includes that trade offs and synergies between ess are explicitly considered as well as the strengths and limitations of each paradigm fig 1 depicts the conceptual linkages between management paradigms river landscape ess and trade offs and synergies thus flood management is guided by paradigms which are interpreted as cultural cognitive institutions halbe et al 2013 flood management shapes the river landscape through operational measures e g renaturation of retention areas or heightening of dikes which follow the development and implementation of institutions e g development of area development plans or more indirectly through the production and dissemination of knowledge e g hydrological studies that inform the design of stream works or awareness campaigns that influence the behavior of stakeholders changes in the river landscape have an effect on ess and their trade offs and synergies which can be induced in a purposeful or unconscious way a purposeful balance of ess requires that ess are explicitly considered in flood management institutions such as policies regulations and guidelines the effects of flood management on ess trade offs and synergies can finally influence the choice for a specific management paradigm thus persistent issues are expected to induce a reflection on the currently held paradigm and eventually experimentation with alternatives 3 methodological and analytical approach we applied a case study research method to better understand the evolution of management paradigms in specific case studies and their link to ess more specifically we investigated how flood management processes evolved in the last decades and how they influenced the management of ess in four cases the areas of the rhine basin in north rhine westphalia nrw germany and the netherlands the hungarian part of the tisza basin and the yangtze basin in china we preferred qualitative research because it allows taking into account the peculiarities of each case study which is important for analysing the management of ess in a specific regional context 3 1 data collection first we conducted a literature review including scientific articles policy reports and legal requirements related to water flood and environmental management relevant to the four case studies the literature review was conducted to i summarize the dominant management paradigm as well as development trajectories at different spatial levels to ii assess how institutions e g policies and legal requirements consider and support ess and to iii identify as far as possible whether the implementation of these institutions impacting the state of ess in the river landscape the latter is difficult to identify due to mismatches between ecological and political scales as well as the time lag between a cause management action and its resulting change alteration in ess while the literature review gave general insight into policy measures and management trajectories expert interviews provided more specific insights on flood management processes and ess to conduct expert interviews the case study areas in germany seven interviews the netherlands seven interviews and hungary eighteen interviews were visited in the period from summer 2014 to autumn 2015 the exploration of the chinese case was conducted without a case study visit nevertheless we include the chinese case as its high level of flood risk and its engineering mega projects make it interesting for comparison the findings of the chinese case are based on a literature review and were afterwards reviewed by two chinese flood management experts for each of the three other case studies semi structured interviews were carried out the selection of experts was based upon their involvement and knowledge regarding flood management and ess in order to elicit different perspectives we interviewed experts with different professional backgrounds politics and administration consulting agriculture nature conservation and research the duration of each interview varied between 60 and 90 min and addressed the topics of a integrated water resources and flood management b barriers towards more ecosystem based solutions and c major future challenges to the institutionalization of integrated flood risk management 3 2 data analyses case study data were structured and analysed according to the management and transition framework mtf pahl wostl et al 2010 pahl wostl 2015 the mtf is an interdisciplinary framework to analyse complex water management processes based upon the theoretical concepts related to water governance and management social learning processes and overall system transformation processes pahl wostl 2015 to operationalize the mtf and to facilitate case study analyses we made use of a relational database knüppe and knieper 2016 knieper et al 2010 the mtf database allows to structure flood management processes which are represented as a network of action situations as for each of the four cases the concept of as was originally developed by ostrom 2005 and describes a structured social interaction that leads to identifiable outcomes pahl wostl 2015 action situations can take place at different spatial levels e g national regional and involve various actors which can be individuals or collectives e g water authorities organized interest groups companies action situations are connected to each other through outcome s that are produced in an as and influence other as an outcome can be 1 an institution e g water acts 2 knowledge i e meaningful information and experience or 3 an operational outcome referring to concrete physical measurable effects e g improvement of water quality land use changes the linkages between as and outcomes allow to derive statements about the management implications linked to ess for example farmers decide to change cultivation practices as and thereby increase soil quality operational outcome this in turn can have a positive impact on water flow regulation ess the characteristics of management paradigms in table 1 are used as a coding scheme to link one or several paradigms to each as thus each outcome of an action situation i e institution knowledge or operational outcome is examined with respect to its underlying system perspective solution strategy and risk and uncertainty management approach thereby the different kinds of outcomes allow identifying paradigm shifts occurring in the evolution of flood management this allows highlighting dominant paradigm s as well as a potential shift over a certain period of time in the last step of the analysis we sort as according to their institutional level cf iad framework ostrom 2005 which can be the operational level i e activities that affect the world directly such as building of a reservoir or land use changes collective choice level i e decision makers create rules to impact operational level activities such as rules how to allocate water to different uses and constitutional level decision makers introduce collective choice bodies such as a basin commission or water user association or determine how collective choice participants will be selected and formal relationships among members of the collective choice body 4 results 4 1 case studies fig 2 shows a map for each of the four case studies the cases have in common that they face a high level of flood exposure their river flow regimes and floodplains are influenced by large scale engineering interventions and high competition among land uses is likely to further increase in the future for a consistent presentation the results for each case are structured in the following order a general case study description and b evolution of management paradigms and effects on ess trade offs and synergies as the collected case study information is very comprehensive we refer to the supplemental material for detailed information tables 1a 4a which shows for each case study the respective network of as the outcomes influencing as and produced by as the management paradigms and institutional level assigned to as as well as a short description of main impacts of management changes to facilitate the reading flow and allow for easy navigation of the supplemental material we use a coding system referring to the individual as of the four case studies 4 1 1 rhine basin in north rhine westphalia germany 4 1 1 1 case study description the rhine is a central european river which originates in the swiss alps and enters the north sea after a total length of 1233 km icpr 2015 in the german federal state of north rhine westphalia nrw the rhine basin covers an area of 21 025 km2 with about 13 million inhabitants icpr 2015 this densely populated area it is one of the most economically important regions in germany comprising the ruhr area as well as major cities along the lower rhine such as cologne dusseldorf and germany s former capital bonn in germany flood management policies and management plans are shaped at the federal state bundesland level in nrw the main authority responsible for flood management is the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture nature and consumer protection north rhine westphalia s water and flood legislation remains subordinated under federal and european law at the local level flood management is assigned to municipalities as well as water and dike boards thomas and knüppe 2016 the rhine and its floodplains in nrw have been strongly modified sänger and schrickel 2010 due to the traditional dominance of large scale engineering interventions in water and flood management 4 1 2 management paradigms and ess the control paradigm has resulted in the modification of the rhine for the benefit of provisioning ess in nrw since the 16th and 17th century functional wetlands in the former floodplains were reduced by 80 and today 70 of the main course of the rhine is diked sänger and schrickel 2010 for nrw and bordering federal states and countries the transportation of goods intensive agricultural activities in the floodplains and the industrial sector using rhine water for cooling processes are of significant economic importance technical measures were often favoured by flood managers farmers and industries in the last centuries to secure the supply of provisioning ess mentioned above this means that the construction of dikes and reclamation of agricultural land in former floodplains diminished multiple regulating ess such as water flow regulation and habitat biodiversity for instance the lateral migration of fish was significantly reduced or lost in approximately 70 of the nrw s portion of the rhine thomas and knüppe 2016 major flood events along the rhine in 1993 and 1995 and along the elbe river in 2002 triggered a modification of flood management in germany pahl wostl et al 2013 the network of as for the rhine basin in nrw indicates an increasing trend towards the ecosystem based paradigm see e g nrw 01 04 nrw 07 10 table 1a however one has to be careful with the interpretation of this finding as most as are only part of strategic flood management processes this includes the development of the blue guideline aiming at the protection and near natural development of rivers streams and floodplains the rhine action plan on flood defence or european and national institutions e g eu floods directive federal flood protection act effects on the ground are still modest given a long history of building technical structures for flood protection which has resulted in a river landscape that leaves little space for natural inundation and associated ess in the densely populated region for example only 2 4 of additional natural retention areas were restored in nrw since 1990 bfn 2014 hence statements about measurable impacts of the ecosystem based paradigm on the state of ess can only be made to a limited extent one example is the implementation of the rhine action programme implemented from 1987 to 2000 which has had a positive impact on the hydrological biological and morphological conditions of the rhine and its landscape through a number of measures such as the extensification of farming practices in certain areas and the improvement of structural diversity of the river and floodplains nrw 02 table 1a notably habitat connectivity and the ecological patency up and downstream migration of the rhine from lake constance to the north sea improved icpr 2015 this in turn fostered synergies between regulating services e g floodplain restoration supporting water flow regulation and natural flood mitigation recovery of endangered species provisioning ess e g fishing and cultural social ess e g attractiveness for leisure and touristic activities the stakeholder involvement paradigm made local and regional knowledge about ess utilizable this kind of knowledge was used during consensus finding processes like the agreement to coordinate flood protection across federal states nrw 04 table 1a legislation process of eu water framework directive nrw 07 table 1a and establishment of the german dutch working group on floods nrw 08 table 1a these as are basically shaped by governmental actors water authorities at higher management levels to better coordinate strategic flood management the implementation of the project living rhine river of thousand islands nrw 10 table 1a is characterized by multiple actors though both governmental and non governmental from higher and lower management levels nabu 2010 multiple measurable impacts of these collaborative processes on regulating services were identified e g natural water flow regulation habitat structures and recovery of endangered fish species 4 1 3 rhine basin in the netherlands 4 1 3 1 case study description the dutch part of the rhine basin is home to about 12 million inhabitants and covers an area of 25 390 km2 icpr 2015 here the main river splits into several streams that drain into the north sea major dutch cities such as amsterdam rotterdam the hague and utrecht are located in this area since 60 of the dutch area is vulnerable to floods from rivers the sea or lakes flood protection is a significant societal task in the netherlands delta programme commissioner 2014 the large population in the dutch rhine basin and its highly advanced economy imply considerable pressure on the river as well as numerous stakeholders with diverse interests in the netherlands water management primarily resides at the national level in close interaction with regional provincial and municipal levels oecd 2014 the national ministry of infrastructure and environment is responsible for the development of national policies and the coordination with other policy arenas such as spatial planning land use environment and agriculture rijkswaterstaat a national water authority is an executive body of the ministry of infrastructure and environment and responsible for the design construction management and maintenance of main infrastructure facilities provinces supervise regional water authorities and are responsible for integrated spatial and environmental planning and groundwater regulation regional water authorities deal with the operative management of regional water systems including flood defence as well as water quality and quantity management finally municipalities perform several tasks and public services such as urban drainage and stormwater collection oecd 2014 4 1 3 2 management paradigms and ess after the devastating flood in 1953 the delta plan was designed that based upon a structural engineering approach including dike extensions and dam construction projects nl 01 table 2a besides improving flood protection further benefits related to provisioning ess such as fishing agriculture and transport as well as cultural social services such as recreation were sought in the 1970s the plan to construct a further impervious dam that completely blocks the scheldt estuary from the inflow of brackish water was opposed by the public which exemplifies a changing public opinion towards more environmental values nl 02 table 2a a compromise was found by building a pervious dam with gates that can be closed in case of storm surges but stay open at all other times goemans and visser 1987 this technical solution supports provisioning ess through an improved controllability of flooding events as well as regulating services by protecting the original brackish water ecosystem and its biodiversity in the 1980s and early 1990s the dutch water policy shifted towards a more integrated approach that still focuses on flood control but complements it with ecological and participatory elements cf wesselink 2007 de jonge 2009 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 nl 03 04 table 2a however major flooding events in 1993 and 1995 caused a step backwards towards structural engineering with only minimal opportunities for stakeholder participation nl 06 table 2a thus dike reinforcements were accomplished without conducting rigorous environmental impact assessments and stakeholder consultations wiering and drissen 2001 after this immediate response the trend towards a more integrated approach nevertheless continued in the netherlands the room for the river programme was a central process that mainstreamed a floodplain approach through 30 individual projects in the netherlands nl 12 table 2a the programme combined an increase in flood safety with increased spatial quality of landscape nature and culture van herk et al 2015 today an integrated flood management approach is applied that combines the control ecosystem based and stakeholder involvement paradigms and seeks to support multiple ess cf delta programme e g nl 10 nl 14 table 2a the benefits of such an integrated approach are reflected in the diversity of flood management measures which increased the water retention volume in the whole rhine catchment between 1995 and 2010 icpr 2013 due to the fact that the netherlands are densely populated a control paradigm is still widely applied to protect residential and agricultural areas nevertheless the limitations of this paradigm are clearly stated in official policy documents flood management in the netherlands has experimented with various forms of participatory approaches edelenbos et al 2016 roth et al 2017 to involve local knowledge define common goals and assure transparency and democratic decision making slomp 2012 water boards have traditionally played a key role in inclusive water governance by involving organized interest groups e g farmer or business organizations and environmentalists in decision making roth et al 2017 in the past a large number of local water boards around 3500 existed which by today were merged into a lower number of regional water authorities 21 by now in a process of centralization and professionalization toonen et al 2006 besides such a strongly institutionalized involvement of organized interest groups there is a trend towards more open participatory processes facilitated by governmental actors as well as the formation of bottom up action groups to oppose governmental plans e g related to flood defence infrastructure or calamity polders e g roth and warner 2007 warner 2011 roth et al 2017 the case study analysis confirms that the implementation of the stakeholder involvement paradigm includes various forms of stakeholder participation first stakeholder involvement in water management is formally required through stakeholder representation in regional water authorities oecd 2014 as well as participation requirements defined in national and international legislations such as the dutch water policy e g nl 10 table 2a the eu water framework directive nl 07 table 2a and the eu floods directive nl13 table 2a second local stakeholder initiatives can generate an impact on flood infrastructure projects and policies as shown in the example of the opposition against the closing of the scheldt estuary nl 02 table 2a the stakeholder involvement paradigm induces a balancing effect on ess trade offs as can generally be seen in various as that include this paradigm e g nl 02 nl 03 nl 07 nl 10 nl 12 nl 14 table 2a thus all these as address a range of provisioning ess e g food production transportation as well as some form of nature protection which support regulating ess e g biodiversity water quality however the selection of stakeholders clearly influences which ess are particularly addressed in the participatory process for instance opposition towards the closing of the scheldt estuary involved the fishing industry and environmentalists so that fishing as a provisioning ess as well as habitat as a regulating ess were promoted nl 02 table 2a roth et al 2017 highlight that there are still several issues related to participatory water governance in the netherlands though such as the instrumental use of stakeholder participation to legitimize decisions by governmental agencies delay of decision making due to a multitude of interests and unclear responsibilities or the strategic use of public fora by interest groups 4 1 4 tisza basin hungary 4 1 4 1 case study description the tisza river originates in the ukrainian carpathian mountains and drains into the danube in serbia after a total length of 966 km icpdr 2010 with an area of 157 186 km2 the tisza basin is the largest sub basin of the danube and is home to about 14 million inhabitants the tisza basin in hungary has been characterized by the occurrence of severe flood events and by a strong modification of the river and its floodplains through technical interventions to improve flood control and navigation pahl wostl et al 2013 and to gain land for settlements and agriculture sendzimir et al 2010 this led to the loss of natural floodplains and wetlands as well as structural changes of the river morphology pinke 2014 water management in hungary faced profound changes in boundary conditions due to the transition from a communist state with a centrally planned economy to a market based democracy water policies are formulated at the national level the general directorate of water management is a central government body under the direction and supervision of the minister of interior it coordinates flood management as well as agricultural water supply and urban water management ovf 2014 in hungary twelve regional water directorates exist that are responsible for daily operational activities such as the maintenance of the state owned infrastructure e g dams weirs and floodgates 4 1 4 2 management paradigms and ess flood protection in the hungarian tisza basin is organized in a centralized way characterized by large scale flood defence infrastructure solutions sendzimir et al 2010 over centuries the control paradigm allowed for navigation and intensification of agriculture activities and settlements in the floodplains by constructing dikes that cut the wetlands off from the main river pinke 2014 especially provisioning ess such as freshwater for croplands were traded off against a variety of regulating ess in particular the natural flood buffer capacity of the floodplains furthermore cultural social ess were negatively diminished such as aesthetic values including a visual diversity of the landscape but also other provisioning ess were degraded due to the grain monoculture development e g raw materials such as timber reed sallow harvest medical resources such as medicinal plants petz et al 2012 poor environmental conditions of the river and its floodplains as well as major floods during the 1990s and 2000s led to strategic changes in flood management at international national and sub basin levels since the 1990s the ecosystem based as well as the stakeholder involvement paradigms have received more attention in the hungarian tisza basin the as development of the danube river protection convention legislation process of the european water framework directive and floods directive and implementation of unpd gef tisza project are some examples of how ess are strategically incorporated in flood management hu 01 02 07 08 table 3a the aim of these as has been to reverse the degradation of the tisza s floodplains e g water flow regulation habitat and climate regulation while meeting the inhabitant s increasing demand for provisioning ess water for irrigation and possibilities for shipping derts and koncsos 2012 found that the flood levels of the tisza could be mitigated by approximately one meter if operative measures like deep floodplain reservoirs were used furthermore national institutions such as the new vásárhelyi plan aimed at the restoration of the multi functional land uses acknowledging that flood protection and nature conservation can benefit from the reintroduction and utilization of natural floodplains hu 03 table 3a werners et al 2010 highlighted that the implementation of the new vásárhelyi plan was delayed due to budgetary problems tensions among different lobbies and unclear property rights hence implications for ess on the ground have not been observed until now albeit a strategic re thinking can be noted in most of the as in table 3a very few non technical measures were implemented such as trainings for water authorities on flood prevention e g hu 07 table 3a the stakeholder involvement paradigm plays a minor role in the tisza basin nevertheless we found that especially at basin and sub basin levels hu 04 and 05 table 3a transboundary and regional cooperation between different stakeholders e g water authorities local communities farmers ngos successfully introduced floodplain rehabilitation into the water policy arena the development of living tisza alliance promoted development and implementation of pilot experiments with floodplain restoration traditional agriculture and tourism sendzimir et al 2010 besides provisioning ess these pilot experiments also consider regulating and cultural social ess 4 1 5 yangtze basin china 4 1 5 1 case study description with 6300 km the yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest in the world yu et al 2009 with more

china s water resource management including surface and ground water river basin management flood control and water and soil conservation the mwr has water bureaus and departments at both the provincial and county levels at the yangtze basin level the changjiang water resources commission a subordinated agency of the mwr is responsible for water administration and law enforcement including amongst others flood control mwr n d 4 1 5 2 management paradigms and ess until the 1990s the network of as indicates a dominance of a flood control paradigm table 4a driven by economic development and a high demand for flood security along the yangtze river technical measures diminished regulating and cultural social ess prc 01 05 table 4a the construction and operation of the three gorges dam prc 04 table 4a diminished fertile farmland and more than 1 13 million people were displaced wilmsen 2016 the dam led to heavy sedimentation in the river channel and connected lakes thereby reducing water storage capacity and water flow regulation gemmer et al 2008 trade offs between technical flood control and almost all other ess occurred habitats for fish birds and mammals decreased micro climate regulation was diminished fertile soils woodlands and villages were flooded algae blooms and malarial mosquitoes emerged as a consequence of reduced water flow and the changing chemical composition of the river which was caused by a shift of land use structures ye at al 2006 only few ess were positively influenced such as the suitability for navigation on the river and the production of hydro power in 1998 a devastating flood in the yangtze basin led to 3600 deaths made 13 2 million people homeless and caused estimated economic losses of 36 billion us ye and glantz 2005 this disaster triggered the awareness of the weaknesses of flood control based on technical measures and the mwr initiated an action programme prc 06 table 4a that included various non structural measures such as the reforestation of uplands change in agricultural practices and resettlement from flood prone areas apart from the construction of the three gorges dam different as indicate the increasing significance of the ecosystem based paradigm both from a strategic and operative point of view the partnership for a living yangtze prc 07 table 4a and the restoring the web of life prc 11 table 4a achieved increasing environmental awareness of stakeholders and also an improvement of multiple ess for example lake and wetland areas were restored supporting habitat ess as well as water flow regulation furthermore to improve rural livelihoods sustainable farming and fishing approaches were implemented in cooperation with the local residents along the yangtze te boekhorst et al 2010 at the national level strategic planning highlights a policy shift towards a re thinking of flood protection and prevention as 06 08 and 13 of less significance to flood management in the yangtze basin is

conservation wwf n d for the implementation of these projects pilot sites were selected to initiate bottom up and co production processes involving local stakeholders governmental water authorities from national and regional level and ngos these programmes achieved synergies between water flow regulation natural flood control habitat diversity and increasing environment friendly farms and fisheries for food production te boekhorst et al 2010 4 2 synthesis fig 3 shows a graphical representation of the dynamics of action situations through time sorted according to their institutional levels in all case studies the evolution of paradigms is not a linear process instead action situations emerge that set impulses by introducing a new paradigm e g nrw 01 nl 03 or combining different sets of paradigms e g hu 01 prc 10 setbacks can be provoked by flooding disasters that may cause a return to conventional flood defence approaches as happened in the netherlands nl 06 in addition the step from developing innovative policies such as the integrated tisza river basin management plan hu 10 towards their implementation in practice hu 11 can also dilute the influence of alternative paradigms all cases show the general trend that new paradigms are introduced at the constitutional collective choice levels and trickle down to the operational level however experimentation with new paradigms did also happen at the operational level even when such paradigms have not yet become evident at the constitutional collective choice levels e g prc 07 for instance the opposition against the closure of the scheldt estuary in the netherlands nl 02 changed the original plan to construct an impermeable dam towards a pervious dam thus a purely flood control approach i e control paradigm was revised towards a more ecosystem based solution that resonated with an increased environmental awareness of citizens in all case studies international pilot projects e g nrw 02 nl 05 prc 11 and hu 07 set impulses for alternative flood management approaches action situations linked to a single paradigm continue to occur after the introduction of a new paradigm however integrative action situations that combine the two alternative paradigms i e ecosystem based and stakeholder participation with the control paradigm turn out to be critical for integrated flood management such integrative action situations were found in the dutch 6 german 3 and hungarian 2 case studies these include european and national policy initiatives as well as the bottom up processes led by action groups despite substantial socio economic differences all cases show a general trend from a flood control paradigm towards a more integrated approach that also considers ecosystem based solutions and stronger participation of stakeholders nevertheless the level of policy coherence as well as implementation in practice varies between case studies in the dutch flood management system all paradigms are largely integrated from a strategical i e water policies as well as operational viewpoint which has been demonstrated in several policy documents e g dutch water act delta programme as well as innovative projects that provide more room for the river the german case also showed several innovative elements at the constitutional collective choice level but implementation on the ground has only appeared to a limited extent in the hungarian tisza case study transition of flood management towards including the ecosystem based paradigm even seems to have stalled between the constitutional collective choice and operational levels as constant leadership was lacking sendzimir et al 2010 the yangtze case study in china shows a quite incoherent picture as innovative projects and discourses about alternatives as well as engineering mega projects are taking place at the same time nevertheless the ecosystem based paradigm has received a higher relevance in the chinese water policy and management practice due to the experience of major floods that showed the limitations of the flood control paradigm the case study analyses show consistent results with regard to the direct or indirect impacts of management paradigms on ess and their trade offs and synergies thus the flood control paradigm mainly supports provisioning ess in all case studies including transportation possibilities for intensive agriculture cooling water for industries fishing freshwater and hydro power however this paradigm has also caused several trade offs between provisioning and regulating ess such as habitat services soil fertility water flow regulation micro climate regulation in addition the aesthetic value of the river landscape can be impacted due to massive infrastructure and intensive agriculture the construction of the three gorges dam demonstrates the huge impact of the control paradigm on the flow regime the water chemistry riverine ecosystems and even broader socio economic developments potential trade offs between provisioning ess were revealed in the case study research as well while the control paradigm supports the industrial usage of provisioning ess e g intensive agriculture more extensive forms of production such as near natural forests or medicinal plants can be negatively affected nevertheless the control paradigm also supports synergies namely between provisioning and cultural ess such as tourism as an example long stretches of river dikes support transportation and tourism in the form of bicycle paths along the river case study results also consistently show that the ecosystem based paradigm supports regulating ess such as habitat services soil fertility water flow regulation and climate regulation trade offs mainly relate to the industrialized utilization of provisioning ess that are predominantly supported by the control paradigm nevertheless the ecosystem based paradigm is also compatible with provisioning ess but balances them with other service categories thus extensive forms of agricultural production that utilize flood resistant crops as well as natural tourism are still supported by an ecosystem based paradigm the case studies showed several opportunities to implement the ecosystem based paradigm such as the dutch room for the rivers program that includes measures such as lowering floodplains and groins dike replacement and excavating secondary channels amongst others another example is the programme living rhine river of thousand islands in germany which achieved synergies between provisioning ess such as shipping transportation and agricultural production schemes and regulating ess such as an improvement of habitat structures across all case studies the stakeholder involvement paradigm showed an increasing significance the inclusion of stakeholders emerged through bottom up initiatives as a reaction to infrastructure projects e g closing of the scheldt estuary in the dutch case study legislative demands e g the european water framework directive and floods directive or requirements of international projects e g wwf project in china the level of involvement in flood management varies between information consultation and active participation of the public there are examples of participatory processes that included horizontal integration by involving stakeholders from different sectors but the same spatial level e g cooperation between water managers and ministers at the state level to coordinate flood protection in germany while other processes included stakeholders from different spatial levels and thus supported vertical integration e g redesign of the new vásárhelyi plan in hungary the influence of the stakeholder involvement paradigm on ess trade offs and synergies mainly depends upon participating stakeholders and their level of involvement 5 discussion a general barrier towards implementing an integrated approach at the operational level might be organizational and institutional routines including human behaviour another contributing factor for the gap between strategic and operational flood management could be the fact that major flood events in our case studies occurred more than ten to almost twenty years ago in contrast to the dutch case study where flooding has always been high on the political agenda due to the particular exposure of the country the social memory in the other cases might have diminished with respect to the urgency for implementing alternatives each case study shows signs of flood management developing in the direction of such an integrated approach that utilizes a diverse set of paradigms and ess tailored to respective regional conditions even though the development of each case has its particular characteristics we could identify a five step pathway towards integrated flood management in the first step awareness for limitations of the control paradigm were experienced in all case studies through major flood events and failure of flood defence infrastructure the highest pressure to act can be identified in the netherlands due its particular exposure to riverine and storm surges in the second step bottom up pressures emerged due to stakeholder frustration about the limitations of the conventional control paradigm and its huge impact on riverine ecosystems these stakeholder initiatives promote more ecosystem based approaches and opportunities for participation in flood management e g opposition against the closing of the scheldt estuary in the netherlands in the third step top down pressures joined these bottom up initiatives through policy changes at the strategic level which were related to national flood policies or international legislation in the european cases the water framework and floods directives have had a major influence in promoting ecosystem based and participatory approaches in addition international working groups e g the german dutch working group on floods can also support integrated flood management in the fourth step innovative flood management approaches have been tested in pilot projects such as the rhine action program in germany or the room for the river program in the netherlands international organizations such as the wwf can have an important role in the experimentation with new ideas as it has been the case in china i e partnership for a living yangtze in the fifth step an integrated approach towards flood management should be mainstreamed at the strategic and operational level based upon experiences from pilot projects this process usually requires a longer period of time as new institutions and capacities need to be developed we suggest that future research has a closer look at action situations that integrate all three of the management paradigms in order to understand coordination mechanisms between paradigms in more detail instead of a temporal analysis to analyse the evolution of paradigms a structural institutional analysis can specify how a flood management regime functions at a specific point in time cf halbe et al 2013 such an analysis can identify social interaction contexts i e action situations and critical system elements i e institutions knowledge operational outcomes that foster a synergetic application of paradigms and minimizes trade offs between ess in addition the step from the inclusion of alternative paradigms and ess in policy documents at the strategic level towards its operationalization requires further research to identify suitable measures that allow for an efficient and effective application in practice thus the existence of all paradigms does not imply an effective flood management practice per se see roth et al 2017 instead fostering synergies and avoiding conflicts between paradigms in specific regional contexts requires iterative improvement of policies and management practice 6 conclusions in this paper we presented a qualitative research perspective on how flood management paradigms evolved in four case studies and how ess are influenced by these developments we found that the control paradigm increases trade offs between ess by mainly supporting the intensive usage of provisioning ess that people obtain from river landscapes such as using the floodplains for crop cultivation the ecosystem based paradigm fosters synergies between ess by supporting multiple ess such as regulating e g habitat services provisioning e g flood resistant crops and cultural social ess e g tourism the stakeholder involvement paradigm is important to balance the interests of various people in planning and decision processes but may have an ambiguous influence on ess depending on participating stakeholders and the design of the process the specific manifestation of trade offs and synergies arising from management choices always depends on respective regional conditions following tompkins and adger 2004 adaptation to climate extremes such as floods is rooted in case individual culture and traditions hence instead of presenting a blueprint for flood management the results highlight the different strengths and limitations of flood management paradigms in relation to ess all cases show a general trend from a flood control paradigm towards a more integrated approach that also considers ecosystem based solutions and stronger participation of stakeholders as floods are likely to increase in the future new strategies and solutions are necessary to deal with uncertainties and risks against the background of these future development trends and experiences from the past a general conclusion about the superiority of a single flood management paradigm cannot be drawn instead our findings support a more differentiated approach in which the application of a flood management paradigm or a combination of paradigms is adapted to the specific topographical social economic and ecological conditions acknowledgements this

7431,due to increasing population worldwide there is an urgent need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability the major innovative design of this study is to provide a practical assessment process for groundwater discharge under a regional demand by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers overlain on a mesozoic granitic gneiss basement which involves the important groundwater system in the kinmen region taiwan roc and the assessment of adoptable groundwater discharge in aquifer is needed the storage coefficient presents an order of one in a thousand and hydraulic conductivity is approximately at the order of 1 8 m d and 0 4 0 9 m d for aquifer and aquitard respectively groundwater discharge and admissible number of pumping well is suggested considering scheduled maximum groundwater volume and head decline change for eastern and western studied area respectively the safety subjected to the conservative issue is then addressed by the use of scheduled maximum groundwater volume it reveals that the safety can be ensured using the indicator as scheduled maximum groundwater volume with predefined scenarios the result can be utilized practically for developing management strategy of groundwater resources due to the applicability and novel of method keywords groundwater water resources leaky aquifer storage coefficient 1 introduction groundwater is a beneficial subsurface water resource it has several substantially favorable qualities relative to surface water resources from the viewpoint of increasing population worldwide there is an indispensable need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability groundwater storage and production processes are complex due to the nature effective assessment plays a pivotal role in design and managing groundwater resources systems kinmen or quemoy officially kinmen county fig 1 governed by the republic of china roc which is located off the southeastern coast of mainland china including the main island great kinmen and several surrounding islets it is an eroded residual island covered by quaternary clastic deposits and has a basement of mesozoic and early cretaceous granitic gneiss it was connected with the asian continent in the geologic past and was then separated by sea erosion and crustal uplift precipitation is the major input to the hydrologic cycle and rainfall is low in this area from historical records approximate mean annual precipitation and potential evaporation are 1047 mm and 1687 mm respectively at present groundwater contributes 53 of the total water usage on the island and total groundwater quantity comes from 17 of the effective rainfall therefore estimation of groundwater budget is very important for the island that it evaluates hydraulic properties such as storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer accompanying leaky factor in the aquitard is in an urgent need and can be used to provide important input of design for water resources development two regional administrative areas eastern and western kinmen are chosen as the demonstration of groundwater resources assessment potential groundwater volume in maximum were estimated and scheduled as 1 6487 106 m3 and 6 2164 106 m3 annually by kinmen county government the primary purpose of this study is to provide a novel and practical assessment for aquifer discharge under regional groundwater demand safety issue is then demonstrated by the ratio of groundwater discharge to maximum scheduled volume and suitable groundwater well number respectively moreover it determines as accurately as possible the most representative values of the relevant hydraulic properties of the aquifer at site prior knowledge of aquifer parameters is indispensable for successful evaluation and management of vital groundwater resources hydraulic character of aquifers such as transmissivity storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity or the other are estimated substantially that to evaluate aquifer type at testing sites and to analyze those parameters for the studied groundwater system is then addressed for the assessment purpose a real case subjected to practical assessment for groundwater discharge under regional demand is well developed to evaluate the type and hydraulic characteristics of aquifers in the studied area conducting aquifer tests derived by the professional method has been performed the analysis is accomplished through use of an analytical model with the drawdown of water levels in the vicinity of a pumped well 2 description of the studied area the studied area is in main island of kinmen for the position of 118 12 e to 118 30 e and 24 22 n to 24 32 n fig 1 it is about 18 km long in the east west direction and has a maximum width of 10 km in the north south direction the neck of the island is 3 5 km wide the area of the island including surrounding islets is about 136 km2 the administrative area for eastern and western kinmen covers about 82 688 km2 and 51 562 km2 respectively the representative sites located eastern and western kinmen are at potsun km mw010 and chinting km mw002 respectively both wells are screened in the leaky confined aquifer table 1 the horizontal aquifer producing groundwater from these wells occurs above the impermeable basement of mesozoic and early cretaceous taiwushan granitic gneiss and is overlain by a leaky aquitard fig 2 the aquifer occurs in the period between neogene and quaternary outcrop of granitic gneiss is about 50 of the total area of kinmen 3 method time drawdown aquifer test data are analyzed by using the nonlinear analytical models such as theis model corrected theis model hantush model neuman model and others depending on the type of aquifer in which the test is suitable the analysis is often performed by the graphical method so called type curve matching which is deemed to be a standard method for estimating aquifer parameters in the real world leaky confined aquifers are commonly encountered in the subsurface hydrological systems characterization of the hydrogeology of leaky confined aquifers can be accomplished with traditional aquifer test methods and analysis models for a confined aquifer the theis model 1935 utilizes the assumption that the aquifer is perfectly confined that is the overlying or underlying confining layer of aquifer is truly impermeable depending on the magnitude of hydraulic gradients around the well the leakage rates from the confining layer may be significantly less than water extraction from or injection to the aquifer hantush and jacob 1955 extended the theis model for conditions in which there is significant leakage to the aquifer from an overlying or underlying less permeable formation the governing equation for radial flow in an elastic confined aquifer with leakage condition for the conceptual model shown in fig 2 has been derived by jacob 1946 and bear 1979 1 2 s r 2 1 r s r k tb s s t s t where s drawdown in aquifer test r distance from pumping well to the observed well s

expressed in the form 3 2 s r 2 1 r s r s b 2 s t s t also defining the leakance or leakage coefficient as 4 k b t b 2 its numerical values are usually given as a measure of leakage rates the initial and boundary condition for drawdown are respectively 5 s r 0 0 for all r and 6 s t 0 for all t the condition for the discharge rate is 7 q 0 for t 0 q constant 0 for t 0 the constant discharge rate for the drawdown at the well is 8 lim r 0 r r s q 2 π t eq 7 states that the discharge of the well is constant throughout the pumping period while eq 8 indicates that the flow rate towards the well is identical to its discharge hantush and jacob 1955 presented the solution of such a system described for eqs 1 8 9 s r t q 4 π t u 1 y exp y r 2 4 b 2 y dy where 10 u r 2 s 4 tt for the case b in eq 9 the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer k is very small and the second term in the exponential term approaches zero in this case eq 9 becomes equivalent to the theis equation b is a function of the aquifer transmissivity t thickness of the confining layer b and the hydraulic conductivity k the ratio r b is a parameter representing the characteristics of the leaky aquifer y is an integration variable in the integrand eq 9 can also be written as 11 s r t q 4 π t w u r b and 12 w u β q 4 π t u 1 y exp y β 2 4 y dy where 13 β r b w u β is known as hantush and jacob well function for leaky aquifers the values of w u β for different values of u and β r b were presented by hantush 1956 1961 1964 a plot of w u versus 1 u for different values of β is shown in fig 3 by considering eqs 10 and 11 type curves matching can be used to find r b and analyze s and t therefore hydraulic conductivity can be obtained from the transmissivity and aquifer thickness hydraulic resistance is used to measure resistance in the confining layer 14 c b k and hydraulic conductivity k in aquifer is computed by 15 k t b where b thickness of aquifer combining well log and drawdown data from aquifer tests figs 4 and 5 it presents that the system is a leaky confined aquifer idealized assumptions of the methodology proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 seem to be appropriate for the research although the procedure is traditional it is expected that accurate values of storage and leakance can be evaluated in the studied aquifer the use of the more simplified approach of theis 1935 for interpretation of aquifer test quantifying aquifer parameters is not appropriate scheduled maximum potential groundwater volume proposed by kinmen government county is used as a basis for controlling groundwater use change of groundwater discharge is then calculated by storage coefficient and head decline change safety level of water use will be demonstrated by the rate of groundwater discharge to scheduled maximum groundwater volume allowable averaged groundwater well number is also evaluated by scheduled maximum groundwater volume and head decline with predefined influential radius in pumping two scenarios are considered to evaluate adoptable discharge 1 using of whole covered area and 2 area involving predefined influential radius of groundwater pumping the area involved in granitic outcrops is excluded in calculation 4 result and discussion the duration of the pumping was about 1000 min with constant pumping rate at 82 08 m3 d automatic recording of the water level drawdown was set up in the observation well with a log time schedule of recorded measurements in the pumping period the drawdown curves for km mw010 and km mw002 match the type curves of leaky conditions in hantush and jacob method figs 4 and 5 interference for an unknown source is observable in the drawdown of km mw002 during 100 to 1000 min fig 5 type curve matching is suitable for km mw010 and km mw002 by choosing r b 0 2 fig 6 and 0 3 0 5 fig 7 respectively for the latter case the curve matching is revealed with r b 0 5 and 0 3 in the early and later section of drawdown respectively for km mw010 transmissivity and storage coefficient are then evaluated as 81 646 m2 d and 1 574 10 3 using eqs 10 12 hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic resistance are calculated as 7 776 m d and 5 147 day using eq 15 and eq 4 with eq 14 respectively table 2 for km mw002 transmissivity and storage coefficient are evaluated as 37 324 m2 d and 1 772 10 3 and hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic resistance are computed as 1 037 m d and 4 39 days respectively combining with eqs 4 and 14 vertical hydraulic conductivity values in the leaky confining layer are 0 389 and 0 911 m d for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively a summary of the data used in the computations is shown in table 2 driscoll 1986 reported that the typical hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient for sand were 10 2 103 m d and 10 5 10 3 respectively accordingly values of hydraulic conductivity estimated in this study are intermediate for the typical range but storage coefficient are somewhat higher than the typical range bear 1979 indicated that groundwater storage is volume of water released from storage per unit horizontal area of aquifer and per unit decline of head it is about one in a thousand for both wells of this study it indicates that 1 m of head decline per 10 m 10 m area the volume of water released from the aquifer is represented about 0 1574 m3 and 0 1772 m3 for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively the ratios of vertical aquitard to horizontal aquifer hydraulic conductivity are 5 and 87 5 for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively it presents that the hydraulic resistance of aquitard in km mw010 is higher than the one in km mw002 the recharge capability from the aquitard of confined aquifer for the western area chinting site is greater than for the eastern area potsun site it is of some interest to note that storage coefficient is used to evaluate the potential outcome of groundwater in kinmen by incorporating data of applied use of groundwater proposed by kinmen county government the maximum groundwater volume is estimated as 1 6487 106 m3 and 6 2164 106 m3 annually for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively the excluded area for outcrops is also estimated as 50 of total area of kinmen kinmen 2011 for head decline in half length of aquifer thickness it reaches at about 20 and 13 of scheduled maximum groundwater volume for eastern and western area respectively while 40 and 26 for the head decline in full length of aquifer thickness table 3 therefore the safety can be met from the viewpoint of the use of scheduled maximum groundwater volume as controlled limit moreover safety assessment of groundwater discharge using influential radius and head decline change are demonstrated in table 4 for eastern kinmen the designed minimum and maximum influential radius e g 10 m and 100 m the groundwater discharge for head decline in half of aquifer thickness are estimated approximately about 2 5 m3 and 250 m3 for eastern kinmen respectively while 10 m3 and 1000 m3 for western kinmen for the case of head decline in full length of aquifer thickness it is estimated approximately about 5 m3 and 500 m3 respectively while 20 m3 and 2000 m3 for western kinmen for the designed maximum influential radius of 100 m and the head decline in half of aquifer thickness the maximum averaged well number can be limited in 3330 and 3100 approximately for eastern and western kinmen respectively for head decline in full length of aquifer thickness average well number can be limited around 1600 for eastern and western kinmen table 4 rate of groundwater discharge to scheduled maximum discharge are in the order of 10 4 10 8 for all defined influential radius table 4 the safety is then met in this study the safety indication involving groundwater discharge and allowable number of groundwater well can be accurately analyzed and suggested using real aquifer properties and scheduled maximum groundwater discharge with scenarios related to pumping drawdown of groundwater and predefined influential radius as the result shown the proposed method is consolidated applicable and innovative it utilizes relevant aquifer data and groundwater demand to assess water resources of subsurface

7431,due to increasing population worldwide there is an urgent need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability the major innovative design of this study is to provide a practical assessment process for groundwater discharge under a regional demand by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers overlain on a mesozoic granitic gneiss basement which involves the important groundwater system in the kinmen region taiwan roc and the assessment of adoptable groundwater discharge in aquifer is needed the storage

predefined scenarios the result can be utilized practically for developing management strategy of groundwater resources due to the applicability and novel of method keywords groundwater water resources leaky aquifer storage coefficient 1 introduction groundwater is a beneficial subsurface water resource it has several substantially favorable qualities relative to surface water resources from the viewpoint of increasing population worldwide there is an indispensable need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability groundwater storage and production processes are complex due to the nature effective assessment plays a pivotal role in design and managing groundwater resources systems kinmen or quemoy officially kinmen county fig 1 governed by the republic of china roc which is located off the southeastern coast of mainland china including the main island great kinmen and several surrounding islets it is an eroded residual island covered by quaternary clastic deposits and has a basement of mesozoic and early cretaceous granitic gneiss it was connected with the asian continent in the geologic past and was then separated by sea erosion and crustal uplift precipitation is the major input to the hydrologic cycle and rainfall is low in this area from historical records approximate mean annual precipitation and potential evaporation are 1047 mm and 1687 mm respectively at present groundwater contributes 53 of the total water usage on the island and total groundwater quantity comes from 17 of the effective rainfall therefore estimation of groundwater budget is very important for the island that it evaluates hydraulic properties such as storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer accompanying leaky factor in the aquitard is in an urgent need and can be used to provide important input of design for water resources development two regional administrative areas eastern and western kinmen are chosen as the demonstration of groundwater resources assessment potential groundwater volume in maximum were estimated and scheduled as 1 6487 106 m3 and 6 2164 106 m3 annually by kinmen county government the primary purpose of this study is to provide a novel and practical assessment for aquifer discharge under regional groundwater demand safety issue is then demonstrated by the ratio of groundwater discharge to maximum scheduled volume and suitable groundwater well number respectively moreover it determines as accurately as possible the most representative values of the relevant hydraulic properties of the aquifer at site prior knowledge of aquifer parameters is indispensable for successful evaluation and management of vital groundwater resources hydraulic character of aquifers such as transmissivity storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity or the other are estimated substantially that to evaluate aquifer type at testing sites and to analyze those parameters for the studied groundwater system is then addressed for the assessment purpose a real case subjected to practical assessment for groundwater discharge under regional demand is well developed to evaluate the type and hydraulic characteristics of aquifers in the studied area conducting aquifer tests derived by the professional method has been performed the analysis is accomplished through use of an analytical model with the drawdown of water levels in the vicinity of a pumped well 2 description of the studied area the studied area is in main island of kinmen for the position of 118 12 e to 118 30 e and 24 22 n to 24 32 n fig 1 it is about 18 km long in the east west direction and has a maximum width of 10 km in the north south direction the neck of the island is 3 5 km wide the area of the island including surrounding islets is about 136 km2 the administrative area for eastern and western kinmen covers about 82 688 km2 and 51 562 km2 respectively the representative sites located eastern and western kinmen are at potsun km mw010 and chinting km mw002 respectively both wells are screened in the leaky confined aquifer table 1 the horizontal aquifer producing groundwater from these wells occurs above the impermeable basement of mesozoic and early cretaceous taiwushan granitic gneiss and is overlain by a leaky aquitard fig 2 the aquifer occurs in the period between neogene and quaternary outcrop of granitic gneiss is about 50 of the total area of kinmen 3 method time drawdown aquifer test data are analyzed by using the nonlinear analytical models such as theis model corrected theis model hantush model neuman model and others depending on the type of aquifer in which the test is suitable the analysis is often performed by the graphical method so called type curve matching which is deemed to be a standard method for estimating aquifer parameters in the real world leaky confined aquifers are commonly encountered in the subsurface hydrological systems characterization of the hydrogeology of leaky confined aquifers can be accomplished with traditional aquifer test methods and analysis models for a confined aquifer the theis model 1935 utilizes the assumption that the aquifer is perfectly confined that is the overlying or underlying confining layer of aquifer is truly impermeable depending on the magnitude of hydraulic gradients around the well the leakage rates from the confining layer may be significantly less than water extraction from or injection to the aquifer hantush and jacob 1955 extended the theis model for conditions in which there is significant leakage to the aquifer from an overlying or underlying less permeable formation the governing equation for radial flow in an elastic confined aquifer with leakage condition for the conceptual model shown in fig 2 has been derived by jacob 1946 and bear 1979 1 2 s r 2 1 r s r k tb s s t s t where s drawdown in aquifer test r distance from pumping well to the observed well s

expressed in the form 3 2 s r 2 1 r s r s b 2 s t s t also defining the leakance or leakage coefficient as 4 k b t b 2 its numerical values are usually given as a measure of leakage rates the initial and boundary condition for drawdown are respectively 5 s r 0 0 for all r and 6 s t 0 for all t the condition for the discharge rate is 7 q 0 for t 0 q constant 0 for t 0 the constant discharge rate for the drawdown at the well is 8 lim r 0 r r s q 2 π t eq 7 states that the discharge of the well is constant throughout the pumping period while eq 8 indicates that the flow rate towards the well is identical to its discharge hantush and jacob 1955 presented the solution of such a system described for eqs 1 8 9 s r t q 4 π t u 1 y exp y r 2 4 b 2 y dy where 10 u r 2 s 4 tt for the case b in eq 9 the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer k is very small and the second term in the exponential term approaches zero in this case eq 9 becomes equivalent to the theis equation b is a function of the aquifer transmissivity t thickness of the confining layer b and the hydraulic conductivity k the ratio r b is a parameter representing the characteristics of the leaky aquifer y is an integration variable in the integrand eq 9 can also be written as 11 s r t q 4 π t w u r b and 12 w u β q 4 π t u 1 y exp y β 2 4 y dy where 13 β r b w u β is known as hantush and jacob well function for leaky aquifers the values of w u β for different values of u and β r b were presented by hantush 1956 1961 1964 a plot of w u versus 1 u for different values of β is shown in fig 3 by considering eqs 10 and 11 type curves matching can be used to find r b and analyze s and t therefore hydraulic conductivity can be obtained from the transmissivity and aquifer thickness hydraulic resistance is used to measure resistance in the confining layer 14 c b k and hydraulic conductivity k in aquifer is computed by 15 k t b where b thickness of aquifer combining well log and drawdown data from aquifer tests figs 4 and 5 it presents that the system is a leaky confined aquifer idealized assumptions of the methodology proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 seem to be appropriate for the research although the procedure is traditional it is expected that accurate values of storage and leakance can be evaluated in the studied aquifer the use of the more simplified approach of theis 1935 for interpretation of aquifer test quantifying aquifer parameters is not appropriate scheduled maximum potential groundwater volume proposed by kinmen government county is used as a basis for controlling groundwater use change of groundwater discharge is then calculated by storage coefficient and head decline change safety level of water use will be demonstrated by the rate of groundwater discharge to scheduled maximum groundwater volume allowable averaged groundwater well number is also evaluated by scheduled maximum groundwater volume and head decline with predefined influential radius in pumping two scenarios are considered to evaluate adoptable discharge 1 using of whole covered area and 2 area involving predefined influential radius of groundwater pumping the area involved in granitic outcrops is excluded in calculation 4 result and discussion the duration of the pumping was about 1000 min with constant pumping rate at 82 08 m3 d automatic recording of the water level drawdown was set up in the observation well with a log time schedule of recorded measurements in the pumping period the drawdown curves for km mw010 and km mw002 match the type curves of leaky conditions in hantush and jacob method figs 4 and 5 interference for an unknown source is observable in the drawdown of km mw002 during 100 to 1000 min fig 5 type curve matching is suitable for km mw010 and km mw002 by choosing r b 0 2 fig 6 and 0 3 0 5 fig 7 respectively for the latter case the curve matching is revealed with r b 0 5 and 0 3 in the early and later section of drawdown respectively for km mw010 transmissivity and storage coefficient are then evaluated as 81 646 m2 d and 1 574 10 3 using eqs 10 12 hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic resistance are calculated as 7 776 m d and 5 147 day using eq 15 and eq 4 with eq 14 respectively table 2 for km mw002 transmissivity and storage coefficient are evaluated as 37 324 m2 d and 1 772 10 3 and hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic resistance are computed as 1 037 m d and 4 39 days respectively combining with eqs 4 and 14 vertical hydraulic conductivity values in the leaky confining layer are 0 389 and 0 911 m d for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively a summary of the data used in the computations is shown in table 2 driscoll 1986 reported that the typical hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient for sand were 10 2 103 m d and 10 5 10 3 respectively accordingly values of hydraulic conductivity estimated in this study are intermediate for the typical range but storage coefficient are somewhat higher than the typical range bear 1979 indicated that groundwater storage is volume of water released from storage per unit horizontal area of aquifer and per unit decline of head it is about one in a thousand for both wells of this study it indicates that 1 m of head decline per 10 m 10 m area the volume of water released from the aquifer is represented about 0 1574 m3 and 0 1772 m3 for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively the ratios of vertical aquitard to horizontal aquifer hydraulic conductivity are 5 and 87 5 for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively it presents that the hydraulic resistance of aquitard in km mw010 is higher than the one in km mw002 the recharge capability from the aquitard of confined aquifer for the western area chinting site is greater than for the eastern area potsun site it is of some interest to note that storage coefficient is used to evaluate the potential outcome of groundwater in kinmen by incorporating data of applied use of groundwater proposed by kinmen county government the maximum groundwater volume is estimated as 1 6487 106 m3 and 6 2164 106 m3 annually for km mw010 and km mw002 respectively the excluded area for outcrops is also estimated as 50 of total area of kinmen kinmen 2011 for head decline in half length of aquifer thickness it reaches at about 20 and 13 of scheduled maximum groundwater volume for eastern and western area respectively while 40 and 26 for the head decline in full length of aquifer thickness table 3 therefore the safety can be met from the viewpoint of the use of scheduled maximum groundwater volume as controlled limit moreover safety assessment of groundwater discharge using influential radius and head decline change are demonstrated in table 4 for eastern kinmen the designed minimum and maximum influential radius e g 10 m and 100 m the groundwater discharge for head decline in half of aquifer thickness are estimated approximately about 2 5 m3 and 250 m3 for eastern kinmen respectively while 10 m3 and 1000 m3 for western kinmen for the case of head decline in full length of aquifer thickness it is estimated approximately about 5 m3 and 500 m3 respectively while 20 m3 and 2000 m3 for western kinmen for the designed maximum influential radius of 100 m and the head decline in half of aquifer thickness the maximum averaged well number can be limited in 3330 and 3100 approximately for eastern and western kinmen respectively for head decline in full length of aquifer thickness average well number can be limited around 1600 for eastern and western kinmen table 4 rate of groundwater discharge to scheduled maximum discharge are in the order of 10 4 10 8 for all defined influential radius table 4 the safety is then met in this study the safety indication involving groundwater discharge and allowable number of groundwater well can be accurately analyzed and suggested using real aquifer properties and scheduled maximum groundwater discharge with scenarios related to pumping drawdown of groundwater and predefined influential radius as the result shown the proposed method is consolidated applicable and innovative it utilizes relevant aquifer data and groundwater demand to assess water resources of subsurface hydrologic system in the studied region which is generally considered as growing lack of water resources it provides an inventive design and analysis to suggest safety level of groundwater discharge and admissible well number due to the regional groundwater demand however aquifer storage in real site and scheduled maximum groundwater discharge perhaps implicate uncertainty due to the complex in

7432,pump storage hydroelectricity is an efficient way to temporarily store energy this technique requires to store temporarily a large volume of water in an upper reservoir and to release it through turbines to the lower reservoir to produce electricity recently the idea of using old flooded quarries as a lower reservoir has been evoked however these flooded quarries are generally connected to unconfined aquifers consequently pumping or injecting large volumes of water within short time intervals will have an impact on the adjacent aquifers conversely water exchanges between the quarry and the aquifer may also influence the water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir using numerical modelling this study investigates the interactions between generic flooded open pit quarries and adjacent unconfined aquifers during various pump storage cyclic stresses the propagation of sinusoidal stresses in the adjacent porous media and the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the quarry are studied homogeneous rock media and the presence of fractures in the vicinity of the quarry are considered results show that hydrological quarry rock interactions must be considered with caution when implementing pump storage systems for rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and as a consequence the instantaneous electricity production regarding the impact of the pump storage cyclic stresses on the surrounding environment the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions and is enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities such as fractures the impact around the quarry used as a lower reservoir thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump storage systems to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring up adverse effects results highlight opportunities and challenges to be faced to implement pump storage hydroelectricity systems in old flooded open pit quarries keywords pump hydro energy storage systems quarry aquifer interactions oscillatory pumping tests groundwater open pit 1 introduction and objectives the energetic production currently induces a lot of socio economic and environmental challenges part of this production is more and more made from renewable energy sources and the integration of this intermittent energy in the power distribution grids becomes problematic connolly 2010 in this context hydroelectricity is highly interesting because it constitutes an efficient way to temporarily store energy this is actually needed for regulation purposes to manage the variable energy demand and production across a day pump storage systems generally consist of an upper and a lower reservoir water is pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir during periods of low energy demands during high energy demand periods water is released into the lower reservoir through turbines to produce electricity the period of the cycles is typically from one to a few hours the amount of produced energy mainly depends on the elevation difference between the two reservoirs and the volume of water involved this technique thus requires very large water reservoirs some pump storage systems have already been installed in different countries rehman et al 2015 this kind of hydroelectric stations classically use impervious artificial water reservoirs and are connected to the high voltage power grids recently the idea of using the numerous abandoned and flooded quarries or underground mines as storage reservoirs has been discussed fig 1 due to the topographic context these quarries and mines would generally be used as the lower reservoirs uddin and asce 2003 this would allow saving some reservoir construction costs reproducing these systems in the many existing sites and connecting them to the medium voltage power grids madlener and specht 2013 quarries and mines can however not be considered as impervious reservoirs they are actually in close interaction with the adjacent rock medium fig 1 as a consequence pumping or injecting large volumes of water in a quarry or a mine within short time intervals will inevitably induce an impact on the surrounding groundwater table reversely under this kind of pumping and injection stresses water exchanges between the flooded quarry and adjacent unconfined aquifers may also impact the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir studying the interactions between the flooded reservoir quarry or mine and the adjacent water table is crucial to decide on the feasibility of the projects the water level fluctuations in the flooded quarry constitutes an important parameter of the hydroelectric production because the drop of elevation between the water levels of two reservoirs defines the productivity of the system these water level fluctuations must therefore be evaluated carefully including the potential influence of the water exchanges between the reservoir and the rock medium the fluctuations induced in the reservoir will propagate into the rock medium the distance of propagation also has to be quantified to determine the impact of pump storage systems on the environment this is necessary for example to assess the cohabitation with other actors such as neighboring groundwater pumping areas similarly soil stability problems related to the subsidence or collapse of some weathered rocks in the vicinity of the quarry kaufmann and quinif 2002 may be caused or exacerbated by the induced fluctuations of the groundwater table very few pump storage systems using permeable reservoirs have been studied from a hydrogeological perspective a few cases involving underground mines have been reported for an example severon 2011 investigates the possibility of recycling some iron mines in pump storage systems some underground mines may actually be interesting because they potentially enable a great elevation difference between the reservoirs pujades et al 2016 however these mines also generate some important questions regarding their stability and almost all studies have focused on geomechanical problems e g lee and song 2003 almost no research about pump storage systems using flooded quarries is reported a few hydrogeological studies involving quarries have been performed but they focus on steady state problems as an example eberts and bair 1990 have assessed the impact of quarry dewatering on long term groundwater resources according to the hydrogeological context lepage et al 1999 have studied groundwater contamination issues induced by a landfill located in an old quarry in canada and have highlighted the influence of the geological structures pump storage systems are however different as they involve transient processes with unusual frequencies of stresses in groundwater systems water is actually pumped or injected cyclically over short time periods varying from one to a few hours recently this kind of cyclic stresses has been investigated through the development of oscillatory pumping tests bakhos et al 2014 bakker 2009 black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 guiltinan and becker 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 the approach is to obtain hydraulic parameter estimation using the amplitude and phase shift of water level oscillations induced in a specific point and propagated in the porous media this approach appears to be useful in some specific conditions bakhos et al 2014 rasmussen et al 2003 for example when the intensity of the propagated signal becomes similar to the ambient noise simple signal processing can differentiate and extract specific frequency components and thus increase the resolution of the method although the context of these tests is different compared to pump storage systems the processes involved are similar oscillatory pumping tests have generally been used to estimate hydraulic properties in oil reservoirs but they have also been applied and studied in groundwater reservoirs rasmussen et al 2003 have performed oscillatory pumping field experiments in a confined leaky and partially penetrating aquifer and estimated the hydraulic parameter values with an analytical solution black and kipp 1981 have estimated the different ranges of hydraulic diffusivity for which sinusoidal pumping tests can be applied using the amplitude and phase shift of the measured signal in a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer bakker 2009 studied the effect of aquifer heterogeneities on the response of a sinusoidal pumping sequence using an analytic element solution the possibility to use oscillatory pumping test for hydraulic imaging is investigated by cardiff et al 2013 with oscillatory pumping tests performed in homogeneous and heterogeneous confined aquifer cardiff et al 2013 renner and messar 2006 and guiltinan and becker 2015 highlight the influence of the frequency in the propagation of the induced stressed and in the investigated scale of the oscillatory pumping test all these studies have been performed considering confined aquifers in the case of pump storage systems in open pit quarries concerned aquifers are however mostly unconfined to our knowledge only one recent study has considered such aquifers using experimental field works laboratory and analytical analyses rabinovich et al 2015 have studied the dependence of the calculated hydraulic parameter values on the prescribed cyclic stresses frequency in an unconfined aquifer the scale to be considered in pump storage systems installed in large surface reservoirs is also very different from the system dimensions considered in previous studies the typical size of open pit quarries is several tens or hundreds of meters as a consequence the scale to consider the water flow rates to pump and inject and the capacity effects to consider in the quarry are much more important than in previously investigated experimental sites considering this context the general objective of this paper is to study the interactions between a flooded open pit quarry and an adjacent unconfined aquifer during cyclic water pumping and injection in the quarry for pump storage system operations we focus our attention on the water volumes exchanged between the quarry and the rock media and on the environmental impact of the cyclic stresses on the surrounding aquifer numerical simulations are used to investigate different configurations as a function of several sets of hydraulic parameters values we consider the case of a homogeneous media the presence of fractures the influence of the cyclic stresses frequency and intensity and the influence of the regional hydraulic gradient the results are discussed regarding the feasibility of pump storage storage systems as a function of the hydrogeological context of the open pit flooded quarries 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model fig 2 conceptualizes the system consisting of a flooded open pit quarry affected by cyclic stresses and the surrounding rock media where induced groundwater level variations propagate the case of unconfined aquifers is exclusively considered the limits of the system are chosen far enough from the quarry so that they have no influence on the studied processes the quarry has a prismatic rectangular shape and is located at the center of the domain the lower limit of the modelled area corresponds to the bottom of the quarry groundwater fluxes through the base of the quarry are consequently not considered this case is frequently observed when the base of the quarry also corresponds to a geological limit cyclic stresses correspond to water pumping and injection in the open pit quarry in this study stresses are conceptualized as sinusoidal variations as illustrated in fig 2 negative and positive values correspond to water pumping and injection respectively in a real pump storage system stresses would not be sinusoidal as further discussed in section 4 however working with a sinusoidal signal presents some advantages bakhos et al 2014 cardiff et al 2013 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 the sinusoidal input signal is fully controlled and characterized by a unique frequency value so that the output measured signal is easy to recognize and analyze results are also easier to compare with other studies which have used the same kind of stresses 2 2 general equations assuming that flows are essentially horizontal we model flows in 2d using the classical dupuit forchheimer equations dupuit 1863 the flow equation within unconfined

conditions are imposed on the whole considered domain 4 h x t 0 h 0 x ω where ω is the entire domain the objective of this study is to assess the impact of the periodic pumping and injection flow rates on the water head variations in the quarry and in the surrounding rock environment to reach this objective different specific output variables will be calculated and analyzed for several scenarios as a function of the main hydraulic parameters the amplitude of the water level variations at any point of the modelled area can be expressed as in eq 5 this amplitude is expected to change according to the hydraulic parameters of the rock media and to the related quarry groundwater interactions 5 δ h x h max x h min x m more specifically the amplitude of the water level variations in the quarry is noted as δ h c 6 δ h c h c max h c min m the amplitudes of the hydraulic head fluctuations at any point of the model is used to define a distance of influence of the pump storage operations in the rock media this distance of influence is defined as the distance between the quarry walls and the point in the rock domain where the amplitude of the hydraulic head fluctuation is reduced by 99 compared to the theoretical amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry in absence of any water exchange between the quarry and the rock medium i e in a quarry located in a

dimensionless variables related to the sinusoidal pumping imposed in the quarry are introduced 9 h h η c h c h c η c t t τ incorporating these variables into eqs 1 to 4 leads to the following non

of rectangular finite difference cells as consequence calculated groundwater fluxes are horizontal and the dupuit forchheimer approximation is considered it enables to reduce the total number of cells and to prevent numerical problems related to saturation desaturation of cells errors induced by dupuit forchheimer approximation have been quantified by comparing multilayer and monolayer model results the maximum difference in terms of groundwater fluxes remains below 2 when the drawdown induced in the quarry is comparable to the aquifer thickness the grid is composed by irregular rectangular cells next to the quarry cells are squared with a width of 1 m away from the quarry cells are rectangular with a size increasing with the distance to the quarry walls by a factor of 1 05 every row and column this mesh ensures higher accuracy next to the quarry where groundwater variations are expected to be higher in the quarry the hydraulic parameters have been specified to represent the volume of water and the absence of rock medium the specific yield is thus equal to 1 and the hydraulic conductivity has been fixed several orders of magnitude larger than the maximum aquifer hydraulic conductivity investigated in these conditions the simulated hydraulic head field in the quarry can be considered as uniform constant groundwater head boundary conditions are prescribed on the external limits of the model these boundaries are located far enough from the quarry to prevent any influence on the studied processes initial groundwater heads are constant all over the modelled area and equal the prescribed heads on the external limits natural groundwater recharge are neglected sinusoidal stresses are applied as prescribed fluxes on all cells corresponding to the open pit quarry in the following results section several scenarios are considered as a function of the hydraulic parameters values of the rock medium the frequency and intensity of the sinusoidal stresses in the quarry and the regional hydrogeological and geological contexts all displayed results are considered when a steady periodic state is reached i e when the amplitude of the fluctuations is constant and not influenced by the initial conditions 3 results 3 1 pump storage operations in homogeneous rock media the impact of cyclic pump storage operations is first studied for a quarry located in a homogeneous rock media this case study is quite simple but enables to understand more easily the hydrogeological response of such systems numerical calculations have been performed using specific quarry rock and pump storage properties in the following paragraphs results are presented using the non dimensional formalism exposed in section 2 3 and are based on the following parameters ranges the squared quarry has horizontal dimensions between 100 100 m and 200 200 m and a saturated depth of 80 m pump storage stresses in the quarry are sinusoidal with a frequency included between 1 6 and 24 cycles per day induced stresses are simulated for hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 to 10 8 m s 1 and specific yield ranging from 0 01 to 0 30 such ranges have been chosen according to expected properties in such a pump storage system fig 3 a and b show the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c and the non dimensional distance of influence d in the rock media as a function of the non dimensional exchange capacity k and the non dimensional diffusivity d these two graphs directly give the evolution of the two investigated variables as a function of the two non dimensional parameters the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c decreases as k increases and d decreases fig 3a within the ranges of parameter values considered in this study this non dimensional amplitude varies between 1 and 0 78 the unity value corresponds to an impermeable lower reservoir without any quarry rock medium water exchange the non dimensional distance of influence increases with d and is independent of k fig 3b as the isovalue curves are globally horizontal this non dimensional distance of influence is included between 0 and 30 for the considered parameters values the two graphs of fig 3 also enable to analyse the impact of pump storage systems as a function of all dimensional parameters defining k and d for any specific context related to the rock hydraulic properties to the quarry dimensions and the pump storage configuration results of fig 3 allow specifying the potential water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence 3 1 1 influence of the rock medium hydraulic properties a change of hydraulic conductivity implies a displacement along the 1 1 direction fig 3 as the hydraulic conductivity defines both k and d non dimensional parameters eqs 14 and 15 the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry decreases and the distance of influence in the rock increases as the hydraulic conductivity of the rock increases these effects are logically explained by higher water exchanges and an easier propagation of the induced stress in a more permeable rock media a change of specific yield implies a displacement along the vertical direction when the specific yield value increases both the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry fig 3a and the non dimensional distance of influence fig 3b decreases due to more important storage effects in the rock an equivalent increase in hydraulic conductivity and specific yield implies a displacement along the horizontal direction in this context the change regarding the water level fluctuations amplitude in the quarry is more important conversely there is no effect on the non dimensional distance of influence 3 1 2 influence of the quarry dimensions using a larger quarry and similar stresses logically induces smaller absolute fluctuations in the quarry and in the surrounding environment any pumped or injected water volume is actually distributed over a larger quarry volume additionally the interface between the quarry and the rock media is also increased inducing potentially different quarry rock interactions to figure out the impact of the quarry dimensions in a more tangible way a change of the quarry surface may be considered keeping the parameter η c constant in this case the maximum value of the sinusoidal flow rate q max is increased by the same ratio as the quarry surface s so that water level fluctuations are only differing due to the potentially different quarry rock media interactions a similar increase of s and q max induces a decrease of k and has no effect on d resulting in a horizontal displacement to the left on the graphs of fig 3 therefore the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry increases towards the unity value in other words the attenuation of the water level fluctuations in the quarry is relatively less important for a larger quarry this observation may be explained by the fact that the water volumes exchanged between the quarry and the rock media increase with the perimeter of the quarry these volumes are however distributed over the whole quarry surface which increases faster than the perimeter in a similar context keeping the parameter η c constant the non dimensional distance of influence in the rock media is not influenced by the quarry surface 3 1 3 impact of the frequency of the pump storage stresses in the quarry the frequency of the pumping injection flow rates prescribed in the quarry is depending on the electricity market prices and on the instantaneous regional electricity production and demand this frequency is therefore variable across the day but may be approximately considered as included between one and a few hours european commission 2017 the impact of the frequency may be discussed on the graphs of fig 3 in a similar way as for the quarry dimensions keeping the parameter η c constant in this context q max must vary in the same proportion as the frequency or in inverse proportion to the period τ it also means that the same water volumes are pumped injected during a single pump storage cycle an increase of the period τ a decrease of the frequency keeping η c constant induces a similar increase of k and d resulting in displacement along the 1 1 direction towards the top right graphs corners fig 3 these changes result in a decrease of the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and an increase of the non dimensional distance of influence in other words results generally show that the interactions quarry rock media are more important in terms of exchanged groundwater volumes and distance of propagation with the decrease of the pump storage stresses frequency 3 1 4 impact of a regional hydraulic head gradient at the scale of the modelled area a regional groundwater head gradient is usually observed and induces natural groundwater flow around open pit quarries to assess the influence of this regional gradient on the water level fluctuations in the quarry and on the distance of influence in the rock media all simulations performed in previous sections were reproduced considering a uniform hydraulic gradient ranging from 0 1 to 2 over the modelled area these gradient values are commonly observed in belgian aquifers dassargues and walraevens 2014 for all models and simulations the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence upstream and downstream the quarry have been calculated results not shown here indicate that the amplitude of the water levels fluctuations in the quarry is similar to the corresponding homogeneous case without regional hydraulic head gradient regarding the environmental impact around the quarry the distance of influence upstream the quarry is slightly longer than downstream however the difference compared to the corresponding case without regional gradient is very small in all cases and simulations this difference is lower than 2 3 2 pump storage operations in heterogeneous rock media the heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties may influence substantially the flow and propagation of any stress in the rock media the objective is here to understand and quantify the impact of a single fracture on a pump storage system regarding the water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence in the surrounding rock media to assess this impact a linear fracture is introduced in the model grid using an equivalent porous media approach the width of the fracture is supposed to be the width of a grid cell row the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and porosity are calculated using the following equations the transmissivity of the fracture t frac is calculated using the poiseuille flow equation 23 t frac ρ g a frac 3 12 μ ρ density of water kg m 3 g acceleration due to gravity m s 2 a frac aperture of the fracture m μ dynamic viscosity of water kg m 1 s 1 the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fracture k frac is calculated as 24 k frac t frac a cell a cell width of the cells row where the fracture is implemented m the equivalent specific yield of the fracture s y frac is calculated as 25 s y frac a frac a cell the influence of the fracture is assessed as a function of its hydraulic properties and position the case of a fracture intersecting perpendicularly the quarry walls is first considered with different fracture apertures 1 10 2 m 1 10 3 m and 1 10 4 m secondly the case of a non intersecting fracture is also investigated with different quarry fracture distances 1 m 5 m and 10 m in all cases the fracture is perpendicular to the quarry walls and is extended to the external boundary of the model 3 2 1 influence of a fracture connected to the quarry the influence of the fracture depends on its aperture and related transmissivity regarding the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry the presence of a single fracture however has a limited impact this amplitude only slightly decreases with the increase of the fracture aperture taking into account all quarry dimensions and rock media properties considered in this study and a very large fracture aperture of 0 1 m t frac 8 1 102 m2 s 1 the maximal difference between the simulated normalized amplitude with and without a fracture is lower than 0 1 following the small impact of the fracture on the overall aquifer storage nevertheless note that the presence of several fractures fractured zones or karstic conduits could affect more significantly the storage and water levels in the quarry their presence and spatial distribution must be studied at the scale of any quarry used for pump storage systems although the influence on the water level fluctuations in the quarry is small the presence of a single fracture may nevertheless locally induce a more significant impact on the amplitude of the groundwater level fluctuations as the aperture of the fracture and its related transmissivity increases a preferential flow path develops and locally extends the distance of influence this effect is clearly shown in fig 4 as a function of the fracture aperture for several cases corresponding to a pump storage cycle period of 10 h a quarry surface of 100 100 m and qmax equal to 25 m3 s 1 this local distance of influence also depends on the hydraulic properties of the adjacent rock matrix the groundwater level fluctuations generated and propagating in the fracture actually dissipate in the bordering rock matrix following the same processes as those reported in section 3 1 as presented in fig 4 the non dimensional distance of influence d in the fracture increases with the decrease of the rock matrix transmissivity and specific yield or decrease of k and or d generally depending on these properties and the aperture of the fracture the non dimensional distance of influence may sharply increase compared to the non dimensional distance of influence in the porous rock media the affected area around the fracture increases with the diffusivity of the rock matrix d note that for very thin fractures results correspond to the homogeneous cases the impact of the fracture becomes logically visible when the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fracture k frac is greater than the matrix hydraulic conductivity note also that calculations are not yet relevant when the distance of influence goes beyond the limits of the modelled area and interacts with the prescribed boundary conditions on the graph of fig 4 this limit approximately corresponds to a non dimensional distance of influence equal to 125 3 2 2 influence of a fracture disconnected from the quarry this section investigates the impact of a fracture located at a specific distance from the quarry the implemented fracture is still perpendicular to the quarry walls but is limited in space and does not intersect it fig 5 shows the calculated distance of influence in the fracture direction as a function of its distance to the quarry for different cases of rock matrix hydraulic properties in this example the aperture of the fracture is equal to 4 10 3 m to maximise the potential effects of the fracture within the range of values for which interactions with the domain limits remain negligible note that when the distance between the quarry and the fracture is equal to zero the results correspond to the case of an intersecting fracture see previous section 3 2 1 for comparison results shown in fig 5 are interpreted as the propagation of the groundwater level fluctuations in two successive different media the rock matrix and the fracture if the fracture is located beyond the non dimensional distance of influence d corresponding to the homogenous rock matrix the effect of the fracture is logically not visible this is clearly illustrated in fig 5 for the rock matrix characterized by a low non dimensional exchange capacity k red curves for this rock matrix the distance of influence is very short and equal to a few meters see section 3 1 as a consequence when the fracture is moved away from the quarry walls the distance of influence rapidly drops from the high values corresponding to the case where the fracture is connected to the quarry section 3 2 1 to the low values corresponding to the homogeneous rock media if the fracture is located within the distance of influence corresponding to the homogenous rock matrix the fracture induces a local distortion and an elongation of the impacted area between the quarry and the fracture groundwater level fluctuations are first attenuated in the porous rock matrix the residual fluctuations then propagate in the fracture this effect can be observed on the blue curves of fig 5 which correspond to a rock matrix characterized by a non dimensional exchange capacity k of 10 2 and two different non dimensional diffusivity d values for these cases the influence of the fracture remains strong even if this fracture is disconnected from the quarry for longer distances between the quarry walls and the fracture the distance of influence tends again to values corresponding to the homogeneous cases as a conclusion the influence of disconnected fractures on the shape of the zone impacted by pump storage operations appears limited in many cases and strongly depends on the rock matrix hydraulic properties from a general point of view and considering realistic rock properties favourable conditions to observe a significant influence would correspond to high values of d and small values of sy this case may combine large zones around the quarry where disconnected fractures remain influent and adequate conditions for pressure propagation into the fracture 4 discussions in terms of pump storage application the results presented above show that the impact of geology and hydrogeology on the water level fluctuations in the quarry are somehow limited considering the used values in fig 3 the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c is included between 1 00 and 0 78 values lower than 1 00 are explained by exchanged groundwater volumes during pump storage cycles between the quarry and the rock medium the lowest value correspond to the most permeable and most porous rocks in the worst case it corresponds to a decrease of 22 however small this difference may be important regarding the hydroelectricity production the system setup and its profitability pujades et al 2017 the evolution through time of the water level in the quarry actually also influences the maximum drop of elevation between the upper and lower reservoirs which determines the electricity power production this may be particularly significant if the elevation difference between the two reservoirs is small compared to the water level fluctuation amplitude in the quarry calculating accurately these expected fluctuations is also important to setup running operations especially regarding the location of particular equipment such as turbines or water pumping pipes finally planning accurately these fluctuations enables to manage possible stability issues which may occur along the quarry walls or within old backfills frequently observed in rock exploitations the distance of influence is much more sensitive in fig 3b the non dimensional distance of influence d around the quarry is included between 0 5 and 25 higher values correspond to more permeable and less porous rocks as shown in section 3 2 this distance of influence may become substantially larger in the presence of heterogeneities such as specific fractures or conduits intersecting the quarry the influence area of the cyclic stresses around the quarry thus appears to be the most constraining geological factor when designing new pump storage systems the impact of induced water level fluctuations in the rock media must be verified and pump storage systems must be developed considering the different actors and the possible hazard or end users conflicts which could occur within this distance as examples they ideally must not interact with other existing pumping installations any stability problems such as soil subsidence or collapse must also be studied this is particularly problematic in limestone formations where potentially unstable weathered of karstified rocks are regularly observed kaufmann and quinif 2002 all these aspects may become critical factors especially in highly urbanized countries such as belgium to limit this distance of influence operators may potentially adapt the maximum pump storage flow rate q max and the cycles frequency 1 τ imposing a minimum frequency would actually constitute an efficient strategy to decrease the distance of influence and mitigate the impact of pump storage operations on the environment section 3 1 3 the stresses frequency historically operated in some existing high voltage pump storage electrical stations is about two cycles a day in this case the objective is mainly to manage the higher electricity demands in the morning and the evening currently the idea of implementing medium voltage stations across the territory is also to be able to accommodate the intermittent energy production from renewable sources ex wind turbines photovoltaic systems in this context the frequency of the pumping injection cycles in the quarry are expected to be much more variable including higher frequency values potentially contributing to less important distance of influence despite potential obstacles that may complicate the practical implementation of pump storage systems in quarries many development possibilities seem to exist in south of belgium walloon region 16844 km2 poty and chevalier 2004 have inventoried almost one thousand open pit quarries located in the administrative and official extracting areas although many other sites exist remacle 2009 this inventory generally gathers the most important open pits in terms of dimensions among them about 25 are actually still operated topographic conditions would allow developing pump storage systems in some of these sites they may be imagined in the old flooded quarries or even in the quarries still in operations with dewatering in this latter case the whole depth of the open pit could potentially be used maximizing the elevation drop between the upper and lower reservoir but a large part of the quarry should however be reserved for water storage and excluded from any extracting operation quarries are located in various rock types poty and chevalier 2004 with different hydraulic properties and dimensions for illustration purpose table 1 shows four simplified examples representative of the variety of existing quarries where pump storage systems could possibly be installed pumping injection sinusoidal stresses characterized by a period of 10 h and a maximum flow rate of 25 m3 s 1 have been simulated in each of them fig 6 presents the simulated absolute amplitude δ h of the groundwater level fluctuations in the rock medium as a function of the distance to the quarry walls dimensional and more tangible results regarding water fluctuations in the quarry distance of influence and elevation drop potentially available are also presented in table 1 these results corroborate the conclusions of section 3 1 the distance of influence is generally larger for the rocks with the highest hydraulic conductivity values note that the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry i e at x 0 are not normalized here and are consequently primarily controlled by the open pit surface the larger the quarry the smaller the absolute amplitude specific hydrogeological studies will be needed to design future pump storage systems in any existing quarry in order to accommodate all specific conditions of the site each quarry has a specific surface depth shape geological structure rock texture etc and it was not possible or the objective in this study to consider all these specificities nevertheless presented results give guidelines on the most constraining issues of the problem considering the water volumes needed to reach a minimum cost effective power production quarries smaller than 100 100 m might hardly be used for pump storage applications using larger quarries the values of amplitude attenuation and distance of influence play an important role in the design of systems results calculated above for a homogeneous medium or for single fractures can be viewed as a first step for impact and feasibility assessment of the problem considering more realistic and complex conditions in terms of shape hydrogeology fractures is however necessary to specify impacts 5 perspectives and conclusions this study allowed assessing the hydrogeological interactions between a flooded open pit quarry and the surrounding unconfined rock media in the context of a pump storage system implementation in particular numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the hydrogeological properties and the pump storage system parameters on these interactions in a broader context most of previous studies about oscillatory pumping tests have generally focused on confined aquifers and smaller scales results of this study have shown that hydrological quarry rock interactions must be considered with caution for rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and as a consequence the instantaneous electricity production results have shown that this effect is also greater as the surface of the lower reservoir is small with realistic hydraulic parameters values and quarries not smaller than 100 100 m the expected impact on the water level fluctuations reaches maximum 22 of the head fluctuations in an ideal quarry without loss in the aquifer some authors have also evoked the possibility to use old underground mines ex abandoned coal mine to implement pump storage systems e g bodeux et al 2017 pujades et al 2016 in this case the elevation drop between the upper and lower reservoirs thus the instantaneous produced electrical power could potentially be higher involved volumes and the equivalent surface of the shafts and galleries could conversely be substantially smaller maximizing the water level fluctuations in the mine bodeux et al 2017 investigate the possibility to use an underground slate mine for pump storage systems they have also highlighted the influence of these water exchanges on the efficiency of the system this present study has also assessed the impact of the pump storage cyclic stresses on the environment surrounding the quarry the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions and may be enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities the presence of fractures intersecting the quarry is crucial they may affect locally but significantly the distance of influence of the pumping injecting operations the impact around the stressed quarry thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump storage systems to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring adverse effects the implementation of a pump storage system in a flooded quarry imposes to characterize in details the hydraulic properties and structure of the surrounding rock media conducting cyclic field tests in the related geological formations may help performing this task this kind of tests are however usually carried out at much smaller spatial and time scales guiltinan and becker 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 the question thus arises about the representativeness of achieved measurements and results in the context of pump storage systems in quarries moreover some authors have also highlighted a possible drift of calculated hydraulic parameters as a function of the stresses frequency therefore performing real case experiments with relevant frequencies and amplitudes could bring highly interesting information for a more realistic impact study this kind of large scale oscillatory pumping experiment would also provide opportunities for characterizing the large scale spatial distribution and structure of hydraulic properties around the quarry by inversion of the measured cyclic data at different observation points finally this study has shown that development of pump storage systems in flooded quarries for hydroelectricity production is possible from a hydrogeological perspective under specific conditions additional steps rely on the assessment of the other technical aspects such as the electromechanical equipment the integration of the produced electricity in the power distribution grids the adequacy with the power demand and finally yet importantly cost benefit aspects of such projects acknowledgements this research has been supported by the public service of wallonia department of energy and sustainable building in the framework of the smartwater project 
7432,pump storage hydroelectricity is an efficient way to temporarily store energy this technique requires to store temporarily a large volume of water in an upper reservoir and to release it through turbines to the lower reservoir to produce electricity recently the idea of using old flooded quarries as a lower reservoir has been evoked however these flooded quarries are generally connected to unconfined aquifers consequently pumping or injecting large volumes of water within short time intervals will have an impact on the adjacent aquifers conversely water exchanges between the quarry and the aquifer may also influence the water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir using numerical modelling this study investigates the interactions between generic flooded open pit quarries and adjacent unconfined aquifers during various pump storage cyclic stresses the propagation of sinusoidal stresses in the adjacent porous media and the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the quarry are studied homogeneous rock media and the presence of fractures in the vicinity of the quarry are considered results show that hydrological quarry rock interactions must be considered with caution when implementing pump storage systems for rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and as a consequence the instantaneous electricity production regarding the impact of the pump storage cyclic stresses on the surrounding environment the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions and is enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities such as fractures the impact around the quarry used as a lower reservoir thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump storage systems to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring up adverse effects results highlight opportunities and challenges to be faced to implement pump storage hydroelectricity systems in old flooded open pit quarries keywords pump hydro energy storage systems quarry aquifer interactions oscillatory pumping tests groundwater open pit 1 introduction and objectives the energetic production currently induces a lot of socio economic and environmental challenges part of this production is more and more made from renewable energy sources and the integration of this intermittent energy in the power distribution grids becomes problematic connolly 2010 in this context hydroelectricity is highly interesting because it constitutes an efficient way to temporarily store energy this is actually needed for regulation purposes to manage the variable energy demand and production across a day pump storage systems generally consist of an upper and a lower reservoir water is pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir during periods of low energy demands during high energy demand periods water is released into the lower reservoir through turbines to produce electricity the period of the cycles is typically from one to a few hours the amount of produced energy mainly depends on the elevation difference between the two reservoirs and the volume of water involved this technique thus requires very large water reservoirs some pump storage systems have already been installed in different countries rehman et al 2015 this kind of hydroelectric stations classically use impervious artificial water reservoirs and are connected to the high voltage power grids recently the idea of using the numerous abandoned and flooded quarries or underground mines as storage reservoirs has been discussed fig 1 due to the topographic context these quarries and mines would generally be used as the lower reservoirs uddin and asce 2003 this would allow saving some reservoir construction costs reproducing these systems in the many existing sites and connecting them to the medium voltage power grids madlener and specht 2013 quarries and mines can however not be considered as impervious reservoirs they are actually in close interaction with the adjacent rock medium fig 1 as a consequence pumping or injecting large volumes of water in a quarry or a mine within short time intervals will inevitably induce an impact on the surrounding groundwater table reversely under this kind of pumping and injection stresses water exchanges between the flooded quarry and adjacent unconfined aquifers may also impact the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir studying the interactions between the flooded reservoir quarry or mine and the adjacent water table is crucial to decide on the feasibility of the projects the water level fluctuations in the flooded quarry constitutes an important parameter of the hydroelectric production because the drop of elevation between the water levels of two reservoirs defines the productivity of the system these water level fluctuations must therefore be evaluated carefully including the potential influence of the water exchanges between the reservoir and the rock medium the fluctuations induced in the reservoir will propagate into the rock medium the distance of propagation also has to be quantified to determine the impact of pump storage systems on the environment this is necessary for example to assess the cohabitation with other actors such as neighboring groundwater pumping areas similarly soil stability problems related to the subsidence or collapse of some weathered rocks in the vicinity of the quarry kaufmann and quinif 2002 may be caused or exacerbated by the induced fluctuations of the groundwater table very few pump storage systems using permeable reservoirs have been studied from a hydrogeological perspective a few cases involving underground mines have been reported for an example severon 2011 investigates the possibility of recycling some iron mines in pump storage systems some underground mines may actually be interesting because they potentially enable a great elevation difference between the reservoirs pujades et al 2016 however these mines also generate some important questions regarding their stability and almost all studies have focused on geomechanical problems e g lee and song 2003 almost no research about pump storage systems using flooded quarries is reported a few hydrogeological studies involving quarries have been performed but they focus on steady state problems as an example eberts and bair 1990 have assessed the impact of quarry dewatering on long term groundwater resources according to the hydrogeological context lepage et al 1999 have studied groundwater contamination issues induced by a landfill located in an old quarry in canada and have highlighted the influence of the geological structures pump storage systems are however different as they involve transient processes with unusual frequencies of stresses in groundwater systems water is actually pumped or injected cyclically over short time periods varying from one to a few hours recently this kind of cyclic stresses has been investigated through the development of oscillatory pumping tests bakhos et al 2014 bakker 2009 black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 guiltinan and becker 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 the approach is to obtain hydraulic parameter estimation using the amplitude and phase shift of water level oscillations induced in a specific point and propagated in the porous media this approach appears to be useful in some specific conditions bakhos et al 2014 rasmussen et al 2003 for example when the intensity of the propagated signal becomes similar to the ambient noise simple signal processing can differentiate and extract specific frequency components and thus increase the resolution of the method although the context of these tests is different compared to pump storage systems the processes involved are similar oscillatory pumping tests have generally been used to estimate hydraulic properties in oil reservoirs but they have also been applied and studied in groundwater reservoirs rasmussen et al 2003 have performed oscillatory pumping field experiments in a confined leaky and partially penetrating aquifer and estimated the hydraulic parameter values with an analytical solution black and kipp 1981 have estimated the different ranges of hydraulic diffusivity for which sinusoidal pumping tests can be applied using the amplitude and phase shift of the measured signal in a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer bakker 2009 studied the effect of aquifer heterogeneities on the response of a sinusoidal pumping sequence using an analytic element solution the possibility to use oscillatory pumping test for hydraulic imaging is investigated by cardiff et al 2013 with oscillatory pumping tests performed in homogeneous and heterogeneous confined aquifer cardiff et al 2013 renner and messar 2006 and guiltinan and becker 2015 highlight the influence of the frequency in the propagation of the induced stressed and in the investigated scale of the oscillatory pumping test all these studies have been performed considering confined aquifers in the case of pump storage systems in open pit quarries concerned aquifers are however mostly unconfined to our knowledge only one recent study has considered such aquifers using experimental field works laboratory and analytical analyses rabinovich et al 2015 have studied the dependence of the calculated hydraulic parameter values on the prescribed cyclic stresses frequency in an unconfined aquifer the scale to be considered in pump storage systems installed in large surface reservoirs is also very different from the system dimensions considered in previous studies the typical size of open pit quarries is several tens or hundreds of meters as a consequence the scale to consider the water flow rates to pump and inject and the capacity effects to consider in the quarry are much more important than in previously investigated experimental sites considering this context the general objective of this paper is to study the interactions between a flooded open pit quarry and an adjacent unconfined aquifer during cyclic water pumping and injection in the quarry for pump storage system operations we focus our attention on the water volumes exchanged between the quarry and the rock media and on the environmental impact of the cyclic stresses on the surrounding aquifer numerical simulations are used to investigate different configurations as a function of several sets of hydraulic parameters values we consider the case of a homogeneous media the presence of fractures the influence of the cyclic stresses frequency and intensity and the influence of the regional hydraulic gradient the results are discussed regarding the feasibility of pump storage storage systems as a function of the hydrogeological context of the open pit flooded quarries 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model fig 2 conceptualizes the system consisting of a flooded open pit quarry affected by cyclic stresses and the surrounding rock media where induced groundwater level variations propagate the case of unconfined aquifers is exclusively considered the limits of the system are chosen far enough from the quarry so that they have no influence on the studied processes the quarry has a prismatic rectangular shape and is located at the center of the domain the lower limit of the modelled area corresponds to the bottom of the quarry groundwater fluxes through the base of the quarry are consequently not considered this case is frequently observed when the base of the quarry also corresponds to a geological limit cyclic stresses correspond to water pumping and injection in the open pit quarry in this study stresses are conceptualized as sinusoidal variations as illustrated in fig 2 negative and positive values correspond to water pumping and injection respectively in a real pump storage system stresses would not be sinusoidal as further discussed in section 4 however working with a sinusoidal signal presents some advantages bakhos et al 2014 cardiff et al 2013 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 the sinusoidal input signal is fully controlled and characterized by a unique frequency value so that the output measured signal is easy to recognize and analyze results are also easier to compare with other studies which have used the same kind of stresses 2 2 general equations assuming that flows are essentially horizontal we model flows in 2d using the classical dupuit forchheimer equations dupuit 1863 the flow equation within unconfined

rates on the water head variations in the quarry and in the surrounding rock environment to reach this objective different specific output variables will be calculated and analyzed for several scenarios as a function of the main hydraulic parameters the amplitude of the water level variations at any point of the modelled area can be expressed as in eq 5 this amplitude is expected to change according to the hydraulic parameters of the rock media and to the related quarry groundwater interactions 5 δ h x h max x h min x m more specifically the amplitude of the water level variations in the quarry is noted as δ h c 6 δ h c h c max h c min m the amplitudes of the hydraulic head fluctuations at any point of the model is used to define a distance of influence of the pump storage operations in the rock media this distance of influence is defined as the distance between the quarry walls and the point in the rock domain where the amplitude of the hydraulic head fluctuation is reduced by 99 compared to the theoretical amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry in absence of any water exchange between the quarry and the rock medium i e in a quarry located in a

and to prevent numerical problems related to saturation desaturation of cells errors induced by dupuit forchheimer approximation have been quantified by comparing multilayer and monolayer model results the maximum difference in terms of groundwater fluxes remains below 2 when the drawdown induced in the quarry is comparable to the aquifer thickness the grid is composed by irregular rectangular cells next to the quarry cells are squared with a width of 1 m away from the quarry cells are rectangular with a size increasing with the distance to the quarry walls by a factor of 1 05 every row and column this mesh ensures higher accuracy next to the quarry where groundwater variations are expected to be higher in the quarry the hydraulic parameters have been specified to represent the volume of water and the absence of rock medium the specific yield is thus equal to 1 and the hydraulic conductivity has been fixed several orders of magnitude larger than the maximum aquifer hydraulic conductivity investigated in these conditions the simulated hydraulic head field in the quarry can be considered as uniform constant groundwater head boundary conditions are prescribed on the external limits of the model these boundaries are located far enough from the quarry to prevent any influence on the studied processes initial groundwater heads are constant all over the modelled area and equal the prescribed heads on the external limits natural groundwater recharge are neglected sinusoidal stresses are applied as prescribed fluxes on all cells corresponding to the open pit quarry in the following results section several scenarios are considered as a function of the hydraulic parameters values of the rock medium the frequency and intensity of the sinusoidal stresses in the quarry and the regional hydrogeological and geological contexts all displayed results are considered when a steady periodic state is reached i e when the amplitude of the fluctuations is constant and not influenced by the initial conditions 3 results 3 1 pump storage operations in homogeneous rock media the impact of cyclic pump storage operations is first studied for a quarry located in a homogeneous rock media this case study is quite simple but enables to understand more easily the hydrogeological response of such systems numerical calculations have been performed using specific quarry rock and pump storage properties in the following paragraphs results are presented using the non dimensional formalism exposed in section 2 3 and are based on the following parameters ranges the squared quarry has horizontal dimensions between 100 100 m and 200 200 m and a saturated depth of 80 m pump storage stresses in the quarry are sinusoidal with a frequency included between 1 6 and 24 cycles per day induced stresses are simulated for hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 to 10 8 m s 1 and specific yield ranging from 0 01 to 0 30 such ranges have been chosen according to expected properties in such a pump storage system fig 3 a and b show the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c and the non dimensional distance of influence d in the rock media as a function of the non dimensional exchange capacity k and the non dimensional diffusivity d these two graphs directly give the evolution of the two investigated variables as a function of the two non dimensional parameters the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c decreases as k increases and d decreases fig 3a within the ranges of parameter values considered in this study this non dimensional amplitude varies between 1 and 0 78 the unity value corresponds to an impermeable lower reservoir without any quarry rock medium water exchange the non dimensional distance of influence increases with d and is independent of k fig 3b as the isovalue curves are globally horizontal this non dimensional distance of influence is included between 0 and 30 for the considered parameters values the two graphs of fig 3 also enable to analyse the impact of pump storage systems as a function of all dimensional parameters defining k and d for any specific context related to the rock hydraulic properties to the quarry dimensions and the pump storage configuration results of fig 3 allow specifying the potential water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence 3 1 1 influence of the rock medium hydraulic properties a change of hydraulic conductivity implies a displacement along the 1 1 direction fig 3 as the hydraulic conductivity defines both k and d non dimensional parameters eqs 14 and 15 the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry decreases and the distance of influence in the rock increases as the hydraulic conductivity of the rock increases these effects are logically explained by higher water exchanges and an easier propagation of the induced stress in a more permeable rock media a change of specific yield implies a displacement along the vertical direction when the specific yield value increases both the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry fig 3a and the non dimensional distance of influence fig 3b decreases due to more important storage effects in the rock an equivalent increase in hydraulic conductivity and specific yield implies a displacement along the horizontal direction in this context the change regarding the water level fluctuations amplitude in the quarry is more important conversely there is no effect on the non dimensional distance of influence 3 1 2 influence of the quarry dimensions using a larger quarry and similar stresses logically induces smaller absolute fluctuations in the quarry and in the surrounding environment any pumped or injected water volume is actually distributed over a larger quarry volume additionally the interface between the quarry and the rock media is also increased inducing potentially different quarry rock interactions to figure out the impact of the quarry dimensions in a more tangible way a change of the quarry surface may be considered keeping the parameter η c constant in this case the maximum value of the sinusoidal flow rate q max is increased by the same ratio as the quarry surface s so that water level fluctuations are only differing due to the potentially different quarry rock media interactions a similar increase of s and q max induces a decrease of k and has no effect on d resulting in a horizontal displacement to the left on the graphs of fig 3 therefore the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry increases towards the unity value in other words the attenuation of the water level fluctuations in the quarry is relatively less important for a larger quarry this observation may be explained by the fact that the water volumes exchanged between the quarry and the rock media increase with the perimeter of the quarry these volumes are however distributed over the whole quarry surface which increases faster than the perimeter in a similar context keeping the parameter η c constant the non dimensional distance of influence in the rock media is not influenced by the quarry surface 3 1 3 impact of the frequency of the pump storage stresses in the quarry the frequency of the pumping injection flow rates prescribed in the quarry is depending on the electricity market prices and on the instantaneous regional electricity production and demand this frequency is therefore variable across the day but may be approximately considered as included between one and a few hours european commission 2017 the impact of the frequency may be discussed on the graphs of fig 3 in a similar way as for the quarry dimensions keeping the parameter η c constant in this context q max must vary in the same proportion as the frequency or in inverse proportion to the period τ it also means that the same water volumes are pumped injected during a single pump storage cycle an increase of the period τ a decrease of the frequency keeping η c constant induces a similar increase of k and d resulting in displacement along the 1 1 direction towards the top right graphs corners fig 3 these changes result in a decrease of the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and an increase of the non dimensional distance of influence in other words results generally show that the interactions quarry rock media are more important in terms of exchanged groundwater volumes and distance of propagation with the decrease of the pump storage stresses frequency 3 1 4 impact of a regional hydraulic head gradient at the scale of the modelled area a regional groundwater head gradient is usually observed and induces natural groundwater flow around open pit quarries to assess the influence of this regional gradient on the water level fluctuations in the quarry and on the distance of influence in the rock media all simulations performed in previous sections were reproduced considering a uniform hydraulic gradient ranging from 0 1 to 2 over the modelled area these gradient values are commonly observed in belgian aquifers dassargues and walraevens 2014 for all models and simulations the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence upstream and downstream the quarry have been calculated results not shown here indicate that the amplitude of the water levels fluctuations in the quarry is similar to the corresponding homogeneous case without regional hydraulic head gradient regarding the environmental impact around the quarry the distance of influence upstream the quarry is slightly longer than downstream however the difference compared to the corresponding case without regional gradient is very small in all cases and simulations this difference is lower than 2 3 2 pump storage operations in heterogeneous rock media the heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties may influence substantially the flow and propagation of any stress in the rock media the objective is here to understand and quantify the impact of a single fracture on a pump storage system regarding the water level fluctuations in the quarry and the distance of influence in the surrounding rock media to assess this impact a linear fracture is introduced in the model grid using an equivalent porous media approach the width of the fracture is supposed to be the width of a grid cell row the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and porosity are calculated using the following equations the transmissivity of the fracture t frac is calculated using the poiseuille flow equation 23 t frac ρ g a frac 3 12 μ ρ density of water kg m 3 g acceleration due to gravity m s 2 a frac aperture of the fracture m μ dynamic viscosity of water kg m 1 s 1 the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fracture k frac is calculated as 24 k frac t frac a cell a cell width of the cells row where the fracture is implemented m the equivalent specific yield of the fracture s y frac is calculated as 25 s y frac a frac a cell the influence of the fracture is assessed as a function of its hydraulic properties and position the case of a fracture intersecting perpendicularly the quarry walls is first considered with different fracture apertures 1 10 2 m 1 10 3 m and 1 10 4 m secondly the case of a non intersecting fracture is also investigated with different quarry fracture distances 1 m 5 m and 10 m in all cases the fracture is perpendicular to the quarry walls and is extended to the external boundary of the model 3 2 1 influence of a fracture connected to the quarry the influence of the fracture depends on its aperture and related transmissivity regarding the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry the presence of a single fracture however has a limited impact this amplitude only slightly decreases with the increase of the fracture aperture taking into account all quarry dimensions and rock media properties considered in this study and a very large fracture aperture of 0 1 m t frac 8 1 102 m2 s 1 the maximal difference between the simulated normalized amplitude with and without a fracture is lower than 0 1 following the small impact of the fracture on the overall aquifer storage nevertheless note that the presence of several fractures fractured zones or karstic conduits could affect more significantly the storage and water levels in the quarry their presence and spatial distribution must be studied at the scale of any quarry used for pump storage systems although the influence on the water level fluctuations in the quarry is small the presence of a single fracture may nevertheless locally induce a more significant impact on the amplitude of the groundwater level fluctuations as the aperture of the fracture and its related transmissivity increases a preferential flow path develops and locally extends the distance of influence this effect is clearly shown in fig 4 as a function of the fracture aperture for several cases corresponding to a pump storage cycle period of 10 h a quarry surface of 100 100 m and qmax equal to 25 m3 s 1 this local distance of influence also depends on the hydraulic properties of the adjacent rock matrix the groundwater level fluctuations generated and propagating in the fracture actually dissipate in the bordering rock matrix following the same processes as those reported in section 3 1 as presented in fig 4 the non dimensional distance of influence d in the fracture increases with the decrease of the rock matrix transmissivity and specific yield or decrease of k and or d generally depending on these properties and the aperture of the fracture the non dimensional distance of influence may sharply increase compared to the non dimensional distance of influence in the porous rock media the affected area around the fracture increases with the diffusivity of the rock matrix d note that for very thin fractures results correspond to the homogeneous cases the impact of the fracture becomes logically visible when the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fracture k frac is greater than the matrix hydraulic conductivity note also that calculations are not yet relevant when the distance of influence goes beyond the limits of the modelled area and interacts with the prescribed boundary conditions on the graph of fig 4 this limit approximately corresponds to a non dimensional distance of influence equal to 125 3 2 2 influence of a fracture disconnected from the quarry this section investigates the impact of a fracture located at a specific distance from the quarry the implemented fracture is still perpendicular to the quarry walls but is limited in space and does not intersect it fig 5 shows the calculated distance of influence in the fracture direction as a function of its distance to the quarry for different cases of rock matrix hydraulic properties in this example the aperture of the fracture is equal to 4 10 3 m to maximise the potential effects of the fracture within the range of values for which interactions with the domain limits remain negligible note that when the distance between the quarry and the fracture is equal to zero the results correspond to the case of an intersecting fracture see previous section 3 2 1 for comparison results shown in fig 5 are interpreted as the propagation of the groundwater level fluctuations in two successive different media the rock matrix and the fracture if the fracture is located beyond the non dimensional distance of influence d corresponding to the homogenous rock matrix the effect of the fracture is logically not visible this is clearly illustrated in fig 5 for the rock matrix characterized by a low non dimensional exchange capacity k red curves for this rock matrix the distance of influence is very short and equal to a few meters see section 3 1 as a consequence when the fracture is moved away from the quarry walls the distance of influence rapidly drops from the high values corresponding to the case where the fracture is connected to the quarry section 3 2 1 to the low values corresponding to the homogeneous rock media if the fracture is located within the distance of influence corresponding to the homogenous rock matrix the fracture induces a local distortion and an elongation of the impacted area between the quarry and the fracture groundwater level fluctuations are first attenuated in the porous rock matrix the residual fluctuations then propagate in the fracture this effect can be observed on the blue curves of fig 5 which correspond to a rock matrix characterized by a non dimensional exchange capacity k of 10 2 and two different non dimensional diffusivity d values for these cases the influence of the fracture remains strong even if this fracture is disconnected from the quarry for longer distances between the quarry walls and the fracture the distance of influence tends again to values corresponding to the homogeneous cases as a conclusion the influence of disconnected fractures on the shape of the zone impacted by pump storage operations appears limited in many cases and strongly depends on the rock matrix hydraulic properties from a general point of view and considering realistic rock properties favourable conditions to observe a significant influence would correspond to high values of d and small values of sy this case may combine large zones around the quarry where disconnected fractures remain influent and adequate conditions for pressure propagation into the fracture 4 discussions in terms of pump storage application the results presented above show that the impact of geology and hydrogeology on the water level fluctuations in the quarry are somehow limited considering the used values in fig 3 the non dimensional amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry δ h c is included between 1 00 and 0 78 values lower than 1 00 are explained by exchanged groundwater volumes during pump storage cycles between the quarry and the rock medium the lowest value correspond to the most permeable and most porous rocks in the worst case it corresponds to a decrease of 22 however small this difference may be important regarding the hydroelectricity production the system setup and its profitability pujades et al 2017 the evolution through time of the water level in the quarry actually also influences the maximum drop of elevation between the upper and lower reservoirs which determines the electricity power production this may be particularly significant if the elevation difference between the two reservoirs is small compared to the water level fluctuation amplitude in the quarry calculating accurately these expected fluctuations is also important to setup running operations especially regarding the location of particular equipment such as turbines or water pumping pipes finally planning accurately these fluctuations enables to manage possible stability issues which may occur along the quarry walls or within old backfills frequently observed in rock exploitations the distance of influence is much more sensitive in fig 3b the non dimensional distance of influence d around the quarry is included between 0 5 and 25 higher values correspond to more permeable and less porous rocks as shown in section 3 2 this distance of influence may become substantially larger in the presence of heterogeneities such as specific fractures or conduits intersecting the quarry the influence area of the cyclic stresses around the quarry thus appears to be the most constraining geological factor when designing new pump storage systems the impact of induced water level fluctuations in the rock media must be verified and pump storage systems must be developed considering the different actors and the possible hazard or end users conflicts which could occur within this distance as examples they ideally must not interact with other existing pumping installations any stability problems such as soil subsidence or collapse must also be studied this is particularly problematic in limestone formations where potentially unstable weathered of karstified rocks are regularly observed kaufmann and quinif 2002 all these aspects may become critical factors especially in highly urbanized countries such as belgium to limit this distance of influence operators may potentially adapt the maximum pump storage flow rate q max and the cycles frequency 1 τ imposing a minimum frequency would actually constitute an efficient strategy to decrease the distance of influence and mitigate the impact of pump storage operations on the environment section 3 1 3 the stresses frequency historically operated in some existing high voltage pump storage electrical stations is about two cycles a day in this case the objective is mainly to manage the higher electricity demands in the morning and the evening currently the idea of implementing medium voltage stations across the territory is also to be able to accommodate the intermittent energy production from renewable sources ex wind turbines photovoltaic systems in this context the frequency of the pumping injection cycles in the quarry are expected to be much more variable including higher frequency values potentially contributing to less important distance of influence despite potential obstacles that may complicate the practical implementation of pump storage systems in quarries many development possibilities seem to exist in south of belgium walloon region 16844 km2 poty and chevalier 2004 have inventoried almost one thousand open pit quarries located in the administrative and official extracting areas although many other sites exist remacle 2009 this inventory generally gathers the most important open pits in terms of dimensions among them about 25 are actually still operated topographic conditions would allow developing pump storage systems in some of these sites they may be imagined in the old flooded quarries or even in the quarries still in operations with dewatering in this latter case the whole depth of the open pit could potentially be used maximizing the elevation drop between the upper and lower reservoir but a large part of the quarry should however be reserved for water storage and excluded from any extracting operation quarries are located in various rock types poty and chevalier 2004 with different hydraulic properties and dimensions for illustration purpose table 1 shows four simplified examples representative of the variety of existing quarries where pump storage systems could possibly be installed pumping injection sinusoidal stresses characterized by a period of 10 h and a maximum flow rate of 25 m3 s 1 have been simulated in each of them fig 6 presents the simulated absolute amplitude δ h of the groundwater level fluctuations in the rock medium as a function of the distance to the quarry walls dimensional and more tangible results regarding water fluctuations in the quarry distance of influence and elevation drop potentially available are also presented in table 1 these results corroborate the conclusions of section 3 1 the distance of influence is generally larger for the rocks with the highest hydraulic conductivity values note that the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry i e at x 0 are not normalized here and are consequently primarily controlled by the open pit surface the larger the quarry the smaller the absolute amplitude specific hydrogeological studies will be needed to design future pump storage systems in any existing quarry in order to accommodate all specific conditions of the site each quarry has a specific surface depth shape geological structure rock texture etc and it was not possible or the objective in this study to consider all these specificities nevertheless presented results give guidelines on the most constraining issues of the problem considering the water volumes needed to reach a minimum cost effective power production quarries smaller than 100 100 m might hardly be used for pump storage applications using larger quarries the values of amplitude attenuation and distance of influence play an important role in the design of systems results calculated above for a homogeneous medium or for single fractures can be viewed as a first step for impact and feasibility assessment of the problem considering more realistic and complex conditions in terms of shape hydrogeology fractures is however necessary to specify impacts 5 perspectives and conclusions this study allowed assessing the hydrogeological interactions between a flooded open pit quarry and the surrounding unconfined rock media in the context of a pump storage system implementation in particular numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the hydrogeological properties and the pump storage system parameters on these interactions in a broader context most of previous studies about oscillatory pumping tests have generally focused on confined aquifers and smaller scales results of this study have shown that hydrological quarry rock interactions must be considered with caution for rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry and as a consequence the instantaneous electricity production results have shown that this effect is also greater as the surface of the lower reservoir is small with realistic hydraulic parameters values and quarries not smaller than 100 100 m the expected impact on the water level fluctuations reaches maximum 22 of the head fluctuations in an ideal quarry without loss in the aquifer some authors have also evoked the possibility to use old underground mines ex abandoned coal mine to implement pump storage systems e g bodeux et al 2017 pujades et al 2016 in this case the elevation drop between the upper and lower reservoirs thus the instantaneous produced electrical power could potentially be higher involved volumes and the equivalent surface of the shafts and galleries could conversely be substantially smaller maximizing the water level fluctuations in the mine bodeux et al 2017 investigate the possibility to use an underground slate mine for pump storage systems they have also highlighted the influence of these water exchanges on the efficiency of the system this present study has also assessed the impact of the pump storage cyclic stresses on the environment surrounding the quarry the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions and may be enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities the presence of fractures intersecting the quarry is crucial they may affect locally but significantly the distance of influence of the pumping injecting operations the impact around the stressed quarry thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump storage systems to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring adverse effects the implementation of a pump storage system in a flooded quarry imposes to characterize in details the hydraulic properties and structure of the surrounding rock media conducting cyclic field tests in the related geological formations may help performing this task this kind of tests are however usually carried out at much smaller spatial and time scales guiltinan and becker 2015 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 the question thus arises about the representativeness of achieved measurements and results in the context of pump storage systems in quarries moreover some authors have also highlighted a possible drift of calculated hydraulic parameters as a function of the stresses frequency therefore performing real case experiments with relevant frequencies and amplitudes could bring highly interesting information for a more realistic impact study this kind of large scale oscillatory pumping experiment would also provide opportunities for characterizing the large scale spatial distribution and structure of hydraulic properties around the quarry by inversion of the measured cyclic data at different observation points finally this study has shown that development of pump storage systems in flooded quarries for hydroelectricity production is possible from a hydrogeological perspective under specific conditions additional steps rely on the assessment of the other technical aspects such as the electromechanical equipment the integration of the produced electricity in the power distribution grids the adequacy with the power demand and finally yet importantly cost benefit aspects of such projects acknowledgements this research has been supported by the public service of wallonia department of energy and sustainable building in the framework of the

7433,an improved general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity is of importance for all groundwater modeling studies that include river aquifer interaction processes riverbed hydraulic conductivity k is one of the main factors controlling river aquifer exchange fluxes however the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k has not been adequately mapped as of yet this study aims to fill this void by combining an extensive field measurement campaign focusing on both horizontal and vertical riverbed k with a detailed geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two test sites along the belgian aa river omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river were calculated both horizontal and vertical riverbed k vary over several orders of magnitude and show significant meter scale spatial variation horizontal k shows a bimodal distribution elongated zones of high horizontal k along the river course are observed at both sections indicating a link between riverbed structures depositional environment and flow regime vertical k is lognormally distributed and its spatial variability is mainly governed by the presence and thickness of a low permeable organic layer at the top of the riverbed the absence of this layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical k and is related to scouring of the riverbed by high discharge events variograms of both horizontal and vertical k show a clear directional anisotropy with ranges along the river being twice as large as those across the river keywords riverbed hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity spatial variability slug tests standpipe tests variograms 1 introduction groundwater surface water interactions play an important role in a wide range of major present day challenges brunner et al 2017 an accurate characterization of these interactions is important for assessing river water quality and riparian ecology boano et al 2014 brunke and gonser 1997 woessner 2000 evaluating stream depletion due to groundwater extraction close to rivers chen et al 2008 lackey et al 2015 poff and zimmerman 2010 and predicting flood peaks and low flows fleckenstein et al 2006 kalbus et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 groundwater surface water exchange fluxes are mainly governed by the hydraulic gradient and hydraulic properties of the aquifer and riverbed sediments however riverbed hydraulic conductivity k can vary over several orders of magnitude and show a strong spatial variation calver 2001 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 chen 2000 2005 cheng et al 2011 genereux et al 2008 leek et al 2009 min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 the direct measurement of riverbed conductivity is however cumbersome and therefore often indirect data such as temperature measurements anderson 2005 anibas et al 2011 constantz 2008 hatch et al 2010 huang et al 2016 mutiti and levy 2010 or calibration of groundwater models are used to constrain riverbed conductivity kalbus et al 2006 in these approaches the riverbed is usually represented as one homogeneous geological structure boulton et al 1998 doppler et al 2007 fleckenstein et al 2006 and the spatial variability of riverbed conductivity is thus neglected however groundwater flow and heat transport modeling indicates that the heterogeneity of riverbed properties has a significant impact on river aquifer exchange fluxes irvine et al 2012 kalbus et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 salehin et al 2004 neglecting this spatial variation leads to a strong homogenization of fluxes through the riverbed kalbus et al 2009 moreover it can lead to a systematic underestimation of net river aquifer exchange fluxes fox et al 2016 kurtz et al 2013 salehin et al 2004 and may have important implications for streambed hydrochemistry nutrient cycling and biogeochemical gradients for the estimation of peak mass flows and for the transport and retention of contaminants boano et al 2014 kalbus et al 2009 a variety of methods can be applied to determine riverbed k due to differences in measurement scale and the directionality of the measurements different methods result in different estimates landon et al 2001 a distinction can be made between direct and indirect methods the indirect methods include numerical modeling cheng and chen 2007 cheong et al 2008 sophocleous et al 1995 yager 1993 tracer tests hatch et al 2010 huang et al 2016 mutiti and levy 2010 su et al 2004 lab permeameter tests levy et al 2011 and estimation of k based on grain size distribution of the riverbed sediments cheong et al 2008 lu et al 2012 shepherd 1989 song et al 2009 the disadvantage of these indirect methods is that they either result in large scale volumetric averages of hydraulic properties and are therefore not suitable for an analysis of spatial variability or they destroy the original structure and layering of the sediments kalbus et al 2006 to obtain information on the meter scale spatial variability direct or instream methods are advised these methods include slug tests cardenas and zlotnik 2003 cey et al 1998 leek et al 2009 rus et al 2001 ryan and boufadel 2007 sebok et al 2015 in situ permeameter or standpipe measurements chen 2000 2005 genereux et al 2008 min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 song et al 2010 and the combination of seepage meters and hydraulic gradient measurements levy et al 2011 rosenberry and pitlick 2009 wojnar et al 2013 seepage meters are inexpensive and relatively easy to construct kalbus et al 2006 however they are prone to failing and therefore the combination of seepage meters and hydraulic gradients to estimate k is not a prefered approach landon et al 2001 slug tests are cheap simple and relatively fast and provide information on the horizontal k of the sediments surrounding the screen interval butler 1997 they can be used to measure horizontal k of deeper sediments and the screen length can be adjusted to get estimates corresponding to different volumes of sediments standpipe tests are mainly used to estimate vertical k of a sediment column up to a depth of a few tens of centimeters and are recommended by landon et al 2001 for reliable in situ estimation of vertical k most studies on riverbed k focus on the coarse scale spatial variability chen 2005 cheng et al 2011 min et al 2013 or temporal variability datry et al 2015 however few studies have been performed focusing on the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k and hence there is a lack of knowledge on meter scale riverbed patterns cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured horizontal k at different depths in the riverbed with constant head injection tests chit along a meander bend of the prairie creek nebraska usa they found an elongated high k structure which was consistent with surficial observations of grain size distributions in a similar modern environment genereux et al 2008 analyzed the spatial variability of vertical riverbed k by performing 487 standpipe measurements at west bear creek north carolina usa they observed higher k v in the center of the channel compared to the sides and related this to changes in water depth and differences in flow velocity similar observations have been made by chen 2005 and min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 measured both k h and k v with respectively slug tests and standpipe tests at the holtum river denmark k h was highest at the depositional inner bend of the stream whereas high k v was observed at the erosional outer bend and near the middle of the river estimated k v was found to be related to the thickness of an organic streambed layer in recent years modeling approaches have been adapted to analyze the effect of heterogeneous riverbeds on the exchange fluxes between rivers and aquifers irvine et al 2012 kalbus et al 2009 kurtz et al 2013 tang et al 2015 2017 kurtz et al 2013 advise a stochastic field approach to model spatially heterogeneous riverbeds geostatistically reliable information on the distribution and meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k is needed as input for these stochastic techniques but in practice this information is not available tang et al 2015 2017 only few studies have reported on variograms of riverbed k variograms of horizontal k have been calculated by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and ryan and boufadel 2007 variograms of vertical k by chen 2005 genereux et al 2008 and cheng et al 2011 however often information at small lag distances is lacking furthermore these variograms are either omnidirectional or for one specific direction resulting in a lack of information on the directionality of the spatial variability this study is the first one to the knowledge of the authors that combines an extensive measurement campaign of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k with a thorough geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two sections of the aa river belgium both omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river are calculated for horizontal and vertical riverbed k these variograms are used to interpolate the k data resulting in detailed maps of riverbed k the main research questions explored in this research paper are 1 can slug tests and standpipe tests be used for an accurate and reliable characterization of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k 2 do riverbeds show significant meter scale spatial variability 3 can we adequately quantify the spatial variability and directional anisotropy of the riverbed sediments 2 study area measurements of riverbed k are performed at the aa river a typical flemish lowland river situated in the nete catchment fig 1 the river has a total length of 36 7 km an average discharge of 1 9 m3s 1 and a catchment area of 235 km2 it comprises about 15 of the nete catchment area the aa river has been straightened and canalized in the 1960s anibas et al 2011 the local geology consists of the tertiary deposits of 1 the formation of kasterlee consisting of fine sands with varying fractions of clay and 2 the formation of diest a heterogeneous iron rich sand deposit dov 2017 the riverbed sediments consist of fine sands with a varying fraction of organic matter in general more organic matter is present along the banks and in the center of the river some pool and riffle structures are present anibas et al 2011 the aa river system is a well studied system with respect to river aquifer exchange fluxes earlier studies like anibas et al 2011 2017 examined a river reach of approximately 1425 m in length limited by two weirs weirs 3 and 4 fig 2 or focused on the major tributary of the aa river along this reach anibas et al 2016 schneidewind et al 2016 the weirs are used to regulate discharge of the river resulting in relatively constant water levels throughout the year a measurement campaign focusing on riverbed k has not been performed at the aa river as of yet the field measurements presented in this work have been performed at two sections of the aa river separated by approx 900 m fig 2 but well within the reach of the earlier works of anibas et al 2011 2017 from here onward these sections will be referred to as the upstream section and the downstream section the upstream section consists of a 14 m long stretch of the river with an average width of 12 m measurements were performed in the summer of 2015 on eight transects along the river approximately 2 m apart one transect consists of twelve measurement locations with a spacing of 1 m across the river the other transects consist of five to six measurement locations with a spacing of 1 5 2 m fig 2 the average water depth during time of the measurements was 1 0 m with in general higher water depths up to 1 5 m in the middle of the river fig 2 the deeper channel in the center of the river is possibly related to the influence of weir 3 about 100 m upstream of this section peak discharges of up to 10 m3 d are observed at times when the level of this weir is lowered which could result in scouring of the riverbed at the center of the river at the banks a layer of organic matter is present on top of the sandy riverbed sediments at the left bank this layer can reach thicknesses of several tens of centimeters the downstream section consists of a 25 m long stretch of the river with an average width of 15 m measurements were performed in the summer of 2016 on eight transects with a spacing of approximately 3 m each transect consists of five to six measurement locations with a spacing of 2 m across the river at time of measurements the average water depth was 0 6 m and riverbed topography was fairly homogeneous fig 2 at the banks a layer of organic matter is present on top of the riverbed albeit less pronounced than at the upstream section 3 methods 3 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity in situ horizontal riverbed hydraulic conductivity k h is measured using pneumatic rising head slug tests fig 3 in total 220 slug tests are performed including 55 repeating tests to analyze repeatability of the measurements the gw1600 pneumatic slug test kit geoprobe systems salina ks usa is used to perform slug tests in a controlled manner a pneumatic manifold is installed on mini piezometers od 33 7 mm which are manually driven in the riverbed sediment these piezometers consist of a 0 25 m well screen slot size 0 65 mm welded to a drive point at the lower end and a stainless steel pipe at the upper end the slug test is initiated by pressurization of the piezometer with a hand pump forcing water levels down once water level is stable the release valve is opened instantaneously releasing air pressure the recovery of hydraulic head to its static level is recorded with a small diameter pressure transducer and hydraulic heads are monitored on a laptop in real time with the slug test acquisition sta software geoprobe systems salina ks usa this allows an assessment of the quality and reliability of the measurements in real time at each test location slug tests are performed at two depth intervals at 0 25 0 50 m and 0 50 0 75 m below the riverbed top for the upstream section and at 0 20 0 45 m and 0 45 0 70 m for the downstream section initial head displacements h 0 varied between 0 10 and 0 80 m duration of recovery to equilibrium head varied significantly from location to location with recovery times ranging from less than a minute to 30 min most tests took approximately 10 20 min based on the resulting recovery curves riverbed conductivities are calculated by the bouwer and rice 1976 method for partially penetrating wells in unconfined aquifers modified for anisotropy by zlotnik 1994 1

normalized heads in the range of 0 20 0 30 are used to calculate k h for fine scale tests the anisotropy ratio k h k v typically lies between 3 and 10 butler 1997 freeze and cherry 1979 with k v being the vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity for the mini piezometers used in this study the maximum error in the estimate of k h related to the uncertainty in the anisotropy ratio is 33 5 due to the presence of fine grained organic layers in the riverbed of the aa river an anisotropy ratio k h k v of 10 is assumed for the calculation of k h values freeze and cherry 1979 3 2 vertical riverbed conductivity vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity k v is measured using falling head standpipe tests fig 3 chen 2000 2005 in total 45 standpipe tests are performed including 8 repeating tests to analyze repeatability aluminum pipes id 75 mm are manually driven inside the riverbed until approx 0 30 0 50 m of riverbed sediments are trapped inside after reaching static water level the standpipes are manually filled with water and recovery to static level is recorded by data loggers duration of recovery varied strongly from location to location ranging from several hours to several days vertical hydraulic conductivities are calculated using the hvorslev 1951 method 6 k v π d 11 m l v t 2 t 1 ln h 1 h 2 with d the diameter of the pipe l l v the length of the riverbed sediment column trapped in the pipe l h the water level in the pipe relative to pre test static level l and t is time t the term m expresses the ratio of horizontal and vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity m k h k v solving eq 6 for ln h with t 1 the start of the standpipe test i e h 1 h 0 at t 1 0 gives 7 ln h k v π d 11 m l v t ln h 0 in this equation h is much more sensitive to k v than to k h especially for standpipe tests with a large l v d chen 2004 genereux et al 2008 for the ratio of l v d of the standpipes used in this study the maximum error related to the uncertainty in the anisotropy ratio m is 4 1 6 3 depending on the length of the riverbed sediment column trapped in the standpipe similar to the calculation of k h an anisotropy ratio k h k v of 10 is assumed for the calculation of k v values 3 3 variogram analysis an exploratory variogram analysis is carried out to assess the meter scale spatial variability in both the k h and k v datasets a variogram is a tool to investigate and quantify the spatial variability of a certain dataset the variogram is defined as half of the average squared difference between variable values separated by a lag distance h deutsch and journel 1998 8 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h x i x i 2 with n h the number of pairs and x i and x i a data pair separated by a lag distance h most geostatistical simulation techniques require a variogram model to reproduce the spatial variability in the dataset gringarten and deutsch 2001 first experimental omnidirectional variograms of the measured k values are computed and modeled to explore the overall spatial continuity of the dataset secondly experimental directional variograms along certain directions across and along the river flow direction are calculated and modeled the experimental variograms are manually fitted by variogram models that consist of the sum of a nugget and a spherical model 9 γ h 0 if h 0 c 0 c 1 3 h 2 a 1 2 h a 3 if 0 h a c 0 c 1 if h a with c 0 the nugget effect c 1 the sill minus c 0 and a the range geometric anisotropy is assumed for all directional variograms meaning that the only difference between the directional variograms is the range all the other parameters model nugget and sill are kept constant all experimental variograms are calculated and modeled using the stanford geostatistical modeling software or sgems remy et al 2009 based on the resulting variogram parameters spatially distributed fields of both k h and k v are interpolated using ordinary kriging 4 results 4 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity the calculated horizontal k ranges over more than two orders of magnitude varying from 0 08 m d to 18 34 m d with an average of 5 09 m d summary statistics for the entire dataset and for the upstream and downstream section datasets separately are shown in table 1 in general the datasets of both sections are comparable with slightly higher average k h at the upstream section 5 82 m d compared to the downstream section 4 34 m d the variance in the upstream section 21 47 m2 d2 is higher than in the downstream section 10 31 m2 d2 indicating higher heterogeneity in the upstream section histograms of both k h and are shown in fig 4 the total k h dataset is neither normally nor lognormally distributed the distributions of the upstream and downstream sections are comparable although the upstream section shows a bimodality which is less pronounced for the downstream section the error between repeating tests calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum measured k h divided by the average k h of all the tests at one specific location varies between 0 3 and 38 4 with an average error of 9 1 most of the repeating tests 43 were performed at the upstream section with errors ranging from 0 3 to 26 0 and an average error of 7 6 at the downstream section only 12 repeating tests were performed with errors ranging from 2 5 to 38 4 and an average error of 14 4 note that the average error is almost double as high in the downstream section compared to the upstream section this is related to the fact that in the downstream section in general only repeating tests were performed when a visual assessment of the first test indicated possible problems these repeating tests were therefore mainly performed in cases where the reliability of the measurements was already relatively low however these measurements are not discarded because these errors are relatively small compared to the spatial variability of the k h data 4 1 1 spatial variability point maps of the calculated k h values for the upstream and downstream section are shown in figs 5 and 6 these clearly indicate the spatial variability in the k h dataset in both lateral and vertical directions for the upstream section the variability is mainly present in the lateral direction with highest values in the middle of the river and lower values near the banks fig 5 especially at the left bank k h is low with kh values ranging from 0 08 to 3 4 m d and an average of 0 8 m d at the right bank values range from 0 3 to 15 5 m d and an average k h of 3 8 m d the average k h at the center of the river is 7 5 m d which is two times as high as the average of the right bank zone and almost ten times higher than the average of the left bank zone furthermore measurements close to both the left and right bank are missing because k of the sediments at these locations was too low to be accurately measured with the pneumatic slug test device the variability in the vertical direction is much less pronounced with only slightly lower k h values in the first depth interval 0 25 0 50 m compared to the second depth interval 0 50 0 75 m with average k h of respectively 5 0 m d and 6 7 m d an elongated zone can be identified with higher k values than in the rest of this section this zone is located near the center of the river slightly towards the right bank fig 5 the k h data of this section can be subdivided into a high k zone with an average k h of 9 4 m d and a low k background with an average k h of 2 8 m d the histograms of the high k and low k zones are shown in fig 7 the data in the high k zone is normally distributed while the low k background is lognormally distributed the combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background results in the bimodal distribution of the entire k h dataset of the upstream section fig 4 in the downstream section variability is more pronounced in the vertical direction than in the lateral direction fig 6 k h is significantly higher at the first depth interval 0 20 0 45 m than at the second depth interval 0 45 0 70 m with average k h of respectively 5 88 m d and 2 37 m d spatial variability is less pronounced in the lateral direction with average k h values for the left bank center of the river and right bank zones of respectively 3 0 m d 4 7 m d and 5 6 m d while k h is lower at the left bank compared to the middle of the river this is not the case for the right bank however at certain locations near the right bank it was impossible to drive the piezometer into the riverbed the location of this impenetrable zone is indicated in fig 6 moreover at some locations in this zone it was only possible to measure at the first depth interval as k h values in this section are in general higher in the first depth interval than in the second the relatively high average k h in this zone is possibly related to the absence of measurements in the second depth interval no clear lateral zones of either high or low k can be identified in the downstream section however a clear difference in k h with depth is identified with higher k h values in the first depth interval compared to the second histograms of these two intervals are shown in fig 8 k h in the high k first depth interval 0 20 0 45 m is normally distributed while it is lognormally distributed in the second depth interval 0 45 0 70 m the combination of these two populations results in a distribution that is neither normal nor lognormal fig 3 the bimodality is less clearly visible for this section because the mode of the normally distributed high k zone lies closer to the mode of the lognormally distributed low k zone 4 2 vertical riverbed conductivity the calculated vertical conductivities range from 0 002 m d to 3 20 m d with an average of 0 50 m d calculated k v ranges over more than three orders of magnitude summary statistics for k v are shown in table 2 histograms of both k v and ln k v are shown in fig 9 demonstrating a lognormal distribution standpipe tests are mainly performed at the upstream section it often took at least one day to reach equilibrium head before the test could be initiated and one to several days for the recovery test itself especially in the low k areas near the bank recovery was very slow 0 10 m d due to time constraints we decided to focus on the faster and more practical slug test measurements at the downstream section this is why standpipe tests were only performed at one transect at this section in total eight repeating tests were performed the error between repeated tests varied between 7 7 and 21 1 compared to the total range of values varying over more than three orders of magnitude this error is relatively low there is a slight increasing trend noticeable with each extra repeating measurement this is possibly related to the flushing of fine sediments due to the flow induced by the measurement 4 2 1 spatial variability point maps of the calculated k v values are shown for the upstream and downstream section in fig 10 these indicate a clear spatial correlation in the lateral direction for the upstream section we see a similar pattern as for the horizontal k vertical k is in general low at the banks and higher in the center of the river fig 11 much like for the horizontal k the vertical k is lowest at the left bank of the river with k v ranging from 0 002 to 0 16 m d with an average k v of 0 07 m d k v is slightly higher near the right bank with k v ranging from 0 002 to 0 34 m d and an average of 0 14 m d in the center of the river k v is significantly higher in this zone k v ranges from 0 04 to 1 58 m d with an average of 0 45 m d average k v in the center of the river is approximately 3 times higher than at the right bank and more than 6 times higher than at the left bank for the downstream section only 8 measurements were performed which are approximately located on one transect across the river k v ranges from 0 10 to 3 2 m d with an average of 1 28 m d average k v is about four times as high for the downstream section compared to the upstream section similar trends as for horizontal k are observed with lowest k at the left bank higher k in the center and highest k at the right bank however these observations are based on only a limited amount of measurements and should therefore be handled with caution 4 3 riverbed anisotropy for the upstream section measurements of both k h and k v at the same point are available for several locations on average horizontal k is about one order of magnitude higher than vertical k the calculated vertical k is representative for the top 0 50 m of the riverbed while the horizontal k is representative for the sediment at a depth of 0 25 0 50 m and 0 50 0 75 m this means we cannot directly compare k h and k v for the exact same volume of sediment however we can get an idea of the anisotropy by comparing k h of the first depth 0 25 0 50 m with the k v values for the top 0 50 m at 25 locations measurements of both k h at the first depth and k v are available the anisotropy ratio k h k v ranges from 3 8 to 229 with an average of 39 and a median of 15 the highest anisotropy ratios 50 are located near the banks while in the center of the river the anisotropy ratios are in general smaller 4 4 variogram analysis a detailed variogram analysis is performed on both the horizontal and vertical k data both omnidirectional variograms and directional variograms along and across the river are explored variograms are calculated for k and for the upstream section the downstream section and for the combined data of both sections in total 24 variograms are calculated an overview of the resulting variogram parameters is given in table 3 the omnidirectional variograms for k h and ln k h are shown in fig 12 the experimental variograms of k h are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 8 m2 d2 and a sill of 19 m2 d2 the nugget comprises 42 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 4 5 m while it is respectively 3 and 6 m for the variograms across and along the river flow the experimental variograms of ln k h are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 0 35 and a sill of 1 65 the nugget comprises 21 of the total sill the ranges are slightly larger for ln k h compared to k h with a range of 6 5 m for the omnidirectional variogram and respectively 4 5 and 8 m for the variograms across and along the river flow the omnidirectional variograms for k v and ln k v are shown in fig 13 only variograms for the upstream section are calculated because not enough data points were available for reliable variograms for the downstream section the experimental variograms of k v are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 0 04 m2 d2 and a sill of 0 15 m2 d2 the nugget comprises 27 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 8 m while it is respectively 7 and 9 m for the variogram across and along the river flow the experimental variograms of ln k v are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 1 and a sill of 3 3 the nugget comprises 30 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 7 m while it is respectively 5 and 10 m for the variogram across and along the river flow the variogram models for ln k v give a better fit than for k v in general for all variograms modeled sills are close to the variance of the datasets furthermore the same trend can be identified for both horizontal and vertical k variogram ranges along the river are approximately twice as large as the ranges across the river 4 5 spatial interpolation based on the modeled variograms a spatial interpolation ordinary kriging of both the horizontal and vertical k data is performed horizontal k is interpolated in three dimensions however for this a variogram in the vertical direction is needed because of the lack of measurements in depth it was not possible to calculate variograms in the vertical direction for our dataset the results of cardenas and zlotnik 2003 are used in which a vertical variogram of k h is calculated based on core samples taken in a meander of the prairie creek nebraska usa a river comparable in size to the aa river for the vertical direction a variogram range of 0 53 m was found as geometric anisotropy is assumed the other variogram parameters model nugget and sill are assumed to be the same as for the horizontal variograms 3d kriging is performed on a grid with cells of 0 05 by 0 05 by 0 05 m the left censored measurements near both banks provide prior information on k that should be included in the interpolation this information is included through simple imputation one value is used for all measurement locations close to the river banks this value is derived from the minimum k value for which a slug test was successful k h 0 08 m d and from minimum k v calculated based on successful standpipe tests near the banks k v 0 002 m d this way an estimated value of k h 0 05 m d has been derived for both banks the results of the kriging of k h for the upstream section are shown in fig 14 a clear elongated high k zone can be identified near the center of the river near the top of the riverbed fig 14a the high k structure is a bit more spread out towards the right bank the structure thins out with depth and the magnitude of k increases with depth it roughly consists of two zones of high k up to 15 m d separated by a zone with slightly lower k 7 9 m d k h is clearly lower at the sides of the river with the lowest values found near the left bank when compared to the map of the bathymetry of the river fig 2 the high k zone does not completely coincide with the channel incised in the riverbed it is located more towards the right bank no statistical correlation between k h and water depth is found the results of the kriging of k h for the downstream section are shown in fig 15 similar to the upstream section an elongated zone with higher k 7 m d in a low k background 4 m d can be observed although the contrast is less clear than for the upstream section this elongated zone is located near the center of the river and is only present in the top layer of the riverbed fig 15a the k of this zone decreases with depth and is not present in the deeper layers fig 15b furthermore a high k zone is located near the right bank at the upstream edge of the measurement area however the exact extent of this zone is not known in general highest k is found in the center of the river with lower k at the banks the right bank has slightly higher k than the left bank in the deeper layers fig 15b k is in general low 4 m d and relatively uniform no clear correlation between k h and water depth is found the 2d kriging map of ln k v of the upstream section is shown is fig 16 k v is highest in the center of the river with lower k v near the banks compared to the high k zone of the horizontal k the high k zone of vertical k is located more in the center of the river and is wider the high k zone coincides well with the incised channel visible in the riverbed bathymetry fig 2 in general k v is highest in the deepest parts of the river the correlation between depth and k v is more pronounced than for k h 5 discussion the results of the slug tests and standpipe tests show that riverbed k at the aa river varies over several orders of magnitude even at a relatively small river reach significant spatial variability is observed for both horizontal and vertical k the calculated riverbed k ranges from 0 08 to 18 3 m d for horizontal k and from 0 002 to 3 2 m d for vertical k these results nicely fit the range of 0 001 100 m d presented by calver 2001 based on an analysis of 41 sources reporting on riverbed k values the range of observed k in this study area corresponds with medium to fine sand and silt fetter 2000 this fits well with in situ observations of the riverbed material which consists of sandy sediments intermixed with varying fractions of organic matter horizontal k is on average about one order of magnitude higher than vertical k the anisotropy ratio k h k v ranges from 3 8 to 229 with an average of 39 and a median of 15 the highest anisotropy ratios 50 are located near the banks while in the center of the river the anisotropy ratios are in general smaller the high anisotropy ratios near the banks can be explained by the presence of a low k organic layer at the top of the riverbed this organic layer is only present in the first few tens of centimeters and therefore mostly affects the k v measurements even a thin layer of organic matter can reduce k v significantly sebok et al 2015 this means that k v is mainly dependent on the presence and thickness of this organic layer the slug tests measure k h at depths of at least 0 20 m which is generally below the organic layer and in the more permeable sandy sediments resulting in higher k estimates consequently the calculated anisotropy ratios are probably an overestimation sebok et al 2015 measured k h and k v and calculated anisotropy ratios for a lowland river similar in size to the aa river they compared k v estimates for the first 0 50 m of the riverbed with k h estimates at a depth of 0 50 m a similar organic layer near the top of the riverbed was observed anisotropy ratios ranged from 3 to 562 and from 0 5 to 1147 for two different time periods with an average of 104 and 125 and a median of 58 and 31 these anisotropy ratios are larger than those measured in the aa river this can be explained by the coarser sand deposits compared to the aa river average k h in sebok et al 2015 is larger than for the aa river k h avg of 13 3 m d versus 5 0 m d while average k v is in the same range k v avg of 0 8 versus 0 5 m d 5 1 statistical distribution of riverbed conductivity the k h data of the aa river show a bimodal distribution which is a combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background this bimodal character is especially clear for the upstream section several field studies report that the spatial distribution of horizontal riverbed k shows non gaussian features springer et al 1999 report a non normal bimodal distribution for k h measured in active reattachment bars of the colorado river this is explained by varying sizes of sediments deposited under different eddy velocities ryan and boufadel 2007 measured k h of the top of the riverbed 7 5 12 5 cm depth in a small urban stream in philadelphia usa the combined dataset is non gaussian although within each sediment layer is normally distributed leek et al 2009 found k h to be neither normally nor lognormally distributed in the touchet river washington usa a river comparable in size to the aa river cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured k h in a meander bend and found the data to be normally distributed they explain this by the fact that only channel deposits are analyzed if other facies were to be analyzed e g overbank deposits presumably a lognormal distribution would be found sebok et al 2015 report a lognormal distribution of k h based on measurements in the holtum river a gaining lowland river in denmark the k v data of the aa river shows a lognormal distribution various spatial distributions of k v have been reported in literature sebok et al 2015 found a lognormal distribution for k v based on standpipe measurements in the holtum river denmark cheng et al 2011 report a normal distribution for nearly all of the 18 analyzed test sites the influence of tributaries and the resulting mixing of different sediment sources is invoked as the reason for the non normality downstream of the confluences genereux et al 2008 show that k v is neither normally nor lognormally distributed and some of their histograms show a somewhat bimodal character min et al 2013 report that standpipe measured k v data is neither normally nor lognormally distributed while often lognormal distributions are reported for siliciclastic aquifers bjerg et al 1992 hess et al 1992 rehfeldt et al 1992 sudicky 1986 this is not a general finding in riverbeds genereux et al 2008 as illustrated by the range of different distributions of both k h and k v reported in literature no general conclusion can be drawn regarding the distribution of riverbed k it is site specific and depends on the governing sedimentation and erosion processes in the studied river 5 2 spatial variability of riverbed conductivity 5 2 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity horizontal riverbed k shows significant meter scale spatial variability at the aa river even at the meter scale at both sections an elongated high k structure is identified along the direction of river flow other field studies on riverbed k have reported on similar elongated structures cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured k h at a meander bend and identified a high k elongated zone which is likely related to deposition during one or more flood events the geometry of this structure compares well with grain size patterns of sediments in the river south esk bridge 1977 a comparable modern river springer et al 1999 identified elongated structures in reattachment bars sebok et al 2015 observed higher spatial variability across than along the river indicating elongated riverbed structures ryan and boufadel 2007 found a clear symmetry of k h with respect to the thalweg of the river channel higher k in the center of the river is explained by higher flow velocities flushing away finer sediments at the upstream section the elongated high k zone is located near the center of the river however it does not coincide with the channel incised in the riverbed in the middle of the river no clear link between water depth and k h is identified indicating that the high k structure might not be related to the flushing of fines due to high flow velocities an origin related to deposition of coarse sediments during a peak flow event as reported by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 is a plausible explanation another explanation is that the structure is not part of the riverbed but is part of the underlying aquifer formation of kasterlee and is related to the depositional environment of these pliocene sand deposits however the aa river is not a completely natural river and therefore it may very well be that the riverbed has been influenced by human interference the aa river has been straightened and canalized in the 1960s the impenetrable zone near the right bank at the downstream section is possibly a remnant of the original canalization at this location small wooden poles are observed in the riverbed at a distance of about 2 m of the right bank the same wooden poles are located right next to the right bank at other straight parts of the river these are presumably remnants of the initial bank reinforcement structures since canalization in the 1960s the aa river has started to meander again albeit very slightly as indicated by the position of the wooden poles the right bank has eroded about 2 m in approximately 50 years 5 2 2 vertical riverbed conductivity for the vertical riverbed k a clear distinction can be made between high k v in the center of the river and low k v near the banks similar observations have been made by chen 2005 genereux et al 2008 min et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 and sebok et al 2015 in a straight channel high k v is observed at the thalweg of the river genereux et al 2008 explain these changes in k v across the channel to changes in grain size linked to different flow velocities and therefore to the deposition and erosion of sediments sebok et al 2015 link k v values to the thickness of an organic sediment layer at the top of the riverbed a similar link can be observed for the aa river on top of the riverbed a layer of organic material is observed this layer is mainly present near the banks while it is absent in the deepest parts in the center of the river it is especially well developed near the left bank where it can be up to several tens of centimeter in thickness this can be explained by the fact that the upstream section is located in a slightly curved meander bend the left bank is situated at the inner bend the slope of the bank is relatively flat and abundant vegetation is present resulting in a larger accumulation of organic matter the right bank is situated at the outer bend and is much steeper and less vegetated the absence of the organic layer in the center of the river is possibly related to the formation of the channel incised in the riverbed topography fig 2 this channel is probably created by scouring of the riverbed due to peak discharges related to the lowering of the upstream weir weir 3 in view of this it seems that the spatial distribution of k v is mainly related to the presence and thickness of the organic layer at the top of the riverbed at the downstream section only eight measurements of k v are performed in general k v is higher at the downstream section than at the upstream section the organic layer is much less developed at this section only close to the river banks a significant organic layer is present the absence of the organic layer combined with the observation of high k v illustrates the importance of the organic layer on the spatial distribution of k v 5 3 variogram analysis variograms of horizontal k have been calculated by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and ryan and boufadel 2007 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured horizontal k at different depths in the riverbed with constant head injection tests chit along a meander bend of the prairie creek nebraska usa variograms across the stream were calculated for six different depths resulting in variogram ranges of 2 3 5 m furthermore a vertical variogram based on core samples was calculated resulting in a variogram range of 0 53 m ryan and boufadel 2007 performed slug tests at 7 5 12 5 cm depth at an 80 m reach of the indian creek a small urban stream in philadelphia usa experimental variograms across the river suggested symmetry with respect to the thalweg in the upper sediments and fractality in the lower layer the experimental variograms are not fitted with variogram models the variograms along the river suggest that the k data are random this could be caused by a lack of measurements at small lag distances the latter is a returning conclusion in most studies focusing on riverbed heterogeneity more measurements at small lag distances are needed to produce reliable variograms in the study of the aa river we made sure that enough measurements at small lag distance were available the variogram ranges calculated for k h across the aa river range of 3 m correspond well with the ranges reported by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 this study is the first to report on variogram models of k h along the river the variogram ranges along the river are two times larger than those across the river this corresponds with the observation of sebok et al 2015 that higher spatial variability is observed across than along the river variograms of vertical k have been calculated by genereux et al 2008 chen 2005 and cheng et al 2011 genereux et al 2008 analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of vertical riverbed k by performing 487 standpipe measurements at west bear creek north carolina usa omnidirectional variograms of ln k v were calculated resulting in variogram ranges of 3 24 m chen 2005 analyzed vertical k measurements from standpipe measurements in the platte river nebraska a river with a width of 150 400 m characterized by shallow water depths 0 60 m variograms of vertical k across the river are calculated showing a clear periodicity of spatial variation wave lengths indicating repetition of spatial correlation varied between 13 and 39 m this periodicity is related to the variation of water depth across the channel cheng et al 2011 performed a geostatistical analysis of vertical k measured with standpipe tests at 18 test sites along the same platte river variograms along the flow direction were calculated for 8 sites resulting in variogram ranges between 0 2 and 16 8 m the variogram ranges calculated for k v at the aa river data fit well in the ranges reported by genereux et al 2008 and cheng et al 2011 this study is the first to report on variogram models of k v both along and across the river for both horizontal and vertical k variogram ranges along the river are twice as large as those across the river indicating elongated riverbed structures in the direction of the river flow similarly cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and sebok et al 2015 also pointed out that higher spatial variability is observed across than along the river this indicates a link between riverbed structures depositional environment and flow regime in the river one should keep in mind that riverbed structures are related to the size and energy regime of the studied river the aa river is a relatively low energy system which allows the formation of aquatic vegetation near the banks resulting in declined flow velocities bal and meire 2009 the trapping of fine sediments and the development of an organic layer at the top of the riverbed only occasionally high peak discharges are observed at the aa river which can lead to important erosion and sedimentation events in larger rivers with higher discharges larger scale riverbed structures are to be expected this is illustrated by the large ranges and the periodicity in spatial variability observed for the platte river which has widths of up to 400 m the high energy flow regime prevents the formation of aquatic vegetation in the river channel resulting in the absence of a low k organic layer at the top and consequently higher vertical k in this study we performed 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests however such a large amount of measurements is often not feasible due to time or budget constraints the amount of measurements needed strongly depends on the specific objectives of a measurement campaign a study focusing on the meter scale spatial variability will need significantly more measurements than a study in which only the large scale trends are needed we analyzed the effect of reducing the amount of measurements on general statistics histograms variograms and the generation of maps of spatially distributed k for the horizontal k dataset of the upstream section 83 measurements three scenarios are defined for which random subsamples of the dataset are generated consisting respectively of 42 50 21 25 and 8 10 data points if only an estimate of mean riverbed k h is needed 10 20 measurements would already give a fairly good estimate however if the goal is to characterize the meter scale spatial variability and directional anisotropy of riverbed k a large amount of measurements is needed by reducing the amount of measurements by 50 valuable information on the statistical distribution and directional anisotropy is already lost however when using variograms based on the full dataset interpolation based on 25 50 of the measurements still resulted in relatively similar spatially distributed fields of riverbed k this means that when good quality variograms are available realistic realizations of riverbed k can be generated even when only a limited amount of measurements is available 6 conclusion this study improves the general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity and is therefore of importance for all future studies that include river aquifer interaction in particular these results can be used as input for groundwater modeling approaches aiming to analyze the effect of riverbed heterogeneity on river aquifer exchange fluxes in this study an extensive measurement campaign of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k was combined with a thorough geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two sections of the aa river both k h and k v display significant fine scale spatial variability even at the meter scale k h and k v vary over more than two and three orders of magnitude respectively for both slug tests and standpipe tests errors between repeating tests are relatively low compared to the spatial variability of riverbed k on average horizontal k is one order of magnitude larger than vertical k k h data of the aa river shows a bimodal distribution which is a combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background this supports the observation that the spatial distribution of k h shows non gaussian features k v is lognormally distributed as illustrated by the range of different distributions of both k h and k v reported in literature no general conclusion can be drawn regarding the distribution of riverbed k it is site specific and depends on the governing sedimentation and erosion processes in the studied river similar to other field studies elongated structures of high k h are observed an origin related to deposition and erosion due to high discharge events is most plausible however it is also possible that the observed structures are not part of the riverbed but part of the underlying aquifer and therefore related to the depositional environment of these pliocene deposits furthermore as the aa river is not a completely natural river human influence cannot be excluded for k v a clear distinction can be made between high k v in the center of the river and low k v near the banks the k v values can be linked to the presence and thickness of an organic layer at the top of the riverbed the absence of the low permeable organic layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical k and is related to the scouring of the top of the riverbed during peak discharges this study is the first to report on variograms of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k at the same study site providing valuable insights in the degree of spatial auto correlation and directional anisotropy in the riverbed k dataset both omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river are calculated these variograms are used to interpolate the k data resulting in high resolution maps of riverbed k for both k h and k v variogram ranges along the river are twice as large as across the river indicating elongated riverbed structures in the direction of the river flow this

7433,an improved general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity is of importance for all groundwater modeling studies that include river aquifer interaction processes riverbed hydraulic conductivity k is one of the main factors controlling river aquifer exchange fluxes however the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k has not been adequately mapped as of yet this study aims to fill this void by combining an extensive field measurement campaign focusing on both horizontal and vertical riverbed k with a detailed geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two test sites along the belgian aa river omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river were calculated both horizontal and vertical riverbed k vary over several orders of magnitude and show significant meter scale spatial variation horizontal k shows a bimodal distribution elongated zones of high horizontal k along the river course are observed at both sections indicating a link between riverbed structures depositional environment and flow regime vertical k is lognormally distributed and its spatial variability is mainly governed by the presence and thickness of a low permeable organic layer at the top of the riverbed the absence of this layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical k and is related to scouring of the riverbed by high discharge events variograms of both horizontal and vertical k show a clear directional anisotropy with ranges along the river being twice as large as those across the river keywords riverbed hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity spatial variability slug tests standpipe tests variograms 1 introduction groundwater surface water interactions play an important role in a wide range of major present day challenges brunner et al 2017 an accurate characterization of these interactions is important for assessing river water quality and riparian ecology boano et al 2014 brunke and gonser 1997 woessner 2000 evaluating stream depletion due to groundwater extraction close to rivers chen et al 2008 lackey et al 2015 poff and zimmerman 2010 and predicting flood peaks and low flows fleckenstein et al 2006 kalbus et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 groundwater surface water exchange fluxes are mainly governed by the hydraulic gradient and hydraulic properties of the aquifer and riverbed sediments however riverbed hydraulic conductivity k can vary over several orders of magnitude and show a strong spatial variation calver 2001 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 chen 2000 2005 cheng et al 2011 genereux et al 2008 leek et al 2009 min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 the direct measurement of riverbed conductivity is however cumbersome and therefore often indirect data such as temperature measurements anderson 2005 anibas et al 2011 constantz 2008 hatch et al 2010 huang et al 2016 mutiti and levy 2010 or calibration of groundwater models are used to constrain riverbed conductivity kalbus et al 2006 in these approaches the riverbed is usually represented as one homogeneous geological structure boulton et al 1998 doppler et al 2007 fleckenstein et al 2006 and the spatial variability of riverbed conductivity is thus neglected however groundwater flow and heat transport modeling indicates that the heterogeneity of riverbed properties has a significant impact on river aquifer exchange fluxes irvine et al 2012 kalbus et al 2009 mccallum et al 2014 salehin et al 2004 neglecting this spatial variation leads to a strong homogenization of fluxes through the riverbed kalbus et al 2009 moreover it can lead to a systematic underestimation of net river aquifer exchange fluxes fox et al 2016 kurtz et al 2013 salehin et al 2004 and may have important implications for streambed hydrochemistry nutrient cycling and biogeochemical gradients for the estimation of peak mass flows and for the transport and retention of contaminants boano et al 2014 kalbus et al 2009 a variety of methods can be applied to determine riverbed k due to differences in measurement scale and the directionality of the measurements different methods result in different estimates landon et al 2001 a distinction can be made between direct and indirect methods the indirect methods include numerical modeling cheng and chen 2007 cheong et al 2008 sophocleous et al 1995 yager 1993 tracer tests hatch et al 2010 huang et al 2016 mutiti and levy 2010 su et al 2004 lab permeameter tests levy et al 2011 and estimation of k based on grain size distribution of the riverbed sediments cheong et al 2008 lu et al 2012 shepherd 1989 song et al 2009 the disadvantage of these indirect methods is that they either result in large scale volumetric averages of hydraulic properties and are therefore not suitable for an analysis of spatial variability or they destroy the original structure and layering of the sediments kalbus et al 2006 to obtain information on the meter scale spatial variability direct or instream methods are advised these methods include slug tests cardenas and zlotnik 2003 cey et al 1998 leek et al 2009 rus et al 2001 ryan and boufadel 2007 sebok et al 2015 in situ permeameter or standpipe measurements chen 2000 2005 genereux et al 2008 min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 song et al 2010 and the combination of seepage meters and hydraulic gradient measurements levy et al 2011 rosenberry and pitlick 2009 wojnar et al 2013 seepage meters are inexpensive and relatively easy to construct kalbus et al 2006 however they are prone to failing and therefore the combination of seepage meters and hydraulic gradients to estimate k is not a prefered approach landon et al 2001 slug tests are cheap simple and relatively fast and provide information on the horizontal k of the sediments surrounding the screen interval butler 1997 they can be used to measure horizontal k of deeper sediments and the screen length can be adjusted to get estimates corresponding to different volumes of sediments standpipe tests are mainly used to estimate vertical k of a sediment column up to a depth of a few tens of centimeters and are recommended by landon et al 2001 for reliable in situ estimation of vertical k most studies on riverbed k focus on the coarse scale spatial variability chen 2005 cheng et al 2011 min et al 2013 or temporal variability datry et al 2015 however few studies have been performed focusing on the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k and hence there is a lack of knowledge on meter scale riverbed patterns cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured horizontal k at different depths in the riverbed with constant head injection tests chit along a meander bend of the prairie creek nebraska usa they found an elongated high k structure which was consistent with surficial observations of grain size distributions in a similar modern environment genereux et al 2008 analyzed the spatial variability of vertical riverbed k by performing 487 standpipe measurements at west bear creek north carolina usa they observed higher k v in the center of the channel compared to the sides and related this to changes in water depth and differences in flow velocity similar observations have been made by chen 2005 and min et al 2013 sebok et al 2015 measured both k h and k v with respectively slug tests and standpipe tests at the holtum river denmark k h was highest at the depositional inner bend of the stream whereas high k v was observed at the erosional outer bend and near the middle of the river estimated k v was found to be related to the thickness of an organic streambed layer in recent years modeling approaches have been adapted to analyze the effect of heterogeneous riverbeds on the exchange fluxes between rivers and aquifers irvine et al 2012 kalbus et al 2009 kurtz et al 2013 tang et al 2015 2017 kurtz et al 2013 advise a stochastic field approach to model spatially heterogeneous riverbeds geostatistically reliable information on the distribution and meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k is needed as input for these stochastic techniques but in practice this information is not available tang et al 2015 2017 only few studies have reported on variograms of riverbed k variograms of horizontal k have been calculated by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and ryan and boufadel 2007 variograms of vertical k by chen 2005 genereux et al 2008 and cheng et al 2011 however often information at small lag distances is lacking furthermore these variograms are either omnidirectional or for one specific direction resulting in a lack of information on the directionality of the spatial variability this study is the first one to the knowledge of the authors that combines an extensive measurement campaign of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k with a thorough geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two sections of the aa river belgium both omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river are calculated for horizontal and vertical riverbed k these variograms are used to interpolate the k data resulting in detailed maps of riverbed k the main research questions explored in this research paper are 1 can slug tests and standpipe tests be used for an accurate and reliable characterization of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k 2 do riverbeds show significant meter scale spatial variability 3 can we adequately quantify the spatial variability and directional anisotropy of the riverbed sediments 2 study area measurements of riverbed k are performed at the aa river a typical flemish lowland river situated in the nete catchment fig 1 the river has a total length of 36 7 km an average discharge of 1 9 m3s 1 and a catchment area of 235 km2 it comprises about 15 of the nete catchment area the aa river has been straightened and canalized in the 1960s anibas et al 2011 the local geology consists of the tertiary deposits of 1 the formation of kasterlee consisting of fine sands with varying fractions of clay and 2 the formation of diest a heterogeneous iron rich sand deposit dov 2017 the riverbed sediments consist of fine sands with a varying fraction of organic matter in general more organic matter is present along the banks and in the center of the river some pool and riffle structures are present anibas et al 2011 the aa river system is a well studied system with respect to river aquifer exchange fluxes earlier studies like anibas et al 2011 2017 examined a river reach of approximately 1425 m in length limited by two weirs weirs 3 and 4 fig 2 or focused on the major tributary of the aa river along this reach anibas et al 2016 schneidewind et al 2016 the weirs are used to regulate discharge of the river resulting in relatively constant water levels throughout the year a measurement campaign focusing on riverbed k has not been performed at the aa river as of yet the field measurements presented in this work have been performed at two sections of the aa river separated by approx 900 m fig 2 but well within the reach of the earlier works of anibas et al 2011 2017 from here onward these sections will be referred to as the upstream section and the downstream section the upstream section consists of a 14 m long stretch of the river with an average width of 12 m measurements were performed in the summer of 2015 on eight transects along the river approximately 2 m apart one transect consists of twelve measurement locations with a spacing of 1 m across the river the other transects consist of five to six measurement locations with a spacing of 1 5 2 m fig 2 the average water depth during time of the measurements was 1 0 m with in general higher water depths up to 1 5 m in the middle of the river fig 2 the deeper channel in the center of the river is possibly related to the influence of weir 3 about 100 m upstream of this section peak discharges of up to 10 m3 d are observed at times when the level of this weir is lowered which could result in scouring of the riverbed at the center of the river at the banks a layer of organic matter is present on top of the sandy riverbed sediments at the left bank this layer can reach thicknesses of several tens of centimeters the downstream section consists of a 25 m long stretch of the river with an average width of 15 m measurements were performed in the summer of 2016 on eight transects with a spacing of approximately 3 m each transect consists of five to six measurement locations with a spacing of 2 m across the river at time of measurements the average water depth was 0 6 m and riverbed topography was fairly homogeneous fig 2 at the banks a layer of organic matter is present on top of the riverbed albeit less pronounced than at the upstream section 3 methods 3 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity in situ horizontal riverbed hydraulic conductivity k h is measured using pneumatic rising head slug tests fig 3 in total 220 slug tests are performed including 55 repeating tests to analyze repeatability of the measurements the gw1600 pneumatic slug test kit geoprobe systems salina ks usa is used to perform slug tests in a controlled manner a pneumatic manifold is installed on mini piezometers od 33 7 mm which are manually driven in the riverbed sediment these piezometers consist of a 0 25 m well screen slot size 0 65 mm welded to a drive point at the lower end and a stainless steel pipe at the upper end the slug test is initiated by pressurization of the piezometer with a hand pump forcing water levels down once water level is stable the release valve is opened instantaneously releasing air pressure the recovery of hydraulic head to its static level is recorded with a small diameter pressure transducer and hydraulic heads are monitored on a laptop in real time with the slug test acquisition sta software geoprobe systems salina ks usa this allows an assessment of the quality and reliability of the measurements in real time at each test location slug tests are performed at two depth intervals at 0 25 0 50 m and 0 50 0 75 m below the riverbed top for the upstream section and at 0 20 0 45 m and 0 45 0 70 m for the downstream section initial head displacements h 0 varied between 0 10 and 0 80 m duration of recovery to equilibrium head varied significantly from location to location with recovery times ranging from less than a minute to 30 min most tests took approximately 10 20 min based on the resulting recovery curves riverbed conductivities are calculated by the bouwer and rice 1976 method for partially penetrating wells in unconfined aquifers modified for anisotropy by zlotnik 1994 1

normalized heads in the range of 0 20 0 30 are used to calculate k h for fine scale tests the anisotropy ratio k h k v typically lies between 3 and 10 butler 1997 freeze and cherry 1979 with k v being the vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity for the mini piezometers used in this study the maximum error in the estimate of k h related to the uncertainty in the anisotropy ratio is 33 5 due to the presence of fine grained organic layers in the riverbed of the aa river an anisotropy ratio k h k v of 10 is assumed for the calculation of k h values freeze and cherry 1979 3 2 vertical riverbed conductivity vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity k v is measured using falling head standpipe tests fig 3 chen 2000 2005 in total 45 standpipe tests are performed including 8 repeating tests to analyze repeatability aluminum pipes id 75 mm are manually driven inside the riverbed until approx 0 30 0 50 m of riverbed sediments are trapped inside after reaching static water level the standpipes are manually filled with water and recovery to static level is recorded by data loggers duration of recovery varied strongly from location to location ranging from several hours to several days vertical hydraulic conductivities are calculated using the hvorslev 1951 method 6 k v π d 11 m l v t 2 t 1 ln h 1 h 2 with d the diameter of the pipe l l v the length of the riverbed sediment column trapped in the pipe l h the water level in the pipe relative to pre test static level l and t is time t the term m expresses the ratio of horizontal and vertical riverbed hydraulic conductivity m k h k v solving eq 6 for ln h with t 1 the start of the standpipe test i e h 1 h 0 at t 1 0 gives 7 ln h k v π d 11 m l v t ln h 0 in this equation h is much more sensitive to k v than to k h especially for standpipe tests with a large l v d chen 2004 genereux et al 2008 for the ratio of l v d of the standpipes used in this study the maximum error related to the uncertainty in the anisotropy ratio m is 4 1 6 3 depending on the length of the riverbed sediment column trapped in the standpipe similar to the calculation of k h an anisotropy ratio k h k v of 10 is assumed for the calculation of k v values 3 3 variogram analysis an exploratory variogram analysis is carried out to assess the meter scale spatial variability in both the k h and k v datasets a variogram is a tool to investigate and quantify the spatial variability of a certain dataset the variogram is defined as half of the average squared difference between variable values separated by a lag distance h deutsch and journel 1998 8 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h x i x i 2 with n h the number of pairs and x i and x i a data pair separated by a lag distance h most geostatistical simulation techniques require a variogram model to reproduce the spatial variability in the dataset gringarten and deutsch 2001 first experimental omnidirectional variograms of the measured k values are computed and modeled to explore the overall spatial continuity of the dataset secondly experimental directional variograms along certain directions across and along the river flow direction are calculated and modeled the experimental variograms are manually fitted by variogram models that consist of the sum of a nugget and a spherical model 9 γ h 0 if h 0 c 0 c 1 3 h 2 a 1 2 h a 3 if 0 h a c 0 c 1 if h a with c 0 the nugget effect c 1 the sill minus c 0 and a the range geometric anisotropy is assumed for all directional variograms meaning that the only difference between the directional variograms is the range all the other parameters model nugget and sill are kept constant all experimental variograms are calculated and modeled using the stanford geostatistical modeling software or sgems remy et al 2009 based on the resulting variogram parameters spatially distributed fields of both k h and k v are interpolated using ordinary kriging 4 results 4 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity the calculated horizontal k ranges over more than two orders of magnitude varying from 0 08 m d to 18 34 m d with an average of 5 09 m d summary statistics for the entire dataset and for the upstream and downstream section datasets separately are shown in table 1 in general the datasets of both sections are comparable with slightly higher average k h at the upstream section 5 82 m d compared to the downstream section 4 34 m d the variance in the upstream section 21 47 m2 d2 is higher than in the downstream section 10 31 m2 d2 indicating higher heterogeneity in the upstream section histograms of both k h and are shown in fig 4 the total k h dataset is neither normally nor lognormally distributed the distributions of the upstream and downstream sections are comparable although the upstream section shows a bimodality which is less pronounced for the downstream section the error between repeating tests calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum measured k h divided by the average k h of all the tests at one specific location varies between 0 3 and 38 4 with an average error of 9 1 most of the repeating tests 43 were performed at the upstream section with errors ranging from 0 3 to 26 0 and an average error of 7 6 at the downstream section only 12 repeating tests were performed with errors ranging from 2 5 to 38 4 and an average error of 14 4 note that the average error is almost double as high in the downstream section compared to the upstream section this is related to the fact that in the downstream section in general only repeating tests were performed when a visual assessment of the first test indicated possible problems these repeating tests were therefore mainly performed in cases where the reliability of the measurements was already relatively low however these measurements are not discarded because these errors are relatively small compared to the spatial variability of the k h data 4 1 1 spatial variability point maps of the calculated k h values for the upstream and downstream section are shown in figs 5 and 6 these clearly indicate the spatial variability in the k h dataset in both lateral and vertical directions for the upstream section the variability is mainly present in the lateral direction with highest values in the middle of the river and lower values near the banks fig 5 especially at the left bank k h is low with kh values ranging from 0 08 to 3 4 m d and an average of 0 8 m d at the right bank values range from 0 3 to 15 5 m d and an average k h of 3 8 m d the average k h at the center of the river is 7 5 m d which is two times as high as the average of the right bank zone and almost ten times higher than the average of the left bank zone furthermore measurements close to both the left and right bank are missing because k of the sediments at these locations was too low to be accurately measured with the pneumatic slug test device the variability in the vertical direction is much less pronounced with only slightly lower k h values in the first depth interval 0 25 0 50 m compared to the second depth interval 0 50 0 75 m with average k h of respectively 5 0 m d and 6 7 m d an elongated zone can be identified with higher k values than in the rest of this section this zone is located near the center of the river slightly towards the right bank fig 5 the k h data of this section can be subdivided into a high k zone with an average k h of 9 4 m d and a low k background with an average k h of 2 8 m d the histograms of the high k and low k zones are shown in fig 7 the data in the high k zone is normally distributed while the low k background is lognormally distributed the combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background results in the bimodal distribution of the entire k h dataset of the upstream section fig 4 in the downstream section variability is more pronounced in the vertical direction than in the lateral direction fig 6 k h is significantly higher at the first depth interval 0 20 0 45 m than at the second depth interval 0 45 0 70 m with average k h of respectively 5 88 m d and 2 37 m d spatial variability is less pronounced in the lateral direction with average k h values for the left bank center of the river and right bank zones of respectively 3 0 m d 4 7 m d and 5 6 m d while k h is lower at the left bank compared to the middle of the river this is not the case for the right bank however at certain locations near the right bank it was impossible to drive the piezometer into the riverbed the location of this impenetrable zone is indicated in fig 6 moreover at some locations in this zone it was only possible to measure at the first depth interval as k h values in this section are in general higher in the first depth interval than in the second the relatively high average k h in this zone is possibly related to the absence of measurements in the second depth interval no clear lateral zones of either high or low k can be identified in the downstream section however a clear difference in k h with depth is identified with higher k h values in the first depth interval compared to the second histograms of these two intervals are shown in fig 8 k h in the high k first depth interval 0 20 0 45 m is normally distributed while it is lognormally distributed in the second depth interval 0 45 0 70 m the combination of these two populations results in a distribution that is neither normal nor lognormal fig 3 the bimodality is less clearly visible for this section because the mode of the normally distributed high k zone lies closer to the mode of the lognormally distributed low k zone 4 2 vertical riverbed conductivity the calculated vertical conductivities range from 0 002 m d to 3 20 m d with an average of 0 50 m d calculated k v ranges over more than three orders of magnitude summary statistics for k v are shown in table 2 histograms of both k v and ln k v are shown in fig 9 demonstrating a lognormal distribution standpipe tests are mainly performed at the upstream section it often took at least one day to reach equilibrium head before the test could be initiated and one to several days for the recovery test itself especially in the low k areas near the bank recovery was very slow 0 10 m d due to time constraints we decided to focus on the faster and more practical slug test measurements at the downstream section this is why standpipe tests were only performed at one transect at this section in total eight repeating tests were performed the error between repeated tests varied between 7 7 and 21 1 compared to the total range of values varying over more than three orders of magnitude this error is relatively low there is a slight increasing trend noticeable with each extra repeating measurement this is possibly related to the flushing of fine sediments due to the flow induced by the measurement 4 2 1 spatial variability point maps of the calculated k v values are shown for the upstream and downstream section in fig 10 these indicate a clear spatial correlation in the lateral direction for the upstream section we see a similar pattern as for the horizontal k vertical k is in general low at the banks and higher in the center of the river fig 11 much like for the horizontal k the vertical k is lowest at the left bank of the river with k v ranging from 0 002 to 0 16 m d with an average k v of 0 07 m d k v is slightly higher near the right bank with k v ranging from 0 002 to 0 34 m d and an average of 0 14 m d in the center of the river k v is significantly higher in this zone k v ranges from 0 04 to 1 58 m d with an average of 0 45 m d average k v in the center of the river is approximately 3 times higher than at the right bank and more than 6 times higher than at the left bank for the downstream section only 8 measurements were performed which are approximately located on one transect across the river k v ranges from 0 10 to 3 2 m d with an average of 1 28 m d average k v is about four times as high for the downstream section compared to the upstream section similar trends as for horizontal k are observed with lowest k at the left bank higher k in the center and highest k at the right bank however these observations are based on only a limited amount of measurements and should therefore be handled with caution 4 3 riverbed anisotropy for the upstream section measurements of both k h and k v at the same point are available for several locations on average horizontal k is about one order of magnitude higher than vertical k the calculated vertical k is representative for the top 0 50 m of the riverbed while the horizontal k is representative for the sediment at a depth of 0 25 0 50 m and 0 50 0 75 m this means we cannot directly compare k h and k v for the exact same volume of sediment however we can get an idea of the anisotropy by comparing k h of the first depth 0 25 0 50 m with the k v values for the top 0 50 m at 25 locations measurements of both k h at the first depth and k v are available the anisotropy ratio k h k v ranges from 3 8 to 229 with an average of 39 and a median of 15 the highest anisotropy ratios 50 are located near the banks while in the center of the river the anisotropy ratios are in general smaller 4 4 variogram analysis a detailed variogram analysis is performed on both the horizontal and vertical k data both omnidirectional variograms and directional variograms along and across the river are explored variograms are calculated for k and for the upstream section the downstream section and for the combined data of both sections in total 24 variograms are calculated an overview of the resulting variogram parameters is given in table 3 the omnidirectional variograms for k h and ln k h are shown in fig 12 the experimental variograms of k h are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 8 m2 d2 and a sill of 19 m2 d2 the nugget comprises 42 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 4 5 m while it is respectively 3 and 6 m for the variograms across and along the river flow the experimental variograms of ln k h are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 0 35 and a sill of 1 65 the nugget comprises 21 of the total sill the ranges are slightly larger for ln k h compared to k h with a range of 6 5 m for the omnidirectional variogram and respectively 4 5 and 8 m for the variograms across and along the river flow the omnidirectional variograms for k v and ln k v are shown in fig 13 only variograms for the upstream section are calculated because not enough data points were available for reliable variograms for the downstream section the experimental variograms of k v are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 0 04 m2 d2 and a sill of 0 15 m2 d2 the nugget comprises 27 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 8 m while it is respectively 7 and 9 m for the variogram across and along the river flow the experimental variograms of ln k v are fitted with a spherical variogram model with a nugget of 1 and a sill of 3 3 the nugget comprises 30 of the total sill the range of the omnidirectional variogram is 7 m while it is respectively 5 and 10 m for the variogram across and along the river flow the variogram models for ln k v give a better fit than for k v in general for all variograms modeled sills are close to the variance of the datasets furthermore the same trend can be identified for both horizontal and vertical k variogram ranges along the river are approximately twice as large as the ranges across the river 4 5 spatial interpolation based on the modeled variograms a spatial interpolation ordinary kriging of both the horizontal and vertical k data is performed horizontal k is interpolated in three dimensions however for this a variogram in the vertical direction is needed because of the lack of measurements in depth it was not possible to calculate variograms in the vertical direction for our dataset the results of cardenas and zlotnik 2003 are used in which a vertical variogram of k h is calculated based on core samples taken in a meander of the prairie creek nebraska usa a river comparable in size to the aa river for the vertical direction a variogram range of 0 53 m was found as geometric anisotropy is assumed the other variogram parameters model nugget and sill are assumed to be the same as for the horizontal variograms 3d kriging is performed on a grid with cells of 0 05 by 0 05 by 0 05 m the left censored measurements near both banks provide prior information on k that should be included in the interpolation this information is included through simple imputation one value is used for all measurement locations close to the river banks this value is derived from the minimum k value for which a slug test was successful k h 0 08 m d and from minimum k v calculated based on successful standpipe tests near the banks k v 0 002 m d this way an estimated value of k h 0 05 m d has been derived for both banks the results of the kriging of k h for the upstream section are shown in fig 14 a clear elongated high k zone can be identified near the center of the river near the top of the riverbed fig 14a the high k structure is a bit more spread out towards the right bank the structure thins out with depth and the magnitude of k increases with depth it roughly consists of two zones of high k up to 15 m d separated by a zone with slightly lower k 7 9 m d k h is clearly lower at the sides of the river with the lowest values found near the left bank when compared to the map of the bathymetry of the river fig 2 the high k zone does not completely coincide with the channel incised in the riverbed it is located more towards the right bank no statistical correlation between k h and water depth is found the results of the kriging of k h for the downstream section are shown in fig 15 similar to the upstream section an elongated zone with higher k 7 m d in a low k background 4 m d can be observed although the contrast is less clear than for the upstream section this elongated zone is located near the center of the river and is only present in the top layer of the riverbed fig 15a the k of this zone decreases with depth and is not present in the deeper layers fig 15b furthermore a high k zone is located near the right bank at the upstream edge of the measurement area however the exact extent of this zone is not known in general highest k is found in the center of the river with lower k at the banks the right bank has slightly higher k than the left bank in the deeper layers fig 15b k is in general low 4 m d and relatively uniform no clear correlation between k h and water depth is found the 2d kriging map of ln k v of the upstream section is shown is fig 16 k v is highest in the center of the river with lower k v near the banks compared to the high k zone of the horizontal k the high k zone of vertical k is located more in the center of the river and is wider the high k zone coincides well with the incised channel visible in the riverbed bathymetry fig 2 in general k v is highest in the deepest parts of the river the correlation between depth and k v is more pronounced than for k h 5 discussion the results of the slug tests and standpipe tests show that riverbed k at the aa river varies over several orders of magnitude even at a relatively small river reach significant spatial variability is observed for both horizontal and vertical k the calculated riverbed k ranges from 0 08 to 18 3 m d for horizontal k and from 0 002 to 3 2 m d for vertical k these results nicely fit the range of 0 001 100 m d presented by calver 2001 based on an analysis of 41 sources reporting on riverbed k values the range of observed k in this study area corresponds with medium to fine sand and silt fetter 2000 this fits well with in situ observations of the riverbed material which consists of sandy sediments intermixed with varying fractions of organic matter horizontal k is on average about one order of magnitude higher than vertical k the anisotropy ratio k h k v ranges from 3 8 to 229 with an average of 39 and a median of 15 the highest anisotropy ratios 50 are located near the banks while in the center of the river the anisotropy ratios are in general smaller the high anisotropy ratios near the banks can be explained by the presence of a low k organic layer at the top of the riverbed this organic layer is only present in the first few tens of centimeters and therefore mostly affects the k v measurements even a thin layer of organic matter can reduce k v significantly sebok et al 2015 this means that k v is mainly dependent on the presence and thickness of this organic layer the slug tests measure k h at depths of at least 0 20 m which is generally below the organic layer and in the more permeable sandy sediments resulting in higher k estimates consequently the calculated anisotropy ratios are probably an overestimation sebok et al 2015 measured k h and k v and calculated anisotropy ratios for a lowland river similar in size to the aa river they compared k v estimates for the first 0 50 m of the riverbed with k h estimates at a depth of 0 50 m a similar organic layer near the top of the riverbed was observed anisotropy ratios ranged from 3 to 562 and from 0 5 to 1147 for two different time periods with an average of 104 and 125 and a median of 58 and 31 these anisotropy ratios are larger than those measured in the aa river this can be explained by the coarser sand deposits compared to the aa river average k h in sebok et al 2015 is larger than for the aa river k h avg of 13 3 m d versus 5 0 m d while average k v is in the same range k v avg of 0 8 versus 0 5 m d 5 1 statistical distribution of riverbed conductivity the k h data of the aa river show a bimodal distribution which is a combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background this bimodal character is especially clear for the upstream section several field studies report that the spatial distribution of horizontal riverbed k shows non gaussian features springer et al 1999 report a non normal bimodal distribution for k h measured in active reattachment bars of the colorado river this is explained by varying sizes of sediments deposited under different eddy velocities ryan and boufadel 2007 measured k h of the top of the riverbed 7 5 12 5 cm depth in a small urban stream in philadelphia usa the combined dataset is non gaussian although within each sediment layer is normally distributed leek et al 2009 found k h to be neither normally nor lognormally distributed in the touchet river washington usa a river comparable in size to the aa river cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured k h in a meander bend and found the data to be normally distributed they explain this by the fact that only channel deposits are analyzed if other facies were to be analyzed e g overbank deposits presumably a lognormal distribution would be found sebok et al 2015 report a lognormal distribution of k h based on measurements in the holtum river a gaining lowland river in denmark the k v data of the aa river shows a lognormal distribution various spatial distributions of k v have been reported in literature sebok et al 2015 found a lognormal distribution for k v based on standpipe measurements in the holtum river denmark cheng et al 2011 report a normal distribution for nearly all of the 18 analyzed test sites the influence of tributaries and the resulting mixing of different sediment sources is invoked as the reason for the non normality downstream of the confluences genereux et al 2008 show that k v is neither normally nor lognormally distributed and some of their histograms show a somewhat bimodal character min et al 2013 report that standpipe measured k v data is neither normally nor lognormally distributed while often lognormal distributions are reported for siliciclastic aquifers bjerg et al 1992 hess et al 1992 rehfeldt et al 1992 sudicky 1986 this is not a general finding in riverbeds genereux et al 2008 as illustrated by the range of different distributions of both k h and k v reported in literature no general conclusion can be drawn regarding the distribution of riverbed k it is site specific and depends on the governing sedimentation and erosion processes in the studied river 5 2 spatial variability of riverbed conductivity 5 2 1 horizontal riverbed conductivity horizontal riverbed k shows significant meter scale spatial variability at the aa river even at the meter scale at both sections an elongated high k structure is identified along the direction of river flow other field studies on riverbed k have reported on similar elongated structures cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured k h at a meander bend and identified a high k elongated zone which is likely related to deposition during one or more flood events the geometry of this structure compares well with grain size patterns of sediments in the river south esk bridge 1977 a comparable modern river springer et al 1999 identified elongated structures in reattachment bars sebok et al 2015 observed higher spatial variability across than along the river indicating elongated riverbed structures ryan and boufadel 2007 found a clear symmetry of k h with respect to the thalweg of the river channel higher k in the center of the river is explained by higher flow velocities flushing away finer sediments at the upstream section the elongated high k zone is located near the center of the river however it does not coincide with the channel incised in the riverbed in the middle of the river no clear link between water depth and k h is identified indicating that the high k structure might not be related to the flushing of fines due to high flow velocities an origin related to deposition of coarse sediments during a peak flow event as reported by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 is a plausible explanation another explanation is that the structure is not part of the riverbed but is part of the underlying aquifer formation of kasterlee and is related to the depositional environment of these pliocene sand deposits however the aa river is not a completely natural river and therefore it may very well be that the riverbed has been influenced by human interference the aa river has been straightened and canalized in the 1960s the impenetrable zone near the right bank at the downstream section is possibly a remnant of the original canalization at this location small wooden poles are observed in the riverbed at a distance of about 2 m of the right bank the same wooden poles are located right next to the right bank at other straight parts of the river these are presumably remnants of the initial bank reinforcement structures since canalization in the 1960s the aa river has started to meander again albeit very slightly as indicated by the position of the wooden poles the right bank has eroded about 2 m in approximately 50 years 5 2 2 vertical riverbed conductivity for the vertical riverbed k a clear distinction can be made between high k v in the center of the river and low k v near the banks similar observations have been made by chen 2005 genereux et al 2008 min et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 and sebok et al 2015 in a straight channel high k v is observed at the thalweg of the river genereux et al 2008 explain these changes in k v across the channel to changes in grain size linked to different flow velocities and therefore to the deposition and erosion of sediments sebok et al 2015 link k v values to the thickness of an organic sediment layer at the top of the riverbed a similar link can be observed for the aa river on top of the riverbed a layer of organic material is observed this layer is mainly present near the banks while it is absent in the deepest parts in the center of the river it is especially well developed near the left bank where it can be up to several tens of centimeter in thickness this can be explained by the fact that the upstream section is located in a slightly curved meander bend the left bank is situated at the inner bend the slope of the bank is relatively flat and abundant vegetation is present resulting in a larger accumulation of organic matter the right bank is situated at the outer bend and is much steeper and less vegetated the absence of the organic layer in the center of the river is possibly related to the formation of the channel incised in the riverbed topography fig 2 this channel is probably created by scouring of the riverbed due to peak discharges related to the lowering of the upstream weir weir 3 in view of this it seems that the spatial distribution of k v is mainly related to the presence and thickness of the organic layer at the top of the riverbed at the downstream section only eight measurements of k v are performed in general k v is higher at the downstream section than at the upstream section the organic layer is much less developed at this section only close to the river banks a significant organic layer is present the absence of the organic layer combined with the observation of high k v illustrates the importance of the organic layer on the spatial distribution of k v 5 3 variogram analysis variograms of horizontal k have been calculated by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and ryan and boufadel 2007 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 measured horizontal k at different depths in the riverbed with constant head injection tests chit along a meander bend of the prairie creek nebraska usa variograms across the stream were calculated for six different depths resulting in variogram ranges of 2 3 5 m furthermore a vertical variogram based on core samples was calculated resulting in a variogram range of 0 53 m ryan and boufadel 2007 performed slug tests at 7 5 12 5 cm depth at an 80 m reach of the indian creek a small urban stream in philadelphia usa experimental variograms across the river suggested symmetry with respect to the thalweg in the upper sediments and fractality in the lower layer the experimental variograms are not fitted with variogram models the variograms along the river suggest that the k data are random this could be caused by a lack of measurements at small lag distances the latter is a returning conclusion in most studies focusing on riverbed heterogeneity more measurements at small lag distances are needed to produce reliable variograms in the study of the aa river we made sure that enough measurements at small lag distance were available the variogram ranges calculated for k h across the aa river range of 3 m correspond well with the ranges reported by cardenas and zlotnik 2003 this study is the first to report on variogram models of k h along the river the variogram ranges along the river are two times larger than those across the river this corresponds with the observation of sebok et al 2015 that higher spatial variability is observed across than along the river variograms of vertical k have been calculated by genereux et al 2008 chen 2005 and cheng et al 2011 genereux et al 2008 analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of vertical riverbed k by performing 487 standpipe measurements at west bear creek north carolina usa omnidirectional variograms of ln k v were calculated resulting in variogram ranges of 3 24 m chen 2005 analyzed vertical k measurements from standpipe measurements in the platte river nebraska a river with a width of 150 400 m characterized by shallow water depths 0 60 m variograms of vertical k across the river are calculated showing a clear periodicity of spatial variation wave lengths indicating repetition of spatial correlation varied between 13 and 39 m this periodicity is related to the variation of water depth across the channel cheng et al 2011 performed a geostatistical analysis of vertical k measured with standpipe tests at 18 test sites along the same platte river variograms along the flow direction were calculated for 8 sites resulting in variogram ranges between 0 2 and 16 8 m the variogram ranges calculated for k v at the aa river data fit well in the ranges reported by genereux et al 2008 and cheng et al 2011 this study is the first to report on variogram models of k v both along and across the river for both horizontal and vertical k variogram ranges along the river are twice as large as those across the river indicating elongated riverbed structures in the direction of the river flow similarly cardenas and zlotnik 2003 and sebok et al 2015 also pointed out that higher spatial variability is observed across than along the river this indicates a link between riverbed structures depositional environment and flow regime in the river one should keep in mind that riverbed structures are related to the size and energy regime of the studied river the aa river is a relatively low energy system which allows the formation of aquatic vegetation near the banks resulting in declined flow velocities bal and meire 2009 the trapping of fine sediments and the development of an organic layer at the top of the riverbed only occasionally high peak discharges are observed at the aa river which can lead to important erosion and sedimentation events in larger rivers with higher discharges larger scale riverbed structures are to be expected this is illustrated by the large ranges and the periodicity in spatial variability observed for the platte river which has widths of up to 400 m the high energy flow regime prevents the formation of aquatic vegetation in the river channel resulting in the absence of a low k organic layer at the top and consequently higher vertical k in this study we performed 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests however such a large amount of measurements is often not feasible due to time or budget constraints the amount of measurements needed strongly depends on the specific objectives of a measurement campaign a study focusing on the meter scale spatial variability will need significantly more measurements than a study in which only the large scale trends are needed we analyzed the effect of reducing the amount of measurements on general statistics histograms variograms and the generation of maps of spatially distributed k for the horizontal k dataset of the upstream section 83 measurements three scenarios are defined for which random subsamples of the dataset are generated consisting respectively of 42 50 21 25 and 8 10 data points if only an estimate of mean riverbed k h is needed 10 20 measurements would already give a fairly good estimate however if the goal is to characterize the meter scale spatial variability and directional anisotropy of riverbed k a large amount of measurements is needed by reducing the amount of measurements by 50 valuable information on the statistical distribution and directional anisotropy is already lost however when using variograms based on the full dataset interpolation based on 25 50 of the measurements still resulted in relatively similar spatially distributed fields of riverbed k this means that when good quality variograms are available realistic realizations of riverbed k can be generated even when only a limited amount of measurements is available 6 conclusion this study improves the general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity and is therefore of importance for all future studies that include river aquifer interaction in particular these results can be used as input for groundwater modeling approaches aiming to analyze the effect of riverbed heterogeneity on river aquifer exchange fluxes in this study an extensive measurement campaign of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k was combined with a thorough geostatistical analysis of the meter scale spatial variability of riverbed k in total 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two sections of the aa river both k h and k v display significant fine scale spatial variability even at the meter scale k h and k v vary over more than two and three orders of magnitude respectively for both slug tests and standpipe tests errors between repeating tests are relatively low compared to the spatial variability of riverbed k on average horizontal k is one order of magnitude larger than vertical k k h data of the aa river shows a bimodal distribution which is a combination of a normally distributed high k zone and a lognormally distributed low k background this supports the observation that the spatial distribution of k h shows non gaussian features k v is lognormally distributed as illustrated by the range of different distributions of both k h and k v reported in literature no general conclusion can be drawn regarding the distribution of riverbed k it is site specific and depends on the governing sedimentation and erosion processes in the studied river similar to other field studies elongated structures of high k h are observed an origin related to deposition and erosion due to high discharge events is most plausible however it is also possible that the observed structures are not part of the riverbed but part of the underlying aquifer and therefore related to the depositional environment of these pliocene deposits furthermore as the aa river is not a completely natural river human influence cannot be excluded for k v a clear distinction can be made between high k v in the center of the river and low k v near the banks the k v values can be linked to the presence and thickness of an organic layer at the top of the riverbed the absence of the low permeable organic layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical k and is related to the scouring of the top of the riverbed during peak discharges this study is the first to report on variograms of both horizontal and vertical riverbed k at the same study site providing valuable insights in the degree of spatial auto correlation and directional anisotropy in the riverbed k dataset both omnidirectional and directional variograms along and across the river are calculated these variograms are used to interpolate the k data resulting in high resolution maps of riverbed k for both k h and k v variogram ranges along the river are twice as large as across the river indicating elongated riverbed structures in the direction of the river flow this

7434,a new methodology based on the computational intelligence ci system is proposed and tested for modeling the classic 1d dam break flow problem the reason to seek for a new solution lies in the shortcomings of the existing analytical and numerical models this includes the difficulty of using the exact solutions and the unwanted fluctuations which arise in the numerical results in this research the application of the radial basis function rbf and multi layer perceptron mlp systems is detailed for the solution of twenty nine dam break scenarios the models are developed using seven variables i e the length of the channel the depths of the up and downstream sections time and distance as the inputs moreover the depths and velocities of each computational node in the flow domain are considered as the model outputs the models are validated against the analytical and lax wendroff and maccormack fdm schemes the findings indicate that the employed ci models are able to replicate the overall shape of the shock and rarefaction waves furthermore the mlp system outperforms rbf and the tested numerical schemes a new monolithic equation is proposed based on the best fitting model

release of an initially stationary fluid body the flow results in two bores known as the shock and rarefaction waves which propagate toward the down and upstream of the dam respectively the phenomenon is significant from two points of view first the possibility of loss of men s lives and property is rather high during and after the disaster this mainly depends on the time needed to warn the river downstream occupants recalling that there are about 800 000 and growing operating dams and dikes on earth this research topic has attracted the attention of hydraulic engineers second numerical simulation of dam break flow is complex and involves advanced mathematics and shock capturing models the need for such schemes is due to the sudden changes of the flow depth and velocity values in the results the significance of the problem also arises from its applications in a wide field of study including tsunami shock tube and other riemann problems engineers have developed numerous numerical models including advanced finite difference methods fdms luo and gao 2015 ouyang et al 2014 triki 2014 finite volume methods fvms aureli et al 2008 stecca et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 finite element methods fems isakson et al 2015 lai and khan 2016 ortiz 2014 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 triki 2013 and lagrangian methods akbari 2017 chang et al 2011 yang et al 2016 as solutions to the problem these numerical schemes also cover the shock capturing methods including the total variation diminishing tvd and flux corrected transport fct models boulahia et al 2014 ortiz 2014 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 nevertheless the need for the simultaneous computation of the governing equations considering the required iterations and constraints like the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition make these models computationally expensive lai and khan 2016 malekmohamadi et al 2008 moreover in order to obtain results with high accuracy these modeling techniques also demand extensive data sets this includes utilizing finer grid forms near regions with high gradients in the numerical results to solve this problem engineers have found an alternative soft computing devices to evolve solutions rather than solve a problem directly babovic 2005 this had led to the computational intelligence ci approaches which have been also used in hydraulic and hydrology engineering govindaraju 2000 kişi 2004 malekmohamadi et al 2008 these include support vector machine svm batt and stevens 2013 yu et al 2004 artificial neural networks ann babovic et al 2001 kazeminezhad et al 2010 and its direct extensions time delay neural network sun et al 2010 radial basis function rbf vojinovic et al 2003 gene expression programming gep elhakeem and sattar 2015 and the combination of these techniques ebtehaj et al 2018 safarzadeh et al 2017 for example babovic et al 2001 proposed a mathematical scheme to combine observations and numerical results in the framework of an ann system for accurate predictions this approach was later utilized by vojinovic et al 2003 by combining an extension of the rbf system with a deterministic pipe network model this hybrid model was able to minimize the prediction errors within wastewater pipe networks the availability of a quick solution to the dam break flow problem is significant especially if it is related to the occurrence of unforeseen events where men s lives are put at risk having a quick predicting tool to obtain the water depth and flow velocity values at a specific time in downstream of a dam would be valuable taking the idea from ci models capability to predict output data from a training and testing process this study proposes a novel idea to solve the dam break problem using two ci systems based on the exact solutions of the problem chanson 2008 chanson 2009 jain 2001 martins et al 2016 seyedashraf et al 2017 stoker 1992 the idea is to train two ann based models i e the rbf and multi layer perceptron mlp systems with a number of input output samples obtained by analytical results to validate the proposed models the predictions were compared with the respective finite difference and analytical results the advantages of the proposed technique are its simplicity high precision and its capability to extract new equations as direct solutions to the problem moreover there would be no obligation to start the calculations from t 0 s to the respective time or to consider restriction like the cfl criteria this study is structured as follows the second section describes the theory of 1d shallow water equations swes and its analytical solution section three explains the training data process for the mlp and rbf models and details the proposed methodology section four presents and compares the ci results with the analytical and numerical results finally the findings of the paper are summarized in the last section 2 theory 2 1 shallow water equations analytical dam break models are regularly extracted from the 1d swes which honor the boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure approximations a partial differential equation system expressed by three matrices demonstrating the flux vectors and flow

the hidden layers activation function the proposed mlp network was designed to have one input layer including five neurons two hidden layers with 8 in the first and 10 neurons in the second layer respectively there were also 2 neurons considered in the output layer moreover 350 epochs with the trainlm function were used as the training algorithm the tansig function was adopted as the

characteristics in this case the obtained model will have the ability to make predictions close to reality however if the number of these data gets unusually large and does not have the necessary dispersion over fitting occurs in the model this will result in the model s failure to make predictions of the out of sample test data babovic et al 2001 in this research the proposed ci models were trained by 4018 input data and the results for the flow depth and velocity parameters were put side by side the exact solution as a validation of the illustrated methodology the upstream and downstream water depths are selected among diverse ratios to help the models be applicable for out of sample test data the number of employed neurons and hidden layers have been chosen suitably to prevent over fitting moreover the training data are selected randomly from the input data and the number of epochs is not large the results are summarized in tables 2 and 3 and figs 5 and 6 according to the results the predicted flow depths and velocities are closely predicted by the mlp model however the rbf system was just able to predict the overall shape of the waves this superiority is more evident in figs 5 and 6 to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed models the test cases were also numerically simulated using the fdm lax wendroff and maccormack s schemes leveque 2002 the flow depth and velocities obtained by the test cases with l 300m and l 200m were considered here the depth inputs in the up and downstream regions of the barrier are h 0 7 m h 1 3 m h 0 20 m h 1 3 m and h 0 13 m h 1 5 m respectively dam break is a transient flow and the cfl stability standard must be honored while using numerical methods this procedure is significant to prevent the possible numerical divergence figs 7 12 compare the obtained results for finite difference mlp and rbf predictions and the analytical solutions in the finite difference framework the maccormack method is ideal for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws covering three important characteristics namely the conservative form predictor and corrector steps and the second order accuracy in time and space the scheme is comparable to the lax wendroff scheme for linear systems of hyperbolic equations this fact confirms what can be seen in figs 9 and 10 from the results it can be distinctly seen that the maccormack and lax wendroff methods have both failed to represent an accurate solution to the shock wave formation with similar errors in abrupt changes however the efficiency of the proposed models especially mlp can be confirmed for capturing the overall shock and rarefaction wave formation and location it can be seen that the rbf model shows a slight error near the abrupt changes in the h and u diagrams nevertheless the mlp system with its current configuration presents more accurate predictions and outperforms both the fdms it can be seen that the numerical models show false oscillations in the flow depth and velocity results near the sudden changes while the mlp network shows smooth predictions this approves the shock capturing ability of the model moreover in comparison to the lax wendroff and maccormack models the mlp and rbf systems are capable of producing results for a certain time t rather than having to conduct the computations from an initial time to t the numerical models used for dam break flow simulation face difficulties when used for cases with large upstream water depths h 0 and small downstream water depths h 1 in these cases a mixed flow regime arises which is a sub and supercritical co mixed flow regime when the value of h 1 h 0 is 0 138 henderson 1996 for h 1 h 0 0 138 the flow is subcritical throughout the domain furthermore for h 1 h 0 0 138 the flow is supercritical in the downstream of the dam and subcritical in the reservoir these co mixed flow regimes are difficult to simulate by numerical models moreover the numerical results i e the shape height and bore speed may considerably deviate from its analytical solution to replicate both flow regimes figs 13 19 compare the ci results with stoker s solution considering h 1 h 0 0 385 0 429 0 150 and 0 100 the results indicate that the mlp system is able to simulate the supercritical flow conditions precisely the computations were performed using the matlab software on a pentium 4 operating system at 2 2 ghz and 3 gigs ram it took about 4 81s to compute the water surface levels using stoker s analytical solution for 100 nodes the average time for the finite difference computations with the same grid configuration was 8 09s while the cpu time for the mlp and rbf models were 1 73 s and 1 27 s respectively the following monolithic equations are derived from the mlp

the correct interval however the proposed equations in this study are monolithic functions this simplifies the required computation workload and reduce the cpu time another advantage of the proposed equations over the existing analytical ones is its capability to have matrices with the respective x and t inputs in this way the outputs can also be obtained as two matrices which also helps to decrease the required cpu time table 4 summarizes the employed parameters 5 conclusions the ability of a mathematical model to capture shock waves using a reasonable cpu time is useful in the context of shock capturing techniques in a wide assortment of applications like simulation of dam break and tsunami in this study a novel approach is introduced to solve the dam break problem using two ci models for the first time the mlp and rbf networks were applied to the classic dam break flow problem the following conclusions were obtained according to the results both the mlp and rbf system were capable of modeling the shock and rarefaction wave formation and propagation the mlp network outperforms the rbf system with its current configuration in terms of accuracy as a continuation of this research the analysis of the other configurations is under further investigation by the authors the proposed methodology can be used to simulate both the sub and supercritical dam break flows the predictions show similar results for the twenty nine test cases which approve the generality of the proposed ci models the proposed methodology is meshless which can be used for fast decision making for dam break flows especially arch dams unlike the literature this work does not deal with solving pdes or any kind of a numerical discretization in space or time there is no need to start the calculations from the initial conditions t 0 to a certain time to obtain the water depths and velocities a new formula was derived from the mlp system for the classic dam break problem unlike the existing piecewise analytical equations this is a monolithic and straightforward equation that can be used to directly solve dam break problems it was shown that both the mlp and rbf models are able to accurately predict the shock and rarefaction formations in a dam break flow problem this proves that these models can also be used to simulate any other riemann or shock dominated problems given the ability of ann to capture shock wave formation in dam break flow problem it would be possible to combine it with a classical numerical model hence a hybrid model can be obtained to predict the fluctuation errors in any shock dominated flow problem this model can modulate the oscillations in the next computational steps and be an alternative to the existing shock capturing models it is intended in the future to investigate this hypothesis and the application of the proposed technique to model tsunami and dam break flows over dry and oblique beds 
7434,a new methodology based on the computational intelligence ci system is proposed and tested for modeling the classic 1d dam break flow problem the reason to seek for a new solution lies in the shortcomings of the existing analytical and numerical models this includes the difficulty of using the exact solutions and the unwanted fluctuations which arise in the numerical results in this research the application of the radial basis function rbf and multi layer perceptron mlp systems is detailed for the solution of twenty nine dam break scenarios the models are developed using seven variables i e the length of the channel the depths of the up and downstream sections time and distance as the inputs moreover the depths and velocities of each computational node in the flow domain are considered as the model outputs the models are validated against the analytical and lax wendroff and maccormack fdm schemes the findings indicate that the employed ci models are able to replicate the overall shape of the shock and rarefaction waves furthermore the mlp system outperforms rbf and the tested numerical schemes a new monolithic equation is proposed based on the best fitting model

release of an initially stationary fluid body the flow results in two bores known as the shock and rarefaction waves which propagate toward the down and upstream of the dam respectively the phenomenon is significant from two points of view first the possibility of loss of men s lives and property is rather high during and after the disaster this mainly depends on the time needed to warn the river downstream occupants recalling that there are about 800 000 and growing operating dams and dikes on earth this research topic has attracted the attention of hydraulic engineers second numerical simulation of dam break flow is complex and involves advanced mathematics and shock capturing models the need for such schemes is due to the sudden changes of the flow depth and velocity values in the results the significance of the problem also arises from its applications in a wide field of study including tsunami shock tube and other riemann problems engineers have developed numerous numerical models including advanced finite difference methods fdms luo and gao 2015 ouyang et al 2014 triki 2014 finite volume methods fvms aureli et al 2008 stecca et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 finite element

these numerical schemes also cover the shock capturing methods including the total variation diminishing tvd and flux corrected transport fct models boulahia et al 2014 ortiz 2014 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 nevertheless the need for the simultaneous computation of the governing equations considering the required iterations and constraints like the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition make these models computationally expensive lai and khan 2016 malekmohamadi et al 2008 moreover in order to obtain results with high accuracy these modeling techniques also demand extensive data sets this includes utilizing finer grid forms near regions with high gradients in the numerical results to solve this problem engineers have found an alternative soft computing devices to evolve solutions rather than solve a problem directly babovic 2005 this had led to the computational intelligence ci approaches which have been also used in hydraulic and hydrology engineering govindaraju 2000 kişi 2004 malekmohamadi et al 2008 these include support vector machine svm batt and stevens 2013 yu et al 2004 artificial neural networks ann babovic et al 2001 kazeminezhad et al 2010 and its direct extensions time delay neural network sun et al 2010 radial basis function rbf vojinovic et al 2003 gene expression programming gep elhakeem and sattar 2015 and the combination of these techniques ebtehaj et al 2018 safarzadeh et al 2017 for example babovic et al 2001 proposed a mathematical scheme to combine observations and numerical results in the framework of an ann system for accurate predictions this approach was later utilized by vojinovic et al 2003 by combining an extension of the rbf system with a deterministic pipe network model this hybrid model was able to minimize the prediction errors within wastewater pipe networks the availability of a quick solution to the dam break flow problem is significant especially if it is related to the occurrence of unforeseen events where men s lives are put at risk having a quick predicting tool to obtain the water depth and flow velocity values at a specific time in downstream of a dam would be valuable taking the idea from ci

problem chanson 2008 chanson 2009 jain 2001 martins et al 2016 seyedashraf et al 2017 stoker 1992 the idea is to train two ann based models i e the rbf and multi layer perceptron mlp systems with a number of input output samples obtained by analytical results to validate the proposed models the predictions were compared with the respective finite difference and analytical results the advantages of the proposed technique are its simplicity high precision and its capability to extract new equations as direct solutions to the problem moreover there would be no obligation to start the calculations from t 0 s to the respective time or to consider restriction like the cfl criteria this study is structured as follows the second section describes the theory of 1d shallow water

of shock capturing techniques in a wide assortment of applications like simulation of dam break and tsunami in this study a novel approach is introduced to solve the dam break problem using two ci models for the first time the mlp and rbf networks were applied to the classic dam break flow problem the following conclusions were obtained according to the results both the mlp and rbf system were capable of modeling the shock and rarefaction wave formation and propagation the mlp network outperforms the rbf system with its current configuration in terms of accuracy as a continuation of this research the analysis of the other configurations is under further investigation by the authors the proposed methodology can be used to simulate both the sub and supercritical dam break flows the predictions show similar results for the twenty nine test cases which approve the generality of the proposed ci models the proposed methodology is meshless which can be used for fast decision making for dam break flows especially arch dams unlike the literature this work does not deal with solving pdes or any kind of a numerical discretization in space or time there is no need to start the calculations from the initial conditions t 0 to a certain time to obtain the water depths and velocities a new formula was derived from the mlp system for the classic dam break problem unlike the existing piecewise analytical equations this is a monolithic and straightforward equation that can be used to directly solve dam break problems it was shown that both the mlp and rbf models are able to accurately predict the shock and rarefaction formations in a dam break flow problem this proves that these models can also be used to simulate any other riemann or shock dominated problems given the ability of ann to capture shock wave formation in dam break flow problem it would be possible to combine it with a classical numerical model hence a hybrid model can be obtained to predict the fluctuation errors in any shock dominated flow problem this model can modulate the oscillations in the next computational steps and be an alternative to the existing shock capturing models it is intended in the future to investigate this hypothesis and the application of the proposed technique to model tsunami and dam break flows over dry and oblique beds
