2435,the globally adopted and computationally efficient curve number cn model fills an active hydrological professional niche and has a well documented history however it is structurally inconsistent and fails to reliably estimate runoff from rainfall this is mainly due to the much debated fixed initial abstraction λ and associated sudden jumps in runoff based on cn obtained from the documented tables in this study three new variants m4 m5 m6 of the cn model are proposed that consider the hydrological imbalance between pre storm soil moisture and initial abstraction after a rainfall event a total of 1837 rainfall runoff events were analyzed from 41 steep slope watersheds in south korea to test the robustness of the proposed cn models the results were compared to the recently updated original cn model m1 and two other recent variants m2 m3 of this model these models were evaluated using root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pb kling gupta

it is inferred that both λ and cn should be kept flexible for a systematic and region specific revision of the cn model to improve runoff estimation in addition a structurally consistent model with a stable soil moisture accounting sma procedure is vital to get more reliable runoff estimates without compromising the simplicity and applicability to ungauged watersheds keywords pre storm moisture content rainfall watershed curve number model inconsistency improved runoff data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the curve number cn model is very popular for predicting rainfall generated runoff it is the simplest globally tested model with rich literature and well documented use that accounts for the essential runoff generating characteristics of watersheds such as land use cover lulc soil type hydrologic soil group hsg and antecedent soil moisture condition amc oliveira et al 2016 shi and wang 2020 walega et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the majority of these watershed characteristics are integrated into a single highly sensitive parameter which is the cn fanta and sime 2022 pang et al 2020 since its development this model has become monotypic due to the lack of another competitor and has enjoyed a long history of application garen and moore 2005 hawkins 2014 with many creative extensions addressing a wide range of hydrological issues and challenges this model has been applied well beyond its simple origin in upland agriculture and has been embedded in various methodologies related to environmental impact assessment flood control sediment erosion and water quality across the globe hawkins 2014 the cn model is well regarded in the realm of applied hydrology and will continue to be at the forefront of hydrometeorological engineering design this model has experienced extensive hydrological and structural adjustments these adjustments include but are not limited to initial abstraction edwards 2017 hawkins et al 2019 ling et al 2019 different approaches to estimate cn ajmal et al 2020 lal et al 2017 interpretation of various soil moisture accounting sma procedures michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2010 santikari and murdoch 2019 singh et al 2015 verma et al 2017 wang et al 2012 rainstorm duration sahu et al 2012 shi et al 2017 cn slope factor ajmal et al 2020 huang et al 2006 and the general renewal of methodology hawkins et al 2019 several studies have debated model inconsistencies due to the fixed initial abstraction coefficient assaye et al 2021 lal et al 2017 verma et al 2021 yuan et al 2014 spatial and temporal changes in the cn values have led to misinterpretation of the model s applicability garen and moore 2005 muche et al 2019 despite the widespread and ongoing success the cn model faces serious structural inconsistencies stemming partly from uncertainty regarding intrinsic parameters and initial moisture conditions and partly from improper use of the underlying soil moisture accounting procedure michel et al 2005 different variants of this model have increased its complexity by incorporating new parameters but are unable to accurately estimate watershed runoff chung et al 2010 very little attention has been given to the mathematical consistency of the model michel et al 2005 or its ability to capture the sma procedure appropriate for the watershed verma et al 2017 however it is possible to modify the model structure without compromising its simplicity based on a better understanding of the underlying sma procedure michel et al 2005 recently several studies were conducted to incorporate the sma procedure in this model to improve its runoff predictive ability e g durán barroso et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2013 jain et al 2012 sahu et al 2010 2007 santikari and murdoch 2019 singh et al 2015 verma et al 2017 williams et al 2012 however the incorporation of new parameters reduces the simplicity and it becomes more challenging to optimize these new parameters in watersheds with limited data there is no stable and flexible foundation for variable amcs which can partially explain the inter event variability of the cn parameter verma et al 2020 and the model is incapable of capturing the watershed dynamics a sound sma procedure incorporated in the cn model is important for more realistic runoff prediction from a rainfall event because cn varies from event to event durán barroso et al 2016 kannan et al 2008 and it plays a vital role in estimating the amc at storm initiation kim et al 2018 any sma procedure must be based on the concept that when the pre storm moisture is higher more rainfall will be converted to runoff in other words all rainfall will become runoff for a saturated soil moisture condition michel et al 2005 to avoid a sudden jump in cn and its associated runoff michel et al 2005 pinpointed different structural inconsistencies in the original cn model to represent the dynamic and continuous response of a watershed to runoff they suggested an sma procedure that incorporates the integral effect of initial soil moisture content and rainfall on runoff generation singh et al 2015 analyzed the underlying drawbacks in the michel et al 2005 model and devised a structurally stable sma procedure for runoff estimation while refining the sma procedure shi et al 2017 found the empirical formulation for v 0 presented by singh et al 2015 inappropriate in some cases in response shi et al 2017 have increased the model complexity to use three parameters similarly verma et al 2017 presented a physically sound sma procedure based model however formulation of v 0 and threshold moisture sa were adopted from singh et al 2015 and thus the applicability of the model in ungauged watersheds is limited as calibration of the two coefficients α and β is required several other studies e g farooq et al 2022 kim et al 2018 kristanto et al 2021 shi et al 2021 shi and wang 2020 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2020 verma et al 2018 were conducted to improve the sma procedure and avoid quantum jumps in the runoff estimation as it is difficult to characterize the initial soil moisture content durán barroso et al 2016 the majority of the studies have associated the amc with rainfall records from the previous five days amatya et al 2022 bera et al 2022 bhuyan et al 2022 muche et al 2019 shi et al 2021 upreti and ojha 2022 however the use of fixed amcs misled the model results alternatively the sma procedure can be incorporated into the cn model to rectify the classical sudden jump and to get a more realistic runoff estimation ajmal et al 2016a durán barroso et al 2016 verma et al 2017 verma et al 2020 similarly different studies have used extensive rank and grading based approaches to evaluate and compare the models performance farooq et al 2022 rawat et al 2021 singh et al 2015 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2018 a comprehensive weighted score approach for different statistical indicators could be effective to evaluate the models performance realizing the structural inconsistencies and limitations of the cn model reported in various studies one objective of this study was to propose structurally consistent variants of the cn model and to avoid sudden jumps in runoff estimation without compromising the simplicity of its application in watersheds with limited data another objective was to introduce a new approach for assessing the credibility of models using overall weighted scores of different statistical indicators 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data to test the runoff estimation capability of the proposed cn model variants the hydro meteorological 2005 2012 and land cover data of 41 mountainous watersheds in south korea were collected from the korea meteorological administration kma and the ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit these watersheds are representative of the entire hydrometeorological setting of south korea ajmal et al 2020 ajmal et al 2016a ajmal et al 2015a the observed discharge was separated into baseflow and runoff using the eckhardt digital filter method xie et al 2020 the minimum mean and maximum rainfall runoff observed for 1837 events were 12 10 0 17 mm 80 01 38 10 mm and 519 68 364 38 mm respectively most rainfall events used in this study were large p 25 4 mm as the theoretical probability of runoff occurrence was 90 durán barroso et al 2016 the number of storm events in an individual watershed varied from 18 to 89 while watershed areas varied from 42 34 to 879 10 km2 forests are the dominant land cover in the study area followed by agricultural and urbanized land the soil is mostly loam and sandy loam with some proportion of silt loam ajmal et al 2016b the normal or average weighted cn values of the watersheds were determined from the documented cn tables based on the land use land cover lulc practices soil type hydrological soil groups hsg and antecedent runoff conditions nrcs 2004 these cn values are according to the fixed λ 0 2 adjusted cn values corresponding to λ 0 05 and slope adjusted cn with some other information on the observed data are given in table 1 2 2 existing variants of cn model 2 2 1 the nrcs latest updated model the updated natural resources conservation services nrcs cn model for runoff estimation nrcs 2017 is as follows 1 q p λ s 2 p 1 λ s p 0 05 s 0 05 2 p 0 95 s 0 05 f o r λ 0 05 where q is the runoff mm p is the rainfall mm λ is the abstraction coefficient and s is the maximum potential retention mm of the soil to adjust s from the previously used λ 0 2 to 0 05 the curve number task force nrcs 2017 recently developed a simple relation s0 05 1 42s0 2 introducing this relation into eq 1 and simplifying gives 2a q p 0 071 s 0 2 2 p 1 349 s 0 2 f o r p 0 071 s 0 2 for different land uses land cover types and hydrological soil groups the weighted cn0 2 for all watersheds was calculated and transformed to s0 2 shi et al 2017 verma et al 2020 using the following equation 2b s 0 2 254 100 c n 0 2 1 the documented tabulated values of cn0 2 and associated s0 2 usually reflect average watershed soil moisture edwards 2017 or normal antecedent runoff conditions arc ii instead of the so called amc ii the s0 2 values for drier arc i and wetter arc iii conditions were obtained by multiplying the values of the average condition by 2 2754 and 0 43 respectively mishra et al 2008 in terms of cn0 2 eq 2a can be represented as follows 3 q p 18 03 100 c n 0 2 1 2 p 342 65 100 c n 0 2 1 f o r p 18 03 100 c n 0 2 1 a n d c n 0 05 c n 0 2 1 42 0 0042 c n 0 2 2 2 2 wang et al model the initial soil abstraction is mainly dependent on the properties of rainfall events and the watershed characteristics assaye et al 2021 fu et al 2011 a sufficiently strong relationship is available between cn and rainfall characteristics chin 2021 soulis and valiantzas 2012 to obviate the sudden jump in runoff prediction of the cn model wang et al 2012 developed a modified sma procedure that integrates the effects of p and s without compromising the model s simplicity after their model simplification it was proposed to determine runoff q using the following equation 4 q c sat s e β p where csat is the runoff coefficient for saturated soil β is the fitting constant and se is the relative saturation csat se β is calculated from the logarithmic back transformation of a newly suggested function f s p as 5a f s p 0 143 l o g 10 s p 2 0 5981 l o g 10 s p 0 296 if s p 1 0 0 296 e x p 1 837 l o g 10 s p if 0 s p 1 0 0 if s p 0 hence eq 4 becomes 5b q log 10 1 f s p p during the derivation of this f s p relationship the number of parameters used in the model has increased from one cn to four however after the derivation a single parameter based model was developed to avoid a sudden jump in runoff estimation this new variant was compared to the original cn model and its other competitors that consider the sma procedure including the michel et al 2005 model sahu et al 2007 model and sahu et al 2010 model wang et al 2012 found their model to be simpler and superior in reproducing watershed runoff 2 2 3 verma et al model to improve the credibility of the cn model runoff prediction verma et al 2021 combined concepts from the mishra and singh 2002 and ajmal et al 2015b variants of the cn model and summarized three new variants of this model among these three variants of the cn model the following variant was found to be more reliable in predicting the runoff of 98 watersheds in the united states 6 q 0 98 p 0 98 p p 5 1 26 s 0 63 0 98 p p 5 1 26 s 0 63 s where p5 is the previous five day rainfall before the onset of a rainfall event and s s0 2 they compared the results of this variant of the cn model with nine other variants of the same model and found their runoff estimates more credible for most watersheds in the united states 2 3 development of the proposed cn model variants 2 3 1 proposed cn model variant 1 the analyses performed by wang et al 2012 indicate that the original cn model nrcs 2004 and its different variants proposed by michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2007 and sahu et al 2010 are inconsistent in accurately estimating runoff and need further modification for improved runoff estimation two new variants of the cn model are conceptualized after combining the original cn model the michel et al 2005 model and the event based gr4j model ajmal et al 2015b because rainfall generated runoff typically lasts for a fairly limited duration the daily evapotranspiration can be neglected yuan et al 2014 the event based gr4j model for estimating runoff q in its cumulative form can then be represented as 7 q p v s s a 2 p v s v o i a 2 where v vo p q is the soil moisture for the cumulative rainstorm p vo is the pre storm moisture condition and s a v o i a for i a is the initial abstraction before runoff starts michel et al 2005 substituting the expression for v in eq 7 results in 8 q p v o p q s v o i a 2 p v o p q s v o i a 2 now the generalized cn model nrcs 2004 is 9 q p i a 2 p i a s the total loss for the cn model can be represented as the difference between p and q nrcs 2004 10 loss p q substituting eq 9 in eq 10 yields 11 loss p q p p i a 2 p i a s after multiplying and dividing the two terms on the right hand side of eq 11 by p i a s and simplifying it becomes 12 p q s i a p i a 2 p i a s now substituting eq 12 into eq 8 yields 13 q p v o s i a p i a 2 p i a s 2 s v o i a 2 after rearrangement eq 13 can be recast as 14 q p v o p i a s s i a p i a 2 p i a s s v o i a 2 to account for pre storm moisture contents and get a more realistic initial abstraction ajmal et al 2016a proposed the following modified relationship 15 i a λ s 2 s v o in their study michel et al 2005 found vo for dry normal and wet conditions these moisture conditions were differentiated based on p5 gao et al 2012 investigating the measured rainfall runoff data different land uses covers and variable moisture conditions from 140 watersheds in france vo was simplified as a fraction of s for dry normal and wet conditions as vo 0 33s vo 0 61s and vo 0 87s respectively michel et al 2005 for more realistic results and greater responsiveness to the watersheds the i a values could have been obtained for actual v o but the measured moisture content is not available and this study has to rely on the empirical relations from previous studies hence for λ 0 2 and vo 0 61s eq 15 gives i a 0 124 s substituting ia 0 124s and vo 0 61s and simplifying eq 14 gives 16 q p p 0 3 s p 0 876 s 2 for p 0 124 s in the above equation s is calculated using eq 3 by replacing cn0 2 with slope adjusted cns ajmal et al 2020 17 c n s 1 1 428 e 7 125 α 50 0 5 c n 0 2 c n 0 2 c n 0 2 75 43 c n 0 2 2 3 2 proposed cn model variant 2 to avoid a sudden jump in runoff estimation shi et al 2017 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 and use only a single s rather than the three s values used in the cn model s in eq 16 was replaced by s p p p 5 substituting this new relationship in eq 16 and simplifying gives 18 q p p p 5 0 3 s p p 5 0 876 s 2 f o r p 0 124 s p p p 5 eq 18 is very simple to apply where practitioners can only use the s corresponding to normal watershed conditions antecedent runoff condition ii arc ii p 5 in eq 18 is used to approximately adjust the value of s for dry and wet watershed conditions 2 3 3 proposed cn model variant 3 if rainfall magnitude is not considered in estimating cn it may lead to substantial runoff underestimation chin 2021 this newly modified cn model incorporated rainfall as an integral part of the initial abstraction to avoid the possible uncertainty in estimating runoff and is expressed as follows 19 q p i a 2 ap i a s b p i a 2 1 15 p i a s 0 87 f o r i a 0 3 s p p s 1 5 a n d p i a here the initial abstraction ia is adopted from jain et al 2006b note that s is the transformed value of the slope adjusted cn using eq 17 the rainfall runoff measured data from 30 randomly selected watersheds out of the 41 total watersheds was used to get the values of a and b the optimized values for a and b found using the nonlinear least squares levenberg marquart algorithm lma were 1 15 and 0 87 lma is a hybrid technique of the gauss newton method and the gradient descendent algorithm this algorithm incorporated the concept of the neural neighborhood for efficient nonlinear optimization based on the behavior of both the memory and time constraints kumaraswamy 2021 the models are described in table 2 the methodology flow chart is shown in fig 1 3 performance evaluation of models to quantitatively assess the performance of the models various statistical approaches were used these include root mean square error rmse adib et

respectively the rmse 0 nse 1 and pb 0 which shows the perfect agreement between the observed and estimated values moriasi et al 2007 like nse kge 1 shows perfect agreement between the observed and estimated values furthermore if the mean runoff is used for the kge benchmark all models with 0 41 kge 1 are believed to perform reasonably well knoben et al 2019 a model shows poor performance for 0 kge 0 5 rogelis et al 2016 and negative kge values make no sense andersson et al 2017 the models performance ratings based on the four statistical indices described above are shown in table 3 in addition to the above goodness of fit criteria the observed and estimated runoff were compared graphically ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 among these scatterplots of the cumulative observed and estimated runoff data from all watersheds were used to identify the best model for the intended purpose to avoid a lengthy procedure adopted in different studies to compare the models output based on their ranks e g ajmal et al 2015a jain et al 2006a singh et al 2015 verma et al 2021 new assessment criteria are introduced overall rmse nse pb and kge weighted scores rmsews nsews pbws kgews are used to identify the credibility of models based on agreement between observed and estimated runoff these weighted scores for all watersheds can be determined as follows 21a rms e ws σ m n rms e 1 1 2 rms e 2 1 7 rms e 3 2 7 rms e 4 3 2 21b ns e ws 1 n ns e 1 0 95 ns e 2 0 85 ns e 3 0 725 ns e 4 0 65 21c p b ws 1 n p b 1 5 p b 2 12 5 p b 3 20 p b 4 25 21d kg e ws 1 n kg e 1 0 90 kg e 2 0 775 kg e 3 0

of performance rating adopted from ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 as shown in table 3 constants with the second good and third satisfactory terms represent the average values of their corresponding performance ratings in eq 21b the constants with first second and third terms are average values from performance ratings of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the constants assigned to the weighted scores last performance ratings show the satisfactory thresholds associated with different statistical indicators similarly the constants assigned to four performance ratings for pbws and kgews were adopted from moriasi et al 2007 and towner et al 2019 in a very similar pattern for convenience in the calculation the pbws considers the individual watersheds pb absolute values 4 results and discussion the recently updated cn model m1 two other variants of the same model m2 m3 and the three new proposed variants m4 m5 m6 were tested for runoff estimation using 1837 rainfall runoff events from 41 south korean watersheds m4 and m5 are very simple like the original cn model and there is no new parameter for which optimization will be required however for improved results m6 can be adjusted for the relevant biome without calibration these new proposed variants of the cn model are equally useful for runoff estimation in both gauged and ungauged watersheds 4 1 slope adjusted cn cns and tabulated cn nrcs 2004 the weighted tabulated cn values for λ 0 2 were in the range of 52 78 mean 64 66 table 1 their corresponding values for λ 0 05 were found to range from 43 to 71 mean 56 the cns estimated based on ajmal et al 2020 were slightly higher 2 15 mean 9 than the cn values found from the documented tables presented by the nrcs 2004 for arc ii based on the lulc and watershed soil characteristics the m1 model underestimates runoff possibly due to the comparatively small cn and fixed λ values the findings from this study and many other studies chin 2021 grimaldi et al 2013 tedela et al 2012 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2021 2017 walega et al 2020 indicate that the original cn underestimates runoff misleading practitioners in designing uneconomical hydraulic structures even the recently updated version of this model nrcs 2017 is unstable and inconsistent in its runoff estimate the runoff underestimation can possibly be attributed to the lower cn from the nrcs 2004 documented tables and fixed λ sharma et al 2022 similarly using the three fixed cn values corresponding to arc i arc ii and arc iii causes sudden jumps in runoff estimation ajmal et al 2020 sharma et al 2022 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 hence cn and λ need local adjustment before the cn model is applied for runoff estimation krajewski et al 2020 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 it can be inferred that after a rainfall event which is a major driving factor for runoff generation comparatively higher cns 2 15 than cn result in greater runoff depth from all 41 watersheds in the study area very similar findings are available in the literature ajmal et al 2020 huang et al 2013 2006 mishra et al 2014 pang et al 2020 shi and wang 2020 verma et al 2018 walega et al 2020 the current study area is mostly mountainous and forested in their findings tedela et al 2012 noted that the underestimate in runoff associated with the tabulated cn could have a drastic effect on urbanization by consistently overdesigning the drainage systems and potentially wasting resources unnecessarily it is worth mentioning that there is no credible source of information to determine cn for forested watersheds walega et al 2020 this indicates that the current methodology of the cn model still has room for improvement in runoff estimates especially in steep slope forested watersheds a detailed comparison of the six models based on four performance evaluation indicators can be found in fig 2 4 2 assessment of models based on rmse after evaluation of the m1 model shown in fig 2 a it is evident that fixing λ 0 05 instead of λ 0 2 does not guarantee the robustness of this model to estimate runoff from almost all watersheds in the study area this is due to inferior results for the overall highest rmse values 10 58 50 14 mm and underestimating runoff compared to other models these inferior results agree with the findings of other recent studies durán barroso et al 2016 galbetti et al 2022 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2017 therefore the λ value should be considered as a flexible regional parameter depending on the specific characteristics and rainfall runoff observations and not as a fixed value caletka et al 2020 michel et al 2005 santikari and murdoch 2019 verma et al 2018 it is evident from fig 2 a that m2 m3 and m4 models performed better than the m1 model with improved mean median rmse values of 21 73 21 29 18 76 17 85 and 26 83 26 32 respectively however the mean median rmse values of the m5 and m6 models were significantly improved by 36 82 36 12 and 35 60 37 04 respectively compared to the m1 model from this it can be inferred that the m5 and m6 models are more reliable for estimating runoff in the study area the rmse interquartile range iqr for the m1 model was 13 17 mm while the corresponding lower values for m2 to m6 are 9 79 mm 9 31 mm 8 28 mm 4 79 mm and 6 30 mm respectively showing sufficient accuracy after applying other competitor models used in this study the m1 model does not appear to be structurally sound due to the less accurate estimated runoff in most of the watersheds within the study area many researchers have reported very similar results on the structural inconsistency of the original cn model e g caletka et al 2020 durán barroso et al 2016 fanta and sime 2022 michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2010 shi et al 2017 verma et al 2021 wang et al 2012 even the recently adjusted cn for λ 0 05 nrcs 2017 for steep watersheds gives unsatisfactory results the evaluation carried out based on the performance rating in table 3 is presented in table 4 based on the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 rmse performance rating criteria the rmse values for the m5 and m6 models are very encouraging with the maximum number 36 33 of watersheds exhibiting a very good or good performance as shown in table 4 for the same rmse first two performance ratings the m5 and m6 models are followed for better runoff estimation in most watersheds by m4 29 m2 22 m3 20 and m1 14 as rmse cannot demonstrate runoff over or underestimation some other statistical indicators are required for proper assessment 4 3 assessment of models based on nse the nse is a commonly used and more informative statistical indicator for comparison of hydrological models using the performance rating criteria of table 3 the suitability of six models for runoff estimation was compared using the nse based performance rating criteria of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the m5 model with nse 0 80 in 33 watersheds and the m6 model with nse 0 80 in 32 watersheds are the models most suitable to estimate runoff in the study area these are followed in decreasing order of performance by m4 m2 m3 and m1 models with nse 0 80 in 27 20 18 and 13 watersheds respectively the findings from this study do not support the use of the m1 model for runoff estimation due to its unsatisfactory performance in 16 watersheds with nse 0 65 similarly the runoff estimation using the m2 and m3 models is also not very encouraging with nse 0 80 in 21 and 23 watersheds respectively as shown in table 4 the nse mean median from 41 watersheds for m1 0 63 0 68 m2 0 78 0 80 m3 0 76 0 79 m4 0 81 0 83 m5 0 86 0 87 and m6 0 85 0 87 respectively support that the proposed models are more acceptable for runoff estimation than the other models without compromising the simplicity it is evident from fig 2 b and the nse criteria of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 that the proposed models have greater potential to accurately estimate runoff than their competitors 4 4 assessment of models based on pb the pb is used to identify the runoff over or underestimation which cannot be assessed using rmse and nse fig 2 c indicates that the m1 model is underestimating runoff in all 41 watersheds it is also evident from table 4 that the m1 model gives an unsatisfactory performance in 25 of 41 watersheds with a median pb of 32 77 the performance of this model is very good in only one watershed this failure could be due to the lack of consideration of slope adjustment in structuring the m1 model ajmal et al 2020 pang et al 2020 and sudden jumps due to three fixed discrete values of cn and its corresponding runoff sharma et al 2022 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 wang et al 2012 introducing the sma procedure the m2 median pb 10 34 and m3 median pb 7 17 give comparatively improved but overall underestimated runoff according to the statistics presented in table 4 the performances of m2 and m3 are encouraging however the m4 and m6 models are more consistent with significantly higher performance with median pb 1 03 and 0 03 very close to the perfect fit similarly the results of the m5 model are also very encouraging but its overestimation is dominant median pb 7 27 based on the statistics presented in table 4 the percentages of satisfactory to very good performance for m1 to m6 models are 29 97 82 93 87 80 87 80 90 24 and 92 68 respectively it can be inferred that the m1 model is inferior whereas m5 and m6 models are superior in predicting runoff followed by m4 m3 and m2 the performance rating of the pb based model can mislead researchers if the model underestimates as much as it overestimates in this case the pb value will be close to zero even though the model estimation is poor therefore to properly assess the model s it is recommended to use pb carefully along with other different statistical and graphical indicators moriasi et al 2015 4 5 assessment of models based on kge the kge is a modified version of nse towner et al 2019 using the criteria defined in table 3 and the model performance shown in table 4 as well as presented in fig 2 d the m6 m5 and m4 models show very reliable runoff estimation with better performance in most of the watersheds these are followed by m3 m2 and m1 models for exhibiting comparatively high to low performance the higher kge mean median for m6 0 81 0 84 m5 0 79 0 81 and m4 0 79 0 81 models compared to m3 0 77 0 79 m2 0 77 0 79 and m1 0 63 0 64 models supports the credibility of the proposed models for runoff estimation in the study area the graphical presentation of nse using the fiteval tool ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in combination with model performance ratings moriasi et al 2007 offers valuable supplemental information for a detailed overview of the performance of the models an example performance output of the fiteval in the songcheon watershed 54 rainfall runoff events for the m6 model is shown in fig 3 the fiteval assesses the models goodness of fit through four graphical techniques scatter plots cumulative distribution plots phase plots and timeseries plots harmel et al 2014 the nse values for m1 to m6 models are 0 59 0 80 0 79 0 84 0 87 and 0 87 respectively similarly the phase wise nse cumulative probability distribution fig 3 for a very good and good performance exhibited by the m6 model is 86 followed by m5 85 m4 72 m2 47 m3 42 and m1 4 the uncertainty in the estimates of the m1 model could be attributed to its inability to adequately account for hydrologic abstractions using the fixed three antecedent runoff conditions 4 6 models comparison based on 1 1 line and overall weighted scores for more insight and other complementary statistical indicators all 1837 observed and modeled runoff events were combinedly compared using the six models under consideration shown in fig 4 as it is clear from multiple statistics in fig 4 rmse nse pb kge and the scatter of data around the 1 1 line the proposed models m4 to m6 are more suitable for runoff estimation the underestimate of the m1 model is more significant the weighted lowest scores of rmsews m5 21 41 m6 22 18 pbws m6 10 49 m4 11 71 and highest scores of nsews m5 0 86 m6 0 85 and kgews m6 0 82 m5 0 80 m4 0 80 respectively shown in table 4 supports the credibility of the proposed models the results of the m2 and m3 models are also encouraging if compared to the m1 model but inferior to the proposed models the assessment of models was extended by applying the fiteval ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 goodness of fit for the combined observed and modeled data from all watersheds the cumulative distribution shown in fig 5 clarifies that the performance of the m1 model is not very good 0 or good 0 whereas for most of the watersheds the nse is only in the acceptable range 99 9 or unsatisfactory 0 1 for m2 and m3 models it is good 98 6 90 8 and acceptable 1 4 9 2 similarly the performance of the m4 model was good 100 furthermore the m5 model very good 5 9 good 94 1 and the m6 model very good 2 4 good 97 6 outperformed in estimating runoff from almost all watersheds improved results of the proposed models could be attributed to their flexible initial abstraction and new structures of the old method however the three fixed arcs estimated from the previous five days rainfall records could not identify the watershed dynamics which is in agreement with the findings of other studies e g durán barroso et al 2016 tramblay et al 2010 it is evident that the recently recommended fixed λ 0 05 and its associated adjustment s0 05 1 42s0 2 nrcs 2017 could not provide much confidence for better runoff estimation with comparatively better runoff estimates from wang et al 2012 it is obvious that the magnitude of rainfall plays a crucial role in introducing a more flexible and region specific initial abstraction where the cn is an integrated component it is also supported by the findings of song et al 2021 in other words both λ and cn should be variable to accurately represent the watershed this agrees with the finding of chin 2021 that if the structural limitations are not addressed then the cn model must be considered fundamentally and quantitatively inferior for violating the basic hydrologic principles with unrealistic output after a detailed assessment it was also found the m1 model with s0 05 1 42s0 2 nrcs 2017 gives better results than the adjustment made by hawkins et al 2020 as s 0 05 1 3422 s 0 2 1 089 inches for its transformed relation s 0 05 0 9931 s 0 2 1 089 mm and the subsequent adjustment made by chin 2022 as s0 05 1 72s0 2 it can be inferred that the sma procedure used in this study works fairly well for rainfall generated runoff compared to its competitors by wang et al 2012 and verma et al 2021 nonetheless the new sma procedure after incorporating p5 as an integral component in the restructured cn model needs more refinement to capture watershed dynamics overall the first two proposed variants of the cn model are simple and reliable when applied in steep slope watersheds in the third proposed model calibration of new coefficients and exponents will increase the model complexity and its applicability in ungauged watersheds will be compromised however if data availability is not a constraint then calibration is highly recommended to adjust the model according to the local hydro geometric settings 5 conclusions with new specifications and maintaining simplicity proposed variants of the cn model deserve practitioners attention due to a more accurate runoff estimation the structural inconsistency of the original cn model with fixed λ and three discrete categories of cn values drier normal wetter leads to sudden jumps in runoff estimation using the sma procedure by incorporating rainfall magnitude in the initial abstraction could improve the model acceptability this study considers a wide range of 1837 rainfall runoff events from 41 steep slope watersheds in south korea the recently updated original cn model m1 with fixed λ 0 05 two other recent variants of this model m2 m3 and three proposed variants m4 m5 m6 were compared for runoff estimation the percent improvements in estimating runoff using the mean of different statistical indicators rmse nse kge compared to the m1 model are as follows m2 21 73 23 24 27 93 m3 18 76 20 98 27 70 m4 26 83 28 38 31 08 m5 36 82 36 12 30 92 m6 35 60 34 96 34 59 respectively the models can be listed in order of decreasing performance using the above three indicators as follows m5 m6 m4 m2 m3 m1 the percentage increase in pb values might be misleading due to its positive and negative values therefore the median pb values from the 41 watersheds for m1 32 77 m2 10 34 m3 7 17 m4 1 03 m5 7 71 and m6 0 03 show that the m4 and m6 models are more in agreement for observed and estimated runoff based on the lowest rmsews 24 34 21 41 22 18 and pbws 11 71 13 54 10 49 the highest nsews 0 82 0 86 0 85 and kgews 0 80 0 80 0 82 the highest number of watersheds with a very good or good performance in estimating runoff and the significantly improved cumulative distribution of nse using fiteval the proposed models m4 m5 m6 outperformed in almost all watersheds however the m5 model overestimation median pb 7 27 makes it comparable with the underestimation of m2 median pb 7 17 and m3 median pb 10 34 models above all the significant overestimation by the m1 model median pb 32 77 makes its application in the study area very uncertain this uncertainty could be reduced by avoiding the fixed λ and three arc based categories of the cn the availability of soil moisture data could be helpful to assess the model sma procedure for more realistic results furthermore encouraging results could be ensured if the magnitude of rainfall is used as an integral component of the initial abstraction the variability in runoff under or overestimation by different variants of the cn model still provides an opportunity for hydrologists and practitioners to explore other venues for the structural improvement and applicability of this model substantial efforts are needed to devise a more stable sma procedure for increasing the model applicability in different hydro geographic settings this might be accomplished by integrating the rainfall intensity duration and pre storm soil moisture conditions to increase the cn model flexibility and credibility in runoff estimates this will also reduce reliance on the calibration of unnecessary parameters that limit the application of this model in ungauged watersheds

2435,the globally adopted and computationally efficient curve number cn model fills an active hydrological professional niche and has a well documented history however it is structurally inconsistent and fails to reliably estimate runoff from rainfall this is mainly due to the much debated fixed initial abstraction λ and associated sudden jumps in runoff based on cn obtained from the documented tables in this study three new variants m4 m5 m6 of the cn model are proposed that consider the hydrological imbalance between pre storm soil moisture and initial abstraction after a rainfall event a total of 1837 rainfall runoff events were analyzed from 41 steep slope watersheds in south korea to test the robustness of the proposed cn models the results were compared to the recently updated original cn model m1 and two other recent variants m2 m3 of this model these models were evaluated using root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pb kling gupta

it is inferred that both λ and cn should be kept flexible for a systematic and region specific revision of the cn model to improve runoff estimation in addition a structurally consistent model with a stable soil moisture accounting sma procedure is vital to get more reliable runoff estimates without compromising the simplicity and applicability to ungauged watersheds keywords pre storm moisture content rainfall watershed curve number model inconsistency improved runoff data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the curve number cn model is very popular for predicting rainfall generated runoff it is the simplest globally tested model with rich literature and well documented use that accounts for the essential runoff generating characteristics of watersheds such as land use cover lulc soil type hydrologic soil group hsg and antecedent soil moisture condition amc oliveira et al 2016 shi and wang 2020 walega et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the majority of these watershed characteristics are integrated into a single highly sensitive parameter which is the cn fanta and sime 2022 pang et al 2020 since its development this model has become monotypic due to the lack of another competitor and has enjoyed a long history of application garen and moore 2005 hawkins 2014 with many creative extensions addressing a wide range of hydrological issues and challenges this model has been applied well beyond its simple origin in upland agriculture and has been embedded in various methodologies related to environmental impact assessment flood control sediment erosion and water quality across the globe hawkins 2014 the cn model is well regarded in the realm of applied hydrology and will continue to be at the forefront of hydrometeorological engineering design this model has experienced extensive hydrological and structural adjustments these adjustments include but are not limited to initial abstraction edwards 2017 hawkins et al 2019 ling et al 2019 different approaches to estimate cn ajmal et al 2020 lal et al 2017 interpretation of various soil moisture accounting sma procedures michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2010 santikari and murdoch 2019 singh et al 2015 verma et al 2017 wang et al 2012 rainstorm duration sahu et al 2012 shi et al 2017 cn slope factor ajmal et al 2020 huang et al 2006 and the general renewal of methodology hawkins et al 2019 several studies have debated model inconsistencies due to the fixed initial abstraction coefficient assaye et al 2021 lal et al 2017 verma et al 2021 yuan et al 2014 spatial and temporal changes in the cn values have led to misinterpretation of the model s applicability garen and moore 2005 muche et al 2019 despite the widespread and ongoing success the cn model faces serious structural inconsistencies stemming partly from uncertainty regarding intrinsic parameters and initial moisture conditions and partly from improper use of the underlying soil moisture accounting procedure michel et al 2005 different variants of this model have increased its complexity by incorporating new parameters but are unable to accurately estimate watershed runoff chung et al 2010 very little attention has been given to the mathematical consistency of the model michel et al 2005 or its ability to capture the sma procedure appropriate for the watershed verma et al 2017 however it is possible to modify the model structure without compromising its simplicity based on a better understanding of the underlying sma procedure michel et al 2005 recently several studies were conducted to incorporate the sma procedure in this model to improve its runoff predictive ability e g durán barroso et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2013 jain et al 2012 sahu et al 2010 2007 santikari and murdoch 2019 singh et al 2015 verma et al 2017 williams et al 2012 however the incorporation of new parameters reduces the simplicity and it becomes more challenging to optimize these new parameters in watersheds with limited data there is no stable and flexible foundation for variable amcs which can partially explain the inter event variability of the cn parameter verma et al 2020 and the model is incapable of capturing the watershed dynamics a sound sma procedure incorporated in the cn model is important for more realistic runoff prediction from a rainfall event because cn varies from event to event durán barroso et al 2016 kannan et al 2008 and it plays a vital role in estimating the amc at storm initiation kim et al 2018 any sma procedure must be based on the concept that when the pre storm moisture is higher more rainfall will be converted to runoff in other words all rainfall will become runoff for a saturated soil moisture condition michel et al 2005 to avoid a sudden jump in cn and its associated runoff michel et al 2005 pinpointed different structural inconsistencies in the original cn model to represent the dynamic and continuous response of a watershed to runoff they suggested an sma procedure that incorporates the integral effect of initial soil moisture content and rainfall on runoff generation singh et al 2015 analyzed the underlying drawbacks in the michel et al 2005 model and devised a structurally stable sma procedure for runoff estimation while refining the sma procedure shi et al 2017 found the empirical formulation for v 0 presented by singh et al 2015 inappropriate in some cases in response shi et al 2017 have increased the model complexity to use three parameters similarly verma et al 2017 presented a physically sound sma procedure based model however formulation of v 0 and threshold moisture sa were adopted from singh et al 2015 and thus the applicability of the model in ungauged watersheds is limited as calibration of the two coefficients α and β is required several other studies e g farooq et al 2022 kim et al 2018 kristanto et al 2021 shi et al 2021 shi and wang 2020 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2020 verma et al 2018 were conducted to improve the sma procedure and avoid quantum jumps in the runoff estimation as it is difficult to characterize the initial soil moisture content durán barroso et al 2016 the majority of the studies have associated the amc with rainfall records from the previous five days amatya et al 2022 bera et al 2022 bhuyan et al 2022 muche et al 2019 shi et al 2021 upreti and ojha 2022 however the use of fixed amcs misled the model results alternatively the sma procedure can be incorporated into the cn model to rectify the classical sudden jump and to get a more realistic runoff estimation ajmal et al 2016a durán barroso et al 2016 verma et al 2017 verma et al 2020 similarly different studies have used extensive rank and grading based approaches to evaluate and compare the models performance farooq et al 2022 rawat et al 2021 singh et al 2015 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2018 a comprehensive weighted score approach for different statistical indicators could be effective to evaluate the models performance realizing the structural inconsistencies and limitations of the cn model reported in various studies one objective of this study was to propose structurally consistent variants of the cn model and to avoid sudden jumps in runoff estimation without compromising the simplicity of its application in watersheds with limited data another objective was to introduce a new approach for assessing the credibility of models using overall weighted scores of different statistical indicators 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data to test the runoff estimation capability of the proposed cn model variants the hydro meteorological 2005 2012 and land cover data of 41 mountainous watersheds in south korea were collected from the korea meteorological administration kma and the ministry of land infrastructure and transport molit these watersheds are representative of the entire hydrometeorological setting of south korea ajmal et al 2020 ajmal et al 2016a ajmal et al 2015a the observed discharge was separated into baseflow and runoff using the eckhardt digital filter method xie et al 2020 the minimum mean and maximum rainfall runoff observed for 1837 events were 12 10 0 17 mm 80 01 38 10 mm and 519 68 364 38 mm respectively most rainfall events used in this study were large p 25 4 mm as the theoretical probability of runoff occurrence was 90 durán barroso et al 2016 the number of storm events in an individual watershed varied from 18 to 89 while watershed areas varied from 42 34 to 879 10 km2 forests are the dominant land cover in the study area followed by agricultural and urbanized land the soil is mostly loam and sandy loam with some proportion of silt loam ajmal et al 2016b the normal or average weighted cn values of the watersheds were determined from the documented cn tables based on the land use land cover lulc practices soil type hydrological soil groups hsg and antecedent runoff conditions nrcs 2004 these cn values are according to the fixed λ 0 2 adjusted cn values corresponding to λ 0 05 and slope adjusted cn with some other information on the observed data are given in table 1 2 2 existing variants of cn model 2 2 1 the nrcs latest updated model the updated natural resources conservation services nrcs cn model for runoff estimation nrcs 2017 is as follows 1 q p λ s 2 p 1 λ s p 0 05 s 0 05 2 p 0 95 s 0 05 f o r λ 0 05 where q is the runoff mm p is the rainfall mm λ is the abstraction coefficient and s is the maximum potential retention mm of the soil to adjust s from the previously used λ 0 2 to 0 05 the curve number task force nrcs 2017 recently developed a simple relation s0 05 1 42s0 2 introducing this relation into eq 1 and simplifying gives 2a q p 0 071 s 0 2 2 p 1 349 s 0 2 f o r p 0 071 s 0 2 for different land uses land cover types and hydrological soil groups the weighted cn0 2 for all watersheds was calculated and transformed to s0 2 shi et al 2017 verma et al 2020 using the following equation 2b s 0 2 254 100 c n 0 2 1 the documented tabulated values of cn0 2 and associated s0 2 usually reflect average watershed soil moisture edwards 2017 or normal antecedent runoff conditions arc ii instead of the so called amc ii the s0 2 values for drier arc i and wetter arc iii conditions were obtained by multiplying the values of the average condition by 2 2754 and 0 43 respectively mishra et al 2008 in terms of cn0 2 eq 2a can be represented as follows 3 q p 18 03 100 c n 0 2 1 2 p 342 65 100 c n 0 2 1 f o r p 18 03 100 c n 0 2 1 a n d c n 0 05 c n 0 2 1 42 0 0042 c n 0 2 2 2 2 wang et al model the initial soil abstraction is mainly dependent on the properties of rainfall events and the watershed characteristics assaye et al 2021 fu et al 2011 a sufficiently strong relationship is available between cn and rainfall characteristics chin 2021 soulis and valiantzas 2012 to obviate the sudden jump in runoff prediction of the cn model wang et al 2012 developed a modified sma procedure that integrates the effects of p and s without compromising the model s simplicity after their model simplification it was proposed to determine runoff q using the following equation 4 q c sat s e β p where csat is the runoff coefficient for saturated soil β is the fitting constant and se is the relative saturation csat se β is calculated from the logarithmic back transformation of a newly suggested function f s p as 5a f s p 0 143 l o g 10 s p 2 0 5981 l o g 10 s p 0 296 if s p 1 0 0 296 e x p 1 837 l o g 10 s p if 0 s p 1 0 0 if s p 0 hence eq 4 becomes 5b q log 10 1 f s p p during the derivation of this f s p relationship the number of parameters used in the model has increased from one cn to four however after the derivation a single parameter based model was developed to avoid a sudden jump in runoff estimation this new variant was compared to the original cn model and its other competitors that consider the sma procedure including the michel et al 2005 model sahu et al 2007 model and sahu et al 2010 model wang et al 2012 found their model to be simpler and superior in reproducing watershed runoff 2 2 3 verma et al model to improve the credibility of the cn model runoff prediction verma et al 2021 combined concepts from the mishra and singh 2002 and ajmal et al 2015b variants of the cn model and summarized three new variants of this model among these three variants of the cn model the following variant was found to be more reliable in predicting the runoff of 98 watersheds in the united states 6 q 0 98 p 0 98 p p 5 1 26 s 0 63 0 98 p p 5 1 26 s 0 63 s where p5 is the previous five day rainfall before the onset of a rainfall event and s s0 2 they compared the results of this variant of the cn model with nine other variants of the same model and found their runoff estimates more credible for most watersheds in the united states 2 3 development of the proposed cn model variants 2 3 1 proposed cn model variant 1 the analyses performed by wang et al 2012 indicate that the original cn model nrcs 2004 and its different variants proposed by michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2007 and sahu et al 2010 are inconsistent in accurately estimating runoff and need further modification for improved runoff estimation two new variants of the cn model are conceptualized after combining the original cn model the michel et al 2005 model and the event based gr4j model ajmal et al 2015b because rainfall generated runoff typically lasts for a fairly limited duration the daily evapotranspiration can be neglected yuan et al 2014 the event based gr4j model for estimating runoff q in its cumulative form can then be represented as 7 q p v s s a 2 p v s v o i a 2 where v vo p q is the soil moisture for the cumulative rainstorm p vo is the pre storm moisture condition and s a v o i a for i a is the initial abstraction before runoff starts michel et al 2005 substituting the expression for v in eq 7 results in 8 q p v o p q s v o i a 2 p v o p q s v o i a 2 now the generalized cn model nrcs 2004 is 9 q p i a 2 p i a s the total loss for the cn model can be represented as the difference between p and q nrcs 2004 10 loss p q substituting eq 9 in eq 10 yields 11 loss p q p p i a 2 p i a s after multiplying and dividing the two terms on the right hand side of eq 11 by p i a s and simplifying it becomes 12 p q s i a p i a 2 p i a s now substituting eq 12 into eq 8 yields 13 q p v o s i a p i a 2 p i a s 2 s v o i a 2 after rearrangement eq 13 can be recast as 14 q p v o p i a s s i a p i a 2 p i a s s v o i a 2 to account for pre storm moisture contents and get a more realistic initial abstraction ajmal et al 2016a proposed the following modified relationship 15 i a λ s 2 s v o in their study michel et al 2005 found vo for dry normal and wet conditions these moisture conditions were differentiated based on p5 gao et al 2012 investigating the measured rainfall runoff data different land uses covers and variable moisture conditions from 140 watersheds in france vo was simplified as a fraction of s for dry normal and wet conditions as vo 0 33s vo 0 61s and vo 0 87s respectively michel et al 2005 for more realistic results and greater responsiveness to the watersheds the i a values could have been obtained for actual v o but the measured moisture content is not available and this study has to rely on the empirical relations from previous studies hence for λ 0 2 and vo 0 61s eq 15 gives i a 0 124 s substituting ia 0 124s and vo 0 61s and simplifying eq 14 gives 16 q p p 0 3 s p 0 876 s 2 for p 0 124 s in the above equation s is calculated using eq 3 by replacing cn0 2 with slope adjusted cns ajmal et al 2020 17 c n s 1 1 428 e 7 125 α 50 0 5 c n 0 2 c n 0 2 c n 0 2 75 43 c n 0 2 2 3 2 proposed cn model variant 2 to avoid a sudden jump in runoff estimation shi et al 2017 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 and use only a single s rather than the three s values used in the cn model s in eq 16 was replaced by s p p p 5 substituting this new relationship in eq 16 and simplifying gives 18 q p p p 5 0 3 s p p 5 0 876 s 2 f o r p 0 124 s p p p 5 eq 18 is very simple to apply where practitioners can only use the s corresponding to normal watershed conditions antecedent runoff condition ii arc ii p 5 in eq 18 is used to approximately adjust the value of s for dry and wet watershed conditions 2 3 3 proposed cn model variant 3 if rainfall magnitude is not considered in estimating cn it may lead to substantial runoff underestimation chin 2021 this newly modified cn model incorporated rainfall as an integral part of the initial abstraction to avoid the possible uncertainty in estimating runoff and is expressed as follows 19 q p i a 2 ap i a s b p i a 2 1 15 p i a s 0 87 f o r i a 0 3 s p p s 1 5 a n d p i a here the initial abstraction ia is adopted from jain et al 2006b note that s is the transformed value of the slope adjusted cn using eq 17 the rainfall runoff measured data from 30 randomly selected watersheds out of the 41 total watersheds was used to get the values of a and b the optimized values for a and b found using the nonlinear least

addition to the above goodness of fit criteria the observed and estimated runoff were compared graphically ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 among these scatterplots of the cumulative observed and estimated runoff data from all watersheds were used to identify the best model for the intended purpose to avoid a lengthy procedure adopted in different studies to compare the models output based on

to identify the credibility of models based on agreement between observed and estimated runoff these weighted scores for all watersheds can be determined as follows 21a rms e ws σ m n rms e 1 1 2 rms

of performance rating adopted from ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 as shown in table 3 constants with the second good and third satisfactory terms represent the average values of their corresponding performance ratings in eq 21b the constants with first second and third terms are average values from performance ratings of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the constants assigned to the weighted scores last performance ratings show the satisfactory thresholds associated with different statistical indicators similarly the constants assigned to four performance ratings for pbws and kgews were adopted from moriasi et al 2007 and towner et al 2019 in a very similar pattern for convenience in the calculation the pbws considers the individual watersheds pb absolute values 4 results and discussion the recently updated cn model m1 two other variants of the same model m2 m3 and the three new proposed variants m4 m5 m6 were tested for runoff estimation using 1837 rainfall runoff events from 41 south korean watersheds m4 and m5 are very simple like the original cn model and there is no new parameter for which optimization will be required however for improved results m6 can be adjusted for the relevant biome without calibration these new proposed variants of the cn model are equally useful for runoff estimation in both gauged and ungauged watersheds 4 1 slope adjusted cn cns and tabulated cn nrcs 2004 the weighted tabulated cn values for λ 0 2 were in the range of 52 78 mean 64 66 table 1 their corresponding values for λ 0 05 were found to range from 43 to 71 mean 56 the cns estimated based on ajmal et al 2020 were slightly higher 2 15 mean 9 than the cn values found from the documented tables presented by the nrcs 2004 for arc ii based on the lulc and watershed soil characteristics the m1 model underestimates runoff possibly due to the comparatively small cn and fixed λ values the findings from this study and many other studies chin 2021 grimaldi et al 2013 tedela et al 2012 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2021 2017 walega et al 2020 indicate that the original cn underestimates runoff misleading practitioners in designing uneconomical hydraulic structures even the recently updated version of this model nrcs 2017 is unstable and inconsistent in its runoff estimate the runoff underestimation can possibly be attributed to the lower cn from the nrcs 2004 documented tables and fixed λ sharma et al 2022 similarly using the three fixed cn values corresponding to arc i arc ii and arc iii causes sudden jumps in runoff estimation ajmal et al 2020 sharma et al 2022 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 hence cn and λ need local adjustment before the cn model is applied for runoff estimation krajewski et al 2020 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 it can be inferred that after a rainfall event which is a major driving factor for runoff generation comparatively higher cns 2 15 than cn result in greater runoff depth from all 41 watersheds in the study area very similar findings are available in the literature ajmal et al 2020 huang et al 2013 2006 mishra et al 2014 pang et al 2020 shi and wang 2020 verma et al 2018 walega et al 2020 the current study area is mostly mountainous and forested in their findings tedela et al 2012 noted that the underestimate in runoff associated with the tabulated cn could have a drastic effect on urbanization by consistently overdesigning the drainage systems and potentially wasting resources unnecessarily it is worth mentioning that there is no credible source of information to determine cn for forested watersheds walega et al 2020 this indicates that the current methodology of the cn model still has room for improvement in runoff estimates especially in steep slope forested watersheds a detailed comparison of the six models based on four performance evaluation indicators can be found in fig 2 4 2 assessment of models based on rmse after evaluation of the m1 model shown in fig 2 a it is evident that fixing λ 0 05 instead of λ 0 2 does not guarantee the robustness of this model to estimate runoff from almost all watersheds in the study area this is due to inferior results for the overall highest rmse values 10 58 50 14 mm and underestimating runoff compared to other models these inferior results agree with the findings of other recent studies durán barroso et al 2016 galbetti et al 2022 verma et al 2021 verma et al 2017 therefore the λ value should be considered as a flexible regional parameter depending on the specific characteristics and rainfall runoff observations and not as a fixed value caletka et al 2020 michel et al 2005 santikari and murdoch 2019 verma et al 2018 it is evident from fig 2 a that m2 m3 and m4 models performed better than the m1 model with improved mean median rmse values of 21 73 21 29 18 76 17 85 and 26 83 26 32 respectively however the mean median rmse values of the m5 and m6 models were significantly improved by 36 82 36 12 and 35 60 37 04 respectively compared to the m1 model from this it can be inferred that the m5 and m6 models are more reliable for estimating runoff in the study area the rmse interquartile range iqr for the m1 model was 13 17 mm while the corresponding lower values for m2 to m6 are 9 79 mm 9 31 mm 8 28 mm 4 79 mm and 6 30 mm respectively showing sufficient accuracy after applying other competitor models used in this study the m1 model does not appear to be structurally sound due to the less accurate estimated runoff in most of the watersheds within the study area many researchers have reported very similar results on the structural inconsistency of the original cn model e g caletka et al 2020 durán barroso et al 2016 fanta and sime 2022 michel et al 2005 sahu et al 2010 shi et al 2017 verma et al 2021 wang et al 2012 even the recently adjusted cn for λ 0 05 nrcs 2017 for steep watersheds gives unsatisfactory results the evaluation carried out based on the performance rating in table 3 is presented in table 4 based on the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 rmse performance rating criteria the rmse values for the m5 and m6 models are very encouraging with the maximum number 36 33 of watersheds exhibiting a very good or good performance as shown in table 4 for the same rmse first two performance ratings the m5 and m6 models are followed for better runoff estimation in most watersheds by m4 29 m2 22 m3 20 and m1 14 as rmse cannot demonstrate runoff over or underestimation some other statistical indicators are required for proper assessment 4 3 assessment of models based on nse the nse is a commonly used and more informative statistical indicator for comparison of hydrological models using the performance rating criteria of table 3 the suitability of six models for runoff estimation was compared using the nse based performance rating criteria of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the m5 model with nse 0 80 in 33 watersheds and the m6 model with nse 0 80 in 32 watersheds are the models most suitable to estimate runoff in the study area these are followed in decreasing order of performance by m4 m2 m3 and m1 models with nse 0 80 in 27 20 18 and 13 watersheds respectively the findings from this study do not support the use of the m1 model for runoff estimation due to its unsatisfactory performance in 16 watersheds with nse 0 65 similarly the runoff estimation using the m2 and m3 models is also not very encouraging with nse 0 80 in 21 and 23 watersheds respectively as shown in table 4 the nse mean median from 41 watersheds for m1 0 63 0 68 m2 0 78 0 80 m3 0 76 0 79 m4 0 81 0 83 m5 0 86 0 87 and m6 0 85 0 87 respectively support that the proposed models are more acceptable for runoff estimation than the other models without compromising the simplicity it is evident from fig 2 b and the nse criteria of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 that the proposed models have greater potential to accurately estimate runoff than their competitors 4 4 assessment of models based on pb the pb is used to identify the runoff over or underestimation which cannot be assessed using rmse and nse fig 2 c indicates that the m1 model is underestimating runoff in all 41 watersheds it is also evident from table 4 that the m1 model gives an unsatisfactory performance in 25 of 41 watersheds with a median pb of 32 77 the performance of this model is very good in only one watershed this failure could be due to the lack of consideration of slope adjustment in structuring the m1 model ajmal et al 2020 pang et al 2020 and sudden jumps due to three fixed discrete values of cn and its corresponding runoff sharma et al 2022 upreti and ojha 2022 verma et al 2017 wang et al 2012 introducing the sma procedure the m2 median pb 10 34 and m3 median pb 7 17 give comparatively improved but overall underestimated runoff according to the statistics presented in table 4 the performances of m2 and m3 are encouraging however the m4 and m6 models are more consistent with significantly higher performance with median pb 1 03 and 0 03 very close to the perfect fit similarly the results of the m5 model are also very encouraging but its overestimation is dominant median pb 7 27 based on the statistics presented in table 4 the percentages of satisfactory to very good performance for m1 to m6 models are 29 97 82 93 87 80 87 80 90 24 and 92 68 respectively it can be inferred that the m1 model is inferior whereas m5 and m6 models are superior in predicting runoff followed by m4 m3 and m2 the performance rating of the pb based model can mislead researchers if the model underestimates as much as it overestimates in this case the pb value will be close to zero even though the model estimation is poor therefore to properly assess the model s it is recommended to use pb carefully along with other different statistical and graphical indicators moriasi et al 2015 4 5 assessment of models based on kge the kge is a modified version of nse towner et al 2019 using the criteria defined in table 3 and the model performance shown in table 4 as well as presented in fig 2 d the m6 m5 and m4 models show very reliable runoff estimation with better performance in most of the watersheds these are followed by m3 m2 and m1 models for exhibiting comparatively high to low performance the higher kge mean median for m6 0 81 0 84 m5 0 79 0 81 and m4 0 79 0 81 models compared to m3 0 77 0 79 m2 0 77 0 79 and m1 0 63 0 64 models supports the credibility of the proposed models for runoff estimation in the study area the graphical presentation of nse using the fiteval tool ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in combination with model performance ratings moriasi et al 2007 offers valuable supplemental information for a detailed overview of the performance of the models an example performance output of the fiteval in the songcheon watershed 54 rainfall runoff events for the m6 model is shown in fig 3 the fiteval assesses the models goodness of fit through four graphical techniques scatter plots cumulative distribution plots phase plots and timeseries plots harmel et al 2014 the nse values for m1 to m6 models are 0 59 0 80 0 79 0 84 0 87 and 0 87 respectively similarly the phase wise nse cumulative probability distribution fig 3 for a very good and good performance exhibited by the m6 model is 86 followed by m5 85 m4 72 m2 47 m3 42 and m1 4 the uncertainty in the estimates of the m1 model could be attributed to its inability to adequately account for hydrologic abstractions using the fixed three antecedent runoff conditions 4 6 models comparison based on 1 1 line and overall weighted scores for more insight and other complementary statistical indicators all 1837 observed and modeled runoff events were combinedly compared using the six models under consideration shown in fig 4 as it is clear from multiple statistics in fig 4 rmse nse pb kge and the scatter of data around the 1 1 line the proposed models m4 to m6 are more suitable for runoff estimation the underestimate of the m1 model is more significant the weighted lowest scores of rmsews m5 21 41 m6 22 18 pbws m6 10 49 m4 11 71 and highest scores of nsews m5 0 86 m6 0 85 and kgews m6 0 82 m5 0 80 m4 0 80 respectively shown in table 4 supports the credibility of the proposed models the results of the m2 and m3 models are also encouraging if compared to the m1 model but inferior to the proposed models the assessment of models was extended by applying the fiteval ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 goodness of fit for the combined observed and modeled data from all watersheds the cumulative distribution shown in fig 5 clarifies that the performance of the m1 model is not very good 0 or good 0 whereas for most of the watersheds the nse is only in the acceptable range 99 9 or unsatisfactory 0 1 for m2 and m3 models it is good 98 6 90 8 and acceptable 1 4 9 2 similarly the performance of the m4 model was good 100 furthermore the m5 model very good 5 9 good 94 1 and the m6 model very good 2 4 good 97 6 outperformed in estimating runoff from almost all watersheds improved results of the proposed models could be attributed to their flexible initial abstraction and new structures of the old method however the three fixed arcs estimated from the previous five days rainfall records could not identify the watershed dynamics which is in agreement with the findings of other studies e g durán barroso et al 2016 tramblay et al 2010 it is evident that the recently recommended fixed λ 0 05 and its associated adjustment s0 05 1 42s0 2 nrcs 2017 could not provide much confidence for better runoff estimation with comparatively better runoff estimates from wang et al 2012 it is obvious that the magnitude of rainfall plays a crucial role in introducing a more flexible and region specific initial abstraction where the cn is an integrated component it is also supported by the findings of song et al 2021 in other words both λ and cn should be variable to accurately represent the watershed this agrees with the finding of chin 2021 that if the structural limitations are not addressed then the cn model must be considered fundamentally and quantitatively inferior for violating the basic hydrologic principles with unrealistic output after a detailed assessment it was also found the m1 model with s0 05 1 42s0 2 nrcs 2017 gives better results than the adjustment made by hawkins et al 2020 as s 0 05 1 3422 s 0 2 1 089 inches for its transformed relation s 0 05 0 9931 s 0 2 1 089 mm and the subsequent adjustment made by chin 2022 as s0 05 1 72s0 2 it can be inferred that the sma procedure used in this study works fairly well for rainfall generated runoff compared to its competitors by wang et al 2012 and verma et al 2021 nonetheless the new sma procedure after incorporating p5 as an integral component in the restructured cn model needs more refinement to capture watershed dynamics overall the first two proposed variants of the cn model are simple and reliable when applied in steep slope watersheds in the third proposed model calibration of new coefficients and exponents will increase the model complexity and its applicability in ungauged watersheds will be compromised however if data availability is not a constraint then calibration is highly recommended to adjust the model according to the local hydro geometric settings 5 conclusions with new specifications and maintaining simplicity proposed variants of the cn model deserve practitioners attention due to a more accurate runoff estimation the structural inconsistency of the original cn model with fixed λ and three discrete categories of cn values drier normal wetter leads to sudden jumps in runoff estimation using the sma procedure by incorporating rainfall magnitude in the initial abstraction could improve the model acceptability this study considers a wide range of 1837 rainfall runoff events from 41 steep slope watersheds in south korea the recently updated original cn model m1 with fixed λ 0 05 two other recent variants of this model m2 m3 and three proposed variants m4 m5 m6 were compared for runoff estimation the percent improvements in estimating runoff using the mean of different statistical indicators rmse nse kge compared to the m1 model are as follows m2 21 73 23 24 27 93 m3 18 76 20 98 27 70 m4 26 83 28 38 31 08 m5 36 82 36 12 30 92 m6 35 60 34 96 34 59 respectively the models can be listed in order of decreasing performance using the above three indicators as follows m5 m6 m4 m2 m3 m1 the percentage increase in pb values might be misleading due to its positive and negative values therefore the median pb values from the 41 watersheds for m1 32 77 m2 10 34 m3 7 17 m4 1 03 m5 7 71 and m6 0 03 show that the m4 and m6 models are more in agreement for observed and estimated runoff based on the lowest rmsews 24 34 21 41 22 18 and pbws 11 71 13 54 10 49 the highest nsews 0 82 0 86 0 85 and kgews 0 80 0 80 0 82 the highest number of watersheds with a very good or good performance in estimating runoff and the significantly improved cumulative distribution of nse using fiteval the proposed models m4 m5 m6 outperformed in almost all watersheds however the m5 model overestimation median pb 7 27 makes it comparable with the underestimation of m2 median pb 7 17 and m3 median pb 10 34 models above all the significant overestimation by the m1 model median pb 32 77 makes its application in the study area very uncertain this uncertainty could be reduced by avoiding the fixed λ and three arc based categories of the cn the availability of soil moisture data could be helpful to assess the model sma procedure for more realistic results furthermore encouraging results could be ensured if the magnitude of rainfall is used as an integral component of the initial abstraction the variability in runoff under or overestimation by different variants of the cn model still provides an opportunity for hydrologists and practitioners to explore other venues for the structural improvement and applicability of this model substantial efforts are needed to devise a more stable sma procedure for increasing the model applicability in different hydro geographic settings this might be accomplished by integrating the rainfall intensity duration and pre storm soil moisture conditions to increase the cn model flexibility and credibility in runoff estimates this will also reduce reliance on the calibration of unnecessary parameters that limit the application of this model in ungauged watersheds

2436,the concept of aquifer basins as palaeoclimate archives has existed for some decades yet few detailed studies comparing aquifer types have been carried out to assess the potential of a particular aquifer as an archive its hydrogeochemical characteristics must be thoroughly investigated ideally in comparison to an adjacent aquifer which can be shown to substantially preserve its ice age endowment at depth the london basin uk presents such an opportunity containing two main aquifers of contrasting type the chalk a fractured microporous limestone and the lower greensand a porous sandstone despite intensive exploitation of both evidence for devensian late glacial water remains at depth though this differs between aquifer type to understand the reasons for this a suite of environmental tracers has been applied in addition to hydrochemistry stable isotopes δ18o δ2h carbon isotopes δ13c dic 14c dic and noble gases he ne ar kr and xe two tracers new to the basin cfcs and 14c doc have been used in effect the lower greensand appears to be the reference aquifer preserving recharge from prior to the last glacial maximum lgm while the chalk contains mixed water with no remaining trace of the undiluted pre lgm end member even at depth in remote parts of the confined basin whereas both aquifers had in the past given maximum 14c dic model ages 30kyr the effective limit of that method in the present study the use of 14c doc has reduced this to 23 4 kyr lower greensand and 17 2 kyr chalk similar contrasts in maximum stable isotope depletions 8 2 and 7 8 δ18o and noble gas derived recharge temperature minima 2 6 and 4 1 c were also observed cfcs were found at all chalk sites with traces detectable even at 40 km from outcrop so some climate signal degradation appears inevitable throughout the chalk aquifer of the basin a correlation between 14c activity and excess 4he suggests that deep saline water in the lower greensand could be 50kyr old the use of 14c doc in particular appears to be key to understanding how reliable these individual aquifers are as palaeoarchives data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction while high latitude ice cores may be the ultimate hydroclimatic indicator in terms of time resolution the changes they record may not be synchronous with those occurring at lower latitudes e g thompson et al 2005 although high resolution proxies like tree rings and lake sediments can circumvent this limitation their use can be problematic e g darling 2004 therefore opportunities to ground truth hydroclimate can be useful confined aquifers at the regional scale are often regarded as having this potential e g edmunds et al 2004 kreuzer et al 2009 priestley et al 2020 this means that they are large enough to contain groundwater recharged over millennia or longer ideally preserving evidence for past variations in temperature and hydrological regime that can ultimately feed into the validation of climate models approaches to unlocking these aquifer basin palaeoarchives have evolved over time originally the emphasis was simply on establishing the age of water in aquifers as a necessary first step with radiocarbon playing a prominent role e g hanshaw et al 1965 vogel 1968 though later supplemented by longer lived radioisotopes e g bentley et al 1986 lehmann et al 1991 for waters exceeding radiocarbon age 30 kyr stable isotopes as a proxy for recharge temperature conditions were introduced shortly after radiocarbon e g gat and issar 1974 vogel and van urk 1975 however ambiguities in interpretation led to the need for more absolute indicators of palaeotemperature with noble gas solubility techniques leading the way stute et al 1995 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 while a wide variety of other environmental tracers cook and herczeg 1999 may also assist palaeoarchive interpretation the above methods are still the mainstay any comprehensive study of aquifer palaeoarchive potential requires conjunctive use of a range of environmental tracers for example the whole concept of groundwater age remains the subject of much debate e g bethke and johnson 2008 suckow 2014 insofar as many pumped waters are mixtures which may be of binary exponential or other type małoszewski and zuber 1982 in such cases a single figure age derived from a particular indicator is no more than a mean residence time and to decipher this will probably need more than one age tracer then there is the question of just how reliable a particular aquifer may be as a palaeoarchive which will require detailed consideration of temperature related phenomena via stable isotopes and noble gas concentrations ideally related to data from other proxies the performance of different aquifer types as palaeoarchives has yet to be much investigated while studies like those of edmunds et al 2004 in africa and jiráková et al 2011 in europe surveyed a range of confined aquifers and found some divergence in their behaviour relative to palaeorecharge they were not able to focus in on a detailed comparison of individual aquifer behaviour the mesoscale london basin of southeast england by contrast provides an ideal opportunity to investigate this by enabling the comparison of two aquifers with contrasting physico chemical properties but which must have received a similar endowment of recharge under past climatic conditions owing to the geographical proximity of their outcrops the two principal aquifers of the london basin are the chalk and the lower greensand lgs both aquifers are confined over much of their area by younger strata and at depth contain at least a proportion of palaeowater defined here as the result of recharge occurring 12 kyr ago in pre holocene times despite the undertaking of several radiocarbon based studies in the late twentieth century to investigate this mather et al 1973 smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 elliot et al 1999 researchers have struggled to assign realistic ages to palaeowater in the chalk owing to its unique lithology downing et al 1979 while largely ignoring the greater palaeoarchive potential of the volumetrically smaller but less exploited lgs these studies used environmental tracers variously in the form of hydrochemistry stable isotopes noble gases and isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic this paper builds on them by adding two tracers not previously applied in the basin namely cfcs chlorofluorocarbons and 14c doc radiocarbon activity of dissolved organic carbon these tracers permit a better understanding of the processes governing apparent groundwater ages in the two aquifers thereby providing a more secure framework against which to judge each aquifer s potential as an archive of late pleistocene climatic conditions 2 background 2 1 description of the basin the london basin is an approximately e w trending syncline of asymmetric cross section sumbler 1996 mostly lying between the hills of the chilterns and the north downs fig 1 some formations in the palaeogene have aquifer potential but are limited both in terms of yield and water quality bearcock and smedley 2010 the principal aquifers are instead found in the underlying cretaceous the chalk upper cretaceous is present across the whole of the london basin though is overlain over approximately half its area by the london clay aquitard eocene which dominates the palaeogene sequence royse et al 2012 the underlying lgs lower cretaceous however was not deposited across the eastern part of the basin owing to the relatively lower sea level at the time resulting in the emergence of the london platform while the outcrop and therefore recharge area of the chalk is reasonably large fig 1 that of the lgs is much smaller particularly on the northern limb of the basin where sediments were deposited in a series of local basins whose hydraulic relationship with the confined aquifer remains somewhat uncertain egerton 1994 natural discharge from the chalk occurs slowly through the london clay aquitard into the river thames except where chalk is exposed directly in the bed of the thames to the east of london where more rapid flow is possible wrb 1972 the natural discharge of the synclinal lgs to the west of london is also assumed to be directed towards the thames but at an extremely slow rate given the preservation of artesian conditions in the slough area darling and lewis 2021 the current lack of evidence for significant invasion of the chalk aquifer by lgs water and the existence of a brackish sump in the deepest part of the lgs egerton 1994 the chalk and lgs have contrasting hydrogeological properties the chalk is a fractured microporous coccolith limestone leading to two main disadvantages for a potential palaeoarchive the high probability of groundwater mixing price 1987 and the potential for extreme dissolution reprecipitation exchange between water and rock in the dic dissolved inorganic carbon system smith et al 1976 the consequences are blurring of the age profile and the compromise of radiocarbon dating based on the conventionally used 14c dic method by contrast the lgs is a better proposition with largely intergranular flow mather et al 1973 and a much lower potential for dic exchange in several respects therefore the lgs provides a good baseline against which to compare the chalk when using age tracers 2 2 previous groundwater age related studies in the basin 2 2 1 lower greensand as the subsidiary principal aquifer of the london basin the lgs has received comparatively little attention from a palaeorecharge point of view mather et al 1973 measured 14c dic on waters from eight sites from n to s across the basin finding 14c activities close to or below the detection limit 0 1pmc or percent modern carbon at two sites interpreted as indicating ages of 24kyr further 14c dic measurements from the lgs were reported by evans et al 1979 this time with stable isotope data showing that waters with low 14c dic activities also possessed more negative δ18o and δ2h values indicating recharge under different climatic conditions measurements of δ13c dic were used to account for inputs of 14c dead carbon from the aquifer matrix although fundamentally a sandstone aquifer the lgs contains some calcite cement except where complete de calcification has occurred on this basis a minimum age of 29 kyr was assigned to a water from slough in the areal centre of the basin fig 1 additional sampling in the early 1990s found the same association of low 14c dic with more negative δ18o and δ2h darling et al 1997 2 2 2 chalk the first chalk 14c dic measurements were reported by smith et al 1976 data from 22sites all north of the basin axis were converted to apparent ages using a simple δ13c based correction the maximum ages obtained from sites in central london were 25 kyr stable o and h isotopes showed a similar association with 14c as found for the lgs but to a lesser extent a reinterpretation of the data with a more sophisticated treatment for the 14c age correction was published by downing et al 1979 but still concluded that groundwater 25 kyr was present in the deep less fractured parts of the basin edmunds et al 1987 investigated a nw se cross section through the chalk aquifer in berkshire situated towards the western end of the basin moving from unconfined to confined conditions samples from 17 sites were measured for 14c dic stable o h and c isotopes and noble gases in addition to inorganic hydrochemistry major minor and selected trace species although a range of apparent ages extending to 20 kyr was obtained by using three different correction models the one theoretically most applicable to the chalk fontes and garnier 1979 gave ages 13kyr suggesting that little evidence of palaeorecharge remained in this part of the basin this conclusion was supported by a lack of consistent δ18o and δ2h depletion though noble gases used for the first time in the basin did give indications of cooler recharge temperatures edmunds et al 1987 recognised the high potential for groundwater mixing in the chalk but had at that time no environmental tracer other than the relatively insensitive 3h with which to investigate this data from a larger number of sites 35 in total situated mainly within greater london and lying both north and south of the river thames was reported by dennis et al 1997 an attempt to correct 14c dic data for the effects of groundwater mixing was made and gave maximum apparent ages 37 kyr though most were significantly younger it was noted that the apparently oldest water coincided with the deepest part of the aquifer along the synclinal axis limited δ18o and δ2h depletion was observed in line with the study of smith et al 1976 noble gas recharge temperatures ngts showed a fall of 5 7 c in the older waters compared to modern recharge three of the dennis et al 1997 sites were the same as sampled by smith et al 1976 and in one case waltham abbey pumping station north london there was a large discrepancy between the measured 14c activities however the lea valley in which waltham abbey ps is situated has been the site of large scale managed aquifer recharge mar activities across the past seven decades wrb 1972 headon et al 2009 so this seems likely to be responsible elliot et al 1999 presented new 14c dic data for six sites in the berkshire chalk plus 14 sites across the greater london area a further three london sites included a re sampling of one smith et al 1976 site and two of dennis et al 1997 in no case was a significant difference observed the new berkshire data extended the edmunds et al 1987 transect further southeast but gave similar contrast between 14c dic values in the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer the london data largely followed the plan of w e and sn sampling transects terminating in central london both in berkshire and london a similar picture emerged of declining 14c activities enriched δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h depletions and lower ngts as the axial zone of the basin was approached as with previous studies maximum ages of 24 kyr were inferred i e well into late devensian glacial times 2 3 investigation methods new to the basin as detailed above the two main weaknesses of previous studies in the london basin chalk were concerned with age ambiguities and the lack of a sensitive indicator showing the degree of penetration of modern water into the confined aquifer clearly for a study of palaeoarchive potential these uncertainties have to be addressed so two additional methods have been applied 2 3 1 cfcs the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are members of the halocarbon family of non toxic compounds traces of which are found in the atmosphere owing to release during industrial processes and refrigerant leakage commencing in the 1930s the two main compounds are cfc 11 ccl3f and cfc 12 ccl2f2 they have accumulated in the atmosphere at a known rate and although now in decline due to a worldwide ban resulting from their ozone depleting properties they remain capable under the right conditions of giving quantitative groundwater age information in the range 0 70 years plummer and busenberg 2000 this relies on equilibration between the atmosphere and infiltrating rainfall being locked in to groundwater at the time of recharge to the aquifer under less favourable conditions leakage to the aquifer from e g refrigeration plants or degreasing operations they still provide indications of the presence of modern 70 yr old groundwater even if the amount may not be quantifiable darling et al 2012 cfcs are routinely used for many types of groundwater investigation chambers et al 2019 their use in the present study primarily focuses on their property of being detectable down to ultra trace concentrations bullister and weiss 1988 2 3 2 14c doc radiocarbon is frequently used in groundwater investigations see a general outline in section s1 of the supplement to this paper but conventionally has been carried out on the dic component of the water e g tamers 1975 the initial goal of 14c doc dating is to isolate and measure the fa fulvic acid or high molecular weight fraction considered to derive from soil organic matter murphy et al 1989 rather than the ha humic acid or low molecular weight fraction that could be derived from various sources including refractory 14c dead carbon present in the aquifer matrix however this would be less significant in the lgs and chalk both of which contain generally very low amounts of solid phase organic carbon pacey 1989 macleod 1998 more recent studies have been carried out by other methods of extraction and doc oxidation that did not differentiate or exclude certain pools of doc heine and einsiedl 2021 the radiocarbon activity of doc was first investigated as a potential water dating agent more than three decades ago in the milk river aquifer of western canada murphy et al 1989 wassenaar et al 1991 the principal advantage of 14c doc over dic dating was considered to be the lack of significant dilution of doc by inputs of dead carbon from the aquifer matrix and the results largely supported this with seven of the eight sites yielding a higher 14c activity for doc than dic the early promise of 14c doc for groundwater dating based on the milk river research led to attempts to apply the technique elsewhere in old groundwaters though usually reporting only a handful of analyses for individual aquifers purdy et al 1992 published four pairs of analyses from the aquia and magothy aquifers in the atlantic coastal plain of maryland usa showing again that doc was greater than dic activity for most sample pairs geyer et al 1993 presented results from 18 sites distributed over three different aquifer types across germany in all but one case doc exceeded dic activity thus in line with the previous studies it had been assumed in previous studies that 14c doc ages could simply be calculated in terms of the 14c decay curve with a 100 pmc initial activity ia but geyer et al 1993 proposed that an ia value in the range 75 95 might be more appropriate to reflect mixing of young and older doc in the recharge zone montjotin et al 1998 studied seven sites in the mol confined sand aquifer in belgium where they too found doc dic activities additionally they measured a few unconfined chalk sites in the paris basin but 14c activities were high 70 90 pmc for both dic and doc so of limited relevance to the present study however they also investigated the ia of doc in the soil zone of a sand aquifer in the loire valley and concluded that this could vary between 75 and 100 pmc since the 1990s however rather few studies have been published the main challenge appearing anecdotally to be the reliable extraction of sufficient carbon from the very low doc concentrations typically found in groundwaters nevertheless recently godfrey et al 2021 used 14c doc as a way of circumventing the challenge of 14c dic groundwater dating in an active volcanic region of chile 13 sites while thomas et al 2021 reported 14c doc results from 26 sites in nevada usa derived from volcanic and carbonate aquifers as with previous studies both found that for individual sites doc almost always exceeded dic activity and therefore gave younger ages even after allowing for dic age correction godfrey et al 2021 used varying values of ia based on site specific assessments of the amount of mixing between doc reservoirs but thomas et al 2021 concluded that no ia correction for calculating 14c doc ages was necessary in their aquifer system however few of the samples in either study gave low 14c doc activities and there remained a need for more data particularly below the 20 pmc level the study of heine and einsiedl 2021 in a carbonate aquifer contributed a few sub 20 pmc values reaching a 14c doc minimum of 5 7 pmc they decided to use a blanket ia value of 85 to calculate their 14c doc ages which were significantly younger than corrected dic ages in line with all the other studies considered above 3 site locations sampling and analysis 3 1 site locations lgs sites 1 10 divide into two groups those in the shallow partially confined hythe formation on the southern edge of the basin 1 5 and those in the stratigraphically overlying but deep and fully confined folkestone formation 6 10 this is illustrated in fig 2 while the geographic locations are shown in fig 3 and site data reported in table 1 chalk sites a y can also be divided into two basic groupings the western basin in berkshire a f and the central basin beneath greater london g x three sites are wholly unconfined a g x the remaining site y is in the far east of the confined basin fig 3 site data are given in table 1 all sampled boreholes abstract from formations in the white chalk subgroup middle and upper chalk in older literature except for the three unconfined sites which include some grey chalk formerly lower chalk strata and a few other confined sites d f and y where boreholes may barely penetrate the upper chalk but are screened in the immediately overlying thin sands and gravels at the base of the palaeogene beneath the london clay relying on hydraulic continuity with the chalk to yield sufficient water 3 2 sampling all samples were collected at or close to borehole wellheads except at site 3 lgs where the sampling point is 500 m from the source boreholes were sampled after temperature ph alkalinity specific electrical conductivity sec and dissolved oxygen do had stabilised values are reported in table1 samples for chemistry δ18o δ2h and δ13c dic were collected in hdpe bottles samples for 14c dic were collected in 1 litre glass bottles while those for 14c doc were either collected in 50 litre polyethylene drums or more recently in 2 5 l amber glass bottles with polycone tops cfc samples were collected under water according to the method described in iaea 2006 while noble gas samples were taken in clamped 10 mm o d copper tubes to check the δ13c values of soil co2 necessary for14c dic age correction some soil gas sample pairs were collected in pre evacuated glass bulbs from the outcrops of the chalk and lgs using a hollow spike sampler 3 3 processing samples for 14c doc measurement samples taken in 1997 98 were prepared by extraction of the hmw compounds humic and fulvic acids from approximately 50 l of groundwater by adsorption onto a deae cellulose resin the hmw compounds were eluted from the resin using 0 5 m naoh the eluant was acidified to ph 1 with hcl to precipitate the humic acid ha fraction while the fulvic acid fa fraction remained in the eluant analysis of the fulvic acid fraction was carried out by ams at nerc rcf at east kilbride scotland here samples were decanted leaving approximately 5 ml of fa rich solution in the sample bottles no obvious ha precipitate was observed measured supernatant sample volumes were rotary evaporated in acid washed sample rinsed glassware until a few ml of solution remained this solution was quantitatively transferred to pre weighed acid washed glass beakers and dried in a freeze dryer known weights of dried solids were converted to co2 either by combustion using an elemental analyser samples from sites a l q and r or under vacuum in sealed quartz tubes in the presence of cuo and ag wire sites b c d e and f for samples taken in 2013 14 four 2 5 l glass bottles were collected per site initially aliquots of 2 5 8 0 l of whole sample water were subjected to rotary evaporation and prepared to dried solids as described above inorganic carbon was removed from the dried solids by fumigation with concentrated hcl in an evacuated 0 1 bar desiccator at 62 c known weights of dried solids were converted to co2 using an elemental analyser later after difficulties with obtaining sufficient carbon for analysis from some sites seven available reserve water samples were submitted to the research and development department at beta analytic miami usa here aliquots of up to 1 l of incrementally filtered sample water were subject to uv oxidation uvox in the presence of oxygen gas and the resulting co2 was collected for 14c and δ13c analysis further details of the uvox method as performed at beta analytic are provided in section s2 of the supplement the co2 from all three preparation methods was cryogenically purified prior to conversion to graphite using fe zn reduction 3 4 analysis inorganic hydrochemistry was determined by the centre for environmental geochemistry at the british geological survey bgs in keyworth using icp mass spectrometry and ion chromatography cfcs and noble gases were measured at bgs wallingford by gas chromatography and quadrupole mass spectrometry respectively o and h stable isotope ratios were determined by dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms at the stable isotope facility at bgs keyworth while most samples for 14c dic and doc were analysed by ams accelerator mass spectrometry at nerc rcf in east kilbride although a subset was measured for 14c doc via the research and development laboratory of beta analytic in miami florida using ams during the ams sample preparation separate aliquots of co2 were taken and measured for δ13c by dual inlet irms where sample size allowed cfc detection limits were 0 01 and 0 03 pmol l for cfc 11 and cfc 12 respectively average measurement precisions for noble gases were 3 5 he 1 5 ne 2 0 ar 2 2 kr and 5 4 xe typical stable isotope precisions were 0 1 δ18o 1 δ2h and 0 2 δ13c dic measurement precisions 1σ for radiocarbon averaged 0 23 pmc 14c dic and 0 38 pmc 14c doc 4 results 4 1 hydrochemistry since the primary focus of this paper is on isotopic and trace gas indicators inorganic hydrochemistry is reported and briefly interpreted in section s3 of the supplement 4 2 dissolved gases cfc data table 2 are cross plotted at different scales in fig 4 a and 4b the first plot shows those results from 75 of the sites in the context of the atmospheric input curve usgs 2021 here converted to dissolved concentration and therefore equivalent to a piston plug flow model fig 4a although london is a megacity darling and gooddy 2007 found no evidence for any local atmospheric enhancement effect preserved in soil gases unlike for example the study of ho et al 1998 in the new york area all except one of the lgs sites have low or undetectable concentrations partly obscuring a few chalk sites on the plot namely e berkshire v south london and y eastern essex apart from these low concentration sites one sample t falls on the binary mixing line between modern and old groundwater otherwise all remaining low chalk sites show evidence of modest cfc enhancement usually in cfc 11 which is more soluble in water than cfc 12 the effect is seen across urban and rural areas alike remaining sites show some very high concentrations of both cfcs though with cfc 12 reaching the most elevated values at sites i j and s fig 4b the sole lgs site to show major cfc enhancement site 1 is the only wholly unconfined site measured in the lgs aquifer the high chalk sites are mostly at or near the edge of confinement by palaeogene cover however despite the existence of some high cfc concentrations these are only relative and even the highest value falls far below the general dissolved organic water quality action level of 0 1 μg l in drinking water for ne ar kr and xe table 2 only subtle variations are apparent but are interpretable in terms of surface equilibration temperature ngt stute and schlosser 1993 and excess air ea heaton and vogel 1981 values prevailing at the time of recharge here calculated using the closed system equilibration ce method of aeschbach hertig et al 2000 in contrast he values range over three orders of magnitude presumably owing to the age related accumulation of 4he not surprisingly therefore the highest he values are associated with the deeper confined sites in both aquifers site y in the chalk and site 10 in the lgs 586 10 8 and 1090 10 8 cm3stp g respectively however to fully reflect the excess 4he component due to accumulation subtractions for the ngt and ea components need to be applied resulting in slightly lower 4heexc values table 2 4 3 isotopes data for δ18o and δ2h table 3 generally adhere closely to craig s 1961 global meteoric water line fig 5 a the lgs data have the greatest range partly due to the geographical spread of sites but also to palaeoclimatic factors considered further in the discussion the chalk data are more scattered especially site k which would conventionally be interpreted as providing evidence of evaporative modification this and other aspects are considered further in the discussion in terms of dic isotopes table 3 lgs waters show rather little change in δ13c but reach a maximum 14c activity of 80 pmc fig 5 b chalk samples however show a generally good correlation between 14c and δ13c attributable to water rock interaction and commonly observed by other studies smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 elliot et al 1999 for the same reason maximum 14c activities are no higher than 60 pmc the implications for residence time calculation are considered further in the discussion below in contrast chalk maximum doc activities reach 94 pmc table 3 fig 5c presumably because of the lack of significant water rock interaction some 75 of the data lie within the δ13c range of 23 to 30 typical of temperate zone soil organic carbon smith and chalk 2021 in this study the evaporation method for concentrating doc tended on occasion to produce more negative δ13c doc values but mainly for the chalk rather than the lgs this was probably due to the higher dic concentration in chalk samples requiring longer hcl fumigation times to remove all contaminant dic from the dried solids after rotary evaporation which may have oxidised and fractionated the fa fraction however this was not a problem with the uvox preparation method at least in those samples yielding sufficient co2 gas for both 14c and δ13c determination soil δ13c co2 values averaged 26 1 and 24 9 for the chalk and lgs respectively table s4 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of recharge to the aquifers one premise of this study is that inputs of stable o and h isotopes from rainfall vary in a predictable way across the basin as inferred from the uk groundwater isotope map of darling et al 2003 but further developed for the lgs by darling and lewis 2021 who considered that inputs from the northern and southern lgs outcrops consistently differ by 0 5 in δ18o see their fig 2 superimposed on any areal differences is a further displacement due to palaeoclimatic shifts in δ18o and δ2h operating beyond the holocene pleistocene boundary some 12 kyr ago thus lgs sites with 14c activities of 20 pmc have more negative stable isotope values the aldershot sites 6 7 and 8 on the southern limb of the lgs syncline and the slough sites 9 and 10 in the ns geographical centre of the basin the reason for the negative displacement between the aldershot and slough samples is thought to be due to slough lying at or near the termination of a flowline deriving from the northern limb of the syncline darling and lewis 2021 a similar age depletion effect operates to an extent in the chalk for example lowest 14c activities are associated with samples more negative than the 30 year 1990 2019 weighted mean of 7 3 δ18o and 49 δ2h for rainfall observed at the wallingford gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation station 70 km west of central london however there is no discernible north south divide in the data partly because the chalk outcrop in the basin is more extensive but also more constricted from n to s than that of the lgs nonetheless the scatter in the chalk δ18o and δ2h values is inherently greater than for the lgs while recharge mechanisms to the two aquifers are different predictable piston flow infiltration to the lgs less predictable mixing and matrix fracture exchange in the chalk unsaturated zone any intra aquifer differences would presumably be smoothed out in confinement instead the scatter must reflect the almost infinite possibilities for mixing in the chalk aquifer between waters of different ages conceivably further influenced by the effects of differing pumping rates as previously proposed for dissolved ch4 by darling and gooddy 2006 could different lgs and chalk infiltration mechanisms lead to inter aquifer selection in groundwater isotope composition to the extent that peak palaeowater isotope depletions might differ between the aquifers it was shown by darling et al 2003 that there was no bias within measurement error between weighted mean isotope values in rainfall and local chalk groundwaters around the wallingford gnip station but for the lgs there are no similar data notwithstanding this comparisons between chalk and lgs groundwaters from the same area can be attempted there are rather few suitable chalk lgs pairs here taken as being within 10 km known stable isotope values unconfined and or of known holocene age but details of available pairs around the perimeter of the london basin are provided in section s4 of the supplement while there are signs of geographical variation as expected there is no evidence of systematic difference between lgs and chalk stable isotope values for individual pairs so it is therefore concluded that no significant holocene selection bias exists and by implication also in the late devensian 5 2 anthropogenic inputs 5 2 1 modern tracers early studies of both the chalk and the lgs reported tritium 3h data as the only contemporaneously available technique for identifying the presence of modern recharge i e since the aerial thermonuclear testing of the mid 1960s in both aquifers detectable 3h activities were found in the unconfined sections as expected but also in some apparently old confined chalk groundwaters smith et al 1976 and in the part confined hythe formation beneath the southern lgs outcrop though the deeper folkestone formation remained tritium free within measurement error mather et al 1973 in the present study measurement of 3h currently only present in rainfall at activities of a few tu tritium units was replaced by cfcs as a by now much more sensitive indicator of the presence of modern recharge fig 4 shows just how pervasive cfc enhancement is in the chalk aquifer for nearly all sites confined or not cfcs cannot be used for reliable age estimation instead their value lies in showing just how far anthropogenic contamination may have penetrated the aquifer by contrast while three lgs sites provided some evidence of enhancement especially the unconfined site 1 fig 4b some of the others had values below detection particularly from the deep 500 m bgl sites around aldershot sites 6 7 and 8 fig 4a implying that these waters are unaffected by any mixing with modern water 5 2 2 induced binary mixing in the chalk aquifer beyond the general conclusion based on a variety of tracers that most chalk groundwater has to a certain extent been heterogenised by processes promoted by its extensive fracture porosity it is clear in a few cases that simple binary mixing is occurring the plot of 14c dic vs δ13c dic fig 5b picks out particularly sites k s and t as falling on a mixing trend between young and old water these sites plus i and u also have the most positive δ18o values fig 5a suggesting all have an input of surface water at site t situated a few hundred metres from the river thames on reclaimed marshland this is clearly a possibility while site k lies a similar distance from flooded gravel pits and the grand union canal site s lies at the southern end of the new river a large aqueduct supplying london with water since the seventeenth century which ended in filter ponds adjacent to the site while the aqueduct now terminates a few kilometres to the north the observed isotope effects may be a legacy of this former activity sites h and w also show evidence for mixing fig 5b but this is more likely due to their positions near the edge of confinement where they may receive a certain amount of concentrated surface runoff from the clays of the overlying palaeogene probably explaining their high cfc excesses as also noted earlier for sites i and j fig 4b 5 3 old groundwater 5 3 1 dic and doc stable isotopes the dic system all δ13c dic values appear consistent with an ultimate derivation from the reaction between soil or rock carbonate minerals and the weak carbonic acid produced by the solution of soil co2 by infiltrating rainwater in other words there is no evidence for anthropogenic 13c inputs affecting any of the sites soil co2 in temperate climates is commonly assigned a δ13c value of 25 e g fontes and garnier 1979 limited soil gas sampling table s4 gave results of 26 chalk and 25 lgs so these values are retained for 14c dic age correction the δ13c of soil and rock carbonate δ13c carb is less well constrained there are almost no data on the δ13c carb values of the carbonate cement of the lgs matrix evans et al 1979 found some highly variable values in core from the warlingham stratigraphic borehole a few kilometres southeast of site x but concluded that the carbonate in the aquifer is predominantly of marine origin with a δ13c close to zero smith et al 1976 assumed a chalk δ13c carb value of 2 35 close to the bulk value of 2 5 since attributed to the white chalk in southern england on the basis of numerous cliff and borehole core profiles collated by jarvis et al 2006 although it was hypothesised by smith et al 1976 that the reactive surfaces of individual chalk coccoliths are slowly becoming less positive in δ13c owing to prolonged exchange with dic there is no clear evidence that this has occurred on a significant scale data from smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 and the present study all show chalk δ13c dic values peaking in the range 0 5 to 0 which would be consistent with a water reaching equilibrium with a chalk matrix having a value of 2 5 δ13c kloppmann et al 1998 the evolutionary path of dic in each aquifer will tend to diverge after the initial carbonate dissolution the 1 1 reaction between soil co2 of δ13c 25 and calcite 0 leads initially to δ13c dic values of around 13 fontes and garnier 1979 open system conditions provide the potential for further re equilibration with soil co2 thus decreasing δ13c dic values for chalk groundwaters this is limited by the large excess of carbonate available so it is unusual to see values 15 in the poorly buffered lgs values down to 20 are known e g darling and gooddy 2006 but more normally lie in the range 12 to 16 closed system conditions which tend to occur under confinement allow further interaction between the dic and the rock leading to the point where δ13c dic values in the chalk can approach those of the rock matrix see previous paragraph this is considered to be very largely due to dissolution reprecipitation processes rather than isotopic re equilibration which is an extremely slow process evans et al 1979 in the lgs however the process is much more limited owing to the relative scarcity of carbonate in the rock the doc system this should in theory be much less variable than the dic values of δ13c doc measured on the fa fraction of soil zone water were not measured during this project but are assumed to have values 25 based on other studies from the uk e g mctiernan et al 1999 palmer et al 2001 owing to a lack of fractionation during solution both the lgs and the chalk have very low matrix organic contents 0 2 by weight in the hythe formation macleod 1998 and 0 1 for the white chalk pacey 1989 most of which is assumed to be highly refractory and therefore unlikely to influence the doc in terms of its isotopic composition 5 3 2 dic and doc groundwater ages calculated 14c ages are reported in table 4 the dic ages are corrected by the evans et al 1979 model first developed for the lgs while the fontes and garnier 1979 model was considered for the chalk erratic performance at higher δ13c dic values edmunds et al 1987 ruled it out for this study lgs ages have here been modelled with two different δ13c carb values because of some uncertainty over the appropriate value to use see earlier though at an average difference of 2 kyr the effect is only small for a 5 difference in δ13c carb doc ages are calculated with two different ia values the traditional 100 pmc and the 85pmc value used by heine and einsiedl 2021 for their jurassic carbonate aquifer table 4 shows that when an 85 pmc value is used ages at the unconfined sites a g and 1 are 1 3 kyr closer to modern so this is the preferred ia for the present study ages calculating in excess of the effective 30 kyr limit for dic dating are reported as 30 kyr the limit for doc dates should in theory be higher perhaps 35 kyr because of the reduction in dead carbon inputs but none of the doc ages reported here exceeds 25 kyr in the lgs aquifer doc ages tend initially to exceed dic ages but cross over at about 15 kyr until the 30 kyr dic dating barrier is reached at which point the maximum doc age is 25 kyr fig 6 this could represent the age limit for fresh water in the lgs of the london basin although there are indications that older saline waters exist 5 4 below the chalk plot shows much more scatter as already demonstrated for example by δ18o and δ2h fig 5a though with most samples falling on or below the 1 1 line while a dic doc age calibration curve can be attempted for the lgs fig 6 clearly this would not be meaningful for the chalk instead it may be more useful to compare chalk dic and doc ages in relation to the basin geology fig 7 a c the dic ages 7a show reasonably well that residence times increase at depth under central london as expected but have an unlikely distribution along the berkshire section doc ages however compare well with the geology in both berkshire and greater london 7b some of the variation could be due to the differing borehole depths 7c boreholes are normally left unlined in the chalk potentially allowing mixing from multiple horizons in the deeper boreholes for both dic and doc the apparent ages of mixed samples are reduced by modern water influx 5 2 2 otherwise virtually all doc ages are younger than 15 kyr while dic ages range up to 30 kyr a tentative age profile curve has been added to the doc ages fig 7b its shape partly reflects the asymmetric nature of the basin but also suggests that representative 14c doc ages can be obtained using any of the three preparation methods used during the study 5 3 3 recharge temperatures ngts from the lgs cover the range 10 3 2 6 c table 2 and despite the small number of samples it is clear that this dataset is highly bimodal reflecting the hydrochemistry as depicted in fig s2 apart from an outlier at 10 5 cm3stp kg site 10 ea values average 4 0cm3stp kg similar to results from other lower cretaceous confined sandstones in norfolk eastern england ingram et al 2007 chalk ngt values range from 13 1 down to 4 1 c table 2 with a fairly even spread across the range the highest ngt of 13 1 c is from k a site already identified as showing mixing with surface water 5 2 2 so this is likely to have perturbed the noble gas ratios also otherwise since the mean annual air temperature maat in southern england is 10 c maximum ngts of around this value would be expected of the four sites with ngts 10 c all are unconfined or near the edge of confinement g h i and x conversely the four sites yielding the lowest ngts 4 5 c are all sites at least 20 km into confinement o p q y ea values average 3 1 cm3stp kg sd 2 1 while this is approximately twice the mean value from the unconfined chalk in west berkshire darling et al 2017 there is little evidence to associate higher ea with cooler ngt values so with the exception of temperature recharge conditions seem likely to have remained similar with no evidence for a marked increase in rainfall intensity such as inferred by zhu and kipfer 2010 5 3 4 helium 4 accumulation accumulation of 4he in older groundwaters is commonly observed e g solomon 2000 in addition to in aquifer production from radioactive decay of u th series minerals 4he may be supplemented by a flux from deeper strata and therefore he accumulation rates are aquifer specific rather than carrying absolute age implications nevertheless in a given aquifer unit an inverse relationship between 4heexc and 14c activity would be expected for waters not exceeding radiocarbon age and fig 8 confirms this to be the case for the london basin there is a relationship rather better for 14c doc than dic especially in the chalk where there is a large scatter below the 1pmc level by contrast the lgs data are much more constrained with a major difference between the sites in the hythe and folkestone units this may be due to easier escape of 4he from the semi confined hythe compared to the fully confined folkestone 5 4 preservation of the palaeorecharge signal the deep confined sites of the lgs would be inherently more likely to retain a record of late devensian recharge than the heavily fractured chalk the comparative thinness of the folkestone aquifer unit fig 1 would also favour the preservation of piston flow rather than the mixing that often characterises the chalk 4 2 5 2 2 however the question arises as to what extent intensive abstraction from the chalk may have perturbed any natural palaeowater preservation while it is certain that chalk groundwater flow lines beneath central london have been modified by pumping wrb 1972 the extent is difficult to assess since isotopic methods have only been available in recent decades the scarce time lapse radiocarbon evidence outlined in 2 2 2 above did not usually show significant change but the time gaps would only have been 20 years the present paper reports two sites j and u also sampled by elliot et al 1999 again about 20 years previously in both cases the new ams measured 14c dic activity was slightly lower than the older decay counted value so perhaps a technique based phenomenon rather than a real change an effective way of testing the two aquifers as palaeoclimate archives is to plot the model ages from table 4 in relation to δ temperature values derived from ngt values in table 2 and assuming a late holocene maat of 10 c fig 9 also shown on the figure is the global surface temperature change curve covering the past 24 kyr osman et al 2021 a period including the last glacial maximum lgm at 15 20kyr although the curve is based on 14c results calibrated to calendar years while the water ages are uncalibrated the plot is sufficient to show that doc ages are more in agreement with it than the dic ages some of which appear too old for their temperatures in the lgs doc ages divide between the hythe holocene and folkestone late devensian units the doc ages for the chalk by comparison tend to plot below the curve in its post lgm section suggesting mixing between modern and late pleistocene waters however doc ages are not wholly without issues the main example of this is at the unconfined chalk site x where the doc age is 7 6kyr but dic gives a much more likely modern age see also fig 7 the ngt difference of 7 c shown by the lgs samples coincides with the temperature curve of osman et al 2021 implying that late pleistocene recharge is well preserved at depth a similar difference in ngt values between holocene and pleistocene recharge was found for the triassic sandstone aquifer in the east midlands of england also considered to preserve palaeowater effectively bath et al 1979 despite the lgs possessing apparently good palaeoarchive properties a question remaining about the aquifer is the age of the residual saline water known to lie in the axial zone from historic borehole evidence egerton 1994 but which is otherwise unexploited or tested in modern times it was proposed by darling and lewis 2021 that hydrochemical data from the slough area reveal evidence of mixing with this brackish water a plot of 4heexc vs cl for four sites in the area including sites 9 and 10 shows a well correlated mixing trend fig 10 given the equally good correlation between 14c doc and 4he in fig 8 extrapolation on a doc age vs cl plot suggests that water close to the centre of the saline zone at 375 mg l cl legacy value for winkfield lodge prestwich 1895 could have an age of 50kyr inset to fig 10 5 5 the wider basin east of london the london basin continues to broaden until around the thames estuary the confining palaeogene cover is 90 km wide from north to south fig 1 while the lgs is largely absent the chalk remains present across the basin to test the theory that older less mixed chalk groundwater might still be preserved at depth in the eastern axial zone of the basin fig 1 a borehole site y fig 3 was sampled on the dengie peninsula of coastal essex the area most remote from the chalk outcrop however as tables 2 and 3 show values of δ18o δ2h and δ13c dic were all comparable to waters from other deep confined chalk sites while the presence of cfcs albeit at very low concentrations was another similarity although at 586 10 8 ccstp g the concentration of 4he was the highest chalk value found during this study slightly higher values were reported for some berkshire sites by elliot et al 1999 these results from dengie therefore strongly suggest that the degradation of the palaeoclimatic signal identified in the aquifer beneath london extends throughout the confined chalk of the whole onshore london basin 6 conclusions earlier studies of the age of groundwater in the principal aquifers of the london basin chalk and lower greensand established that both still contained evidence of recharge in late devensian last ice age times but left much doubt over the maximum ages and therefore degree of preservation of these remnants the present study has provided more robust and reliable water age characterisation with the aid of techniques new to the basin specifically chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and the radiocarbon activity of dissolved organic carbon 14c doc measuring the latter presented some technical challenges at the low doc concentrations encountered but comparable results using three different extraction methods appear to validate the doc dating approach most significantly all 14c doc activities have been above the limit of detection whereas the corresponding 14c dic activities have sometimes been below this level rendering it only possible to assign a model age of 30 kyr to these waters minimum 14c doc activities found for the chalk and lgs were 10 6 and 5 0 pmc respectively providing a degree of headroom above the detection limit and consequently usually resulting in younger ages than the corresponding 14c dic values a phenomenon commonly observed in similar studies on this basis the oldest chalk groundwater identified was 17kyr and the oldest lgs water 23 kyr a similar level of discrepancy was shown by climate related stable isotope depletions the lgs reaching a minimum of 8 2 δ18o compared to 7 8 for the chalk and noble gas derived recharge temperatures giving minima of 2 6 c lgs and 4 1 c chalk despite the exact meaning of groundwater age being debatable it seems likely that the lgs substantially preserves its ice age recharge endowment at depth but that this has disappeared from the chalk leaving evidence of its previous existence inferable only from mixing relationships the susceptibility of the chalk to mixing has been well demonstrated by this study particularly by the detection of cfcs throughout the confined aquifer even at 40 km from outcrop although some of this may have been promoted by large scale pumping from the aquifer the chalk s highly fractured nature would probably have led to much the same outcome even under natural flow gradients while there must now be little expectation of finding relict devensian recharge anywhere in the chalk of the london basin the lgs has been shown to have good potential as a palaeoarchive in particular future research could help to unravel the relationship between the deep fresh water boreholes and the brackish water along the basin axis which may preserve evidence of earlier devensian recharge under a warmer climate more broadly the results from this study when compared to lgm cooling effects preserved in other archive aquifers are similar to those included in the arppe and karhu 2010 survey of δ18o depletion in european groundwaters and the seltzer et al 2021 survey of low to medium latitude noble gas temperatures worldwide this provides additional evidence that the lgs aquifer performs

2436,the concept of aquifer basins as palaeoclimate archives has existed for some decades yet few detailed studies comparing aquifer types have been carried out to assess the potential of a particular aquifer as an archive its hydrogeochemical characteristics must be thoroughly investigated ideally in comparison to an adjacent aquifer which can be shown to substantially preserve its ice age endowment at depth the london basin uk presents such an opportunity containing two main aquifers of contrasting type the chalk a fractured microporous limestone and the lower greensand a porous sandstone despite intensive exploitation of both evidence for devensian late glacial water remains at depth though this differs between aquifer type to understand the reasons for this a suite of environmental tracers has been applied in addition to hydrochemistry stable isotopes δ18o δ2h carbon isotopes δ13c dic 14c dic and noble gases he ne ar kr and xe two tracers new to the basin cfcs and 14c doc have been used in effect the lower greensand appears to be the reference aquifer preserving recharge from prior to the last glacial maximum lgm while the chalk contains mixed water with no remaining trace of the undiluted pre lgm end member even at depth in remote parts of the confined basin whereas both aquifers had in the past given maximum 14c dic model ages 30kyr the effective limit of that method in the present study the use of 14c doc has reduced this to 23 4 kyr lower greensand and 17 2 kyr chalk similar contrasts in maximum stable isotope depletions 8 2 and 7 8 δ18o and noble gas derived recharge temperature minima 2 6 and 4 1 c were also observed cfcs were found at all chalk sites with traces detectable even at 40 km from outcrop so some climate signal degradation appears inevitable throughout the chalk aquifer of the basin a correlation between 14c activity and excess 4he suggests that deep saline water in the lower greensand could be 50kyr old the use of 14c doc in particular appears to be key to understanding how reliable these individual aquifers are as palaeoarchives data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction while high latitude ice cores may be the ultimate hydroclimatic indicator in terms of time resolution the changes they record may not be synchronous with those occurring at lower latitudes e g thompson et al 2005 although high resolution proxies like tree rings and lake sediments can circumvent this limitation their use can be problematic e g darling 2004 therefore opportunities to ground truth hydroclimate can be useful confined aquifers at the regional scale are often regarded as having this potential e g edmunds et al 2004 kreuzer et al 2009 priestley et al 2020 this means that they are large enough to contain groundwater recharged over millennia or longer ideally preserving evidence for past variations in temperature and hydrological regime that can ultimately feed into the validation of climate models approaches to unlocking these aquifer basin palaeoarchives have evolved over time originally the emphasis was simply on establishing the age of water in aquifers as a necessary first step with radiocarbon playing a prominent role e g hanshaw et al 1965 vogel 1968 though later supplemented by longer lived radioisotopes e g bentley et al 1986 lehmann et al 1991 for waters exceeding radiocarbon age 30 kyr stable isotopes as a proxy for recharge temperature conditions were introduced shortly after radiocarbon e g gat and issar 1974 vogel and van urk 1975 however ambiguities in interpretation led to the need for more absolute indicators of palaeotemperature with noble gas solubility techniques leading the way stute et al 1995 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 while a wide variety of other environmental tracers cook and herczeg 1999 may also assist palaeoarchive interpretation the above methods are still the mainstay any comprehensive study of aquifer palaeoarchive potential requires conjunctive use of a range of environmental tracers for example the whole concept of groundwater age remains the subject of much debate e g bethke and johnson 2008 suckow 2014 insofar as many pumped waters are mixtures which may be of binary exponential or other type małoszewski and zuber 1982 in such cases a single figure age derived from a particular indicator is no more than a mean residence time and to decipher this will probably need more than one age tracer then there is the question of just how reliable a particular aquifer may be as a palaeoarchive which will require detailed consideration of temperature related phenomena via stable isotopes and noble gas concentrations ideally related to data from other proxies the performance of different aquifer types as palaeoarchives has yet to be much investigated while studies like those of edmunds et al 2004 in africa and jiráková et al 2011 in europe surveyed a range of confined aquifers and found some divergence in their behaviour relative to palaeorecharge they were not able to focus in on a detailed comparison of individual aquifer behaviour the mesoscale london basin of southeast england by contrast provides an ideal opportunity to investigate this by enabling the comparison of two aquifers with contrasting physico chemical properties but which must have received a similar endowment of recharge under past climatic conditions owing to the geographical proximity of their outcrops the two principal aquifers of the london basin are the chalk and the lower greensand lgs both aquifers are confined over much of their area by younger strata and at depth contain at least a proportion of palaeowater defined here as the result of recharge occurring 12 kyr ago in pre holocene times despite the undertaking of several radiocarbon based studies in the late twentieth century to investigate this mather et al 1973 smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 elliot et al 1999 researchers have struggled to assign realistic ages to palaeowater in the chalk owing to its unique lithology downing et al 1979 while largely ignoring the greater palaeoarchive potential of the volumetrically smaller but less exploited lgs these studies used environmental tracers variously in the form of hydrochemistry stable isotopes noble gases and isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic this paper builds on them by adding two tracers not previously applied in the basin namely cfcs chlorofluorocarbons and 14c doc radiocarbon activity of dissolved organic carbon these tracers permit a better understanding of the processes governing apparent groundwater ages in the two aquifers thereby providing a more secure framework against which to judge each aquifer s potential as an archive of late pleistocene climatic conditions 2 background 2 1 description of the basin the london basin is an approximately e w trending syncline of asymmetric cross section sumbler 1996 mostly lying between the hills of the chilterns and the north downs fig 1 some formations in the palaeogene have aquifer potential but are limited both in terms of yield and water quality bearcock and smedley 2010 the principal aquifers are instead found in the underlying cretaceous the chalk upper cretaceous is present across the whole of the london basin though is overlain over approximately half its area by the london clay aquitard eocene which dominates the palaeogene sequence royse et al 2012 the underlying lgs lower cretaceous however was not deposited across the eastern part of the basin owing to the relatively lower sea level at the time resulting in the emergence of the london platform while the outcrop and therefore recharge area of the chalk is reasonably large fig 1 that of the lgs is much smaller particularly on the northern limb of the basin where sediments were deposited in a series of local basins whose hydraulic relationship with the confined aquifer remains somewhat uncertain egerton 1994 natural discharge from the chalk occurs slowly through the london clay aquitard into the river thames except where chalk is exposed directly in the bed of the thames to the east of london where more rapid flow is possible wrb 1972 the natural discharge of the synclinal lgs to the west of london is also assumed to be directed towards the thames but at an extremely slow rate given the preservation of artesian conditions in the slough area darling and lewis 2021 the current lack of evidence for significant invasion of the chalk aquifer by lgs water and the existence of a brackish sump in the deepest part of the lgs egerton 1994 the chalk and lgs have contrasting hydrogeological properties the chalk is a fractured microporous coccolith limestone leading to two main disadvantages for a potential palaeoarchive the high probability of groundwater mixing price 1987 and the potential for extreme dissolution reprecipitation exchange between water and rock in the dic dissolved inorganic carbon system smith et al 1976 the consequences are blurring of the age profile and the compromise of radiocarbon dating based on the conventionally used 14c dic method by contrast the lgs is a better proposition with largely intergranular flow mather et al 1973 and a much lower potential for dic exchange in several respects therefore the lgs provides a good baseline against which to compare the chalk when using age tracers 2 2 previous groundwater age related studies in the basin 2 2 1 lower greensand as the subsidiary principal aquifer of the london basin the lgs has received comparatively little attention from a palaeorecharge point of view mather et al 1973 measured 14c dic on waters from eight sites from n to s across the basin finding 14c activities close to or below the detection limit 0 1pmc or percent modern carbon at two sites interpreted as indicating ages of 24kyr further 14c dic measurements from the lgs were reported by evans et al 1979 this time with stable isotope data showing that waters with low 14c dic activities also possessed more negative δ18o and δ2h values indicating recharge under different climatic conditions measurements of δ13c dic were used to account for inputs of 14c dead carbon from the aquifer matrix although fundamentally a sandstone aquifer the lgs contains some calcite cement except where complete de calcification has occurred on this basis a minimum age of 29 kyr was assigned to a water from slough in the areal centre of the basin fig 1 additional sampling in the early 1990s found the same association of low 14c dic with more negative δ18o and δ2h darling et al 1997 2 2 2 chalk the first chalk 14c dic measurements were reported by smith et al 1976 data from 22sites all north of the basin axis were converted to apparent ages using a simple δ13c based correction the maximum ages obtained from sites in central london were 25 kyr stable o and h isotopes showed a similar association with 14c as found for the lgs but to a lesser extent a reinterpretation of the data with a more sophisticated treatment for the 14c age correction was published by downing et al 1979 but still concluded that groundwater 25 kyr was present in the deep less fractured parts of the basin edmunds et al 1987 investigated a nw se cross section through the chalk aquifer in berkshire situated towards the western end of the basin moving from unconfined to confined conditions samples from 17 sites were measured for 14c dic stable o h and c isotopes and noble gases in addition to inorganic hydrochemistry major minor and selected trace species although a range of apparent ages extending to 20 kyr was obtained by using three different correction models the one theoretically most applicable to the chalk fontes and garnier 1979 gave ages 13kyr suggesting that little evidence of palaeorecharge remained in this part of the basin this conclusion was supported by a lack of consistent δ18o and δ2h depletion though noble gases used for the first time in the basin did give indications of cooler recharge temperatures edmunds et al 1987 recognised the high potential for groundwater mixing in the chalk but had at that time no environmental tracer other than the relatively insensitive 3h with which to investigate this data from a larger number of sites 35 in total situated mainly within greater london and lying both north and south of the river thames was reported by dennis et al 1997 an attempt to correct 14c dic data for the effects of groundwater mixing was made and gave maximum apparent ages 37 kyr though most were significantly younger it was noted that the apparently oldest water coincided with the deepest part of the aquifer along the synclinal axis limited δ18o and δ2h depletion was observed in line with the study of smith et al 1976 noble gas recharge temperatures ngts showed a fall of 5 7 c in the older waters compared to modern recharge three of the dennis et al 1997 sites were the same as sampled by smith et al 1976 and in one case waltham abbey pumping station north london there was a large discrepancy between the measured 14c activities however the lea valley in which waltham abbey ps is situated has been the site of large scale managed aquifer recharge mar activities across the past seven decades wrb 1972 headon et al 2009 so this seems likely to be responsible elliot et al 1999 presented new 14c dic data for six sites in the berkshire chalk plus 14 sites across the greater london area a further three london sites included a re sampling of one smith et al 1976 site and two of dennis et al 1997 in no case was a significant difference observed the new berkshire data extended the edmunds et al 1987 transect further southeast but gave similar contrast between 14c dic values in the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer the london data largely followed the plan of w e and sn sampling transects terminating in central london both in berkshire and london a similar picture emerged of declining 14c activities enriched δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h depletions and lower ngts as the axial zone of the basin was approached as with previous studies maximum ages of 24 kyr were inferred i e well into late devensian glacial times 2 3 investigation methods new to the basin as detailed above the two main weaknesses of previous studies in the london basin chalk were concerned with age ambiguities and the lack of a sensitive indicator showing the degree of penetration of modern water into the confined aquifer clearly for a study of palaeoarchive potential these uncertainties have to be addressed so two additional methods have been applied 2 3 1 cfcs the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are members of the halocarbon family of non toxic compounds traces of which are found in the atmosphere owing to release during industrial processes and refrigerant leakage commencing in the 1930s the two main compounds are cfc 11 ccl3f and cfc 12 ccl2f2 they have accumulated in the atmosphere at a known rate and although now in decline due to a worldwide ban resulting from their ozone depleting properties they remain capable under the right conditions of giving quantitative groundwater age information in the range 0 70 years plummer and busenberg 2000 this relies on equilibration between the atmosphere and infiltrating rainfall being locked in to groundwater at the time of recharge to the aquifer under less favourable conditions leakage to the aquifer from e g refrigeration plants or degreasing operations they still provide indications of the presence of modern 70 yr old groundwater even if the amount may not be quantifiable darling et al 2012 cfcs are routinely used for many types of groundwater investigation chambers et al 2019 their use in the present study primarily focuses on their property of being detectable down to ultra trace concentrations bullister and weiss 1988 2 3 2 14c doc radiocarbon is frequently used in groundwater investigations see a general outline in section s1 of the supplement to this paper but conventionally has been carried out on the dic component of the water e g tamers 1975 the initial goal of 14c doc dating is to isolate and measure the fa fulvic acid or high molecular weight fraction considered to derive from soil organic matter murphy et al 1989 rather than the ha humic acid or low molecular weight fraction that could be derived from various sources including refractory 14c dead carbon present in the aquifer matrix however this would be less significant in the lgs and chalk both of which contain generally very low amounts of solid phase organic carbon pacey 1989 macleod 1998 more recent studies have been carried out by other methods of extraction and doc oxidation that did not differentiate or exclude certain pools of doc heine and einsiedl 2021 the radiocarbon activity of doc was first investigated as a potential water dating agent more than three decades ago in the milk river aquifer of western canada murphy et al 1989 wassenaar et al 1991 the principal advantage of 14c doc over dic dating was considered to be the lack of significant dilution of doc by inputs of dead carbon from the aquifer matrix and the results largely supported this with seven of the eight sites yielding a higher 14c activity for doc than dic the early promise of 14c doc for groundwater dating based on the milk river research led to attempts to apply the technique elsewhere in old groundwaters though usually reporting only a handful of analyses for individual aquifers purdy et al 1992 published four pairs of analyses from the aquia and magothy aquifers in the atlantic coastal plain of maryland usa showing again that doc was greater than dic activity for most sample pairs geyer et al 1993 presented results from 18 sites distributed over three different aquifer types across germany in all but one case doc exceeded dic activity thus in line with the previous studies it had been assumed in previous studies that 14c doc ages could simply be calculated in terms of the 14c decay curve with a 100 pmc initial activity ia but geyer et al 1993 proposed that an ia value in the range 75 95 might be more appropriate to reflect mixing of young and older doc in the recharge zone montjotin et al 1998 studied seven sites in the mol confined sand aquifer in belgium where they too found doc dic activities additionally they measured a few unconfined chalk sites in the paris basin but 14c activities were high 70 90 pmc for both dic and doc so of limited relevance to the present study however they also investigated the ia of doc in the soil zone of a sand aquifer in the loire valley and concluded that this could vary between 75 and 100 pmc since the 1990s however rather few studies have been published the main challenge appearing anecdotally to be the reliable extraction of sufficient carbon from the very low doc concentrations typically found in groundwaters nevertheless recently godfrey et al 2021 used 14c doc as a way of circumventing the challenge of 14c dic groundwater dating in an active volcanic region of chile 13 sites while thomas et al 2021 reported 14c doc results from 26 sites in nevada usa derived from volcanic and carbonate aquifers as with previous studies both found that for individual sites doc almost always exceeded dic activity and therefore gave younger ages even after allowing for dic age correction godfrey et al 2021 used varying values of ia based on site specific assessments of the amount of mixing between doc reservoirs but thomas et al 2021 concluded that no ia correction for calculating 14c doc ages was necessary in their aquifer system however few of the samples in either study gave low 14c doc activities and there remained a need for more data particularly below the 20 pmc level the study of heine and einsiedl 2021 in a carbonate aquifer contributed a few sub 20 pmc values reaching a 14c doc minimum of 5 7 pmc they decided to use a blanket ia value of 85 to calculate their 14c doc ages which were significantly younger than corrected dic ages in line with all the other studies considered above 3 site locations sampling and analysis 3 1 site locations lgs sites 1 10 divide into two groups those in the shallow partially confined hythe formation on the southern edge of the basin 1 5 and those in the stratigraphically overlying but deep and fully confined folkestone formation 6 10 this is illustrated in fig 2 while the geographic locations are shown in fig 3 and site data reported in table 1 chalk sites a y can also be divided into two basic groupings the western basin in berkshire a f and the central basin beneath greater london g x three sites are wholly unconfined a g x the remaining site y is in the far east of the confined basin fig 3 site data are given in table 1 all sampled boreholes abstract from formations in the white chalk subgroup middle and upper chalk in older literature except for the three unconfined sites which include some grey chalk formerly lower chalk strata and a few other confined sites d f and y where boreholes may barely penetrate the upper chalk but are screened in the immediately overlying thin sands and gravels at the base of the palaeogene beneath the london clay relying on hydraulic continuity with the chalk to yield sufficient water 3 2 sampling all samples

conductivity sec and dissolved oxygen do had stabilised values are reported in table1 samples for chemistry δ18o δ2h and δ13c dic were collected in hdpe bottles samples for 14c dic were collected in 1 litre glass bottles while those for 14c doc were either collected in 50 litre polyethylene drums or more recently in 2 5 l amber glass bottles with polycone tops cfc samples were collected under water according to the method described in iaea 2006 while noble gas samples were taken in clamped 10 mm o d copper tubes to check the δ13c values of soil co2 necessary for14c dic age correction some soil gas sample pairs were collected in pre evacuated glass bulbs from the outcrops of the chalk and lgs using a hollow spike sampler 3 3 processing samples for 14c doc measurement samples taken in 1997 98 were prepared by extraction of the hmw compounds humic and fulvic acids from approximately 50 l of groundwater by adsorption onto a deae cellulose resin the hmw compounds were eluted from the resin using 0 5 m naoh the eluant was acidified to ph 1 with hcl to precipitate the humic acid ha fraction while the fulvic acid fa fraction remained in the eluant analysis of the fulvic acid fraction was carried out by ams at nerc rcf at east kilbride scotland here samples were decanted leaving approximately 5 ml of fa rich solution in the sample bottles no obvious ha precipitate was observed measured supernatant sample volumes were rotary evaporated in acid washed sample rinsed glassware until a few ml of solution remained this solution was quantitatively transferred to pre weighed acid washed glass beakers and dried in a freeze dryer known weights of dried solids were converted to co2 either by combustion using an elemental analyser samples from sites a l q and r or under vacuum in sealed quartz tubes in the presence of cuo and ag wire sites b c d e and f for samples taken in 2013 14 four 2 5 l glass bottles were collected per site initially aliquots of 2 5 8 0 l of whole sample water were subjected to rotary evaporation and prepared to dried solids as described above inorganic carbon was removed from the dried solids by fumigation with concentrated hcl in an evacuated 0 1 bar desiccator at 62 c known weights of dried solids were converted to co2 using an elemental analyser later after difficulties with obtaining sufficient carbon for analysis from some sites seven available reserve water samples were submitted to the research and development department at beta analytic miami usa here aliquots of up to 1 l of incrementally filtered sample water were subject to uv oxidation uvox in the presence of oxygen gas and the resulting co2 was collected for 14c and δ13c analysis further details of the uvox method as performed at beta analytic are provided in section s2 of the supplement the co2 from all three preparation methods was cryogenically purified prior to conversion to graphite using fe zn reduction 3 4 analysis inorganic hydrochemistry was determined by the centre for environmental geochemistry at the british geological survey bgs in keyworth using icp mass spectrometry and ion chromatography cfcs and noble gases were measured at bgs wallingford by gas chromatography and quadrupole mass spectrometry respectively o and h stable isotope ratios were determined by dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms at the stable isotope facility at bgs keyworth while most samples for 14c dic and doc were analysed by ams accelerator mass spectrometry at nerc rcf in east kilbride although a subset was measured for 14c doc via the research and development laboratory of beta analytic in miami florida using ams during the ams sample preparation separate aliquots of co2 were taken and measured for δ13c by dual inlet irms where sample size allowed cfc detection limits were 0 01 and 0 03 pmol l for cfc 11 and cfc 12 respectively average measurement precisions for noble gases were 3 5 he 1 5 ne 2 0 ar 2 2 kr and 5 4 xe typical stable

this paper is on isotopic and trace gas indicators inorganic hydrochemistry is reported and briefly interpreted in section s3 of the supplement 4 2 dissolved gases cfc data table 2 are cross plotted at different scales in fig 4 a and 4b the first plot shows those results from 75 of the sites in the context of the atmospheric input curve usgs 2021 here converted to dissolved concentration and therefore equivalent to a piston plug flow model fig 4a although london is a megacity darling and gooddy 2007 found no evidence for any local atmospheric enhancement effect preserved in soil gases unlike for example the study of ho et al 1998 in the new york area all except one of the lgs sites have low or undetectable concentrations partly obscuring a few chalk sites on the plot namely e berkshire v south london and y eastern essex apart from these low concentration sites one sample t falls on the binary mixing line between modern and old groundwater otherwise all remaining low chalk sites show evidence of modest cfc enhancement usually in cfc 11 which is more soluble in water than cfc 12 the effect is seen across urban and rural areas alike remaining sites show some very high concentrations of both cfcs though with cfc 12 reaching the most elevated values at sites i j and s fig 4b the sole lgs site to show major cfc enhancement site 1 is the only wholly unconfined site measured in the lgs aquifer the high chalk sites are mostly at or near the edge of confinement by palaeogene cover however despite the existence of some high cfc concentrations these are only relative

table 3 generally adhere closely to craig s 1961 global meteoric water line fig 5 a the lgs data have the greatest range partly due to the geographical spread of sites but also to palaeoclimatic factors considered further in the discussion the chalk data are more scattered especially site k which would conventionally be interpreted as providing evidence of evaporative modification this and other aspects are considered further in the discussion in terms of dic isotopes table 3 lgs waters show rather little change in δ13c but reach a maximum 14c activity of 80 pmc fig 5 b chalk samples however show a generally good correlation between 14c and δ13c attributable to water rock interaction and commonly observed by other studies smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 elliot et al 1999 for the same reason maximum 14c activities are no higher than 60 pmc the implications for residence time calculation are considered further in the discussion below in contrast chalk maximum doc activities reach 94 pmc table 3 fig 5c presumably because of the lack of significant water rock interaction some 75 of the data lie within the δ13c range of 23 to 30 typical of temperate zone soil organic carbon smith and chalk 2021 in this study the evaporation method for concentrating doc tended on occasion to produce more negative δ13c doc values but mainly for the chalk rather than the lgs this was probably due to the higher dic concentration in chalk samples requiring longer hcl fumigation times to remove all contaminant dic from the dried solids after rotary evaporation which may have oxidised and fractionated the fa fraction however this was not a problem with the uvox preparation method at least in those samples yielding sufficient co2 gas for both 14c and δ13c determination soil δ13c co2 values averaged 26 1 and 24 9 for the chalk and lgs respectively table s4 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of recharge to the aquifers one premise of this study is that inputs of stable o and h isotopes from rainfall vary in a predictable way across the basin as inferred from the uk groundwater isotope map of darling et al 2003 but further developed for the lgs by darling and lewis 2021 who considered that inputs from the northern and southern lgs outcrops consistently differ by 0 5 in δ18o see their fig 2 superimposed on any areal differences is a further displacement due to palaeoclimatic shifts in δ18o and δ2h operating beyond the holocene pleistocene boundary some 12 kyr ago thus lgs sites with 14c activities of 20 pmc have more negative stable isotope values the aldershot sites 6 7 and 8 on the southern limb of the lgs syncline and the slough sites 9 and 10 in the ns geographical centre of the basin the reason for the negative displacement between the aldershot and slough samples is thought to be due to slough lying at or near the termination of a flowline deriving from the northern limb of the syncline darling and lewis 2021 a similar age depletion effect operates to an extent in the chalk for example lowest 14c activities are associated with samples more negative than the 30 year 1990 2019 weighted mean of 7 3 δ18o and 49 δ2h for rainfall observed at the wallingford gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation station 70 km west of central london however there is no discernible north south divide in the data partly because the chalk outcrop in the basin is more extensive but also more constricted from n to s than that of the lgs nonetheless the scatter in the chalk δ18o and δ2h values is inherently greater than for the lgs while recharge mechanisms to the two aquifers are different predictable piston flow infiltration to the lgs less predictable mixing and matrix fracture exchange in the chalk unsaturated zone any intra aquifer differences would presumably be smoothed out in confinement instead the scatter must reflect the almost infinite possibilities for mixing in the chalk aquifer between waters of different ages conceivably further influenced by the effects of differing pumping rates as previously proposed for dissolved ch4 by darling and gooddy 2006 could different lgs and chalk infiltration mechanisms lead to inter aquifer selection in groundwater isotope composition to the extent that peak palaeowater isotope depletions might differ between the aquifers it was shown by darling et al 2003 that there was no bias within measurement error between weighted mean isotope values in rainfall and local chalk groundwaters around the wallingford gnip station but for the lgs there are no similar data notwithstanding this comparisons between chalk and lgs groundwaters from the same area can be attempted there are rather few suitable chalk lgs pairs here taken as being within 10 km known stable isotope values unconfined and or of known holocene age but details of available pairs around the perimeter of the london basin are provided in section s4 of the supplement while there are signs of geographical variation as expected there is no evidence of systematic difference between lgs and chalk stable isotope values for individual pairs so it is therefore concluded that no significant holocene selection bias exists and by implication also in the late devensian 5 2 anthropogenic inputs 5 2 1 modern tracers early studies of both the chalk and the lgs reported tritium 3h data as the only contemporaneously available technique for identifying the presence of modern recharge i e since the aerial thermonuclear testing of the mid 1960s in both aquifers detectable 3h activities were found in the unconfined sections as expected but also in some apparently old confined chalk groundwaters smith et al 1976 and in the part confined hythe formation beneath the southern lgs outcrop though the deeper folkestone formation remained tritium free within measurement error mather et al 1973 in the present study measurement of 3h currently only present in rainfall at activities of a few tu tritium units was replaced by cfcs as a by now much more sensitive indicator of the presence of modern recharge fig 4 shows just how pervasive cfc enhancement is in the chalk aquifer for nearly all sites confined or not cfcs cannot be used for reliable age estimation instead their value lies in showing just how far anthropogenic contamination may have penetrated the aquifer by contrast while three lgs sites provided some evidence of enhancement especially the unconfined site 1 fig 4b some of the others had values below detection particularly from the deep 500 m bgl sites around aldershot sites 6 7 and 8 fig 4a implying that these waters are unaffected by any mixing with modern water 5 2 2 induced binary mixing in the chalk aquifer beyond the general conclusion based on a variety of tracers that most chalk groundwater has to a certain extent been heterogenised by processes promoted by its extensive fracture porosity it is clear in a few cases that simple binary mixing is occurring the plot of 14c dic vs δ13c dic fig 5b picks out particularly sites k s and t as falling on a mixing trend between young and old water these sites plus i and u also have the most positive δ18o values fig 5a suggesting all have an input of surface water at site t situated a few hundred metres from the river thames on reclaimed marshland this is clearly a possibility while site k lies a similar distance from flooded gravel pits and the grand union canal site s lies at the southern end of the new river a large aqueduct supplying london with water since the seventeenth century which ended in filter ponds adjacent to the site while the aqueduct now terminates a few kilometres to the north the observed isotope effects may be a legacy of this former activity sites h and w also show evidence for mixing fig 5b but this is more likely due to their positions near the edge of confinement where they may receive a certain amount of concentrated surface runoff from the clays of the overlying palaeogene probably explaining their high cfc excesses as also noted earlier for sites i and j fig 4b 5 3 old groundwater 5 3 1 dic and doc stable isotopes the dic system all δ13c dic values appear consistent with an ultimate derivation from the reaction between soil or rock carbonate minerals and the weak carbonic acid produced by the solution of soil co2 by infiltrating rainwater in other words there is no evidence for anthropogenic 13c inputs affecting any of the sites soil co2 in temperate climates is commonly assigned a δ13c value of 25 e g fontes and garnier 1979 limited soil gas sampling table s4 gave results of 26 chalk and 25 lgs so these values are retained for 14c dic age correction the δ13c of soil and rock carbonate δ13c carb is less well constrained there are almost no data on the δ13c carb values of the carbonate cement of the lgs matrix evans et al 1979 found some highly variable values in core from the warlingham stratigraphic borehole a few kilometres southeast of site x but concluded that the carbonate in the aquifer is predominantly of marine origin with a δ13c close to zero smith et al 1976 assumed a chalk δ13c carb value of 2 35 close to the bulk value of 2 5 since attributed to the white chalk in southern england on the basis of numerous cliff and borehole core profiles collated by jarvis et al 2006 although it was hypothesised by smith et al 1976 that the reactive surfaces of individual chalk coccoliths are slowly becoming less positive in δ13c owing to prolonged exchange with dic there is no clear evidence that this has occurred on a significant scale data from smith et al 1976 dennis et al 1997 and the present study all show chalk δ13c dic values peaking in the range 0 5 to 0 which would be consistent with a water reaching equilibrium with a chalk matrix having a value of 2 5 δ13c kloppmann et al 1998 the evolutionary path of dic in each aquifer will tend to diverge after the initial carbonate dissolution the 1 1 reaction between soil co2 of δ13c 25 and calcite 0 leads initially to δ13c dic values of around 13 fontes and garnier 1979 open system conditions provide the potential for further re equilibration with soil co2 thus decreasing δ13c dic values for chalk groundwaters this is limited by the large excess of carbonate available so it is unusual to see values 15 in the poorly buffered lgs values down to 20 are known e g darling and gooddy 2006 but more normally lie in the range 12 to 16 closed system conditions which tend to occur under confinement allow further interaction between the dic and the rock leading to the point where δ13c dic values in the chalk can approach those of the rock matrix see previous paragraph this is considered to be very largely due to dissolution reprecipitation processes rather than isotopic re equilibration which is an extremely slow process evans et al 1979 in the lgs however the process is much more limited owing to the relative scarcity of carbonate in the rock the doc system this should in theory be much less variable than the dic values of δ13c doc measured on the fa fraction of soil zone water were not measured during this project but are assumed to have values 25 based on other studies from the uk e g mctiernan et al 1999 palmer et al 2001 owing to a lack of fractionation during solution both the lgs and the chalk have very low matrix organic contents 0 2 by weight in the hythe formation macleod 1998 and 0 1 for the white chalk pacey 1989 most of which is assumed to be highly refractory and therefore unlikely to influence the doc in terms of its isotopic composition 5 3 2 dic and doc groundwater ages calculated 14c ages are reported in table 4 the dic ages are corrected by the evans et al 1979 model first developed for the lgs while the fontes and garnier 1979 model was considered for the chalk erratic performance at higher δ13c dic values edmunds et al 1987 ruled it out for this study lgs ages have here been modelled with two different δ13c carb values because of some uncertainty over the appropriate value to use see earlier though at an average difference of 2 kyr the effect is only small for a 5 difference in δ13c carb doc ages are calculated with two different ia values the traditional 100 pmc and the 85pmc value used by heine and einsiedl 2021 for their jurassic carbonate aquifer table 4 shows that when an 85 pmc value is used ages at the unconfined sites a g and 1 are 1 3 kyr closer to modern so this is the preferred ia for the present study ages calculating in excess of the effective 30 kyr limit for dic dating are reported as 30 kyr the limit for doc dates should in theory be higher perhaps 35 kyr because of the reduction in dead carbon inputs but none of the doc ages reported here exceeds 25 kyr in the lgs aquifer doc ages tend initially to exceed dic ages but cross over at about 15 kyr until the 30 kyr dic dating barrier is reached at which point the maximum doc age is 25 kyr fig 6 this could represent the age limit for fresh water in the lgs of the london basin although there are indications that older saline waters exist 5 4 below the chalk plot shows much more scatter as already demonstrated for example by δ18o and δ2h fig 5a though with most samples falling on or below the 1 1 line while a dic doc age calibration curve can be attempted for the lgs fig 6 clearly this would not be meaningful for the chalk instead it may be more useful to compare chalk dic and doc ages in relation to the basin geology fig 7 a c the dic ages 7a show reasonably well that residence times increase at depth under central london as expected but have an unlikely distribution along the berkshire section doc ages however compare well with the geology in both berkshire and greater london 7b some of the variation could be due to the differing borehole depths 7c boreholes are normally left unlined in the chalk potentially allowing mixing from multiple horizons in the deeper boreholes for both dic and doc the apparent ages of mixed samples are reduced by modern water influx 5 2 2 otherwise virtually all doc ages are younger than 15 kyr while dic ages range up to 30 kyr a tentative age profile curve has been added to the doc ages fig 7b its shape partly reflects the asymmetric nature of the basin but also suggests that representative 14c doc ages can be obtained using any of the three preparation methods used during the study 5 3 3 recharge temperatures ngts from the lgs cover the range 10 3 2 6 c table 2 and despite the small number of samples it is clear that this dataset is highly bimodal reflecting the hydrochemistry as depicted in fig s2 apart from an outlier at 10 5 cm3stp kg site 10 ea values average 4 0cm3stp kg similar to results from other lower cretaceous confined sandstones in norfolk eastern england ingram et al 2007 chalk ngt values range from 13 1 down to 4 1 c table 2 with a fairly even spread across the range the highest ngt of 13 1 c is from k a site already identified as showing mixing with surface water 5 2 2 so this is likely to have perturbed the noble gas ratios also otherwise since the mean annual air temperature maat in southern england is 10 c maximum ngts of around this value would be expected of the four sites with ngts 10 c all are unconfined or near the edge of confinement g h i and x conversely the four sites yielding the lowest ngts 4 5 c are all sites at least 20 km into confinement o p q y ea values average 3 1 cm3stp kg sd 2 1 while this is approximately twice the mean value from the unconfined chalk in west berkshire darling et al 2017 there is little evidence to associate higher ea with cooler ngt values so with the exception of temperature recharge conditions seem likely to have remained similar with no evidence for a marked increase in rainfall intensity such as inferred by zhu and kipfer 2010 5 3 4 helium 4 accumulation accumulation of 4he in older groundwaters is commonly observed e g solomon 2000 in addition to in aquifer production from radioactive decay of u th series minerals 4he may be supplemented by a flux from deeper strata and therefore he accumulation rates are aquifer specific rather than carrying absolute age implications nevertheless in a given aquifer unit an inverse relationship between 4heexc and 14c activity would be expected for waters not exceeding radiocarbon age and fig 8 confirms this to be the case for the london basin there is a relationship rather better for 14c doc than dic especially in the chalk where there is a large scatter below the 1pmc level by contrast the lgs data are much more constrained with a major difference between the sites in the hythe and folkestone units this may be due to easier escape of 4he from the semi confined hythe compared to the fully confined folkestone 5 4 preservation of the palaeorecharge signal the deep confined sites of the lgs would be inherently more likely to retain a record of late devensian recharge than the heavily fractured chalk the comparative thinness of the folkestone aquifer unit fig 1 would also favour the preservation of piston flow rather than the mixing that often characterises the chalk 4 2 5 2 2 however the question arises as to what extent intensive abstraction from the chalk may have perturbed any natural palaeowater preservation while it is certain that chalk groundwater flow lines beneath central london have been modified by pumping wrb 1972 the extent is difficult to assess since isotopic methods have only been available in recent decades the scarce time lapse radiocarbon evidence outlined in 2 2 2 above did not usually show significant change but the time gaps would only have been 20 years the present paper reports two sites j and u also sampled by elliot et al 1999 again about 20 years previously in both cases the new ams measured 14c dic activity was slightly lower than the older decay counted value so perhaps a technique based phenomenon rather than a real change an effective way of testing the two aquifers as palaeoclimate archives is to plot the model ages from table 4 in relation to δ temperature values derived from ngt values in table 2 and assuming a late holocene maat of 10 c fig 9 also shown on the figure is the global surface temperature change curve covering the past 24 kyr osman et al 2021 a period including the last glacial maximum lgm at 15 20kyr although the curve is based on 14c results calibrated to calendar years while the water ages are uncalibrated the plot is sufficient to show that doc ages are more in agreement with it than the dic ages some of which appear too old for their temperatures in the lgs doc ages divide between the hythe holocene and folkestone late devensian units the doc ages for the chalk by comparison tend to plot below the curve in its post lgm section suggesting mixing between modern and late pleistocene waters however doc ages are not wholly without issues the main example of this is at the unconfined chalk site x where the doc age is 7 6kyr but dic gives a much more likely modern age see also fig 7 the ngt difference of 7 c shown by the lgs samples coincides with the temperature curve of osman et al 2021 implying that late pleistocene recharge is well preserved at depth a similar difference in ngt values between holocene and pleistocene recharge was found for the triassic sandstone aquifer in the east midlands of england also considered to preserve palaeowater effectively bath et al 1979 despite the lgs possessing apparently good palaeoarchive properties a question remaining about the aquifer is the age of the residual saline water known to lie in the axial zone from historic borehole evidence egerton 1994 but which is otherwise unexploited or tested in modern times it was proposed by darling and lewis 2021 that hydrochemical data from the slough area reveal evidence of mixing with this brackish water a plot of 4heexc vs cl for four sites in the area including sites 9 and 10 shows a well correlated mixing trend fig 10 given the equally good correlation between 14c doc and 4he in fig 8 extrapolation on a doc age vs cl plot suggests that water close to the centre of the saline zone at 375 mg l cl legacy value for winkfield lodge prestwich 1895 could have an age of 50kyr inset to fig 10 5 5 the wider basin east of london the london basin continues to broaden until around the thames estuary the confining palaeogene cover is 90 km wide from north to south fig 1 while the lgs is largely absent the chalk remains present across the basin to test the theory that older less mixed chalk groundwater might still be preserved at depth in the eastern axial zone of the basin fig 1 a borehole site y fig 3 was sampled on the dengie peninsula of coastal essex the area most remote from the chalk outcrop however as tables 2 and 3 show values of δ18o δ2h and δ13c dic were all comparable to waters from other deep confined chalk sites while the presence of cfcs albeit at very low concentrations was another similarity although at 586 10 8 ccstp g the concentration of 4he was the highest chalk value found during this study slightly higher values were reported for some berkshire sites by elliot et al 1999 these results from dengie therefore strongly suggest that the degradation of the palaeoclimatic signal identified in the aquifer beneath london extends throughout the confined chalk of the whole onshore london basin 6 conclusions earlier studies of the age of groundwater in the principal aquifers of the london basin chalk and lower greensand established that both still contained evidence of recharge in late devensian last ice age times but left much doubt over the maximum ages and therefore degree of preservation of these remnants the present study has provided more robust and reliable water age characterisation with the aid of techniques new to the basin specifically chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and the radiocarbon activity of dissolved organic carbon 14c doc measuring the latter presented some technical challenges at the low doc concentrations encountered but comparable results using three different extraction methods appear to validate the doc dating approach most significantly all 14c doc activities have been above the limit of detection whereas the corresponding 14c dic activities have sometimes been below this level rendering it only possible to assign a model age of 30 kyr to these waters minimum 14c doc activities found for the chalk and lgs were 10 6 and 5 0 pmc respectively providing a degree of headroom above the detection limit and consequently usually resulting in younger ages than the corresponding 14c dic values a phenomenon commonly observed in similar studies on this basis the oldest chalk groundwater identified was 17kyr and the oldest lgs water 23 kyr a similar level of discrepancy was shown by climate related stable isotope depletions the lgs reaching a minimum of 8 2 δ18o compared to 7 8 for the chalk and noble gas derived recharge temperatures giving minima of 2 6 c lgs and 4 1 c chalk despite the exact meaning of groundwater age being debatable it seems likely that the lgs substantially preserves its ice age recharge endowment at depth but that this has disappeared from the chalk leaving evidence of its previous existence inferable only from mixing relationships the susceptibility of the chalk to mixing has been well demonstrated by this study particularly by the detection of cfcs throughout the confined aquifer even at 40 km from outcrop although some of this may have been promoted by large scale pumping from the aquifer the chalk s highly fractured nature would probably have led to much the same outcome even under natural flow gradients while there must now be little expectation of finding relict devensian recharge anywhere in the chalk of the london basin the lgs has been shown to have good potential as a palaeoarchive in particular future research could help to unravel the relationship between the deep fresh water boreholes and the brackish water along the basin axis which may preserve evidence of earlier devensian recharge under a warmer climate more broadly the results from this study when compared to lgm cooling effects preserved in other archive aquifers are similar to those included in the arppe and karhu 2010 survey of δ18o depletion in european groundwaters and the seltzer et al 2021 survey of low to medium latitude noble gas temperatures worldwide this provides additional evidence that the lgs aquifer performs

2437,groundwater contamination is an exacerbating global issue that severely threatens human health subsurface remediation thus has gained increased interest in recent years to effectively remediate subsurface contaminated sites one needs to identify the locations of contaminant sources and characterize contaminant spreading groundwater contamination is often driven by multiple contaminant sources making source identification problems challenging further when the densities of dissolved contaminants and ambient groundwater differ the resultant variable density flows add complexity to the task of source identification however most previous studies are limited to a single source identification in a two dimensional aquifer this study presents a novel inversion method based on ensemble smoothing that identifies the locations of multiple contaminant sources in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems a new covariance localization algorithm based on a clustering method is integrated into the inversion method which improves the accuracy of multi source identification using the proposed inversion framework we successfully estimate the locations of multiple contaminant sources and three dimensional permeability fields utilizing pressure and concentration data from monitoring wells further we investigate and elucidate the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and variable density flows on multiple source identification we find that variable density flow increases the data information contents and thus improves the inversion accuracy this is the first time demonstration of the effects of variable density flow on the inversion accuracy of multi source identification in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems keywords inverse estimation multiple contaminant sources 3d heterogeneous aquifer ensemble smoothing variable density flows data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has been aggravating globally severely threatening human health li et al 2016 subba rao et al 2019 abiriga et al 2020 predicting groundwater flow and contaminant transport is critical for assessing the risks associated with aquifer contamination and designing optimal remediation strategies numerical groundwater models have been an essential tool to predict flow and transport under various scenarios of contaminant sources and aquifer heterogeneity a key challenge in applying groundwater flow and contaminant transport models is that we need an accurate estimation of hydrogeologic parameters e g heterogeneous permeability distribution and the forcing parameters e g locations of contaminant sources the accuracy of the parameters determines the model predictability however the direct measurement of the parameters based on boring and coring is often too costly for practical purposes advances in inverse modeling have made it possible to efficiently estimate various aquifer characteristics such as aquifer permeability and contaminant sources from different data types at multi spatiotemporal scales gorelick et al 1983 wagner 1992 atmadja bagtzoglou 2001 mahinthakumar sayeed 2005 datta et al 2009 dafflon et al 2011 jeong park 2019 zhang et al 2020 we refer readers to gómez hernández xu 2022 for a thorough review of the advances in inverse modeling for contaminated aquifer characterization and contaminant source identification a well proven inversion method is the ensemble kalman based data assimilation the method is a monte carlo implementation of the well known kalman formula which is derived from the bayesian framework assuming prior and likelihood functions as gaussian evensen 1994 2003 2009 the method has been actively used for characterizing groundwater systems including hydraulic conductivity fields zhou et al 2011 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 xia et al 2018 and recently contaminant sources zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 recent inversion studies on contaminant source identification showed promising results zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2021 li et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however most studies consider a single contaminant source in a two dimensional aquifer system such simplifications are useful for proof of concept and methodological development but natural aquifer systems are three dimensional and multiple contaminant sources are prevalent only recently have source identification studies considered three dimensional groundwater systems but with a single source jha datta 2013 ayaz 2022 inverse modeling studies with multiple sources are currently limited to a two dimensional setup moghaddam et al 2021 wang zhang 2021 zhao et al 2021 variable density flow is another important but often overlooked feature in characterizing contaminated aquifers when the densities of the contaminant plume and the ambient groundwater differ variable density flows occur for example the total dissolved solids concentration of leachate from sanitary landfills has been estimated to range from 5 000 to 40 000 mg l freeze cherry 1979 meaning approximately 0 35 2 8 density difference between the contaminant solute and the groundwater simmons et al 2001 recent studies demonstrated that variable density flow impacts the information contents of pressure and concentration data for aquifer characterization kang et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 although a few recent studies conducted contaminant source characterizations in aquifers where variable density flow exists dodangeh et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and rajabi 2022 no study has investigated how the degree of variable density flow affects the inverse estimation of contaminant sources this study presents a novel inversion method that jointly estimates multiple contaminant sources and heterogeneous permeability fields in three dimensional aquifers where variable density flow occurs we propose an advanced ensemble smoother es suitable for multi source identification the proposed es is based on a new covariance localization algorithm that is tailored to multiple source identification problems covariance localization is a kalman formula variant developed two decades ago hamill et al 2001 houtekamer mitchell 2001 and has been widely used in ensemble kalman based data assimilation to circumvent invalid correlation between state variables and observation data however the procedure for applying covariance localization to multiple source identification problems has not been established this study for the first time demonstrates the ability of es with covariance localization for estimating multiple contaminant sources in 3d heterogeneous aquifers further we elucidate how variable density flow influences data information contents and the inverse estimation of contaminant sources the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the numerical modeling framework for variable density flows in 3d heterogeneous aquifers and the proposed ensemble smoother algorithm section 3 shows the performance of the ensemble smoother algorithm and also elucidates the effects of variable density flow on data informativeness and inversion accuracy finally we provide a summary and conclusions in section 4 2 methods 2 1 simulation of variable density flow and contaminant transport we consider a variable density groundwater flow system where the concentration of dissolved contaminants determines the fluid density under the assumptions of incompressible fluids and the boussinesq approximation the governing equations for the variable density groundwater flow and contaminant transport consist of the continuity equation darcy s law and the advection dispersion equation riaz et al 2006 landman and schotting 2007 hidalgo and carrera 2009 elenius et al 2012 hidalgo et al 2012 szulczewski and juanes 2013 kang et al 2017 1a u 0 1b u k μ p ρ c g z 1c ϕ c t u c ϕ

brine of ρ c 700 kg m 3 voss souza 1987 related physical constants and other settings are given in table 1 we consider a three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer with three contaminant sources the contaminant sources release dissolved contaminants into surrounding groundwater at a constant concentration we impose constant head boundaries on the inlet and outlet planes to induce background

a cubic element with dimensions of δ x δ y δ z 1 m we solve for the pressure field using a finite volume method with a two point flux approximation then solve for the concentration field using a finite volume method with an upwind scheme yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 we then integrate in time using an explicit forward euler scheme leveque 2002 we consider three different variable density flow regimes which are quantified by the relative strength of density driven flow compared to ambient groundwater flow ward et al 2007 we estimate the strength of ambient groundwater flow with the characteristic velocity v g w k μ ϕ δ p l x where k is the mean permeability δ p is the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet boundaries distant by the aquifer length l x the strength of density driven flow is estimated with the characteristic velocity v δ ρ k δ ρ g b μ ϕ the ratio of the two characteristic velocities is known as the mixed convection ratio m v δ ρ v g w δ ρ g b l x δ p ward et al 2007 we consider three different values of δ p to induce three different mixed convection ratios of m 0 1 1 10 when m 1 free and forced convection are balanced and the two characteristic velocities are approximately equal fig 3 shows the multiple snapshots of contaminant transport simulated in the aquifer shown in fig 1 a for the three values of m as m increases the density driven flow becomes dominant over the ambient groundwater flow and a strong downward groundwater flow emerges e g see the right most column of fig 3 in the following sections we investigate how the variable density flow influences the informativeness of observation data collected from the monitoring wells and inversion accuracy 2 2 localized ensemble smoother for multi source identification we use ensemble smoothing to estimate three contaminant source locations and three dimensional permeability fields thus we set the unknown parameter vector m to include three source locations s x 1 x 2 x 3 where x i x i y i z i for i 1 2 3 and log permeability field ln k such that m s ln k note that the ensemble smoothing framework can be easily extended to incorporate additional parameters such as the temporal variation of source intensity and different numbers of contaminant sources the uncertainty of the model parameter m is modeled by an ensemble of the parameter realizations m 1 f m n e f where n e is the ensemble size the ensemble of the three source locations is generated from the uniform distribution in the ranges of 2 x s 14 7 y s 19 and 2 z s 23 and the permeability fields are generated using the spatial correlation structure of the spherical variogram described in table 1 related geostatistical features are given in table 1 the flow and transport model is assumed as an error free model y f m implying that the accuracy of the model predictions is determined only by the uncertainty in the model parameter m the prediction vector includes the predicted state values of pressure and concentration at the monitoring location as y p f c f to honor the measurement noise in observations y o b s a multivariate gaussian error ε with zero mean and covariance r see table 1 is added to the predicted values as y f y ε we update the parameter vectors using the following kalman formula with covariance localization 3 m i u m i f τ m y c m y τ y y c y y r 1 y o b s y i f here c m y e m f e m f y f e y f t is the cross covariance matrix between the model parameter m and the model prediction y f and c y y e y f e y f y f e y f t is the auto covariance matrix of the model prediction the notation is the schur product element wise matrix multiplication and τ is the weighting function for covariance localization even if the corresponding state components are physically far apart the corresponding correlation values in the covariance matrices c m y and c y y can be unphysically high to prevent the effects of unphysical correlation the covariance matrices are often adjusted by a weighting function τ this procedure is known as covariance localization and we use the well proved fifth order formulae proposed by gaspari and cohn 1999 defined as 4 τ ij d 1 4 d r 5 1 2 d r 4 5 8 d r 3 5 3 d r 2 1 0 d r 1 12 d r 5 1 2 d r 4 5 8 d r 3 5 3 d r 2 5 d r 4 2 3 d r 1 r d 2 r 0 2 r d where τ ij is the i th row and j th column element of τ and d is the distance between the two states corresponding to τ ij although covariance localization is a well proven technique for improving kalman based data assimilation applying it to the multiple source identification problem is not straightforward when computing τ m y in equation 3 we need to quantify the distance d between the observation locations and contaminant sources equation 4 however the distance is not easy to define because the source locations are unknown variables to be estimated and each ensemble member has different source locations a simple solution to determine the source locations when estimating d is taking the ensemble average of the source locations as e s however the simple ensemble average is not an effective way to estimate d for example consider two ensemble vectors of source location parameters s 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 3 and s 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 3 as shown in fig 4 a even if the sources form three groups of clusters simply taking the ensemble average s s 1 s 2 2 cannot honor the clustering pattern as shown in fig 4 b which may lead to an inaccurate estimation of d to honor the clustering status one needs to re order the source elements such that the distance between each ensemble member and the ensemble average s 1 s s 2 s is minimized where the s s denotes euclidean distance l 2 norm between s and s by properly re ordering the source location elements in the ensemble vectors fig 4 c one can estimate ensemble average estimates that honor the clustering status fig 4 d the re ordering will enable us to estimate d in equation 4 which better represents each ensemble vector s source locations based on the above discussion we propose a two step algorithm as formulated in table 2 for determining the source locations when estimating the distance d in equation 4 we first cluster the initially generated source locations into multiple groups as many as the number of sources three using the k means clustering method and estimate the centroids of the three groups c c 1 c 2 c 3 lloyd 1982 then for each ensemble vector we re order the source location elements such that the sum of euclidean distance l 2 norm between the source locations and the centroids of the three groups is minimized we use the ensemble average of the re ordered source locations to estimate the distance between the locations of observation and contaminant sources when computing the weighing function τ m y in equation 3 fig 5 shows an example of the randomly generated ensemble of source locations s 1 s n e as well as the ensemble of re ordered source locations s 1 s n e computed by applying the algorithm in table 2 because the source locations s 1 s n e are randomly generated the ensemble average of the source locations s 1 n e i 1 n e s i is all near the center of the source zone as shown in fig 5 b c d e in contrast the newly proposed algorithm re orders the source elements in each ensemble vector and adjacent source locations are grouped together as shown in fig 5 g h i consequently the ensemble average of the re ordered source locations s 1 n e i 1 n e s i is not centered in the source zone fig 5 f g h i improving the proximity of the ensemble average s to each ensemble member s i for i 1 n e we analyze how the proposed method of covariance localization improves the inverse estimation of multiple contaminant source locations and three dimensional permeability fields in section 3 2 the es updates the model parameters by assimilating data over all time steps via the kalman formula in equation 3 for highly nonlinear problems multiple iterations of the update are necessary to achieve a reliable calibration emerick and reynolds 2013 however the multiple updates could underestimate uncertainties in the unknown parameters and thus one needs to inflate the measurement error by a factor of α t and the corresponding matrix r by the square of α t in iteration t t 1 n i t e r the factor α t should satisfy t 1 n i t e r 1 α t 2 1 and we set α t n i t e r thus in each iteration we update the parameter vectors by 5 m i u m i f τ m y c m y τ y y c y y α t 2 r 1 y o b s y i f where y f y α t ε the ensemble smoothing with multiple iterations equation 5 is often called ensemble smoothing with multiple data assimilation esmda we iterate the update ten times n i t e r 10 beyond which we find that the inversion results do not improve fig 6 shows the flow chart of esmda we conduct the forward simulation forecast step for each iteration based on the updated parameters in the previous update 3 results 3 1 inverse estimation of multiple contaminant sources and 3d permeability fields we estimate the source locations and heterogeneous permeability fields using the ensemble smoother presented in section 2 2 at three different mixed convection regimes m 0 1 1 10 and at three aquifer heterogeneity levels σ ln k 2 0 5 1 2 for each combination of m and σ ln k 2 we generate 20 inverse problems to avoid case specific results and the ensemble size of the es is 300 for each problem this results in a total of 54 000 20 3 m 3 σ l n k 2 300 n e forward models we utilize the high performance computing resources at minnesota supercomputing institute to deal with the substantial computational requirement we first visually highlight the performance of the proposed es by showing the estimated permeability fields and source locations for m 0 1 and m 10 at σ ln k 2 0 5 in fig 7 the estimated permeability fields and contaminant sources are the ensemble means of updated parameter vectors after the final iteration the figure also shows the source locations of all ensemble members after the final iteration qualitatively the es well characterizes the unknown permeability fields for both cases and the estimation of the source locations is more accurate at m 10 than at m 0 1 also the ensemble of the source locations is more clustered around the ensemble mean at the higher m implying reduced uncertainty in the estimates fig 7 shows the good performance of the proposed inversion algorithm and also shows the improvement in the inversion quality for the higher degree of variable density flow the improved inversion quality is because the variable density flow increases the data information contents as will be discussed in section 3 3 we quantify the inversion accuracy using the metric of normalized error reduction defined as e k d k t r u e d k 0 d k 0 for permeability field and e s d s t r u e d s 0 d s 0 for contaminant sources here d k t r u e ln k t r u e ln k which is the euclidean distance l 2 norm between the reference log permeability field ln k t r u e and the ensemble mean of the estimated log permeability fields ln k in the same way d k 0 ln k t r u e ln k 0 which is the distance between ln k t r u e and the ensemble mean of the initial log permeability fields ln k 0 the distance terms for source locations are similarly defined as d s t r u e s t r u e s and d s 0 s t r u e s 0 where s t r u e is the reference source locations s is the ensemble mean of the estimated source locations and s 0 is the ensemble mean of the initial source locations fig 8 shows the normalized error reduction for source locations and log permeability fields more than 50 error is reduced in source identification whereas more than 30 error is reduced for permeability estimation the level of error reduction in permeability estimation is comparable to our previous inversion study where we reported 30 40 error reductions in estimating two dimensional heterogeneous permeability fields using a localized ensemble kalman filter yoon et al 2020 this means that the proposed ensemble smoother can achieve the inversion quality in three dimensional systems similar to the level achieved for two dimensional systems fig 8 also shows that the error reduction increases as the mixed convection ratio increases confirming that the variable density flow increases the data information contents see section 3 3 for further details another factor impacting the error reduction is the aquifer heterogeneity quantified by the variance of the log permeability field as the log permeability variance increases the error reduction of permeability estimation increases whereas the error reduction in source identification decreases fig 8 high variance in the permeability field means that the permeability variability is larger compared to a low heterogeneity case as the possible permeability range increases the contrast between high and low permeability regions increases the increased permeability contrast strongly influences groundwater flow inducing preferential flow paths which in turn control contaminant transport kung 1990 fiori and jankovic 2012 kang et al 2016 this means that the high permeability variance causes distinct responses in pressure and concentration data which will be sensitive to the corresponding heterogeneous permeability field thus the observation data become more sensitive to the permeability fields and the error reduction increases as the permeability variance increases on the contrary the permeability heterogeneity adds complexity to the source identification problem when the permeability field is homogeneous meaning σ ln k 2 0 the source locations will dictate the evolution of the pressure and concentration data at the monitoring wells however as the permeability variance increases the influence of the heterogeneous permeability on flow and transport increases and the data responses become sensitive not only to the source location but also to the permeability field consequently the error reduction of source location decreases as the permeability variance increases notably the improvement in the source identification reaches up to 80 percent reduction of error σ ln k 2 0 5 and m 10 whereas the improvement in the permeability estimation does not go beyond 40 percent reduction of error this can be explained by the dimension of the unknown parameters while the dimension of the unknown source location parameters is nine that of the log permeability field is comparatively very high as many as 50 x 25 y 25 z 31250 since the data dimension is 20 w e l l 5 s e n s o r 10 t i m e s 1000 the inverse problem to estimate the unknown permeability field is ill posed limiting the inversion accuracy tian chyi et al 2015 this section confirms that the proposed modeling framework successfully characterizes multiple contaminant sources and 3d permeability fields a key aspect of the inversion framework is the implementation of covariance localization into es for multi source identification as presented in section 2 2 the following section shows how the proposed es improves the inverse estimation of multiple contaminant sources and heterogeneous permeability fields compared to conventional es 3 2 comparison with conventional es the ensemble smoother we propose in this study uses a new algorithm for covariance localization see section 2 2 to quantify the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm we conduct inverse modeling estimating the source locations and log permeability fields using a standard ensemble smoother without localizing the covariance matrices the standard es updates the parameter vectors in each update by 6 m i u m i f c m y c y y α t 2 r 1 y o b s y i f where y f y α t ε compared to the localized es equation 5 the standard es does not apply the weighting function τ m y and τ y y for covariance localization in addition we conduct another inverse modeling with covariance localization but without applying the re ordering algorithm table 2 when computing the weighting function τ m y in equation 5 we do not re order the source location elements and take the ensemble average of the source locations in determining the distance d in equation 4 fig 9 shows the error reduction in the inverse estimation of contaminant source locations and log permeability for different mixed convection ratios when σ ln k 2 2 for all mixed convection ratios the conventional es underperforms in reducing the estimation error furthermore the error reduction by the standard es decreases as m goes beyond one meaning that the standard es cannot take advantage of the increased data informativeness driven by the variable density flow the uncertainty of the inverse estimation is also larger with the standard es moreover the error bar plot shows that the standard es can lead to negative values in the error reduction meaning that the conventional method can even increase the error we confirmed similar results for other cases of σ ln k 2 when we apply covariance localization without re ordering the source elements in ensemble vectors the inversion quality improves compared to the conventional case however the localized es with the re ordering algorithm outperforms the localized es without re ordering the above results show that limiting the unphysical correlations between sources and monitoring wells through the proposed covariance localization significantly improves the inversion quality moreover the proposed re ordering algorithm for multi source identification improves the inversion accuracy by accurately determining the distances to the source locations this is the first study establishing the framework of applying covariance localization to ensemble smoothing for multiple source identification problems and demonstrating the performance of localized ensemble smoother 3 3 effects of variable density flow on data information content as shown in section 3 1 the inversion quality improves as the degree of variable density flow increases to elucidate the underlying mechanism through which variable density flow controls the inversion quality we investigate how variable density flow affects the monitoring well data because the data information contents will determine the accuracy of the inverse estimation we first investigate data variability according to mixed convection ratios because data variability reveals the amount of information yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 we measure the fluid pressure and contaminant concentration at the monitoring locations shown in fig 1 b by conducting flow and transport simulations for different mixed convection ratios m 0 1 1 10 when σ ln k 2 1 over the time duration of one pore volume injection pvi in this study we vary the mixed convection ratio by varying the hydraulic gradient across the domain see section 2 1 therefore the time units of the various mixed convection ratio cases need to be normalized to compare the data variability over time we use one pore volume injection pvi as the normalized time unit one pvi is the required time for the total groundwater inflow from the inlet plane to be equal to the total pore volume of the aquifer domain fig 10 a b show the absolute change of pressure and concentration averaged over all monitoring locations defined as p t p 0 and c t c 0 here the angle bracket denotes the average over all monitoring locations and p 0 and c 0 are the initial values of pressure and concentration for both data types the data variability increases as variable density flow effects intensify as m increases this is because the coupling between pressure and concentration intensifies as m increases darcy s law in equation 1 b shows that the evolving fluid density distribution causes the pressure field p to evolve this indicates that the state variables of pressure and concentration are coupled because concentration distribution affects fluid density distribution and in turn local pressure gradient carrera et al 2010 as a result the increased variable density flow effects at a higher mixed convection ratio lead to more significant data variability as shown in fig 10 a b the data variability is also sensitive to the sweeping efficiency of contaminant plumes and the contaminant plume passes through a larger volume of the aquifer domain as m increases see fig 3 we count the number of grid cells n s w e p t that experience concentrations larger than 0 01 c 1 and estimate the sweeping efficiency defined by n s w e p t n g r i d as shown in fig 10 c the sweeping efficiency increases as m increases which is well aligned with the data variability shown in fig 10 a b the increased sweeping efficiency at high m implies that the fluid density is altered in a larger area of the aquifer domain because the fluid density depends on plume concentration thus the increased sweeping efficiency caused by variable density flow increases the variability of the observation data note that the mixed convection ratio is determined not only by the density contrast between groundwater and contaminated water but also by the strength of the background groundwater flow when the background groundwater flow is insignificant even a small density difference between water and contaminated water can lead to a large mixed convection ratio we consider a range of m 0 1 10 observable in the fields ward et al 2007 and the sweeping efficiency may decrease for m 10 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 in view of data information contents the coupling between the data of pressure and concentration implies that they contain information about each other the additional information from the other data types is quantifiable by mutual information cover thomas 1991 yoon et al 2020 setting p and c as the random variables for the pressure field and concentration field respectively the mutual information for both variables is m i p c p c p p c log 2 p p c p p p c where p p c is the joint distribution and p p p c is the product distribution of both variables we estimate the mutual information of fluid pressure and contaminant concentration empirically meaning that sampled data is used to estimate the measure the mutual information measure is not constrained to certain types of distributions cover thomas 1991 fig 11 shows the ensemble mean and standard deviation of mutual information of fluid pressure and contaminant concentration data for different mixed convection ratios the mutual information increases as m increases indicating that the additional information amount increases as the degree of variable density flow increases thus variable density flow increases the data information contents the increased mutual information at the higher mixed convection ratio aligns well with the improved inversion quality at the higher mixed convection ratio fig 8 this result indicates that the increased data information contents driven by variable density flow improved the inversion quality to further investigate how variable density flow aids source identification we conduct inverse modeling with two additional settings of contaminant sources first we add one more contaminant source to the inverse modeling four sources while all other settings are fixed fig 12 shows the inversion results for different values of the mixed convection ratio m 0 1 10 at m 10 the four contaminant sources are all accurately estimated by the ensemble smoothing further demonstrating the performance of the proposed ensemble smoothing method for multi source identification at m 0 1 the estimated source locations become less accurate compared to m 10 case e g diamond and triangle symbols as shown in fig 12 e the better inversion quality at m 10 compared to the case of m 0 1 confirms our finding that the enhanced variable density flow increases the data informativeness thereby improving the inversion quality we conduct another inverse modeling where two of the three sources are very close to each other as shown in fig 13 at m 10 all three source including the two close sources are accurately estimated however at m 0 1 the ensemble smoother identified the two close sources as a single source while the single remote source red triangle is identified as two close sources as expected the inversion becomes more challenging as the source locations get closer but the proposed algorithm can still successfully identify source locations especially when m is large the results in this section show that variable density flow increases data information contents fig 11 and the increased data information contents are consistent with the increased data variability and sweeping efficiency fig 10 in view of inverse modeling the dependence of data informativeness on the degree of variable density flow is the key factor by which the variable density flow controls the inversion accuracy 4 summary and conclusions we proposed an advanced ensemble smoother with a new covariance localization algorithm that is tailored for multi source identification problems although covariance localization is a proven technique for improving ensemble kalman based data assimilation a procedure to apply the technique to multi source identification problems has not been established we established the covariance localization procedure that clusters and re orders the source location elements in ensemble vectors enabling one to properly define the source locations when estimating the distance between sources and monitoring wells using the localized es we successfully estimated both multiple contaminant source locations and heterogeneous permeability fields in three dimensional aquifers the localized es showed improved inversion quality compared to the standard es that does not apply the covariance localization technique this demonstrates that the proposed covariance localization technique is suitable for multi source identification problems we also investigated the effects of variable density flow on the data information contents and inverse estimation using the measure of mutual information we demonstrated that the data information content increases as the degree of variable density flow increases this is because the coupling between pressure and concentration data and the sweeping efficiency increase as the degree of variable density flow increases the coupling between pressure and concentration implies that they contain information about each other and the additional information increases as the degree of the coupling increases furthermore the increased sweeping efficiency leads to the alteration of fluid density in a larger area indicating increased data information contents over the larger area consequently the inversion quality improves due to the increased data information contents when the degree of variable density flow increases to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that elucidates the effects of variable density flow on identifying multiple contaminant sources in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifers in this study we only considered source locations and permeability fields as unknowns to be estimated there can be more uncertain parameters at actual contaminated sites such as the temporal variation of source intensity and boundary conditions de barros nowak 2010 xing et al 2019 the proposed framework of ensemble smoothing can be easily extended to incorporate such additional parameters the inverse problem of estimating source locations with additional parameters in more general settings at a real field site will be the subject of future work despite the simplifying assumptions made in this study the promising results show the potential of inverse modeling for multi source identification in 3d systems with variable density flows which will motivate future multi source identification studies credit

2437,groundwater contamination is an exacerbating global issue that severely threatens human health subsurface remediation thus has gained increased interest in recent years to effectively remediate subsurface contaminated sites one needs to identify the locations of contaminant sources and characterize contaminant spreading groundwater contamination is often driven by multiple contaminant sources making source identification problems challenging further when the densities of dissolved contaminants and ambient groundwater differ the resultant variable density flows add complexity to the task of source identification however most previous studies are limited to a single source identification in a two dimensional aquifer this study presents a novel inversion method based on ensemble smoothing that identifies the locations of multiple contaminant sources in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems a new covariance localization algorithm based on a clustering method is integrated into the inversion method which improves the accuracy of multi source identification using the proposed inversion framework we successfully estimate the locations of multiple contaminant sources and three dimensional permeability fields utilizing pressure and concentration data from monitoring wells further we investigate and elucidate the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and variable density flows on multiple source identification we find that variable density flow increases the data information contents and thus improves the inversion accuracy this is the first time demonstration of the effects of variable density flow on the inversion accuracy of multi source identification in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer systems keywords inverse estimation multiple contaminant sources 3d heterogeneous aquifer ensemble smoothing variable density flows data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has been aggravating globally severely threatening human health li et al 2016 subba rao et al 2019 abiriga et al 2020 predicting groundwater flow and contaminant transport is critical for assessing the risks associated with aquifer contamination and designing optimal remediation strategies numerical groundwater models have been an essential tool to predict flow and transport under various scenarios of contaminant sources and aquifer heterogeneity a key challenge in applying groundwater flow and contaminant transport models is that we need an accurate estimation of hydrogeologic parameters e g heterogeneous permeability distribution and the forcing parameters e g locations of contaminant sources the accuracy of the parameters determines the model predictability however the direct measurement of the parameters based on boring and coring is often too costly for practical purposes advances in inverse modeling have made it possible to efficiently estimate various aquifer characteristics such as aquifer permeability and contaminant sources from different data types at multi spatiotemporal scales gorelick et al 1983 wagner 1992 atmadja bagtzoglou 2001 mahinthakumar sayeed 2005 datta et al 2009 dafflon et al 2011 jeong park 2019 zhang et al 2020 we refer readers to gómez hernández xu 2022 for a thorough review of the advances in inverse modeling for contaminated aquifer characterization and contaminant source identification a well proven inversion method is the ensemble kalman based data assimilation the method is a monte carlo implementation of the well known kalman formula which is derived from the bayesian framework assuming prior and likelihood functions as gaussian evensen 1994 2003 2009 the method has been actively used for characterizing groundwater systems including hydraulic conductivity fields zhou et al 2011 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 xia et al 2018 and recently contaminant sources zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 recent inversion studies on contaminant source identification showed promising results zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2021 li et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however most studies consider a single contaminant source in a two dimensional aquifer system such simplifications are useful for proof of concept and methodological development but natural aquifer systems are three dimensional and multiple contaminant sources are prevalent only recently have source identification studies considered three dimensional groundwater systems but with a single source jha datta 2013 ayaz 2022 inverse modeling studies with multiple sources are currently limited to a two dimensional setup moghaddam et al 2021 wang zhang 2021 zhao et al 2021 variable density flow is another important but often overlooked feature in characterizing contaminated aquifers when the densities of the contaminant plume and the ambient groundwater differ variable density flows occur for example the total dissolved solids concentration of leachate from sanitary landfills has been estimated to range from 5 000 to 40 000 mg l freeze cherry 1979 meaning approximately 0 35 2 8 density difference between the contaminant solute and the groundwater simmons et al 2001 recent studies demonstrated that variable density flow impacts the information contents of pressure and concentration data for aquifer characterization kang et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 although a few recent studies conducted contaminant source characterizations in aquifers where variable density flow exists dodangeh et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and rajabi 2022 no study has investigated how the degree of variable density flow affects the inverse estimation of contaminant sources this study presents a novel inversion method that jointly estimates multiple contaminant sources and heterogeneous permeability fields in three dimensional aquifers where variable density flow occurs we propose an advanced ensemble smoother es suitable for multi source identification the proposed es is based on a new covariance localization algorithm that is tailored to multiple source identification problems covariance localization is a kalman formula variant developed two decades ago hamill et al 2001 houtekamer mitchell 2001 and has been widely used in ensemble kalman based data assimilation to circumvent invalid correlation between state variables and observation data however the procedure for applying covariance localization to multiple source identification problems has not been established this study for the first time demonstrates the ability of es with covariance localization for estimating multiple contaminant sources in 3d heterogeneous aquifers further we elucidate how variable density flow influences data information contents and the inverse estimation of contaminant sources the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the numerical modeling framework for variable density flows in 3d heterogeneous aquifers and the proposed ensemble smoother algorithm section 3 shows the performance of the ensemble smoother algorithm and also elucidates the effects of variable density flow on data informativeness and inversion accuracy finally we provide a summary and conclusions in section 4 2 methods 2 1 simulation of variable density flow and contaminant transport we consider a variable density groundwater flow system where the concentration of dissolved contaminants determines the fluid density under the assumptions of incompressible fluids and the boussinesq approximation the governing equations for the variable density groundwater flow and contaminant transport consist of the continuity equation darcy s law and the advection dispersion

to salt brine we use the saturated contaminant concentration of c 1 0 035 kg kg which is similar to a salt brine solution in water we also use the reported value of the density change rate of salt brine of ρ c 700 kg m 3 voss souza 1987 related physical constants and other settings are given in table 1 we consider a three dimensional heterogeneous aquifer with three contaminant sources the contaminant sources release dissolved contaminants into surrounding groundwater at a constant concentration we impose constant head boundaries on the inlet and outlet planes to induce background groundwater flow and no flow conditions are assigned to all the other side boundaries we consider three different levels of aquifer heterogeneity σ ln k 2 0 5 1 2 and fig 1 shows an example of a heterogeneous log permeability field with unit variance σ ln k 2 1 and three source locations the spatial correlation structure is modeled using a spherical variogram the mean log permeability is set to ln k 23 which corresponds to approximately k 10 5 millidarcy the value of permeability is similar to those of natural geologic formations consisting of medium to coarse sand such as the site in cape cod massachusetts leblanc et al 1991 the flow boundary conditions are given by 2a p x 0 y z t ρ 0 g z δ p 2b u n 0 at side boundaries 2c p x l y z t ρ 0 g z where n is the outward unit vector

a cubic element with dimensions of δ x δ y δ z 1 m we solve for the pressure field using a finite volume method with a two point flux approximation then solve for the concentration field using a finite volume method with an upwind scheme yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 we then integrate in time using an explicit forward euler scheme leveque 2002 we consider three different variable density flow regimes which are quantified by the relative strength of density driven flow compared to ambient groundwater flow ward et al 2007 we estimate the strength of ambient groundwater flow with the characteristic velocity v g w k μ ϕ δ p l x where k is the mean permeability δ p is the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet boundaries distant by the aquifer length l x the strength of density driven flow is estimated with the characteristic velocity v δ ρ k δ ρ g b μ ϕ the ratio of the two characteristic velocities is known as the mixed convection ratio m v δ ρ v g w δ ρ g b l x δ p ward et al 2007 we consider three different values of δ p to induce three different mixed convection ratios of m 0 1 1 10 when m 1 free and forced convection are balanced and the two characteristic velocities are approximately equal fig 3 shows the multiple snapshots of contaminant transport simulated in the aquifer shown in fig 1 a for the three values of m as m increases the density driven flow becomes dominant over the ambient groundwater flow and a strong downward groundwater flow emerges e g see the right most column of fig 3 in the following sections we investigate how the variable density flow influences the informativeness of observation data collected from the monitoring wells and inversion accuracy 2 2 localized ensemble smoother for multi source identification we use ensemble smoothing to estimate three contaminant source locations and three dimensional permeability fields thus we set the unknown parameter vector m to include three source locations s x 1 x 2 x 3 where x i x i y i z i for i 1 2 3 and log permeability field ln k such that m s ln k note that the ensemble smoothing framework can be easily extended to incorporate additional parameters such as the temporal variation of source intensity and different numbers of contaminant sources the uncertainty of the model parameter m is modeled by an ensemble of the parameter realizations m 1 f m n e f where n e is the ensemble size the ensemble of the three source locations is generated from the uniform distribution in the ranges of 2 x s 14 7 y s 19 and 2 z s 23 and the permeability fields are generated using the spatial correlation structure of the spherical variogram described in table 1 related geostatistical features are given in table 1 the flow and transport model is assumed as an error free model y f m implying that the accuracy of the model predictions is determined only by the uncertainty in the model parameter m the prediction vector includes the predicted state values of pressure and concentration at the monitoring location as y p f c f to honor the measurement noise in observations y o b s a multivariate gaussian error ε with zero mean and covariance r see table 1 is added to the predicted values as y f y ε we update the parameter vectors using the following kalman formula with covariance localization 3 m i u m i f τ m y c m y τ y y c y y r 1 y o b s y i f here c m y e m f e m f y f e y f t is the cross covariance matrix between the model parameter m and the model prediction y f and c y y e y f e y f y f e y f t is the auto covariance matrix of the model prediction the notation is the schur product element wise matrix multiplication and τ is the weighting function for covariance localization even if the corresponding state components are physically far apart the corresponding correlation values in the covariance matrices c m y and c y y can be unphysically high to prevent the effects of unphysical correlation the covariance matrices are often adjusted by a weighting function τ this procedure is known as covariance localization and we use the well proved fifth order formulae proposed by gaspari and cohn 1999 defined as 4 τ ij d 1 4 d r 5 1 2 d r 4 5 8 d r 3 5 3 d r 2 1 0 d r 1 12 d r 5 1 2 d r 4 5 8 d r 3 5 3 d r 2 5 d r 4 2 3 d r 1 r d 2 r 0 2 r d where τ ij is the i th row and j th column element of τ and d is the distance between the two states corresponding to τ ij although covariance localization is a well proven technique for improving kalman based data assimilation applying it to the multiple source identification problem is not straightforward when computing τ m y in equation 3 we need to quantify the distance d between the observation locations and contaminant sources equation 4 however the distance is not easy to define because the source locations are unknown variables to be estimated and each ensemble member has different source locations a simple solution to determine the source locations when estimating d is taking the ensemble average of the source locations as e s however the simple ensemble average is not an effective way to estimate d for example consider two ensemble vectors of source location parameters s 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 3 and s 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 3 as shown in fig 4 a even if the sources form three groups of clusters simply taking the ensemble average s s 1 s 2 2 cannot honor the clustering pattern as shown in fig 4 b which may lead to an inaccurate estimation of d to honor the clustering status one needs to re order the source elements such that the distance between each ensemble member and the ensemble average s 1 s s 2 s is minimized where the s s denotes euclidean distance l 2 norm between s and s by properly re ordering the source location elements in the ensemble vectors fig 4 c one can estimate ensemble average estimates that honor the clustering status fig 4 d the re ordering will enable us to estimate d in equation 4 which better represents each ensemble vector s source locations based on the above discussion we propose a two step algorithm as formulated in table 2 for determining the source locations when estimating the distance d in equation 4 we first cluster the initially generated source locations into multiple groups as many as the number of sources three using the k means clustering method and estimate the centroids of the three groups c c 1 c 2 c 3 lloyd 1982 then for each ensemble vector we re order the source location elements such that the sum of euclidean distance l 2 norm between the source locations and the centroids of the three groups is minimized we use the ensemble average of the re ordered source locations to estimate the distance between the locations of observation and contaminant sources when computing the weighing function τ m y in equation 3 fig 5 shows an example of the randomly generated ensemble of source locations s 1 s n e as well as the ensemble of re ordered source locations s 1 s n e computed by applying the algorithm in table 2 because the source locations s 1 s n e are randomly generated the ensemble average of the source locations s 1 n e i 1 n e s i is all near the center of the source zone as shown in fig 5 b c d e in contrast the newly proposed algorithm re orders the source elements in each ensemble vector and adjacent source locations are grouped together as shown in fig 5 g h i consequently the ensemble average of the re ordered source locations s 1 n e i 1 n e s i is not centered in the source zone fig 5 f g h i improving the proximity of the ensemble average s to each ensemble member s i for i 1 n e we analyze how the proposed method of covariance localization improves the inverse estimation of multiple contaminant source locations and three dimensional permeability fields in section 3 2 the es updates the model parameters by assimilating data over all time steps via the kalman formula in equation 3 for highly nonlinear problems multiple iterations of the update are necessary to achieve a reliable calibration emerick and reynolds 2013 however the multiple updates could underestimate uncertainties in the unknown parameters and thus one needs to inflate the measurement error by a factor of α t and the corresponding matrix r by the square of α t in iteration t t 1 n i t e r the factor α t should satisfy t 1 n i t e r 1 α t 2 1 and we set α t n i t e r thus in each iteration we update the parameter vectors by 5 m i u m i f τ m y c m y τ y y c y y α t 2 r 1 y o b s y i f where y f y α t ε the ensemble smoothing with multiple iterations equation 5 is often called ensemble smoothing with multiple data assimilation esmda we iterate the update ten times n i t e r 10 beyond which we find that the inversion results do not improve fig 6 shows the flow chart of esmda we conduct the forward simulation forecast step for each iteration based on the updated parameters in the previous update 3 results 3 1 inverse estimation of multiple contaminant sources and 3d permeability fields we estimate the source locations and heterogeneous permeability fields using the ensemble smoother presented in section 2 2 at three different mixed convection regimes m 0 1 1 10 and at three aquifer heterogeneity levels σ ln k 2 0 5 1 2 for each combination of m and σ ln k 2 we generate 20 inverse problems to avoid case specific results and the ensemble size of the es is 300 for each problem this results in a total of 54 000 20 3 m 3 σ l n k 2 300 n e forward models we utilize the high performance computing resources at minnesota supercomputing institute to deal with the substantial computational requirement we first visually highlight the performance of the proposed es by showing the estimated permeability fields and source locations for m 0 1 and m 10 at σ ln k 2 0 5 in fig 7 the estimated permeability fields and contaminant sources are the ensemble means of updated parameter vectors after the final iteration the figure also shows the source locations of all ensemble members after the final iteration qualitatively the es well characterizes the unknown permeability fields for both cases and the estimation of the source locations is more accurate at m 10 than at m 0 1 also the ensemble of the source locations is more clustered around the ensemble mean at the higher m implying reduced uncertainty in the estimates fig 7 shows the good performance of the proposed inversion algorithm and also shows the improvement in the inversion quality for the higher degree of variable density flow the improved inversion quality is because the variable density flow increases the data information contents as will be discussed in section 3 3 we quantify the inversion accuracy using the metric of normalized error reduction defined as e k d k t r u e d k 0 d k 0 for permeability field and e s d s t r u e d s 0 d s 0 for contaminant sources here d k t r u e ln k t r u e ln k which is the euclidean distance l 2 norm between the reference log permeability field ln k t r u e and the ensemble mean of the estimated log permeability fields ln k in the same way d k 0 ln k t r u e ln k 0 which is the distance between ln k t r u e and the ensemble mean of the initial log permeability fields ln k 0 the distance terms for source locations are similarly defined as d s t r u e s t r u e s and d s 0 s t r u e s 0 where s t r u e is the reference source locations s is the ensemble mean of the estimated source locations and s 0 is the ensemble mean of the initial source locations fig 8 shows the normalized error reduction for source locations and log permeability fields more than 50 error is reduced in source identification whereas more than 30 error is reduced for permeability estimation the level of error reduction in permeability estimation is comparable to our previous inversion study where we reported 30 40 error reductions in estimating two dimensional heterogeneous permeability fields using a localized ensemble kalman filter yoon et al 2020 this means that the proposed ensemble smoother can achieve the inversion quality in three dimensional systems similar to the level achieved for two dimensional systems fig 8 also shows that the error reduction increases as the mixed convection ratio increases confirming that the variable density flow increases the data information contents see section 3 3 for further details another factor impacting the error reduction is the aquifer heterogeneity quantified by the variance of the log permeability field as the log permeability variance increases the error reduction of permeability estimation increases whereas the error reduction in source identification decreases fig 8 high variance in the permeability field means that the permeability variability is larger compared to a low heterogeneity case as the possible permeability range increases the contrast between high and low permeability regions increases the increased permeability contrast strongly influences groundwater flow inducing preferential flow paths which in turn control contaminant transport kung 1990 fiori and jankovic 2012 kang et al 2016 this means that the high permeability variance causes distinct responses in pressure and concentration data which will be sensitive to the corresponding heterogeneous permeability field thus the observation data become more sensitive to the permeability fields and the error reduction increases as the permeability variance increases on the contrary the permeability heterogeneity adds complexity to the source identification problem when the permeability field is homogeneous meaning σ ln k 2 0 the source locations will dictate the evolution of the pressure and concentration data at the monitoring wells however as the permeability variance increases the influence of the heterogeneous permeability on flow and transport increases and the data responses become sensitive not only to the source location but also to the permeability field consequently the error reduction of source location decreases as the permeability variance increases notably the improvement in the source identification reaches up to 80 percent reduction of error σ ln k 2 0 5 and m 10 whereas the improvement in the permeability estimation does not go beyond 40 percent reduction of error this can be explained by the dimension of the unknown parameters while the dimension of the unknown source location parameters is nine that of the log permeability field is comparatively very high as many as 50 x 25 y 25 z 31250 since the data dimension is 20 w e l l 5 s e n s o r 10 t i m e s 1000 the inverse problem to estimate the unknown permeability field is ill posed limiting the inversion accuracy tian chyi et al 2015 this section confirms that the proposed modeling framework successfully characterizes multiple contaminant sources and 3d permeability fields a key aspect of the inversion framework is the implementation of covariance localization into es for multi source identification as presented in section 2 2 the following section shows how the proposed es improves the inverse estimation of multiple contaminant sources and heterogeneous permeability fields compared to conventional es 3 2 comparison with conventional es the ensemble smoother we propose in this study uses a new algorithm for covariance localization see section 2 2 to quantify the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm we conduct inverse modeling estimating the source locations and log permeability fields using a standard ensemble smoother without localizing the covariance matrices the standard es updates the parameter vectors in each update by 6 m i u m i f c m y c y y α t 2 r 1 y o b s y i f where y f y α t ε compared to the localized es equation 5 the standard es does not apply the weighting function τ m y and τ y y for covariance localization in addition we conduct another inverse modeling with covariance localization but without applying the re ordering algorithm table 2 when computing the weighting function τ m y in equation 5 we do not re order the source location elements and take the ensemble average of the source locations in determining the distance d in equation 4 fig 9 shows the error reduction in the inverse estimation of contaminant source locations and log permeability for different mixed convection ratios when σ ln k 2 2 for all mixed convection ratios the conventional es underperforms in reducing the estimation error furthermore the error reduction by the standard es decreases as m goes beyond one meaning that the standard es cannot take advantage of the increased data informativeness driven by the variable density flow the uncertainty of the inverse estimation is also larger with the standard es moreover the error bar plot shows that the standard es can lead to negative values in the error reduction meaning that the conventional method can even increase the error we confirmed similar results for other cases of σ ln k 2 when we apply covariance localization without re ordering the source elements in ensemble vectors the inversion quality improves compared to the conventional case however the localized es with the re ordering algorithm outperforms the localized es without re ordering the above results show that limiting the unphysical correlations between sources and monitoring wells through the proposed covariance localization significantly improves the inversion quality moreover the proposed re ordering algorithm for multi source identification improves the inversion accuracy by accurately determining the distances to the source locations this is the first study establishing the framework of applying covariance localization to ensemble smoothing for multiple source identification problems and demonstrating the performance of localized ensemble smoother 3 3 effects of variable density flow on data information content as shown in section 3 1 the inversion quality improves as the degree of variable density flow increases to elucidate the underlying mechanism through which variable density flow controls the inversion quality we investigate how variable density flow affects the monitoring well data because the data information contents will determine the accuracy of the inverse estimation we first investigate data variability according to mixed convection ratios because data variability reveals the amount of information yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 we measure the fluid pressure and contaminant concentration at the monitoring locations shown in fig 1 b by conducting flow and transport simulations for different mixed convection ratios m 0 1 1 10 when σ ln k 2 1 over the time duration of one pore volume injection pvi in this study we vary the mixed convection ratio by varying the hydraulic gradient across the domain see section 2 1 therefore the time units of the various mixed convection ratio cases need to be normalized to compare the data variability over time we use one pore volume injection pvi as the normalized time unit one pvi is the required time for the total groundwater inflow from the inlet plane to be equal to the total pore volume of the aquifer domain fig 10 a b show the absolute change of pressure and concentration averaged over all monitoring locations defined as p t p 0 and c t c 0 here the angle bracket denotes the average over all monitoring locations and p 0 and c 0 are the initial values of pressure and concentration for both data types the data variability increases as variable density flow effects intensify as m increases this is because the coupling between pressure and concentration intensifies as m increases darcy s law in equation 1 b shows that the evolving fluid density distribution causes the pressure field p to evolve this indicates that the state variables of pressure and concentration are coupled because concentration distribution affects fluid density distribution and in turn local pressure gradient carrera et al 2010 as a result the increased variable density flow effects at a higher mixed convection ratio lead to more significant data variability as shown in fig 10 a b the data variability is also sensitive to the sweeping efficiency of contaminant plumes and the contaminant plume passes through a larger volume of the aquifer domain as m increases see fig 3 we count the number of grid cells n s w e p t that experience concentrations larger than 0 01 c 1 and estimate the sweeping efficiency defined by n s w e p t n g r i d as shown in fig 10 c the sweeping efficiency increases as m increases which is well aligned with the data variability shown in fig 10 a b the increased sweeping efficiency at high m implies that the fluid density is altered in a larger area of the aquifer domain because the fluid density depends on plume concentration thus the increased sweeping efficiency caused by variable density flow increases the variability of the observation data note that the mixed convection ratio is determined not only by the density contrast between groundwater and contaminated water but also by the strength of the background groundwater flow when the background groundwater flow is insignificant even a small density difference between water and contaminated water can lead to a large mixed convection ratio we consider a range of m 0 1 10 observable in the fields ward et al 2007 and the sweeping efficiency may decrease for m 10 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2020 in view of data information contents the coupling between the data of pressure and concentration implies that they contain information about each other the additional information from the other data types is quantifiable by mutual information cover thomas 1991 yoon et al 2020 setting p and c as the random variables for the pressure field and concentration field respectively the mutual information for both variables is m i p c p c p p c log 2 p p c p p p c where p p c is the joint distribution and p p p c is the product distribution of both variables we estimate the mutual information of fluid pressure and contaminant concentration empirically meaning that sampled data is used to estimate the measure the mutual information measure is not constrained to certain types of distributions cover thomas 1991 fig 11 shows the ensemble mean and standard deviation of mutual information of fluid pressure and contaminant concentration data for different mixed convection ratios the mutual information increases as m increases indicating that the additional information amount increases as the degree of variable density flow increases thus variable density flow increases the data information contents the increased mutual information at the higher mixed convection ratio aligns well with the improved inversion quality at the higher mixed convection ratio fig 8 this result indicates that the increased data information contents driven by variable density flow improved the inversion quality to further investigate how variable density flow aids source identification we conduct inverse modeling with two additional settings of contaminant sources first we add one more contaminant source to the inverse modeling four sources while all other settings are fixed fig 12 shows the inversion results for different values of the mixed convection ratio m 0 1 10 at m 10 the four contaminant sources are all accurately estimated by the ensemble smoothing further demonstrating the performance of the proposed ensemble smoothing method for multi source identification at m 0 1 the estimated source locations become less accurate compared to m 10 case e g diamond and triangle symbols as shown in fig 12 e the better inversion quality at m 10 compared to the case of m 0 1 confirms our finding that the enhanced variable density flow increases the data informativeness thereby improving the inversion quality we conduct another inverse modeling where two of the three sources are very close to each other as shown in fig 13 at m 10 all three source including the two close sources are accurately estimated however at m 0 1 the ensemble smoother identified the two close sources as a single source while the single remote source red triangle is identified as two close sources as expected the inversion becomes more challenging as the source locations get closer but the proposed algorithm can still successfully identify source locations especially when m is large the results in this section show that variable density flow increases data information contents fig 11 and the increased data information contents are consistent with the increased data variability and sweeping efficiency fig 10 in view of inverse modeling the dependence of data informativeness on the degree of variable density flow is the key factor by which the variable density flow controls the inversion accuracy 4 summary and conclusions we proposed an advanced ensemble smoother with a new covariance localization algorithm that is tailored for multi source identification problems although covariance localization is a proven technique for improving ensemble kalman based data assimilation a procedure to apply the technique to multi source identification problems has not been established we established the covariance localization procedure that clusters and re orders the source location elements in ensemble vectors enabling one to properly define the source locations when estimating the distance between sources and monitoring wells using the localized es we successfully estimated both multiple contaminant source locations and heterogeneous permeability fields in three dimensional aquifers the localized es showed improved inversion quality compared to the standard es that does not apply the covariance localization technique this demonstrates that the proposed covariance localization technique is suitable for multi source identification problems we also investigated the effects of variable density flow on the data information contents and inverse estimation using the measure of mutual information we demonstrated that the data information content increases as the degree of variable density flow increases this is because the coupling between pressure and concentration data and the sweeping efficiency increase as the degree of variable density flow increases the coupling between pressure and concentration implies that they contain information about each other and the additional information increases as the degree of the coupling increases furthermore the increased sweeping efficiency leads to the alteration of fluid density in a larger area indicating increased data information contents over the larger area consequently the inversion quality improves due to the increased data information contents when the degree of variable density flow increases to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that elucidates the effects of variable density flow on identifying multiple contaminant sources in three dimensional heterogeneous aquifers in this study we only considered source locations and permeability fields as unknowns to be estimated there can be more uncertain parameters at actual contaminated sites such as the temporal variation of source intensity and boundary conditions de barros nowak 2010 xing et al 2019 the proposed framework of ensemble smoothing can be easily extended to incorporate such additional parameters the inverse problem of estimating source locations with additional parameters in more general settings at a real field site will be the subject of future work despite the simplifying assumptions made in this study the promising results show the potential of inverse modeling for multi source identification in 3d systems with variable density flows which will motivate future multi source identification studies credit

hydrology and sediment properties in these rivers we propose particle size served as an integral proxy for favorable conditions of fluvial ch4 production due to strong dependence of benthic substrates anaerobic conditions and microbial colonization on fine particles the dependence of fluvial co2 emission on riverbed sediment properties was however weak due to multiple production pathways not controlled by sediment anaerobic metabolisms these findings extended our understandings on the important in situ controls of fluvial ch4 and co2 emissions and suggest the possibility of improving the

2016 gomez gener et al 2021 rosentreter et al 2021 as it is not only important for improving estimates of the emission magnitudes saunois et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 but also developing mechanistic understandings of their linkages to terrestrial carbon cycling and atmospheric warming liu et al 2022 this is particularly true for fluvial systems on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp where unparalleled warming during the past decades has triggered dramatic changes to the rivers and terrestrial fluvial interactions in this region yet current understandings of in situ greenhouse gas

characterized by high ch4 emission rates and ch4 to co2 emission ratios zhang et al 2020 a phenomenon attributed to abundant substrate supplies from local soils and favorable hydrodynamic conditions for ch4 ebullition within the region here we hypothesize that the hydrology and bed sediment composition shape largely the magnitude and spatial variations of ch4 and co2 emissions from rivers through systematic investigations of rivers of different sizes and geophysical settings on eastern qinghai tibetan plateau we aim to demonstrate 1 significant variations of fluvial ch4 and co2 emissions in rivers of contrasting bed sediment compositions 2 important in situ controls of riverbed sediments on ch4 and co2 emission from the rivers 3 underlying mechanisms behind the bed sediment controls of

from 800 to 4600 m above sea level and averaged approximately 3500 m we sampled surface water samples with precleaned plastic bottles immersed 10 cm below the water surface to allow gently filled with flowing water the samples were then transferred to a portable refrigerator 4 until further analysis of physiochemical properties in the lab a total of 24 riverbed sediment samples were also collected by forcing three pvc pipes diameter 4 cm into adjacent sediments at each site sediment samples were then stored under ice until further analysis in lab for sediment porewater collection three piezometers were deployed simultaneously in the river channel for triplicate sample collections porewater at the 15 cm depth below surface sediments were collected the piezometers were made of stainless steel diameter 5 cm within which a silicone tube inner diameter 9 mm was installed and connected to a peristaltic pump for water pumping the first 50 ml porewater was discarded and we took care for the rest of the sampling procedure to avoid strong disturbance to the sediment flow field two portions of porewater were collected the first portion 100 ml was used for dissolved gas analysis

equilibration method johnson et al 1990 water samples for dissolved gas analysis were sampled with a 600 ml glass serum bottle equipped with butyl stopper the bottle was immersed 10 cm under water to allow it gently filled with flowing water and sealed underneath with a stopper to avoid entrainment of air bubbles high purity argon was then injected into the bottle to create a 100 ml headspace the bottle was vigorously shaken for 1 min for dissolved gases to equilibrate the headspace gas sample was then transferred to a 150 ml pre vacuumed air bag for lab analysis by using a gas chromatography

due probably to more favorable conditions for bubble formation and eruptive ch4 emissions in fine grained sediments liu et al 2018 the clear differences highlight riverbed sediment composition as a critical factor affecting the magnitude of ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers sediment porewater ch4 concentration was on average 31 folds that in surface waters 4299 vs 136 nmol l fig 2a the high concentration gradient supports the idea of benthic anaerobic metabolism as a strong ch4 source to overlying waters schindler and krabbenhoft 1998 hlaváčová et al 2005 table s2 in comparison to surface waters the magnitude of difference in porewater ch4 concentration was even more significant among the sediment types to illustrate porewater ch4 concentration in the silt dominated rivers was on average 18 195 folds that in the sand or gravel dominated riverbeds 9770 11200 vs 50 30 and 550 850 nmol l p 0 05 fig 2a in comparison to the 6 12 fold difference in surface water ch4 we found remarkably strong correlations between porewater ch4 concentration and sediment silt r2 0 30 p 0 01 fig 3 a and table s3 suggesting the importance of silty sediment on ch4 production in riverbed sediments additionally high ch4 concentration and evasion fluxes were also found in rivers of high oc substrates as indicated by the multiple positive correlations between benthic oc contents sediment oc porewater doc and sediment weoc and ch4 concentrations evasion fluxes r2 0 11 0 34 p 0 05 0 01 fig 3b d table s3 it is important to point out that the correlations between porewater doc or sediment weoc and ch4 were generally stronger than between sediment oc and ch4 r2 0 26 0 34 vs r2 0 11 0 16 suggesting freely dissolved oc as a more bioavailable substrate for ch4 metabolism in benthic sediments than oc protected by particle minerals hlaváčová et al 2005 buriankova et al 2013 in comparison the correlations between surface water doc and ch4 were much weaker or insignificant p 0 05 table s3 in contrast to the impacts of sediment oc contents strong negative correlations were found between do and ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 14 0 23 fig 3e table s3 suggesting stronger ch4 emission in less oxygenated rivers additionally sediment fe3 and nitrate contents showed strong negative correlations with ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 50 0 58 and 0 22 0 27 respectively fig 3f and g figures s3 and s4 and table s3 implying fe3 and nitrate as the possible main alternative terminal electron acceptor tea modulators for anaerobic ch4 oxidation in the qtp rivers though mechanisms responsible for ch4 oxidation in the rivers need to be further resolved lastly both mcra and pmoa gene abundances were positively correlated with ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 14 0

the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 and much smaller than that of ch4 emissions 3 8 vs 13 14 folds fig 2c and e this suggests riverbed sediment grain size was not a strong predictor for spatial variations in surface water co2 concentration or emission flux across the rivers in line with the weak to insignificant correlations p 0 05 between the various sediment properties weoc porewater do fe3 and surface water co2 concentration flux figures s3 and s4 table s3 except a positive correlation was found between surface water doc concentration and co2 flux table s3 indicating the existence of other possible co2 production pathways in water columns besides preferential anaerobic and aerobic co2 respiration in riverbed sediments in contrast to ch4 none of the sediment properties were retained in the stepwise regression models for co2 flux and the best predictors for co2 flux variation were surface water doc and temperature table s5 porewater co2 concentration was on average five folds that in surface waters 201 versus 39 μmol l fig 2b and highly correlated with porewater ch4 concentration r2 0 45 p 0 01 figure s3 table s3 in line with the idea of ch4 oxidation as part of the sediment co2 sources trimmer et al 2010 in contrast to surface waters porewater co2 concentration was significantly higher in silt dominated rivers than in sand or gravel dominated rivers 411 7 764 5 vs 49 5 16 8 and 42 4 6 4 μmol l p 0 01 fig 2b though the difference was not as large as for ch4 8 10 vs 18 195 times similar to porewater ch4 a high correlation between sediment silt and porewater co2 r2 0 26 p 0 01 was identified figure s3 suggesting a similar direct impact of fine sediments on porewater co2 3 3 sediment physicochemical properties measurements of benthic oc contents sediment oc weoc and porewater doc were the highest in silt dominated rivers intermediate in sand dominated rivers and lowest in gravel dominated rivers p 0 05 figure s2 fig 4 a c in contrast porewater do was significantly lower in silt dominated than in sand or gravel dominated sediments 3 6 vs 4 5 4 6 mg l p 0 01 suggesting the more permeable gravel and sandy riverbeds were more oxygenated strong negative correlation between porewater do and sediment silt was identified r 0 43 p 0 05 table s3 suggesting fine sediments promote anoxia additionally though the amount of hcl extractable fe was comparable among the three sediment types 7 2 9 8 g kg 1 p 0 05 fe ii increased whereas fe iii decreased from gravel to silty sediments fig 4f the systematic variation in dominant fe forms together with low porewater do suggest more reduced redox conditions in silt dominated sediments which favor methanogenesis and suppress methanotrophy bodmer et al 2020 a strong negative relationship between flow velocity with sediment silt figure s5a indicating limited fine deposits in rivers with higher flow velocity significant positive correlations between sediment oc porewater doc weoc and sediment silt were identified r2 0 2 0 28 p 0 05 0 001 fig 5 a c table s3 suggesting a high dependence of benthic oc contents on sediment particle size furthermore the correlation between weoc and sediment silt was stronger than those between sediment oc and silt 0 63 versus 0 51 fig 5b and c table s3 probably caused by a stronger release of mineral bound oc in the more anoxic silt sediments adhikari et al 2017 both mcra and pmoa gene abundances in silt dominated rivers on average were one magnitude order greater than those of sand or gravel dominated rivers fig 4g h positive correlations between sediment silt with both mcra and pmoa gene abundances were observed r2 0 12 0 17 p 0 05 0 01 fig 5e and f table s3 suggesting a major control of sediment particle size on ch4 related microbial abundances additionally as a process depending highly upon substrate availability methanotrophy and therefore the growth of methanotrophic microbes were promoted in fine sediments shelley et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 the gene abundances were also correlated with sediment weoc r 0 71 0 77 porewater doc concentration r 0 43 0 56 sediment oc r 0 42 0 50 and temperature r 0 46 0 61 table s3 suggesting a direct impact of benthic oc and thermodynamics on ch4 related gene abundances and metabolisms in sediments shelley et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2019 3 4 a hierarchal effect of sediment grain size on ch4 production and emission from the rivers based on the above observations we proposed a structural equation model sem to highlight the hierarchal effects of sediment grain size on sediment properties and then ch4 production and release from the qtp rivers fig 6 we show that the amount of oc substrates hydraulic exchanges redox conditions and microbial abundances were all related to particle size composition of riverbed sediments in particular sediment silt content imposes positive impacts on sediment oc contents with standardized path coefficient of 0 53 0 61 see below and mcra gene abundance 0 74 and negative impacts on hydraulic exchanges do and fe3 0 28 with together created favorable benthic conditions for ch4 production and emission in fine sediment rivers stepwise multilinear regression models were established using the various sediment properties as predicting variables which explained 69 87 and 76 of the variations in surface water ch4 concentration porewater ch4 concentration and ch4 fluxes from the qtp rivers fig 3j l table s4 among the sediment properties sediment weoc and fe3 contents porewater do and methanogenic gene abundance were most often retained variables during the stepwise regression processes table s4 suggesting a direct impact of these factors on benthic ch4 metabolisms fig 6 additionally we retained sediment silt as a key factor in the regression models considering its effects on the series of sediment properties fig 5 the high explaining capacity of these variables supports a major riverbed sediment control on ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers in contrast multilinear regression models established for co2 were generally much weaker and explained 55 of the porewater co2 variations table s5 the following formulas can be used to explain ch4 and co2 concentration and flux using measured values through stepwise regression model 8 p o r e w a t e r c h 4 c o

rivers our results support the proposition of a strong riverbed sediment control on ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers figs 6 and 7 ch4 production in sediments depends highly on the amount and composition of substrates wilkinson et al 2015 and fine sediments are frequently associated with higher oc content sanders et al 2007 sawakuchi et al 2014 crawford et al 2017 though particulate oc of fluvial sediments is affected by its origin or particle mineralogy specific area has been well recognized as a main modulator of the oc loadings on particle surfaces mayer 1994b bergamaschi et al 1997 strong though variable associations of particulate oc with fine particles are reported in a wide range of fluvial systems keil et al 1997 galy et al 2008 and the qtp rivers fig 5a which are believed to form during prolonged soil pedogenic mayer 1994a or fluvial hydrodynamic processes galy et al 2008 where high specific area allows for a more enriched oc loading and high oc availability in sediments of fine particles in addition to the overall higher oc content fig 4a our analysis further indicates significantly higher soluble oc i e porewater doc and sediment weoc concentrations in fine grained sediments fig 4b and c which showed stronger correlations with fluvial ch4 concentrations than bulk sediment oc fig 3b d higher soluble oc was in contradictory to the theory of a stronger mineral protection effect of fine grained minerals we however argue that this results from an equilibristic dissociation where fine sediments release more oc simply because of their high bulk oc content mayer 1994a keil et al 1997 importantly reductive release of protected oc from redox sensitive minerals e g fe could also play an unignorable role in anoxic sediments adhikari et al 2017 peter and sobek 2018 on the qinghai tibetan plateau the release of fe bound oc along with rising water tables and anerobic sediments has been demonstrated as a main mechanism for enhanced oc release in wetland soils wang et al 2017 in accordance with the strong negative correlations between sediment fe3 and ch4 concentrations observed for the qtp rivers fig 3g earlier research further suggests that the magnitude of fe bound oc release depends on sediment oc to fe oc fe ratio with a significant stimulating effect in sediments with high oc fe ratios e g 3 7 presumably due to the capabilities of oc in securing more reducing conditions and providing substrates for iron reducing microbes adhikari et al 2017 in this analysis we found high sediment oc fe ratios 4 6 2 5 in silt dominated rivers which decreased substantially in sand and gravel dominated rivers 3 1 2 7 and 1 4 0 8 respectively we therefore conclude a stronger reductive oc release and a higher substrate availability promote ch4 production in fine sediment rivers on the plateau fine sediments are further associated with more reduced conditions fig 4d f that favor methanogenesis and suppress ch4 oxidation which together dictate high ch4 production and emission in rivers of finer sediments bodmer et al 2020 hydraulic exchange of oxygenated surface water is the main process responsible for o2 replenishment in hyporheic sediments greig et al 2007 where grain size imposes a major constraint on riverbed permeability and hydraulic exchange rates greig et al 2007 wildhaber et al 2014 the strong negative relationship between flow velocity with sediment silt figure s5a indicates limited fine deposits in rivers of high flow velocity maeck et al 2013 which stimulates hyporheic reaeration in coarser sediments in addition to stream aeration flow velocity also affects do penetration depth in sediments raymond et al 2012 the positive correlation between flow velocity and porewater do figure s5b suggests low flow velocities favor more reduced sediment condition compared with higher flows low o2 exchange and infiltration rates together with a more thorough depletion of alternative teas fig 4d f reduces the magnitude of aerobic ch4 oxidation in rivers of fine sediments sawakuchi et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 we suggest that this effect is further strengthened by higher metabolic rates in fine sediments promoted by enriched substrate availability fig 4a c and prolonged residence time wildhaber et al 2014 which consume o2 and alternative teas at a faster rate in contrast to these effects high hydraulic o2 exchanges often allow for more oxygenated conditions or even result in net ch4 oxidation in rivers of coarser deposits trimmer et al 2010 therefore preferential ch4 production in more reduced fine sediments promotes stronger benthic ch4 production and release in rivers of low velocity and fine riverbed sediment compositions which was also confirmed by the inverse correlation between ebullitive ch4 flux and flow velocity figure s5c lastly fine sediments allow for a denser microbial colonization fig 4g and h which is also believed to be facilitated by high specific area and denser harboring sites on fine particles zhang et al 1998 de falco et al 2004 we show that mcra and pmoa genes increased simultaneously with sediment silt fig 5e and f suggesting both higher ch4 production and oxidation potentials in fine sediments this is explained by the fact that methanotrophy is highly substrate e g ch4 limited shelley et al 2014 where high ch4 concentration promoted its oxidation in fine sediments bodmer et al 2020 the more reduced conditions fig 4d f however shift the balance towards higher net ch4 production in finer sediments trimmer et al 2010 stanley et al 2016 4 2 weak control of sediment properties on co2 emission in comparison to the strong dependence of ch4 emission on riverbed sediment properties co2 emission varied much less significantly across the rivers fig 2b though high concentration gradients from sediment to channel suggest riverbeds act also as a co2 source to overlying waters and the atmosphere trimmer et al 2010 comer warner et al 2019 like ch4 we suggest that higher substrate concentration and microbial colonization promote co2 production in riverbeds of fine sediments see fig 2b co2 as a more thorough end product of benthic metabolism is however affected by additional sources in addition to the simultaneous production by anaerobic acetoclastic methanogenesis bridgham et al 2013 importantly ch4 oxidation either via aerobic routes in shallow surface sediment layers shelley et al 2014 sawakuchi et al 2016 or anaerobic routes mediated by alternative tea reduction liu et al 2020 has been suggested to be a major sink for aquatic ch4 and a source for aquatic co2 though ch4 oxidation was not directly measured in this study we suggest that this effect is also subject to the particle size effect and more pronounced in sediments of coarser grains as has been well demonstrated in earlier studies aiming at ch4 oxidation sanders et al 2007 trimmer et al 2010 shelley et al 2015 additionally light microbe mediated oc mineralization in surface waters cory et al 2014 and high solubility and therefore mobility of co2 might also work to facilitate the homogenization between sediments and surface waters resulting in a weaker dependence on local sediment properties than ch4 therefore multiple pathways for co2 production and significant anaerobic aerobic ch4 to co2 conversions in sediments cory et al 2014 miller et al 2022 result in a weak dependence of river co2 emission on local sediment properties 5 conclusion to conclude we found a strong dependence of fluvial ch4 emission on sediment grain size composition and associated benthic physicochemical properties we suggest that fine particles i e silt in depositional riverbed sediments act as an integral determinant for high substrate availability more reduced conditions and enriched methanogenic archaea communities in sediments all favorable for strengthened ch4 production and emission in fluvial environments the reliance of fluvial co2 emission on riverbed sediment properties was however much weaker because of more generalized production pathways that are not necessarily dependent on small scale local conditions while there are numerous estimates of the magnitude of ch4 emissions from global or qtp rivers none have resolved fine scale variations in the emissions and are therefore uncertain a main hindrance to the effort lies with the difficulty to derive accurate mechanistic understandings that are able to capture drivers at fine spatial scales the findings that fluvial ch4 emissions vary partly in synchrony with riverbed sediment properties may aid in this effort while the biological and chemical processes that dictate aquatic ch4 production and metabolic losses are highly variable sedimentation of eroded martials in fluvial systems is highly predictable and tightly linked to hydrological and geomorphological settings of river channels we therefore believe that the findings here are critical for improving ch4 emissions from either global or regional river networks 6 data availability data used for this analysis can be found at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6907667 credit authorship contribution statement jiao liu

2438,fluvial systems evade massive amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere where stream hydrology and riverbed biogeochemistry imposes important in situ controls current paradigm however lacks an effective framework to account for this effect here we investigated ch4 and co2 emissions from 28 rivers on the qinghai tibetan plateau an area of strong fluvial emissions and high climate sensitivity we found two orders of magnitude higher ch4 fluxes in silt dominated the finest riverbed sediment type than in sand or gravel dominated rivers 1 200 1 290 vs 88 83 and 93 77 μmol m 2 d 1 p

abundance together explained 76 of ch4 emission from the rivers and a higher percentage of porewater 87 than of surface ch4 concentration 69 suggesting a direct control of fluvial ch4 emission by hydrology and sediment properties in these rivers we propose particle size served as an integral proxy for favorable conditions of fluvial ch4 production due to strong dependence of benthic substrates anaerobic conditions and microbial colonization on fine particles the dependence of fluvial co2 emission on riverbed sediment properties was however weak due to multiple production pathways not controlled by sediment anaerobic metabolisms these findings extended our understandings on the important in situ controls of fluvial ch4 and co2 emissions and suggest the possibility of improving the

raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 to decipher processes that dictate the magnitude of in situ greenhouse gas production is a main research objective hotchkiss et al 2015 saunois et al 2016 gomez gener et al 2021 rosentreter et al 2021 as it is not only important for improving estimates of the emission magnitudes saunois et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 but also developing mechanistic understandings of their linkages to terrestrial carbon cycling and atmospheric warming liu et al 2022 this is particularly true for fluvial systems on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp where unparalleled warming during the past decades has triggered dramatic changes to the rivers and terrestrial fluvial interactions in this region yet current understandings of in situ greenhouse gas production in rivers are still poor stanley et al 2016 hampering interpretation of their spatial and temporal variations in the region hyporheic sediments are recognized as hotspots for aquatic carbon cycling due to orders of magnitude higher substrate availability fellows et al 2001 and prolonged substitute residence times findlay 1995 than in overlying waters biogeochemical transformations in hyporheic sediments depend further on the hydrology and riverbed sediment compositions shaped largely by the hydrological and geophysical settings of watersheds keil et al 1997 galy et al 2008 relying on reach scale mass balances or separate benthic flux fellows et al 2001 demonstrate that hyporheic respiration could account for 40 93 of whole ecosystem respiration this observation is consistent with highly elevated co2 concentration often observed in streambed porewaters schindler and krabbenhoft 1998 hlaváčová et al 2005 benthic biogeochemical processes could be a more important control for fluvial ch4 emissions considering methanogenesis is a strictly anaerobic process and benthic sediments as the main site for anaerobiosis bodmer et al 2020 similar to co2 limited earlier measurements have alluded to highly enriched ch4 concentration in sediment porewaters hlaváčová et al 2005 sanders et al 2007 how riverbed sediment composition affects the spatial variations in ch4 production and emission from fluvial channels is however rarely investigated furthermore sediments contribute to surface ch4 emissions via direct gas bubble bursts e g ebullition from sediments a pathway often comparable to or higher than diffusive evasion sawakuchi et al 2014 demonstrating unignorable benthic metabolism in fluvial ch4 budgets despite the progress current understandings of how riverbed metabolism shapes ch4 or co2 emissions in streams and rivers are rudimentary and therefore represent a large knowledge gap in this field the eastern qinghai tibetan plateau qtp rivers are characterized by high ch4 emission rates and ch4 to co2 emission ratios zhang et al 2020 a phenomenon attributed to abundant substrate supplies from local soils and favorable hydrodynamic conditions for ch4 ebullition within the region here we hypothesize that the hydrology and bed sediment composition shape largely the magnitude and spatial variations of ch4 and co2 emissions from rivers through systematic investigations of rivers of different sizes and geophysical settings on eastern qinghai tibetan plateau we aim to demonstrate 1 significant variations of fluvial ch4 and co2 emissions in rivers of contrasting bed sediment compositions 2 important in situ controls of riverbed sediments on ch4 and co2 emission from the rivers 3 underlying mechanisms behind the bed sediment controls of riverine ch4 and co2 emissions in this analysis we first presented the spatial variations of surface porewater ch4 and co2 concentrations and emission rates among rivers of contrasting bed sediment compositions section 3 1 and 3 2 and the key role of fine sediments i e sediment silt in determining substrate availability redox condition and microbial abundances in bed sediments section 3 3 we then discussed mechanisms that lead to strong bed sediment controls on ch4 section 4 1 but rather weak controls on co2 emission section 4 2 from the rivers respectively the results shed light on important within channel controls on ch4 and co2 emissions from fluvial systems and suggest the possibility of developing spatially explicit ch4 emission estimates by relating it to bed sediment properties across the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection we sampled 28 streams and rivers located in five large river basins yellow yangtze lancang nu and yalung zangbo on the eastern qinghai tibetan plateau fig 1 and table s1 during late spring and early summer may june 2021 mean atmospheric temperature was around 15 during the sampling period the sites

flowing water the samples were then transferred to a portable refrigerator 4 until further analysis of physiochemical properties in the lab a total of 24 riverbed sediment samples were also collected by forcing three pvc pipes diameter 4 cm into adjacent sediments at each site sediment samples were then stored under ice until further analysis in lab for sediment porewater collection three piezometers were deployed simultaneously in the river channel for triplicate sample collections porewater at the 15 cm depth below surface sediments were collected the piezometers were made of stainless steel diameter 5 cm within which a silicone tube inner diameter 9 mm was installed and connected to a peristaltic pump for water pumping the first 50 ml porewater was discarded and we took care for the rest of the sampling procedure to avoid strong disturbance to the sediment flow field two portions of porewater were collected the first portion 100 ml was used for dissolved gas analysis

depth and water velocity were measured using a ruler and a portable flowmeter respectively flow velocity ranged from 0 1 to 1 4 m s 1 and wind speed was consistently low 2 m s during the sampling period a portable gps was used to record location and altitude of the sampling sites 2 2 dissolved gas concentration and flux measurements dissolved ch4 and co2 gases were sampled with the headspace equilibration method johnson et al 1990 water samples for dissolved gas analysis were sampled with a 600 ml glass serum bottle equipped with butyl stopper the bottle was immersed 10 cm under water to allow it gently filled with flowing water and sealed underneath with a stopper to avoid entrainment of air bubbles high purity argon was then injected into the bottle to create a 100 ml headspace the bottle was vigorously shaken for 1 min for dissolved gases to equilibrate the headspace gas sample was then transferred to a 150 ml pre vacuumed air bag for lab analysis by using a gas chromatography

µmol l according to the henry s law to sample dissolved gases in porewaters a 100 ml syringe was used instead and a 30 ml headspace was created ch4 and co2 fluxes were measured in situ and a static flux chamber h 0 6 m was deployed on the river surface connecting with an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer los gatos research 907 0011 abb canada ch4 and co2 concentrations in ppmv were recorded

fluctuations a clear pattern emerged where the highest surface water ch4 concentration and fluxes were found in silt dominated rivers figures s1 s2 fig 2 the finest sediment type found among the surveyed qtp rivers ch4 concentration was on average one order of magnitude higher in silt dominated rivers 281 315 nmol l than in sand or gravel dominated rivers 24 20 and 48 60 nmol l respectively p

due probably to more favorable conditions for bubble formation and eruptive ch4 emissions in fine grained sediments liu et al 2018 the clear differences highlight riverbed sediment composition as a critical factor affecting the magnitude of ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers sediment porewater ch4 concentration was on average 31 folds that in surface waters 4299 vs 136 nmol l fig 2a the high concentration gradient supports the idea of benthic anaerobic metabolism as a strong ch4 source to overlying waters schindler and krabbenhoft 1998 hlaváčová et al 2005 table s2 in comparison to surface waters the magnitude of difference in porewater ch4 concentration was even more significant among the sediment types to illustrate porewater ch4 concentration in the silt dominated rivers was on average 18 195 folds that in the sand or gravel dominated riverbeds 9770 11200 vs 50 30 and 550 850 nmol l p 0 05 fig 2a in comparison to the 6 12 fold difference in surface water ch4 we found remarkably strong correlations between porewater ch4 concentration and sediment silt r2 0 30 p 0 01 fig 3 a and table s3 suggesting the importance of silty sediment on ch4 production in riverbed sediments additionally high ch4 concentration and evasion fluxes were also found in rivers of high oc substrates as indicated by the multiple positive correlations between benthic oc contents sediment oc porewater doc and sediment weoc and ch4 concentrations evasion fluxes r2 0 11 0 34 p 0 05 0 01 fig 3b d table s3 it is important to point out that the correlations between porewater doc or sediment weoc and ch4 were generally stronger than between sediment oc and ch4 r2 0 26 0 34 vs r2 0 11 0 16 suggesting freely dissolved oc as a more bioavailable substrate for ch4 metabolism in benthic sediments than oc protected by particle minerals hlaváčová et al 2005 buriankova et al 2013 in comparison the correlations between surface water doc and ch4 were much weaker or insignificant p 0 05 table s3 in contrast to the impacts of sediment oc contents strong negative correlations were found between do and ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 14 0 23 fig 3e table s3 suggesting stronger ch4 emission in less oxygenated rivers additionally sediment fe3 and nitrate contents showed strong negative correlations with ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 50 0 58 and 0 22 0 27 respectively fig 3f and g figures s3 and s4 and table s3 implying fe3 and nitrate as the possible main alternative terminal electron acceptor tea modulators for anaerobic ch4 oxidation in the qtp rivers though mechanisms responsible for ch4 oxidation in the rivers need to be further resolved lastly both mcra and pmoa gene abundances were positively correlated with ch4 concentration emission fluxes r2 0 14 0

emission in contrast to the order of magnitude 10 times higher ch4 in silty sediment rivers surface water co2 concentration was comparable among the three sediment types 35 4 18 6 μmol l vs 56 0 92 7 and 27 2 9 3 μmol l p 0 05 fig 2b similarly though surface co2 evasion flux was overall the highest in silt dominated rivers 98 3 250 6 versus 27 5 51 8 and 12 5 7 6 mmol m 2 d 1 figures s1 s2 fig 2d the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 and much smaller than that of ch4 emissions 3 8 vs 13 14 folds fig 2c and e this suggests riverbed sediment grain size was not a strong predictor for spatial variations in surface water co2 concentration or emission flux across the rivers in line with the weak to insignificant correlations p 0 05 between the various sediment properties weoc porewater do fe3 and surface water co2 concentration flux figures s3 and s4 table s3 except a positive correlation was found between surface water doc concentration and co2 flux table s3 indicating the existence of other possible co2 production pathways in water columns besides preferential anaerobic and aerobic co2 respiration in riverbed sediments in contrast to ch4 none of the sediment properties were retained in the stepwise regression models for co2 flux and the best predictors for co2 flux variation were surface water doc and temperature table s5 porewater co2 concentration was on average five folds that in surface waters 201 versus 39 μmol l fig 2b and highly correlated with porewater ch4 concentration r2 0 45 p 0 01 figure s3 table s3 in line with the idea of ch4 oxidation as part of the sediment co2 sources trimmer et al 2010 in contrast to surface waters porewater co2 concentration was significantly higher in silt dominated rivers than in sand or gravel dominated rivers 411 7 764 5 vs 49 5 16 8 and 42 4 6 4 μmol l p 0 01 fig 2b though the difference was not as large as for ch4 8 10 vs 18 195 times similar to porewater ch4 a high correlation between sediment silt and porewater co2 r2 0 26 p 0 01 was identified figure s3 suggesting a similar direct impact of fine sediments on porewater co2 3 3 sediment physicochemical properties measurements of benthic oc contents sediment oc weoc and porewater doc were the highest in silt dominated rivers intermediate in sand dominated rivers and lowest in gravel dominated rivers p 0 05 figure s2 fig 4 a c in contrast porewater do was significantly lower in silt dominated than in sand or gravel dominated sediments 3 6 vs 4 5 4 6 mg l p 0 01 suggesting the more permeable gravel and sandy riverbeds were more oxygenated strong negative correlation between porewater do and sediment silt was identified r 0 43 p 0 05 table s3 suggesting fine sediments promote anoxia additionally though the amount of hcl extractable fe was comparable among the three sediment types 7 2 9 8 g kg 1 p 0 05 fe ii increased whereas fe iii decreased from gravel to silty sediments fig 4f the systematic variation in dominant fe forms together with low porewater do suggest more reduced redox conditions in silt dominated sediments which favor methanogenesis and suppress methanotrophy bodmer et al 2020 a strong negative relationship between flow velocity with sediment silt figure s5a indicating limited fine deposits in rivers with higher flow velocity significant positive correlations between sediment oc porewater doc weoc and sediment silt were identified r2 0 2 0 28 p 0 05 0 001 fig 5 a c table s3 suggesting a high dependence of benthic oc contents on sediment particle size furthermore the correlation between weoc and sediment silt was stronger than those between sediment oc and silt 0 63 versus 0 51 fig 5b and c table s3 probably caused by a stronger release of mineral bound oc in the more anoxic silt sediments adhikari et al 2017 both mcra and pmoa gene abundances in silt dominated rivers on average were one magnitude order greater than those of sand or gravel dominated rivers fig 4g h positive correlations between sediment silt with both mcra and pmoa gene abundances were observed r2 0 12 0 17 p 0 05 0 01 fig 5e and f table s3 suggesting a major control of sediment particle size on ch4 related microbial abundances additionally as a process depending highly upon substrate availability methanotrophy and therefore the growth of methanotrophic microbes were promoted in fine sediments shelley et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 the gene abundances were also correlated with sediment weoc r 0 71 0 77 porewater doc concentration r 0 43 0 56 sediment oc r 0 42 0 50 and temperature r 0 46 0 61 table s3 suggesting a direct impact of benthic oc and thermodynamics on ch4 related gene abundances and metabolisms in sediments shelley et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2019 3 4 a hierarchal effect of sediment grain size on ch4 production and emission from the rivers based on the above observations we proposed a structural equation model sem to highlight the hierarchal effects of sediment grain size on sediment properties and then ch4 production and release from the qtp rivers fig 6 we show that the amount of oc substrates hydraulic exchanges redox conditions and microbial abundances were all related to particle size composition of riverbed sediments in particular sediment silt content imposes positive impacts on sediment oc contents with standardized path coefficient of 0 53 0 61 see below and mcra gene abundance 0 74 and negative impacts on hydraulic exchanges do and fe3 0 28 with together created favorable benthic conditions for ch4 production and emission in fine sediment rivers stepwise multilinear regression models were established using the various sediment properties as predicting variables which explained 69 87 and 76 of the variations in surface water ch4 concentration porewater ch4 concentration and ch4 fluxes from the qtp rivers fig 3j l table s4 among the sediment properties sediment weoc and fe3 contents porewater do and methanogenic gene abundance were most often retained variables during the stepwise regression processes table s4 suggesting a direct impact of these factors on benthic ch4 metabolisms fig 6 additionally we retained sediment silt as a key factor in the regression models considering its effects on the series of sediment properties fig 5 the high explaining capacity of these variables supports a major riverbed sediment control on ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers in contrast multilinear regression models established for co2 were generally much weaker and explained 55 of the porewater co2 variations table s5 the following formulas can be used to explain ch4 and co2 concentration and flux using measured values through stepwise regression model 8 p o r e w a t e r c h 4 c o

rivers our results support the proposition of a strong riverbed sediment control on ch4 emissions from the qtp rivers figs 6 and 7 ch4 production in sediments depends highly on the amount and composition of substrates wilkinson et al 2015 and fine sediments are frequently associated with higher oc content sanders et al 2007 sawakuchi et al 2014 crawford et al 2017 though particulate oc of fluvial sediments is affected by its origin or particle mineralogy specific area has been well recognized as a main modulator of the oc loadings on particle surfaces mayer 1994b bergamaschi et al 1997 strong though variable associations of particulate oc with fine particles are reported in a wide range of fluvial systems keil et al 1997 galy et al 2008 and the qtp rivers fig 5a which are believed to form during prolonged soil pedogenic mayer 1994a or fluvial hydrodynamic processes galy et al 2008 where high specific area allows for a more enriched oc loading and high oc availability in sediments of fine particles in addition to the overall higher oc content fig 4a our analysis further indicates significantly higher soluble oc i e porewater doc and sediment weoc concentrations in fine grained sediments fig 4b and c which showed stronger correlations with fluvial ch4 concentrations than bulk sediment oc fig 3b d higher soluble oc was in contradictory to the theory of a stronger mineral protection effect of fine grained minerals we however argue that this results from an equilibristic dissociation where fine sediments release more oc simply because of their high bulk oc content mayer 1994a keil et al 1997 importantly reductive release of protected oc from redox sensitive minerals e g fe could also play an unignorable role in anoxic sediments adhikari et al 2017 peter and sobek 2018 on the qinghai tibetan plateau the release of fe bound oc along with rising water tables and anerobic sediments has been demonstrated as a main mechanism for enhanced oc release in wetland soils wang et al 2017 in accordance with the strong negative correlations between sediment fe3 and ch4 concentrations observed for the qtp rivers fig 3g earlier research further suggests that the magnitude of fe bound oc release depends on sediment oc to fe oc fe ratio with a significant stimulating effect in sediments with high oc fe ratios e g 3 7 presumably due to the capabilities of oc in securing more reducing conditions and providing substrates for iron reducing microbes adhikari et al 2017 in this analysis we found high sediment oc fe ratios 4 6 2 5 in silt dominated rivers which decreased substantially in sand and gravel dominated rivers 3 1 2 7 and 1 4 0 8 respectively we therefore conclude a stronger reductive oc release and a higher substrate availability promote ch4 production in fine sediment rivers on the plateau fine sediments are further associated with more reduced conditions fig 4d f that favor methanogenesis and suppress ch4 oxidation which together dictate high ch4 production and emission in rivers of finer sediments bodmer et al 2020 hydraulic exchange of oxygenated surface water is the main process responsible for o2 replenishment in hyporheic sediments greig et al 2007 where grain size imposes a major constraint on riverbed permeability and hydraulic exchange rates greig et al 2007 wildhaber et al 2014 the strong negative relationship between flow velocity with sediment silt figure s5a indicates limited fine deposits in rivers of high flow velocity maeck et al 2013 which stimulates hyporheic reaeration in coarser sediments in addition to stream aeration flow velocity also affects do penetration depth in sediments raymond et al 2012 the positive correlation between flow velocity and porewater do figure s5b suggests low flow velocities favor more reduced sediment condition compared with higher flows low o2 exchange and infiltration rates together with a more thorough depletion of alternative teas fig 4d f reduces the magnitude of aerobic ch4 oxidation in rivers of fine sediments sawakuchi et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 we suggest that this effect is further strengthened by higher metabolic rates in fine sediments promoted by enriched substrate availability fig 4a c and prolonged residence time wildhaber et al 2014 which consume o2 and alternative teas at a faster rate in contrast to these effects high hydraulic o2 exchanges often allow for more oxygenated conditions or even result in net ch4 oxidation in rivers of coarser deposits trimmer et al 2010 therefore preferential ch4 production in more reduced fine sediments promotes stronger benthic ch4 production and release in rivers of low velocity and fine riverbed sediment compositions which was also confirmed by the inverse correlation between ebullitive ch4 flux and flow velocity figure s5c lastly fine sediments allow for a denser microbial colonization fig 4g and h which is also believed to be facilitated by high specific area and denser harboring sites on fine particles zhang et al 1998 de falco et al 2004 we show that mcra and pmoa genes increased simultaneously with sediment silt fig 5e and f suggesting both higher ch4 production and oxidation potentials in fine sediments this is explained by the fact that methanotrophy is highly substrate e g ch4 limited shelley et al 2014 where high ch4 concentration promoted its oxidation in fine sediments bodmer et al 2020 the more reduced conditions fig 4d f however shift the balance towards higher net ch4 production in finer sediments trimmer et al 2010 stanley et al 2016 4 2 weak control of sediment properties on co2 emission in comparison to the strong dependence of ch4 emission on riverbed sediment properties co2 emission varied much less significantly across the rivers fig 2b though high concentration gradients from sediment to channel suggest riverbeds act also as a co2 source to overlying waters and the atmosphere trimmer et al 2010 comer warner et al 2019 like ch4 we suggest that higher substrate concentration and microbial colonization promote co2 production in riverbeds of fine sediments see fig 2b co2 as a more thorough end product of benthic metabolism is however affected by additional sources in addition to the simultaneous production by anaerobic acetoclastic methanogenesis bridgham et al 2013 importantly ch4 oxidation either via aerobic routes in shallow surface sediment layers shelley et al 2014 sawakuchi et al 2016 or anaerobic routes mediated by alternative tea reduction liu et al 2020 has been suggested to be a major sink for aquatic ch4 and a source for aquatic co2 though ch4 oxidation was not directly measured in this study we suggest that this effect is also subject to the particle size effect and more pronounced in sediments of coarser grains as has been well demonstrated in earlier studies aiming at ch4 oxidation sanders et al 2007 trimmer et al 2010 shelley et al 2015 additionally light microbe mediated oc mineralization in surface waters cory et al 2014 and high solubility and therefore mobility of co2 might also work to facilitate the homogenization between sediments and surface waters resulting in a weaker dependence on local sediment properties than ch4 therefore multiple pathways for co2 production and significant anaerobic aerobic ch4 to co2 conversions in sediments cory et al 2014 miller et al 2022 result in a weak dependence of river co2 emission on local sediment properties 5 conclusion to conclude we found a strong dependence of fluvial ch4 emission on sediment grain size composition and associated benthic physicochemical properties we suggest that fine particles i e silt in depositional riverbed sediments act as an integral determinant for high substrate availability more reduced conditions and enriched methanogenic archaea communities in sediments all favorable for strengthened ch4 production and emission in fluvial environments the reliance of fluvial co2 emission on riverbed sediment properties was however much weaker because of more generalized production pathways that are not necessarily dependent on small scale local conditions while there are numerous estimates of the magnitude of ch4 emissions from global or qtp rivers none have resolved fine scale variations in the emissions and are therefore uncertain a main hindrance to the effort lies with the difficulty to derive accurate mechanistic understandings that are able to capture drivers at fine spatial scales the findings that fluvial ch4 emissions vary partly in synchrony with riverbed sediment properties may aid in this effort while the biological and chemical processes that dictate aquatic ch4 production and metabolic losses are highly variable sedimentation of eroded martials in fluvial systems is highly predictable and tightly linked to hydrological and geomorphological settings of river channels we therefore believe that the findings here are critical for improving ch4 emissions from either global or regional river networks 6 data availability data used for this analysis can be found at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6907667 credit authorship contribution statement jiao liu

2439,flood disaster is more serious in coastal cities due to the combined impact of rainfall and tides accurate assessment of coastal flood risk is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation under changing environment the objective of the study is to propose an integrated framework for future flood risk assessment by bayesian based time varying model and expected annual damage ead in the coastal city to decrease the uncertainty of non stationary frequency bayesian model averaging bma and time varying parameter distribution tvpd models were employed to establish the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides and copula function was adopted to determine the joint and co occurrence probability subsequently to reflect flooding probability and inundation damage simultaneously the ead was applied to quantify flood risk by copula function and hydrodynamic model the variation and uncertainty of flood risk were also investigated under changing environment taking haidian island in hainan province china as a case study the results show that the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides can be appropriately derived based on bma and tvpd models the joint and co occurrence probabilities increase significantly under non stationary scenario with the average rates of 33 22 and 64 82 respectively moreover the ead will be underestimated by 20 56 69 84 in 2030 2060 year without considering non stationarity and the uncertainty of ead rises with the increase of the design year the approach and result of our study can help decision makers evaluate the future flood risk in the coastal city and provide support for sustainable flood management to adapt the climate change keywords flood risk non stationarity time varying model coastal city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal cities face multiple drivers of flooding like heavy rainfall high tides and so on jang et al 2022 when different drivers occur simultaneously the risk and severity of flooding would be enlarged zheng et al 2014 ganguli and merz 2019 which can cause serious social and economic losses wahl et al 2015 watson et al 2018 liu et al 2022 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change s sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 extreme rainfall and tides are expected to show an upward trend under future climate change and coastal flood risk will be exacerbated due to the driving processes of rainfall and tides fang et al 2021 moreover coastal cities will be further developed in the future especially in china resulting in more people and property being exposed to flood risk therefore quantitative assessment of future flood risk caused by rainfall and tides under non stationary scenarios is of great significance to flood management in coastal cities traditional hydrological frequency analysis assumes that the hydrological sequence is stationary however rising global temperatures bring a raise about the occurrence probability and magnitude of severe hydrological events yilmaz et al 2014 and the design values based on the stationary hydrological frequency may be underestimated under future scenarios in recent years studies on non stationary frequency analysis have gradually increased due to increasing attention to climate change call et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2019 jimenez u et al 2022 and commonly used methods include global climate model gcm her et al 2019 k nearest neighbor weather generator knn agilan and umamahesh 2016 and time varying parameter distribution tvpd model xu et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2022 among them the tvpd model assumes that the distribution parameters change with the time and has been widely applied to various hydrological events condon et al 2015 deng et al 2019 li et al 2019 ju et al 2021 hu et al 2022 for instance li et al 2019 established a time varying generalized extreme value gev model and investigated the non stationary frequency of extreme rainfall ju et al 2021 proposed a non stationary drought identification method through the time varying gamma distribution which was fully utilized in the jinsha river basin china many studies have demonstrated that the tvpd model can well characterize the non stationarity of hydrological time series in the process of constructing the tvpd model the selection of distribution parameters varying with time is a crucial step yilmaz et al 2014 adopted the exponential function to describe the scale parameter of generalized pareto distribution gpd varying with time and investigated the potential impact of climate change on extreme rainfall nie et al 2021 selected the location parameter of the gev model to vary with time and evaluated the multivariate drought risks in wei river basin china under non stationary assumption ossandón et al 2021 built a linear function of the location scale and shape parameters of the gev model and obtained the non stationary frequency distribution of rainfall however most previous studies have directly assumed that certain parameters of the distribution function vary with time mailhot and duchesne 2009 cheng et al 2014 zheng et al 2015 xu et al 2020 ignoring the uncertainty caused by the selection of varying parameter when the distribution function has several parameters e g location scale and shape parameters of gev model which one should be selected to vary with time and how to describe the trend of the varying parameter e g linearly or exponentially with time have become important issues to the best of our knowledge few studies have focused on the above issues the unreasonable selection of varying parameter would increase the uncertainty in hydrological frequency analysis under non stationary scenarios schoniger et al 2014 enemark et al 2019 different selection of varying parameters corresponds to different non stationary models the bayesian model averaging bma method plays an important role in multi model fusion which maximizes the advantages of each model structure thus provides more accurate simulation values and evaluates the uncertainty of multi model combination simulation hoge et al 2020 yan et al 2022 it gives the final model the highest accuracy and decreases the uncertainty caused by model selection this study explores the non stationary frequency of rainfall and tides by integrating the tvpd model and bma method to reduce the influences of uncertainty the above studies mainly focused on the univariate frequency analysis under non stationary scenarios whereas coastal flooding is known to be influenced by a combination of rainfall and tides zheng et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 considered the rainfall extremes and tides simultaneously to estimate coastal flooding risk firstly and subsequently numerous analyses have reported the combined effect of rainfall and tides at global nicholls et al 2021 continental bevacqua et al 2019 national fang et al 2021 and local xu et al 2022 scales it is therefore preferable to develop a bivariate joint distribution to simulate the occurrence frequency of rainfall and tides copula function is widely used in the bivariate joint distribution model since it does not require the same marginal distribution between variables das et al 2020 and the model can well quantify the joint and co occurrence probability risk of flood events zhou et al 2019 zellou and rahali 2019 balistrocchi and grossi 2020 obtained the co occurrence probability of rainfall and storm surge in coastal low lying areas through copula function copula function was also further introduced into urban drainage model to predict flood risk change caused by climate change karamouz et al 2020 besides in recent years the hydrodynamic model was also applied to evaluate the flood risk caused by rainfall and tides in coastal cities kumbier et al 2018 bass and bedient 2018 for instance xu et al 2022 applied the hydrodynamic model to simulate the inundation area and depth of rainfall and tides in haikou city china the hydrodynamic model could obtain the inundation extent and depth for different combinations of rainfall and tides which is useful for flood prevention and management rong et al 2020 however there are still a few shortcomings of the copula function and hydrodynamic model for flood risk assessment for example the copula function only reflects the occurrence possibility of flood and does not consider the flood inundation loss the hydrodynamic model visualizes the flood inundation while the occurrence probability of flood is ignored so far future flood risk and its uncertainty analysis especially considering flooding probability and inundation losses simultaneously are still scarce in coastal cities in this study we adopted the expected annual damage i e ead method to analyze the flood risk of rainfall and tides and evaluated the influence and uncertainty of flood risk under changing environment the objective of the study is to propose an integrated framework for future flood risk assessment by bayesian based time varying model and expected annual damage considering non stationarity and uncertainty in the coastal city the main contributions are summarized as follows a an integrated approach based on bma and tvpd model was proposed to establish non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides and reduce the uncertainty of time varying model selection under changing environment b to reflect the flooding probability and damage simultaneously the ead was applied to quantify the flood risk and the variation and uncertainty of ead were investigated under non stationary state c we explored the combined influence of rainfall and tides on flood damage and the contribution of different combinations of rainfall and tides to ead the rest paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods of the study section 3 describes the study area and the used data section 4 discusses the main results section 5 draws the main conclusion 2 methods the study framework is presented in fig 1 first the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides were obtained by integrating of tvpd model and bma method the weight of bma was determined by expected maximum em algorithm and the uncertainty was evaluated by the monte carlo method second the copula function was applied to determine the joint and co occurrence probability for given combined rainfall and tide events and the influence of non stationarity was investigated third the urban flood inundation model was used to simulate the flooding depth and build up the flood damage grid of combined rainfall and tide events final the ead was calculated based on the occurrence probability and corresponding flood damage and was adopted for quantifying the variation and uncertainty of flood risk under changing environment 2 1 non stationary distribution and uncertainty analysis 2 1 1 time varying parameter distribution model the parameters of hydrological series are usually obtained by fitting the existing historical hydrological series and remain the constant in the stationary scenario however the hydrological series will be affected by the climate change human activities and so on the tvpd model is an effective way to describe hydrological characteristics in changing environment which has been widely applied in non stationary frequency analysis of rainfall sugahara et al 2009 flood xu et al 2022 drought nie et al 2021 and other fields it assumes that the parameters change with time shown in fig 2 thus reflecting the effect of climate change on variables for example the formula of time varying gev distribution is as follows eq 1 bender et al 2014 most of literatures considered the location parameter varying with time shang et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2015 however climate change has destroyed the stationarity of the hydrological series all parameters that describe the average value and variability of distributions may change over time recently some literatures have begun to consider the scale and shape parameter varying with time to comprehensively reflect the non stationarity of hydrological series gilroy and mccuen 2012 yilmaz et al 2014 ju et al 2021 ossandón et al 2021 therefore all parameters were chosen to establish time varying model in this study 1 f x μ t σ t δ t e x p 1 δ t x μ t σ t 1 δ t where μ t σ t δ t represent location scale and shape parameter vary with time respectively 2 1 2 bayesian model averaging the bayesian model averaging bma is a common method for obtaining a composite value by weighting the calculated values of different models dong et al 2011 the bma can fully ensure that the optimal model has the largest weight when weighting and evaluates the uncertainty of multi model combination simulation in this paper different time varying marginal distribution models are set up and the frequency distributions of different models are weighted by bma to obtain the comprehensive frequency distribution that is non stationary marginal distributions suppose y is the simulation variable of the multi model d r t is the measured data and f f 1 f 2 f k is the set of k model simulations the probability density distribution function of the bma simulated variable y is 2 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d k 1 k ω k f k where p y d is the non stationary distributions p f k d is the posterior probability of the kth model which is actually the weight ω k of the time varying distribution models the higher the accuracy of the model the larger the corresponding weight value and the sum of all weight values is 1 p k y f k d is the probability distribution of different models given f k and measured data expected maximum em algorithm is adopted to derive the weights in the bma the em algorithm assumes that the model sequences satisfy the normal distribution therefore box cox function is used to carry out normal transformation of measured sequence and simulation sequence of each model before em algorithm is applied the em algorithm mainly establishes a hidden variable to assist in calculating the weight values and iterates repeatedly using expectation and maximization steps until the two calculated likelihood function interpolations meet the error requirements and obtain the maximum likelihood value the weight ω k and the error σ k 2 are obtained by the em algorithm then the monte carlo sample method is used to generate the simulated value of each hydrological value to deduce the uncertainty interval of the simulated sequence bilmes 1998 in this paper 1000 samples were selected for each hydrological value and the prediction value between 5 and 95 quantile was determined 2 2 bivariate joint distribution based on copula function the copula theory was proposed by sklar in 1959 sklar 1959 the advantage of the copula function is that the variables are not required to have the same marginal distribution during the construction process according to the sklar theory h r t is a bivariate joint distribution with marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 a copula function c u v exists to make 3 h r t c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 we choose two archimedean copula functions i e gumbel copula frank copula and two elliptic copula functions i e gaussian copula student s t copula to build the bivariate joint distribution model of rainfall and tides the candidate copula functions are described in table 1 the akaike information criterion aic and ordinary least squares ols are applied to select the best fit function which are defined as follows 4 aic 2 n l n 1 n ρ ρ e 2 2 γ 5 ols 1 n ρ ρ e 2 where ρ is the theoretical frequency ρ e is the empirical frequency n is the number of samples γ is the number of variables the smaller the aic and ols values the better the fitting effect kolmogorov smirnov ks test is used to judge whether the function is available and the test statistic z is defined as follow 6 z m a x c k i n c k i 1 n where c k is the theoretical distribution of samples i is the serial number of samples in ascending order when the test statistic z is less than the critical test value the test is accepted in this study the joint and co occurrence probability are selected to describe the probability of combined rainfall and tide events the probability that rainfall r and tides t have a variable exceeding a certain magnitude is called joint probability denoted as p or 7 p or p r r t t 1 h r t the probability that both rainfall r and tides t exceed a certain magnitude is called the co occurrence probability denoted as p and 8 p and p r r t t 1 f 1 r f 2 t h r t 2 3 urban flood inundation model personal computer storm water management model pcswmm is adopted to establish the urban flood inundation model in this study which is a hydrological and hydrodynamic model developed by the canadian computational hydraulics institute chi based on the swmm model the reliability and availability of the pcswmm model have been verified and fully utilized in many countries such as the united states panos et al 2021 china xu et al 2020 italy pilotti et al 2021 etc a variety of hydrological processes including surface runoff infiltration and flood evolution can be simulated james et al 2010 the urban flood inundation model includes one dimension 1d drainage model and two dimension 2d surface drainage model the 1d drainage model refers to the urban drainage network and river drainage system and the 2d surface drainage model simulates the flow on the ground the pcswmm model provides two approaches for coupling 1d and 2d drainage model including using orifice connections and direct 1d 2d node connections and the orifice connection approach is selected in this study the hydrodynamic calculation adopts the dynamic wave method and the calculation formula is as follows 9 q m a t 0 10 ga h m m q 2 a q t g a s f 0 where a represents cross section area over water m2 h represents water depth m represents distance along the conduit q represents flow rate t represents time s f represents friction slope and g represents gravity acceleration 2 4 expected annual damage expected annual damage ead is a widely adopted metric of flood risk koks et al 2019 this is obtained by multiplying the damage function of simulated events by the relative probability that is the comprehensive reflection of the consequences and possibilities caused by the events adnan et al 2020 general its calculation formula is 11 ead f 0 d f d f where ead is the expected annual damage d f is the flood damage caused by the flood events with occurrence frequency f in our work we evaluate the flood risk caused by combined rainfall and tide events therefore the flood damage is estimated by double integral method eq 12 to simplify the integration calculation we choose to simulate enough combination events of rainfall and tides couasnon et al 2022 the probability mass function of each event is multiplied by the corresponding flood damage finally sum the results to obtain the ead 12 ead r t d r t f r t d x d y where d r t is the damage from given rainfall and tides and f r t is the probability density function corresponding to rainfall and tides 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the proposed framework was applied in haidian island which is located in the northern of haikou city hainan province china haidian island has a tropical maritime monsoon climate with a rainfall of 2067 mm year and an average annual temperature of 24 3 c chen et al 2018 due to the specificity of the location haidian island is surrounded by the qiongzhou strait and nandu river see fig 3 and is frequently damaged by severe typhoons meanwhile the average elevation is low and the terrain is flat which makes it vulnerable to floods xu et al 2018a b xu et al 2020 haidian island is a highly urbanized area and the island includes many campuses residential and commercial areas with a relatively large percentage of impervious area which can cause serious economic and social losses once urban flooding is generated the study data mainly consists of three parts the first part is the historical rainfall and tides data used for building bivariate joint probability model the second part is the basic data for constructing the urban flood inundation model including digital elevation model dem data drainage network data and river cross section data the third part is the rainfall and tide data of typhoon rammaun and the observed data of water depth the sources and main uses of the above data are as follows the daily rainfall and tides data from 1974 to 2012 was provided by haikou municipal water bureau the annual maximum rainfall and corresponding tides were selected for the construction of marginal and joint probability distributions of rainfall and tides dem data was used to construct the 2d model in urban flood inundation model and it was obtained from the resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx drainage network data and river data were used to construct the 1d drainage model in urban flood inundation model which were provided by haikou municipal water bureau the rainfall and tides process data of typhoon rammasun in july 2014 and the observed data of water depth are the basic of calibration model parameters the observed data of water depth were collected through field investigation and provided by haikou municipal water bureau since we were undertaking flood and tide control planning project of haikou city during typhoon rammasun 3 2 selection of marginal distribution in this section four commonly used functions that is gev lognorm norm and gamma were adopted for determining the marginal distributions of rainfall and tides the parameters of marginal distributions were derived from maximum likelihood estimation the ks test was chosen for fitting test and the fitting quality of distribution function was evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse relative error re ols and aic fig 4 shows the fitting comparison between the candidate marginal distributions and empirical distribution and table 2 lists the evaluation values in the ks test the number of samples is 39 and the critical value of the significance level α 0 05 is 0 2178 frank and massey 2012 as shown in table 2 the all functions have passed the test for the evaluation of goodness of fit the nse of gev function is larger than the other three functions and re ols aic values are the minimum it reveals that the gev function is the best fit distribution of rainfall and tides 3 3 establishment and calibration of urban flood inundation model 3 3 1 model establishment the structure procedure of pcswmm model includes 1d 2d model construction and model parameter calibration the final model contains 2071 1d junctions 2038 conduits 23 580 2d cells and 13 sub catchments the drainage network and river data were processed by arcgis and then were imported into the pcswmm to generate the 1d drainage model after the 1d model was built 2d cells was constructed from the dem data and the boundary range of the study area the cell is hexagon with resolution of 25 m roughness of 0 085 and sampling factor of 3 finally the 1d and 2d model was coupled through orifices shown in fig 5 in addition horton model was selected as the infiltration model and the flood process was simulated by the dynamic wave method 3 3 2 model parameter calibration the parameters of the urban flood inundation model were calibrated by the observations during typhoon rammasun in july 2014 the rainfall and tide processes data were applied for boundary conditions of the urban flood inundation model the observed and simulated depths at different observation points were shown in fig 6 due to the limitation of data accuracy such as terrain the simulated depth cannot be completely consistent with the observed depth however in general the error values between the simulated and observed depth of each observation point are small the relative error is less than 15 and the nse is 0 73 thus the model is considered acceptable for urban flooding simulation dechmi et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides 4 1 1 selection of varying parameters in tvpd models fig 7 shows the variation trend of distribution parameters obtained by accumulating historical rainfall and tide data which were fitted by the levenberg marquardt algorithm as shown in fig 7c and fig 7e the trends of the shape parameter of rainfall and the scale parameter of tides are not significant and the correlation coefficients r2 are lower than 0 4 therefore these two parameters are not considered in tvpd models for other four distribution parameters the correlation coefficients between fitted models and parameter values all exceed 0 7 which indicates that the fitted models are reasonable the linear and exponential fitted models are presented in fig 7 location and scale parameters of rainfall show an upward trend the location parameter of tides shows an increasing trend while the shape parameter presents a downward trend meanwhile the prediction interval between 5 and 95 surrounds the time series of parameters and reflects all the possibilities of parameter changes thus can reasonably characterize the uncertainty of time varying models shown in fig 7 4 1 2 bma weights and tvpd models of rainfall and tides different time varying distribution models were set up based on variation trends of distribution parameters in section 4 1 1 for rainfall model ⅰ the location parameter changes with time while the scale and shape parameters remain unchanged model ⅱ the location and scale parameters change with time while the shape parameter remains unchanged for tides model ⅰ the location parameter changes with time while the scale and shape parameters remain unchanged model ⅱ the location and shape parameters change with time while the scale parameter remains unchanged table 3 presents the bma weights of different models which were obtained by the em algorithm we obviously find that the weight of model ⅱ is greater than that of model ⅰ indicating that model ⅱ has greater contribution to the non stationary distribution model the bma method ensures that better time varying models have higher weights making the final non stationary distribution model more reasonable to test the validity of the bayesian based tvpd model we used historical rainfall and tide data during 1974 2003 years to establish the non stationary models which were adopted to predict the rainfall and tide in 2012 year fig 8 illustrates the non stationary distribution and prediction interval between 5 and 95 of rainfall and tides on the whole the non stationary distribution and empirical distribution of rainfall and tides are well fitted indicating that the method is reasonable the prediction interval characterizes the uncertainty of bma simulation results the prediction interval between 5 and 95 surrounds the distribution models which already reflect all the results of the bma simulation greater rainfall and tides with greater uncertainty are derived from changes in the bandwidth of the interval 4 1 3 variation of univariate probability under non stationary state fig 9 presents the exceedance probability of rainfall and tides under stationary and non stationary state in 2030 based on the bayesian based tvpd model overall compared with the stationary state the exceedance probability of rainfall and tides increases significantly under the non stationary state among them the increase rate of rainfall rises with the increase of rainfall and the average increase rate is 61 09 comparing with stationary state the increase rate of tides is weaker than that of rainfall and the average increase rate of tides is 15 08 the maximum increase rate is 31 11 and the corresponding tide is 2 82 m thus these indicate that the changing environment will affect the occurrence probability of heavy rainfall and high tide obviously and further enhancing the probability of flood 4 2 variation and uncertainty of joint and co occurrence probability under non stationary state 4 2 1 bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides four copula functions were adopted to establish the bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides as presented in table 4 all copula functions have passed the ks test with the significance level of 0 05 and the aic and ols values of frank copula are the minimum values thus frank copula is selected as the optimal function besides as shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient r2 between theoretical and empirical distribution is 0 979 indicating that the frank copula is optimally applicable to characterize the dependence between rainfall and tides under non stationary state 4 2 2 variation of the joint and co occurrence probability fig 11 a and fig 11b illustrates the increase value and increase rate in joint probability under given combinations of rainfall and tides respectively considering the uncertainty of the non stationary distribution the bounds of 5 and 95 of the increase value are also presented in fig 11 subparts ii and iii as a whole the increase values decrease as the increase of rainfall and tides due to the low probability of heavy rainfall and high tides see fig 11a however the increase rates gradually rise when the rainfall and tides increase shown in fig 11b the average increase rate is 33 22 and the maximum increase rate is 74 72 the fig 11b subparts ii and iii show the uncertainty of combined events of rainfall and tides caused by non stationary distributions the average increase rates of the 5 and 95 bounds are 18 97 and 48 59 respectively the increase values of co occurrence probability decrease as the increase of rainfall and tides shown in fig 12 a which is consistent with the change trend of the joint probability the increase rate is more obvious in heavy rainfall and high tides with an average value of 64 82 and a maximum of 153 05 shown in fig 12b besides due to the uncertainty of marginal distributions the increase rates for the 5 and 95 bounds are 27 17 and 114 53 see fig 12b subparts ii and iii furthermore we notice that the increase rates of heavy rainfall and high tides are large meaning that the changing environment has greater impact on extreme rainfall and tide combination events 4 3 flood damage for different combination of rainfall and tides fig 13 a presents the flood damage for different combination of rainfall and tides which was calculated by the flood unit cost and inundation depth based on our previous study the flood unit cost was set at 258 yuan through the results of field survey for the two flood events in october 2010 and july 2014 in this study area xu et al 2020 the inundation depth was obtained by the urban flood inundation model the flood damage increases with increasing rainfall and tides fig 13b illustrates the variation of flood damage with rainfall under typical tides the flood damage rises slowly with increasing rainfall and there is little distinction between flood damage under different rainfall fig 13c shows the variation of flood damage with tides under typical rainfall unlike fig 13b the flood damage increases significantly with the increase of tides for instance when the rainfall is 400 mm and the tide increases from 3 0 m to 4 0 m the flood damage rises from 462 69 million yuan to 1479 70 million yuan with the increase of 223 69 therefore the tide plays a leading role in flood damage in the study area meanwhile we find that the flood damage increases more rapidly when the tide is higher than 3 0 m and more attention should be devoted to flood prevention when the highest tide is forecast to exceed 3 0 m 4 4 flood risk analysis under non stationary state to reflect the flooding probability and the inundation losses simultaneously the ead was adopted to evaluate the flood risk we chose to simulate 10 000 random combinations of rainfall and tides to analyze the ead under non stationary state fig 14 a shows the simulated combinations as well as the flood damage contour the damage contour was obtained from flood damage grid shown in fig 13a fig 14b illustrates the multiplication result of flood damage and relative probability of simulated rainfall and tides the tiny squares with different colors represent the contribution of the combination of rainfall and tides to the ead in fig 14b larger values of the tiny squares indicate a greater contribution to the ead which is mainly in the combinations of low rainfall and low tide events these combined events include rainfall for 4 to 10 year return periods and tides for 1 to 5 year return periods therefore although the damage caused by a heavy rainfall and high tide event is much higher than that of a low rainfall and low tide event shown in fig 14a the occurrence of low rainfall and low tide events is so frequent that they contribute more to the ead than heavy rainfall and high tide events which is consistent with the result of merz et al 2009 and hooshyaripor et al 2020 fig 15 a presents the ead eigenvalue for different design years the black line in the box represents the ead median value the box edges and whiskers represent specific percentiles respectively see note in fig 15a compared with the stationary state the ead values of different design years increase significantly under changing environment for the ead median the increase rate changes from 20 56 in 2030 to 69 84 in 2060 shown in fig 15b indicating that the risk of flood will be further exacerbated over time under changing environment in addition the percentile range of ead is larger with the increase of design years for instance the d value i e the different value between 5th and 95th percentiles of ead in 2030 is 26 88 million yuan while the d value of ead in 2060 is 91 6 million yuan these indicate that changing environment will lead to greater uncertainty in ead in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed an integrated framework for non stationary flood risk analysis by bayesian based tvpd model copula function urban flood inundation model and ead method in the coastal city we analyzed the change and uncertainty of flood risk affected by the changing environment and selected haidian island as the study area the major conclusions presented in this study are as follows the non stationary distributions generated by bma and tvdp models are reasonable and reduce the uncertainty of model selection and frank copula is the best fit function for bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides the joint and co occurrence probabilities increase significantly in non stationary state with the average rates of 33 22 and 64 82 respectively in addition the tide is the dominant factor for the flood damage in the study area when the tides exceed 3 0 m the damage has a significant change which requires special attention moreover the ead is adopted to quantify the flood risk based on flood probability and flood damage the combination events of rainfall for 4 to 10 year return periods and tides for 1 to 5 year return periods have a high contribution to ead compared with the stationary state the median increase rate of ead in the non stationary state increased from 20 56 in 2030 to 69 84 in 2060 the changing environment increases the potential risk and the uncertainty of flooding obviously due to the limitation of data in the study area the tvpd model is built by the rainfall and tide data with the length of 39 years to analyze the flood risk under changing environment in the future we will further improve the reliability of the tvpd model by combining gcm prediction data and analyze the adaptability of flood control measures e g green infrastructures under changing environment besides the hydrodynamic model is an important tool for flood risk assessment and the accuracy of the risk is influenced by model parameters e g conduit roughness it is also be our future work to considering data assimilation and deep learning method to improve the accuracy of flood risk the proposed framework can also be used in other coastal cities to evaluate the potential flood risk under non stationary state and provide a powerful support for future flood management credit authorship contribution statement xinjian guan conceptualization methodology software

2439,flood disaster is more serious in coastal cities due to the combined impact of rainfall and tides accurate assessment of coastal flood risk is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation under changing environment the objective of the study is to propose an integrated framework for future flood risk assessment by bayesian based time varying model and expected annual damage ead in the coastal city to decrease the uncertainty of non stationary frequency bayesian model averaging bma and time varying parameter distribution tvpd models were employed to establish the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides and copula function was adopted to determine the joint and co occurrence probability subsequently to reflect flooding probability and inundation damage simultaneously the ead was applied to quantify flood risk by copula function and hydrodynamic model the variation and uncertainty of flood risk were also investigated under changing environment taking haidian island in hainan province china as a case study the results show that the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides can be appropriately derived based on bma and tvpd models the joint and co occurrence probabilities increase significantly under non stationary scenario with the average rates of 33 22 and 64 82 respectively moreover the ead will be underestimated by 20 56 69 84 in 2030 2060 year without considering non stationarity and the uncertainty of ead rises with the increase of the design year the approach and result of our study can help decision makers evaluate the future flood risk in the coastal city and provide support for sustainable flood management to adapt the climate change keywords flood risk non stationarity time varying model coastal city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal cities face multiple drivers of flooding like heavy rainfall high tides and so on jang et al 2022 when different drivers occur simultaneously the risk and severity of flooding would be enlarged zheng et al 2014 ganguli and merz 2019 which can cause serious social and economic losses wahl et al 2015 watson et al 2018 liu et al 2022 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change s sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 extreme rainfall and tides are expected to show an upward trend under future climate change and coastal flood risk will be exacerbated due to the driving processes of rainfall and tides fang et al 2021 moreover coastal cities will be further developed in the future especially in china resulting in more people and property being exposed to flood risk therefore quantitative assessment of future flood risk caused by rainfall and tides under non stationary scenarios is of great significance to flood management in coastal cities traditional hydrological frequency analysis assumes that the hydrological sequence is stationary however rising global temperatures bring a raise about the occurrence probability and magnitude of severe hydrological events yilmaz et al 2014 and the design values based on the stationary hydrological frequency may be underestimated under future scenarios in recent years studies on non stationary frequency analysis have gradually increased due to increasing attention to climate change call et al 2017 ghanbari et al 2019 jimenez u et al 2022 and commonly used methods include global climate model gcm her et al 2019 k nearest neighbor weather generator knn agilan and umamahesh 2016 and time varying parameter distribution tvpd model xu et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2022 among them the tvpd model assumes that the distribution parameters change with the time and has been widely applied to various hydrological events condon et al 2015 deng et al 2019 li et al 2019 ju et al 2021 hu et al 2022 for instance li et al 2019 established a time varying generalized extreme value gev model and investigated the non stationary frequency of extreme rainfall ju et al 2021 proposed a non stationary drought identification method through the time varying gamma distribution which was fully utilized in the jinsha river basin china many studies have demonstrated that the tvpd model can well characterize the non stationarity of hydrological time series in the process of constructing the tvpd model the selection of distribution parameters varying with time is a crucial step yilmaz et al 2014 adopted the exponential function to describe the scale parameter of generalized pareto distribution gpd varying with time and investigated the potential impact of climate change on extreme rainfall nie et al 2021 selected the location parameter of the gev model to vary with time and evaluated the multivariate drought risks in wei river basin china under non stationary assumption ossandón et al 2021 built a linear function of the location scale and shape parameters of the gev model and obtained the non stationary frequency distribution of rainfall however most previous studies have directly assumed that certain parameters of the distribution function vary with time mailhot and duchesne 2009 cheng et al 2014 zheng et al 2015 xu et al 2020 ignoring the uncertainty caused by the selection of varying parameter when the distribution function has several parameters e g location scale and shape parameters of gev model which one should be selected to vary with time and how to describe the trend of the varying parameter e g linearly or exponentially with time have become important issues to the best of our knowledge few studies have focused on the above issues the unreasonable selection of varying parameter would increase the uncertainty in hydrological frequency analysis under non stationary scenarios schoniger et al 2014 enemark et al 2019 different selection of varying parameters corresponds to different non stationary models the bayesian model averaging bma method plays an important role in multi model fusion which maximizes the advantages of each model structure thus provides more accurate simulation values and evaluates the uncertainty of multi model combination simulation hoge et al 2020 yan et al 2022 it gives the final model the highest accuracy and decreases the uncertainty caused by model selection this study explores the non stationary frequency of rainfall and tides by integrating the tvpd model and bma method to reduce the influences of uncertainty the above studies mainly focused on the univariate frequency analysis under non stationary scenarios whereas coastal flooding is known to be influenced by a combination of rainfall and tides zheng et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 considered the rainfall extremes and tides simultaneously to estimate coastal flooding risk firstly and subsequently numerous analyses have reported the combined effect of rainfall and tides at global nicholls et al 2021 continental bevacqua et al 2019 national fang et al 2021 and local xu et al 2022 scales it is therefore preferable to develop a bivariate joint distribution to simulate the occurrence frequency of rainfall and tides copula function is widely used in the bivariate joint distribution model since it does not require the same marginal distribution between variables das et al 2020 and the model can well quantify the joint and co occurrence probability risk of flood events zhou et al 2019 zellou and rahali 2019 balistrocchi and grossi 2020 obtained the co occurrence probability of rainfall and storm surge in coastal low lying areas through copula function copula function was also further introduced into urban drainage model to predict flood risk change caused by climate change karamouz et al 2020 besides in recent years the hydrodynamic model was also applied to evaluate the flood risk caused by rainfall and tides in coastal cities kumbier et al 2018 bass and bedient 2018 for instance xu et al 2022 applied the hydrodynamic model to simulate the inundation area and depth of rainfall and tides in haikou city china the hydrodynamic model could obtain the inundation extent and depth for different combinations of rainfall and tides which is useful for flood prevention and management rong et al 2020 however there are still a few shortcomings of the copula function and hydrodynamic model for flood risk assessment for example the copula function only reflects the occurrence possibility of flood and does not consider the flood inundation loss the hydrodynamic model visualizes the flood inundation while the occurrence probability of flood is ignored so far future flood risk and its uncertainty analysis especially considering flooding probability and inundation losses simultaneously are still scarce in coastal cities in this study we adopted the expected annual damage i e ead method to analyze the flood risk of rainfall and tides and evaluated the influence and uncertainty of flood risk under changing environment the objective of the study is to propose an integrated framework for future flood risk assessment by bayesian based time varying model and expected annual damage considering non stationarity and uncertainty in the coastal city the main contributions are summarized as follows a an integrated approach based on bma and tvpd model was proposed to establish non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides and reduce the uncertainty of time varying model selection under changing environment b to reflect the flooding probability and damage simultaneously the ead was applied to quantify the flood risk and the variation and uncertainty of ead were investigated under non stationary state c we explored the combined influence of rainfall and tides on flood damage and the contribution of different combinations of rainfall and tides to ead the rest paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods of the study section 3 describes the study area and the used data section 4 discusses the main results section 5 draws the main conclusion 2 methods the study framework is presented in fig 1 first the non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides were obtained by integrating of tvpd model and bma method the weight of bma was determined by expected maximum em algorithm and the uncertainty was evaluated by the monte carlo method second the copula function was applied to determine the joint and co occurrence probability for given combined rainfall and tide events and the influence of non stationarity was investigated third the urban flood inundation model was used to simulate the flooding depth and build up the flood damage grid of combined rainfall and tide events final the ead was calculated based on the occurrence probability and corresponding flood damage and was adopted for quantifying the variation and uncertainty of flood risk under changing environment 2 1 non stationary distribution and uncertainty analysis 2 1 1 time varying parameter distribution model the parameters of hydrological series are usually obtained by fitting the existing historical hydrological series and remain the constant in the stationary scenario however the hydrological series will be affected by the climate change human activities and so on the tvpd model is an effective way to describe hydrological characteristics in changing environment which has been widely applied in non stationary frequency analysis of rainfall sugahara et al 2009 flood xu et al 2022 drought nie et al 2021 and other fields it assumes that the parameters change with time shown in fig 2 thus reflecting the effect of climate change on variables for example the formula of time varying gev distribution is as follows eq 1 bender et al 2014 most of literatures considered the location parameter varying with time shang et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2015 however climate change has destroyed the stationarity of the hydrological series all parameters that describe the average value and variability of distributions may change over time recently some literatures have begun to consider the scale and shape parameter varying with time to comprehensively reflect the non stationarity of hydrological series gilroy and mccuen 2012 yilmaz et al 2014 ju et al 2021 ossandón et al 2021 therefore all parameters were chosen to establish time varying model in this study 1 f x μ t σ t δ t e x p 1 δ t x μ t σ t 1 δ t where μ t σ t δ t represent location scale and shape parameter vary with time respectively 2 1 2 bayesian model averaging the bayesian model averaging bma is a common method for obtaining a composite value by weighting the calculated values of different models dong et al 2011 the bma can fully ensure that the optimal model has the largest weight when weighting and evaluates the uncertainty of multi model combination simulation in this paper different time varying marginal distribution models are set up and the frequency distributions of different models are weighted by bma to obtain the comprehensive frequency distribution that is non stationary marginal distributions suppose y is the simulation variable of the multi model d r t is the measured data and f f 1 f 2 f k is the set of k model simulations the probability density distribution function of the bma simulated variable y is 2 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d k 1 k ω k f k where p y d is the non stationary distributions p f k d is the posterior probability of the kth model which is actually the weight ω k of the time varying distribution models the higher the accuracy of the model the larger the corresponding weight value and the sum of all weight values is 1 p k y f k d is the probability distribution of different models given f k and measured data expected maximum em algorithm is adopted to derive the weights in the bma the em algorithm assumes that the model sequences satisfy the normal distribution therefore box cox function is used to carry out normal transformation of measured sequence and simulation sequence of each model before em algorithm is applied the em algorithm mainly establishes a hidden variable to assist in calculating the weight values and iterates repeatedly using expectation and maximization steps until the two calculated likelihood function interpolations meet the error requirements and obtain the maximum likelihood value the weight ω k and the error σ k 2 are obtained by the em algorithm then the monte carlo sample method is used to generate the simulated value of each hydrological value to deduce the uncertainty interval of the simulated sequence bilmes 1998 in this paper 1000 samples were selected for each hydrological value and the prediction value between 5 and 95 quantile was determined 2 2 bivariate joint distribution based on copula function the copula theory was proposed by sklar in 1959 sklar 1959 the advantage of the copula function is that the variables are not required to have the same marginal distribution during the construction process according to the sklar theory h r t is a bivariate joint distribution with marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 a copula function c u v exists to make 3 h r t c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 we choose two archimedean copula functions i e gumbel copula frank copula and two elliptic copula functions i e gaussian copula student s t copula to build the bivariate joint distribution model of rainfall and tides the candidate copula functions are described in table 1 the akaike information criterion aic and ordinary least squares ols are applied to select the best fit function which are defined as follows 4 aic 2 n l n 1 n ρ ρ e 2 2 γ 5 ols 1 n ρ ρ e 2 where ρ is the theoretical frequency ρ e is the empirical frequency n is the number of samples γ is the number of variables the smaller the aic and ols values the better the fitting effect kolmogorov smirnov ks test is used to judge whether the function is available and the test statistic z is defined as follow 6 z m a x c k i n c k i 1 n where c k is the theoretical distribution of samples i is the serial number of samples in ascending order when the test statistic z is less than the critical test value the test is accepted in this study the joint and co occurrence probability are selected to describe the probability of combined rainfall and tide events the probability that rainfall r and tides t have a variable exceeding a certain magnitude is called joint probability denoted as p or 7 p or p r r t t 1 h r t the probability that both rainfall r and tides t exceed a certain magnitude is called the co occurrence probability denoted as p and 8 p and p r r t t 1 f 1 r f 2 t h r t 2 3 urban flood inundation model personal computer storm water management model pcswmm is adopted to establish the urban flood inundation model in this study which is a hydrological and hydrodynamic model developed by the canadian computational hydraulics institute chi based on the swmm model the reliability and availability of the pcswmm model have been verified and fully utilized in many countries such as the united states panos et al 2021 china xu et al 2020 italy pilotti et al 2021 etc a variety of hydrological processes including surface runoff infiltration and flood evolution can be simulated james et al 2010 the urban flood inundation model includes one dimension 1d drainage model and two dimension 2d surface drainage model the 1d drainage model refers to the urban drainage network and river drainage system and the 2d surface drainage model simulates the flow on the ground the pcswmm model provides two approaches for coupling 1d and 2d drainage model including using orifice connections and direct 1d 2d node connections and the orifice connection approach is selected in this study the hydrodynamic calculation adopts the dynamic wave method and the calculation formula is as follows 9 q m a t 0 10 ga h m m q 2 a q t g a s f 0 where a represents cross section area over water m2 h represents water depth m represents distance along the conduit q represents flow rate t represents time s f represents friction slope and g represents gravity acceleration 2 4 expected annual damage expected annual damage ead is a widely adopted metric of flood risk koks et al 2019 this is obtained by multiplying the damage function of simulated events by the relative probability that is the comprehensive reflection of the consequences and possibilities caused by the events adnan et al 2020 general its calculation formula is 11 ead f 0 d f d f where ead is the expected annual damage d f is the flood damage caused by the flood events with occurrence frequency f in our work we evaluate the flood risk caused by combined rainfall and tide events therefore the flood damage is estimated by double integral method eq 12 to simplify the integration calculation we choose to simulate enough combination events of rainfall and tides couasnon et al 2022 the probability mass function of each event is multiplied by the corresponding flood damage finally sum the results to obtain the ead 12 ead r t d r t f r t d x d y where d r t is the damage from given rainfall and tides and f r t is the probability density function corresponding to rainfall and tides 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the proposed framework was applied in haidian island which is located in the northern of haikou city hainan province china haidian island has a tropical maritime monsoon climate with a rainfall of 2067 mm year and an average annual temperature of 24 3 c chen et al 2018 due to the specificity of the location haidian island is surrounded by the qiongzhou strait and nandu river see fig 3 and is frequently damaged by severe typhoons meanwhile the average elevation is low and the terrain is flat which makes it vulnerable to floods xu et al 2018a b xu et al 2020 haidian island is a highly urbanized area and the island includes many campuses residential and commercial areas with a relatively large percentage of impervious area which can cause serious economic and social losses once urban flooding is generated the study data mainly consists of three parts the first part is the historical rainfall and tides data used for building bivariate joint probability model the second part is the basic data for constructing the urban flood inundation model including digital elevation model dem data drainage network data and river cross section data the third part is the rainfall and tide data of typhoon rammaun and the observed data of water depth the sources and main uses of the above data are as follows the daily rainfall and tides data from 1974 to 2012 was provided by haikou municipal water bureau the annual maximum rainfall and corresponding tides were selected for the construction of marginal and joint probability distributions of rainfall and tides dem data was used to construct the 2d model in urban flood inundation model and it was obtained from the resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx drainage network data and river data were used to construct the 1d drainage model in urban flood inundation model which were provided by haikou municipal water bureau the rainfall and tides process data of typhoon rammasun in july 2014 and the observed data of water depth are the basic of calibration model parameters the observed data of water depth were collected through field investigation and provided by haikou municipal water bureau since we were undertaking flood and tide control planning project of haikou city during typhoon rammasun 3 2 selection of marginal distribution in this section four commonly used functions that is gev lognorm norm and gamma were adopted for determining the marginal distributions of rainfall and tides the parameters of marginal distributions were derived from maximum likelihood estimation the ks test was chosen for fitting test and the fitting quality of distribution function was evaluated by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse relative error re ols and aic fig 4 shows the fitting comparison between the candidate marginal distributions and empirical distribution and table 2 lists the evaluation values in the ks test the number of samples is 39 and the critical value of the significance level α 0 05 is 0 2178 frank and massey 2012 as shown in table 2 the all functions have passed the test for the evaluation of goodness of fit the nse of gev function is larger than the other three functions and re ols aic values are the minimum it reveals that the gev function is the best fit distribution of rainfall and tides 3 3 establishment and calibration of urban flood inundation model 3 3 1 model establishment the structure procedure of pcswmm model includes 1d 2d model construction and model parameter calibration the final model contains 2071 1d junctions 2038 conduits 23 580 2d cells and 13 sub catchments the drainage network and river data were processed by arcgis and then were imported into the pcswmm to generate the 1d drainage model after the 1d model was built 2d cells was constructed from the dem data and the boundary range of the study area the cell is hexagon with resolution of 25 m roughness of 0 085 and sampling factor of 3 finally the 1d and 2d model was coupled through orifices shown in fig 5 in addition horton model was selected as the infiltration model and the flood process was simulated by the dynamic wave method 3 3 2 model parameter calibration the parameters of the urban flood inundation model were calibrated by the observations during typhoon rammasun in july 2014 the rainfall and tide processes data were applied for boundary conditions of the urban flood inundation model the observed and simulated depths at different observation points were shown in fig 6 due to the limitation of data accuracy such as terrain the simulated depth cannot be completely consistent with the observed depth however in general the error values between the simulated and observed depth of each observation point are small the relative error is less than 15 and the nse is 0 73 thus the model is considered acceptable for urban flooding simulation dechmi et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 non stationary distributions of rainfall and tides 4 1 1 selection of varying parameters in tvpd models fig 7 shows the variation trend of distribution parameters obtained by accumulating historical rainfall and tide data which were fitted by the levenberg marquardt algorithm as shown in fig 7c and fig 7e the trends of the shape parameter of rainfall and the scale parameter of tides are not significant and the correlation coefficients r2 are lower than 0 4 therefore these two parameters are not considered in tvpd models for other four distribution parameters the correlation coefficients between fitted models and parameter values all exceed 0 7 which indicates that the fitted models are reasonable the linear and exponential fitted models are presented in fig 7 location and scale parameters of rainfall show an upward trend the location parameter of tides shows an increasing trend while the shape parameter presents a downward trend meanwhile the prediction interval between 5 and 95 surrounds the time series of parameters and reflects all the possibilities of parameter changes thus can reasonably characterize the uncertainty of time varying models shown in fig 7 4 1 2 bma weights and tvpd models of rainfall and tides different time varying distribution models were set up based on variation trends of distribution parameters in section 4 1 1 for rainfall model ⅰ the location parameter changes with time while the scale and shape parameters remain unchanged model ⅱ the location and scale parameters change with time while the shape parameter remains unchanged for tides model ⅰ the location parameter changes with time while the scale and shape parameters remain unchanged model ⅱ the location and shape parameters change with time while the scale parameter remains unchanged table 3 presents the bma weights of different models which were obtained by the em algorithm we obviously find that the weight of model ⅱ is greater than that of model ⅰ indicating that model ⅱ has greater contribution to the non stationary distribution model the bma method ensures that better time varying models have higher weights making the final non stationary distribution model more reasonable to test the validity of the bayesian based tvpd model we used historical rainfall and tide data during 1974 2003 years to establish the non stationary models which were adopted to predict the rainfall and tide in 2012 year fig 8 illustrates the non stationary distribution and prediction interval between 5 and 95 of rainfall and tides on the whole the non stationary distribution and empirical distribution of rainfall and tides are well fitted indicating that the method is reasonable the prediction interval characterizes the uncertainty of bma simulation results the prediction interval between 5 and 95 surrounds the distribution models which already reflect all the results of the bma simulation greater rainfall and tides with greater uncertainty are derived from changes in the bandwidth of the interval 4 1 3 variation of univariate probability under non stationary state fig 9 presents the exceedance probability of rainfall and tides under stationary and non stationary state in 2030 based on the bayesian based tvpd model overall compared with the stationary state the exceedance probability of rainfall and tides increases significantly under the non stationary state among them the increase rate of rainfall rises with the increase of rainfall and the average increase rate is 61 09 comparing with stationary state the increase rate of tides is weaker than that of rainfall and the average increase rate of tides is 15 08 the maximum increase rate is 31 11 and the corresponding tide is 2 82 m thus these indicate that the changing environment will affect the occurrence probability of heavy rainfall and high tide obviously and further enhancing the probability of flood 4 2 variation and uncertainty of joint and co occurrence probability under non stationary state 4 2 1 bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides four copula functions were adopted to establish the bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides as presented in table 4 all copula functions have passed the ks test with the significance level of 0 05 and the aic and ols values of frank copula are the minimum values thus frank copula is selected as the optimal function besides as shown in fig 10 the correlation coefficient r2 between theoretical and empirical distribution is 0 979 indicating that the frank copula is optimally applicable to characterize the dependence between rainfall and tides under non stationary state 4 2 2 variation of the joint and co occurrence probability fig 11 a and fig 11b illustrates the increase value and increase rate in joint probability under given combinations of rainfall and tides respectively considering the uncertainty of the non stationary distribution the bounds of 5 and 95 of the increase value are also presented in fig 11 subparts ii and iii as a whole the increase values decrease as the increase of rainfall and tides due to the low probability of heavy rainfall and high tides see fig 11a however the increase rates gradually rise when the rainfall and tides increase shown in fig 11b the average increase rate is 33 22 and the maximum increase rate is 74 72 the fig 11b subparts ii and iii show the uncertainty of combined events of rainfall and tides caused by non stationary distributions the average increase rates of the 5 and 95 bounds are 18 97 and 48 59 respectively the increase values of co occurrence probability decrease as the increase of rainfall and tides shown in fig 12 a which is consistent with the change trend of the joint probability the increase rate is more obvious in heavy rainfall and high tides with an average value of 64 82 and a maximum of 153 05 shown in fig 12b besides due to the uncertainty of marginal distributions the increase rates for the 5 and 95 bounds are 27 17 and 114 53 see fig 12b subparts ii and iii furthermore we notice that the increase rates of heavy rainfall and high tides are large meaning that the changing environment has greater impact on extreme rainfall and tide combination events 4 3 flood damage for different combination of rainfall and tides fig 13 a presents the flood damage for different combination of rainfall and tides which was calculated by the flood unit cost and inundation depth based on our previous study the flood unit cost was set at 258 yuan through the results of field survey for the two flood events in october 2010 and july 2014 in this study area xu et al 2020 the inundation depth was obtained by the urban flood inundation model the flood damage increases with increasing rainfall and tides fig 13b illustrates the variation of flood damage with rainfall under typical tides the flood damage rises slowly with increasing rainfall and there is little distinction between flood damage under different rainfall fig 13c shows the variation of flood damage with tides under typical rainfall unlike fig 13b the flood damage increases significantly with the increase of tides for instance when the rainfall is 400 mm and the tide increases from 3 0 m to 4 0 m the flood damage rises from 462 69 million yuan to 1479 70 million yuan with the increase of 223 69 therefore the tide plays a leading role in flood damage in the study area meanwhile we find that the flood damage increases more rapidly when the tide is higher than 3 0 m and more attention should be devoted to flood prevention when the highest tide is forecast to exceed 3 0 m 4 4 flood risk analysis under non stationary state to reflect the flooding probability and the inundation losses simultaneously the ead was adopted to evaluate the flood risk we chose to simulate 10 000 random combinations of rainfall and tides to analyze the ead under non stationary state fig 14 a shows the simulated combinations as well as the flood damage contour the damage contour was obtained from flood damage grid shown in fig 13a fig 14b illustrates the multiplication result of flood damage and relative probability of simulated rainfall and tides the tiny squares with different colors represent the contribution of the combination of rainfall and tides to the ead in fig 14b larger values of the tiny squares indicate a greater contribution to the ead which is mainly in the combinations of low rainfall and low tide events these combined events include rainfall for 4 to 10 year return periods and tides for 1 to 5 year return periods therefore although the damage caused by a heavy rainfall and high tide event is much higher than that of a low rainfall and low tide event shown in fig 14a the occurrence of low rainfall and low tide events is so frequent that they contribute more to the ead than heavy rainfall and high tide events which is consistent with the result of merz et al 2009 and hooshyaripor et al 2020 fig 15 a presents the ead eigenvalue for different design years the black line in the box represents the ead median value the box edges and whiskers represent specific percentiles respectively see note in fig 15a compared with the stationary state the ead values of different design years increase significantly under changing environment for the ead median the increase rate changes from 20 56 in 2030 to 69 84 in 2060 shown in fig 15b indicating that the risk of flood will be further exacerbated over time under changing environment in addition the percentile range of ead is larger with the increase of design years for instance the d value i e the different value between 5th and 95th percentiles of ead in 2030 is 26 88 million yuan while the d value of ead in 2060 is 91 6 million yuan these indicate that changing environment will lead to greater uncertainty in ead in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed an integrated framework for non stationary flood risk analysis by bayesian based tvpd model copula function urban flood inundation model and ead method in the coastal city we analyzed the change and uncertainty of flood risk affected by the changing environment and selected haidian island as the study area the major conclusions presented in this study are as follows the non stationary distributions generated by bma and tvdp models are reasonable and reduce the uncertainty of model selection and frank copula is the best fit function for bivariate joint distribution of rainfall and tides the joint and co occurrence probabilities increase significantly in non stationary state with the average rates of 33 22 and 64 82 respectively in addition the tide is the dominant factor for the flood damage in the study area when the tides exceed 3 0 m the damage has a significant change which requires special attention moreover the ead is adopted to quantify the flood risk based on flood probability and flood damage the combination events of rainfall for 4 to 10 year return periods and tides for 1 to 5 year return periods have a high contribution to ead compared with the stationary state the median increase rate of ead in the non stationary state increased from 20 56 in 2030 to 69 84 in 2060 the changing environment increases the potential risk and the uncertainty of flooding obviously due to the limitation of data in the study area the tvpd model is built by the rainfall and tide data with the length of 39 years to analyze the flood risk under changing environment in the future we will further improve the reliability of the tvpd model by combining gcm prediction data and analyze the adaptability of flood control measures e g green infrastructures under changing environment besides the hydrodynamic model is an important tool for flood risk assessment and the accuracy of the risk is influenced by model parameters e g conduit roughness it is also be our future work to considering data assimilation and deep learning method to improve the accuracy of flood risk the proposed framework can also be used in other coastal cities to evaluate the potential flood risk under non stationary state and provide a powerful support for future flood management credit authorship contribution statement xinjian guan conceptualization methodology software
