8395,study region osun drainage basin nigeria study focus estimating spatial and temporal patterns of recharge is important for sustainable groundwater resources management this is especially true for data poor regions such as the basement complex in nigeria which has shallow aquifers a proliferation of wells and no efficient groundwater monitoring network this study evaluates the performance of a spatially distributed monthly water balance model wetspass m in estimating groundwater recharge the wetspass m model has moderate data demands which allows for comprehensive assessment of recharge new hydrological insights for the region 27 of the rainfall in osun drainage basin becomes recharge while the remaining is lost through evapotranspiration 43 surface runoff 21 and interception 9 september is the month with highest recharge ranging between 0 and 73 mm in the north and 129 up to 213 mm in the south and northeast of the basin the study revealed the significance of the applied water balance model in understanding the spatial and temporal status of recharge therefore the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge should be taken into consideration in preparing a sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the osun drainage basin artificial recharge might be adopted to store storm water runoff during wet periods to improve the groundwater supply in dry months also monthly groundwater withdrawals should be regulated in relation to spatial and temporal recharge patterns keywords groundwater recharge wetspass m groundwater management osun basin 1 introduction groundwater recharge estimation is a well established research area omorinbola 1986 lerner et al 1990 beekman et al 1996 finch 1998 arnold et al 2000 finch 2001 armbruster and leibundgut 2001 de vries and simmers 2002 lerner 2002 edmunds et al 2002 batelaan et al 2003 sophocleous 2004 goni et al 2005 adelana et al 2006 batelaan and de smedt 2007 nolan et al 2007 hamza et al 2007 jyrkama and sykes 2007 mileham et al 2008 milewski et al 2009 healy 2010 pan et al 2011 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamichael et al 2013 zomlot et al 2015 abdollahi et al 2017 however the paucity of data and limited research capacity in developing countries such as nigeria means that there is a lack of understanding recharge variability for large parts of the developing world this can be attributed to the complex nature of groundwater resources and its interaction with the ecosystem and to what taylor and tindimugaya 2012 called the limited hydrological knowledge base human and institutional capacity in the tropical regions of the world researchers in nigeria have strived to estimate groundwater recharge of locations and drainage basins across the country using different methods some of these methods include tracers isotopes adanu 1991 edmunds et al 2002 goni et al 2005 sani et al 2012 empirical relationships omorinbola 1982 1986 carter 1994 carter and alkali 1996 adeleke et al 2015 ashaolu 2016a soil moisture balance and water table fluctuation adindu et al 2013 oke et al 2014 and hydrograph separation method ifabiyi 2004 idowu and martins 2007 other scholars also adopted a combination of two or more methods adelana et al 2006 or different empirical equations oke et al 2015 with the intention of comparing the results also previous studies fmwr 2014a oke et al 2015 on groundwater recharge in southwestern nigeria lumped ogun and osun drainage basins together as a unit of investigation and reported a single mean annual recharge for the two basins the methods highlighted above have restricted spatial and temporal capability and assessed recharge on an annual or seasonal time scale thereby neglecting important smaller time scale monthly recharge variability neither did these studies examine the interconnectivity between groundwater and surface water resources despite their intrinsic role in the hydrological cycle it has been stressed that groundwater resources do not exist in isolation but are connected to surface water resources and the terrestrial ecosystems unesco 2008 hence both should be conceptualized as a combined resource winter et al 1998 adopting an integrated system approach that recognizes groundwater system as part of the hydrologic cycle is paramount when examining groundwater availability and long term aquifer sustainability healy et al 2007 unesco 2008 bredehoeft 2011 also suggested that a holistic approach is needed in assessing the relationships between groundwater and surface water because groundwater cannot be managed independently from surface water without considering their interdependencies these issues call for a need to employ an integrated approach for groundwater recharge estimation owing to the complexities in direct assessment of the water budget hydrologists and water resources engineers have widely adopted hydrological models to enable its comprehension ashaolu 2017 there are several recharge estimation models such as swat arnold et al 2000 svat armbruster and leibundgut 2001 and dream manfreda et al 2005 that are data intensive and based on complex hydrological process calculations thereby reducing their application in developing countries where hourly or daily climatic data are scarce abdollahi et al 2017 the wetspass model batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 estimate groundwater recharge on seasonal and annual basis which limited its application in the basement complex rocks terrain where intra seasonal recharge processes are important and hence a smaller time step for the recharge estimation is required for sustainable groundwater management thus the general scientific aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of the wetspass m model for its capability to estimate regional spatially and temporally monthly variable groundwater recharge under conditions of limited data availability as is typical in tropical continental climate regions and basement complex rocks terrain the choice for the wetspass m model is based on the premise that it offers an efficient approach for basins where there is sparse monitoring and lack of data on hydrological processes abdollahi et al 2017 studies in different parts of the world have adopted wetspass models in assessing the water balance which yielded satisfying results batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 de smedt and batelaan 2003 dams et al 2007 pan et al 2011 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 zomlot et al 2015 2017 melki et al 2017 mustafa et al 2017 abdollahi et al 2017 the last three references applied wetspass m while only the bangladesh study area of mustapha et al 2017 has a similar climate albeit this study did not focus on the wetspass m performance and has very different hydrogeological conditions groundwater occurrence in the basement complex rocks aquifer in any environment is defined by the presence of a shallow water table and significant amount of natural recharge is mainly from rainfall sekhar et al 1994 nyagwambo 2006 and the groundwater residence time is about three to six months nyagwambo 2006 as there is a high temporal rainfall variability ashaolu 2018 in nigeria estimating only annual and seasonal recharge in the basement complex aquifer will not be sufficient for understanding intra and inter annual variability of the groundwater resource this study focuses on osun drainage basin which is one of the two major drainage basins in southwestern nigeria the basement complex rocks underlie about 93 of this basin it constitutes a poor aquifer although sizeable amount of groundwater is found in areas with deeply weathered regolith ashaolu 2016a ashaolu and adebayo 2014 taylor and howard 2000 azeez 1972 in addition increasing population put at 12 million in 2018 is putting pressure on water resources development within the osun drainage basin it has been argued that long term water resource planning requires both spatial and temporal information on groundwater recharge to properly manage not only water use and exploitation but also land use allocation and development jyrkama and sykes 2006 hence this study will help in the long term sustainable groundwater resources management in the study area 2 study area the osun drainage basin is located between latitudes 6 25 58 79ʺ and 8 21 3 6ʺ n and longitudes 3 47 34 8ʺ and 5 10 55 2ʺ e in south western nigeria it extends over 9 259 km2 the osun drainage system rises in oke mesi ridge about 5 km north of effon alaiye and flows north through the itawure gap to latitude 7 53ʺ before turning westwards via osogbo ede and southwards to flow into lagos lagoon about 8 km east of epe fig 1 ogun oshun river basin development authority oorbda 1982 oke et al 2013 ashaolu 2016b the basin climate is influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the quasi stationary boundary that distinguishes the sub tropical continental air mass over the sahara and the equatorial maritime air mas over the atlantic ocean the sub tropical continental air mass is marked by the dry north easterly winds known as harmattan while equatorial air mass is marked with the rain bearing south westerly winds from the gulf of guinea oorbda 1982 the basin experiences two types of seasons dry and rainy wet season the dry season is a period of minimal rainfall when the northeast trade wind dominates the rainy season starts by the end of april when the basin is under the influence of the southwest trade wind which is a rain bearing wind ifabiyi 2005 the switch from the rainy season to the dry season is abrupt while the onset of the rain after the dry season is gradual oorbda 1982 the salient feature of the rainfall pattern is its seasonal distribution fig 2 the rainy season begins earlier in the south around march and continues until the end of october or early november in the north around ogbomosho the rain begins in late april or early may and end in mid october giving six months of rainfall dry days are frequent and regular in late july and early august which was termed the little dry season the mean 1976 2015 wet season rainfall varies from 1020 mm to 1520 mm in the south of the basin to less than 1020 mm in the north on the other hand the mean dry season rainfall varies from 127 to 178 mm in the north while it varies from 178 to 254 mm in the south oorbda 1982 meanwhile the mean annual 1976 2015 rainfall amount for osun drainage basin estimated from the records of the 24 weather stations is 1620 mm the rainfall amount between 1976 and 2015 exhibits a non significant decreasing trend in osun drainage basin using mann kendall trend analysis fig 3 table 1 the months of february and march are the hottest in the basin and temperatures are high over the entire basin during this period fig 4 there is also variation in temperature from the south to the north where it is higher the lowest mean 1976 2015 minimum temperature in the north is usually in december during harmattans while it is usually recorded in july during the rainy season in the southern part of the basin oorbda 1982 the mean annual 1976 2015 temperature is about 30 c which can vary depending on the location and time of the year ifabiyi 2005 the temperature in the study area revealed a significant increasing trend over the period of 1976 2015 fig 5 table 1 in general relative humidity decreases northwards in the basin the mean annual humidity varies from 75 in the south to 55 in the north oorbda 1982 the basin is underlain by two types of rocks which are the basement complex rocks 9259 km2 or about 93 and the sedimentary deposits 668 km2 or about 7 fig 6 oorbda 1982 oke et al 2013 ashaolu 2016b the basement complex consists mainly of folded gneiss schist and quartzite complexes which belong to the older intrusive series with outcrops visible in many places oke et al 2013 the age of the basement complex rocks of the study area belong to two eras the archean age 2500ma 2750 25ma and the early proterozoic age 2000ma 2500ma ajibade et al 1987 rahman 1988 sedimentary rocks of cretaceous and later deposits are found in the southern sections of the osun basin oke et al 2013 the soils belong to the highly ferruginous tropical red soils associated with basement complex rocks four soil types were identified in the basin on basis of their texture fig 7 these are clay 29 sandy clay loam 51 sandy loam 16 and loamy sand soil 4 ashaolu 2016b the population distribution pattern of the basin is quite uneven the urban population in the basin is larger than the rural population besides available records from different investigations and surveys confirmed a migration of population from the rural areas to the cities based on the 1963 population census of western nigeria the estimated population of the basin made by ogun oshun river basin development authority in 1980 was 4 2 million and this was used as the basis of estimation for year 2015 at an annual rate of 3 to be about 12 million ashaolu 2018 3 material and methods 3 1 data the data used in this study include climatic data such as rainfall amount mm number of rainy days temperature ºc sunshine hour relative humidity and wind speed m s collected from the nigeria meteorological agency nimet also climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data on precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep were downloaded from https globalweather tamu edu website the cfsr provides a high resolution global reanalysis a best estimate of the observed state of the atmosphere of past weather at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 the available 24 weathers stations used in this study are those that fall within and close to the drainage basin fig 1 the data on all the climatic variables spanned 40 years 1976 2015 the trend in the climatic variables determined by mann kendall trend statistics is presented in table 1 however some of the stations like abeokuta and the cfsr stations did not have data to cover the period 1976 2015 therefore the missing years records were filled with data from other stations to achieve this data from abeokuta station 1981 2015 was correlated with data from other ground stations for the same period of 1981 2015 the station with the highest coefficient of correlation with abeokuta was used to fill the period 1976 1980 that have no record in abeokuta station a similar approach was adopted for the period 1976 1978 and 2015 that has no record in the cfrs data table s1 shows the summary of the climatic stations with their respective locations and years of record the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 this method was selected because it is physically based clearly incorporates both physiological and aerodynamic parameters as well as regarded as the most reliable predictor of pet rates under all climatic conditions jensen et al 1990 the eto calculator version 3 2 of fao was used to compute pet in this study raes 2012 the classified land use land cover maps of the study area for 2000 and 2015 by ashaolu et al 2019 were used in this study the classification adopted seven land use land cover classes bare surfaces built up area crops shrubs forest rock outcrops water bodies and wetland the classes fall under four main category of land use land cover vegetated cover bares soil open water and impervious surfaces as used by wetspass m for runoff parameterization table 2 shows that in the osun drainage area in 2000 crops shrubs bare surfaces and forest covered 42 27 and 21 respectively of the total basin in 2015 these coverages changed to 32 31 and 22 for respectively crops shrubs bare surface and forest while built up area accounted for 10 7 in 2015 a soil map of the study area was extracted from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 2012 prepared by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao digital elevation model dem with 30 m resolution of the study area was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission strm of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the slope and aspect maps of the study area were processed from the dem using arcgis due to the dearth of data on the depth to groundwater in the study area the mean depth to groundwater for the study area was adopted from the water level for the study area reported in the federal ministry of water resources fmwr 2014a 2014b national water resource master plan report of nigeria a 10 m depth to water was adopted for 93 of the basin underlain by the basement complex rocks and 50 m for the remaining 7 underlain by the sedimentary basin in the south the available few records from borehole logs show that depth to groundwater in the basin is more than 2 m the adoption of a mean depth to groundwater does not influence the wetspass m simulation results if the depth to groundwater in an area of investigation is more than the root depth tilahun and merkel 2009 tesfamicheal et al 2013 stream discharge data available at apoje gauging station for the period 1980 until january 2000 were collected from ogun oshun river basin development authority the hydrograph separation method was used to separate the runoff data into surface runoff interflow and baseflow using the semi logarithm method watson and burnett 1995 ifabiyi 2004 the baseflow computed is used as an approximation of long term recharge in the study area hence it is likely to be less than the amount of water that actually recharges the aquifer in osun drainage basin 3 2 wetspass wetspass m water balance modelling the wetspass m model is described in s1 the model requires two types of input data gis grid maps and parameters tables batelaan and de smedt 2001 the grid maps include slope land use land cover soil texture depth to groundwater and monthly climatic maps of rainfall amount temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed abdollahi et al 2017 all the input maps were converted into ascii grid format the monthly climatic parameters used in the model are available in all the 24 stations within and close to the basin mean monthly values of rainfall amount temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed for the period 1976 2015 were calculated from the available data in each station the mean monthly spatial digital maps of the parameters were determined by spatial interpolation of the values obtained in the stations using the universal kriging interpolation module in arcgis 10 4 wetspass m uses the usgs soil texture classes therefore the percentages of coarse medium and fine particle size fractions in the top soil was used to extract the soil texture map of the study area from harmonised world soil database hwsd the types of soil based on the texture are clay sandy clay loam sandy loam and loamy sand fig 7 land use number of rainy days and soil characteristic was specified as parameters tables in the model batelaan and de smedt 2001 tesfamichael et al 2013 abdollahi et al 2017 these tables were connected to the maps as attribute tables the land use attribute table include parameters related to land use type such as rooting depth leaf area index vegetation height manning coefficient among many others the soil parameter table contains soil parameters for each textural soil class such as field capacity wilting point permeability etc the runoff attribute is considered to be universal because a certain combination of slope land use and soil type will produce a certain fraction of runoff independent of location tesfamichael et al 2013 for the sake of matrix calculation all input maps into wetspass m must have uniform grid cell size i e the same spatial resolution however the data used in this study have different spatial resolutions which necessitated the need for resampling therefore all the secondary data lulc soil map and dem and the generated weather maps were resampled into 15 m resolution the nearest neighbor resampling method was adopted to resample the year 2000 and 2015 land use land cover maps and soil map because they are discrete data with distinct boundaries while bilinear technique was adopted in resampling the dem because of its continuous nature the land use land cover maps of the year 2000 fig 8 and 2015 fig 9 were selected as the lulc data input the simulation was first run using the lulc map of the year 2000 the mean monthly record of climatic variables for the period 1980 1999 was used as the weather input as well as the soil and dem of the study area for the first simulation the output of this simulation runoff and recharge were used in the calibration and validation of the model because runoff data in the study area spanned between 1980 1999 and was not available beyond january 2000 the model was calibrated manually using the following parameters soil moisture alfa coefficient α lpa calibration parameter which reduces the potential evapotranspiration depending on the soil moisture default is 0 65 interception parameter a and runoff delay factor x which were optimized according to the goodness of fit between the simulated runoff and the runoff from observed discharge at apoje station the calibration started with the soil moisture alfa coefficient abdollahi et al 2017 the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse were used for validation using the simulated and observed mean monthly discharge data of 1980 1999 at apoje gauge station the nash sutcliffe model efficiency is defined as 1 e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient q o is the mean of observed discharge q m is modeled discharge and q o t is the observed discharge at time t the result can range to 1 the closer the model efficiency is to 1 the more accurate the predicted model result in addition the hydrograph separation method was employed to estimate groundwater recharge using the runoff data from the apoje gauge station after the validation of the model for the study area the lulc of the year 2015 was adopted for simulating the mean monthly water budget for the period 1976 2015 a 10 m and 50 m mean depth to groundwater for the basement complex rocks and sedimentary basin respectively was prepared with an output cell size of 15 m while the processing extent was also set to 9977 14043 to have the same column and row and pixel size as the other variables the dem of the study area was used to produce the slope map in arcgis the prepared input data were inputted into the model to begin the simulation of the mean monthly water budget of osun drainage basin for the period 1976 2015 the outputs include several mean monthly spatio temporal hydrologic outputs but the mean interception actual evapotranspiration runoff and recharge are the main concern of this study 4 results 4 1 water budget components in osun drainage basin the mean monthly water budget and the ratio of rainfall amount to each of the water balance components are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively the results of each components of the water balance are presented in section 4 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 interception rate the monthly mean interception in osun drainage basin for the period 1976 2015 ranges from 1 mm in january to 23 mm in september while the mean annual interception is 146 mm this accounted for 9 of the mean annual rainfall amount 1620 mm from 1976 to 2015 table 3 the spatial distribution of the mean monthly interception in the osun drainage basin showed that high interception rates 3 47 mm are found in the forested areas in awaiye apomu alagutan apoje ijebu ife akata and epe etc in the middle of the basin down to the southern part low interception rate 0 3 mm is found in alawere ikoyi ogbomosho aba epo arowomole tafun iyalode and other places in the northwest zone of the basin fig 12 4 1 2 surface runoff the estimated mean monthly surface runoff ranges from 0 mm to 79 mm with a mean annual value of 348 mm year the highest mean rainfall amount occurred in september resulting in 27 becoming surface runoff the lowest surface runoff 0 mm occurred in december january and february and they coincide with the months that have the lowest mean monthly rainfall amount table 3 the mean monthly spatial pattern of surface runoff in the basin show that the highest surface runoff 209 430 mm is observed in apomu alaguntan apoje iganmeji and akata etc located in the central part towards the southern part of the basin for most of the months also high surface runoff was found in some months in the built up areas such as osogbo ilesha ede etc and on rock outcrops especially in the northeastern zone fig 12 the simulated result of runoff was compared to the observed stream discharge in apoje gauge station located in the southern part of the study area in order to validate the results of the model fig 13 the comparison suggests that wetspass m estimated lower and higher run offs in dry and wet months respectively the mean annual surface runoff for different combinations of lulc and soil classes show that the largest surface runoff 1925 mm occurred on clay soils with water body lulc while the lowest value 104 mm is on loamy sand soil in forest area table 4 the higher standard deviation values of the surface runoff for different lulc types indicate that surface runoff is less influenced by lulc type compared to the soil types in the study area 4 1 3 actual evapotranspiration the mean monthly aet in the basin ranges from 10 mm in january to 85 mm in october table 3 the annual mean aet in the basin is 696 mm year aet is the largest component of the water budget in osun basin constituting 43 of the annual rainfall amount the percentage of aet to rainfall in the basin is highest for the months of january 86 and december 86 which are the months with lowest amount of rainfall the spatial distribution of mean monthly aet in the osun basin showed that open water bodies have high evapotranspiration rate especially during the dry months november march for example the aet rate from the open water in january is between 29 190 mm the majority part of the basin experience high aet in wet months where majority of the basin in september recorded aet that ranges between 91 221 mm 4 1 4 groundwater recharge the estimated monthly distribution of groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin is presented in table 3 the mean monthly groundwater recharge varies from 0 mm in january to 102 mm in september the highest mean rainfall amount occurred in september of which 35 recharges the groundwater system while 2 of rainfall in january becomes groundwater recharge table 3 the estimated mean annual recharge in the basin was 430 mm this is 27 of the mean annual rainfall recorded in the basin for the period of study the results of the estimated recharge from baseflow separation and the wetspass m simulated recharge is presented in table 5 the correlation coefficient of the mean monthly recharge estimated from baseflow separation method and predicted by wetspass m is 0 97 which suggests a good agreement between the recharge estimation from the baseflow separation method and the wetspass m model the mean monthly spatial distribution patterns of groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin is presented in fig 12 akata epe eluju iberekodo located in the southern part of the basin have high recharge 2 5 mm in january this pattern is peculiar to all the five dry months november march in the study area arowomole oko ejigbo ifon etc found in the northern part of the basin have lower groundwater recharge for the same dry months meanwhile high recharge 129 213 mm is observed in september in the northeastern part in oke imesi efon alaye etc as well as in some southern parts of the basin in epe and ibeju lekki all the wet months in the study area have similar recharge pattern to the month of september table 6 shows the mean monthly groundwater recharge for different combinations of lulc and soil classes for september which is the month with highest groundwater recharge the highest recharge occurs on loamy sand soil with forest 181 mm bare surface 152 mm crops shrubs 133 mm lulc while the lowest values are on clay soil in built up 6 mm and wetland 32 mm areas the higher standard deviation values of the recharge for different lulc types table 6 indicate that recharge is less influenced by lulc type than by soil types 5 discussion groundwater recharge is one of the components of the hydrological cycle and this study conceptualized it as the residual of the hydrological cycle in other words it was conceptualized as the residual water that enters the groundwater system after inflow from rainfall and outflow through surface runoff stream discharge and actual evapotranspiration was estimated the direct measurement of these various components of the hydrological cycle is usually difficult because of the complex nature of the environmental system therefore it often requires the modelling of similar but simpler structures to improve its understanding the groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin varies over space and time because of the various environmental factors such as climate slope soil type lulc etc controlling the amount of direct recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge with the adoption of a spatially distributed water balance model has provided a new hydrological insight for the osun drainage basin in the basement complex rocks of nigeria this new insight particularly on groundwater recharge will assist the stakeholders and government agencies in the area to develop and use the groundwater of this region in a way that is more sustainable without resulting to unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences ashaolu 2018 alley et al 1999 it is usually better to understand and discuss the various components of the water balance of the region because of their interconnectivity hence besides groundwater recharge which is the focus of this research the other three important components interception aet surface runoff of the water balance were discussed as well the average monthly water balance viz interception surface runoff aet and groundwater recharge for the period 1974 2015 revealed that most of the water balance components follow the temporal pattern of rainfall amount in the basin fig 10 this implies that rainfall variability and the number of dry and wet episodes in the basin determines the rate and pattern of the water balance components especially the groundwater resources that depends mainly on rainfall in this type of environment for example the month of september that has the highest mean monthly rainfall amount 290 mm also has the highest recharge 102 mm and runoff 79 mm this is in agreement with an earlier study in lake chad where most of the mean seasonal water budget components follow the change in seasonal rainfall amounts babama aji 2013 the observed mean monthly hydrological feedbacks in osun drainage basin shows that most of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration 43 especially in the dry months of november to march fig 11 despite the huge percentage 43 of rainfall amount being lost to aet more water is able to infiltrate into the soil and percolate to recharge the groundwater system in the wet months particularly in september which coincides with the month of highest rainfall in the basin as expected there is more surface runoff in the wet months compared to the dry months the percentage of runoff from rainfall however varies from month to month depending on the rainfall amount rainfall intensity and the antecedent soil moisture interception is the least 9 important component of the hydrological budget in osun drainage basin the small percentage in the mean annual interception can be attributed to the fact that the original rainforest of the basin has been lost over time in fact forest area coverage as of 2015 was only 22 of the total basin area interception is the first component of the hydrological budget that respond to rainfall in an environment muzylo et al 2009 and it is a function in wetspass m of rainfall amount and intensity wind speed and leaf area index lai babama aji 2013 interception rate is shown to be high in the wet months compared to the dry months thus the rainfall interception ratio indicated that the interception percentage depends largely on the amount of rainfall received in any particular month the result is similar to the earlier observation by babama aji 2013 that the lake chad basin exhibited higher interception in the mixed forest area found in the southern part of the basin than in the open vegetation found in the west central part the study by van dijk et al 2011 also revealed that interception was higher in areas of tall forests compared to those of lower vegetation such as grassland or agricultural crops the northwest zone of the basin is characterized by lower vegetation such as grassland or agricultural crops which is responsible for the lower interception rate observed the zone also received lower rainfall amount compared to other parts of the basin le maitre et al 1999 reported that vegetation cover alters rate of recharge by directly disturbing the passage of rainfall from the atmosphere to the land surface and to the water table by deflecting part of the rainfall however the section of the basin with lower vegetation are also areas of lower recharge and rainfall meanwhile the southern part of the basin with high vegetation also recorded high rainfall amount and high recharge rate therefore the intensity and duration of rainfall windspeed can be said to be responsible for this pattern the high surface runoff in september can be attributed to the antecedent soil moisture of the preceding months this might not be unconnected to the fact that soil has become completely saturated with rainfall of the previous months thereby making infiltration low or nonexistent the low runoff in the dry months particularly january 0 mm is because soil matrix is expectedly dry during this period hence the little rainfall received was quickly absorbed thereby resulting in little or no surface runoff it was discovered that about 22 of total annual rainfall amount became surface runoff in the basin during the period under investigation this result is higher than what was found in the semi arid arid and temperate environment in earlier studies tesfamicheal et al 2013 teklebirhan et al 2012 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 dams et al 2007 for example in the arid jafr basin jordan al kuisi and el naqa 2013 observed that as low as 5 of the total annual rainfall became surface runoff the differences in the results obtained in arid environment compared to the tropical environment where osun drainage basin is located is attributed to the extreme dryness of the arid zone the highest surface runoff in the central part and towards the southern part of the basin is expected as surface runoff is usually high in areas towards and close to the mouth of a drainage basin high surface runoff of the built up areas like osogbo ilesha and on rock outcrops in the northeastern zone indicated that interaction between rainfall and surface runoff varies from place to place within the basin the high runoff observed around alaguntan apoje and other areas in the central part toward the southern part of the basin can be associated with the presence of clay soil which has low permeability the low permeability of clay soil enhanced surface runoff in this part of the basin similar results observed by babama aji 2013 in the lake chad basin was also attributed to the low permeability nature of clay soil al kuisi and el naqa 2013 also attributed the high surface runoff in jafr basin jordan to silt clay soil which have low permeability in most of the northern and the northwestern part of the basin there is less surface runoff especially during the dry months fig 12 the pattern observed is also associated with the high composition of sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils found in this part of the basin this may be connected to the fact that infiltration rate on these soils hinder high surface runoff it is important to point out that regardless of the lulc types areas with clay soil sandy clay loam tend to generate high amount of surface runoff while places with loamy sand and sandy loam soils generate lower surface runoff the results of the different combinations of lulc and soil classes revealed that surface runoff pattern in the basin is highly controlled by the effect of soil types rather than the effect of land use land cover type or slope high surface runoff has been attributed to soil texture rather than land use land cover types in some earlier studies teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 babama aji 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 the comparison of the simulated surface runoff and observed stream discharge suggests that wetspass m estimated lower and higher run offs in dry and wet months respectively this may be as a result of the same lulc used for all the months without given consideration to the variation in land cover from one month to another especially when we know that grasses and low vegetation often influence the rate of runoff between wet and dry months the pearson moment correlation coefficient of 0 98 exists between the observed and simulated surface runoff while the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 89 the results of these two coefficients showed good agreements which indicate that the wetspass m model is an efficient tool that can be used to predict surface runoff in the osun drainage basin the results of aet in osun basin are in agreement with previous studies tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 teklebirhan et al 2012 elsewhere that suggested that evapotranspiration is the major process by which water loss from a drainage basin occurred however this can further be related to the climate especially rainfall amount temperature and vegetation of such basin these studies revealed that basins in the arid and semi arid region loose higher percentage of rainfall amount received to evapotranspiration compared to basins in the tropics for example tesfamicheal et al 2013 found that 76 of precipitation was lost to evapotranspiration annually in geba basin ethiopia while it is as high as 81 in illala catchment ethiopia teklebirhan et al 2012 a very large percentage of 95 of the annual rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration in both the jaffr basin jordan al kuisi and el naqa 2013 and the lake chad basin babama aji 2013 the percentage of aet to rainfall in the basin is highest for the months of january and december which are the months with lowest amount of rainfall the sparse rainfall and few number of rainy days in these two months as well as high evaporative power of the atmosphere in these dry months is responsible for this observation however in terms of absolute aet the highest 95 mm aet occurs in october while lowest 10 mm is in january the observed pattern of high aet on water bodies can be attributed to the fact that evaporation mostly takes place on open water surfaces of streams and lakes in dry months because there is little rainfall during this time of the year generally larger percentage of evaporation takes place on open water surfaces compared to other land classes even during the wet period this result is consistent with the findings of babama aji 2013 in lake chad basin and pan et al 2011 in guishui river basin china in general ikoyi aba epo ejigbo oko inisha okuku igbajo ijero etc located in the northern part of the osun drainage basin have low evapotranspiration due to the low rainfall amount and the relatively low percentage area covered with forest the southern part of the basin on the other hand found in areas such as alaguntan ijebu ife apoje kure apomu and others have high evapotranspiration as a result of high rainfall amount and large areas with tall trees the wetspass m model predicted higher groundwater recharge in the wet months of april to october while more recharge was estimated by the hydrograph baseflow separation method in the dry months of november to march compared to the wetspass m prediction the estimated mean annual groundwater recharge was 337 mm from the hydrography separation method and 430 mm from the wetspass m model the difference in the mean annual recharge from the two methods is partly caused by the fact that the discharge data used in baseflow separation covered a period of 20 years 1980 1999 while the climatic parameters used in wetspass m model covered a period of 40 years 1976 2015 another reason might also be because baseflow discharge is not always directly equated to recharge for reasons such as pumpage evapotranspiration and underflow to deep aquifers which may also be significant in some cases scanlon et al 2002 as stated earlier that some previous studies fmwr 2014a oke et al 2015 on groundwater recharge in southwestern nigeria lumped ogun and osun drainage basins together as a unit of investigation and reported mean annual recharge for the two basins as one thus the result of wetspass m model for osun is compared with the result of ogun osun basin of these earlier studies the result of wetspass m is higher than the values given by oke et al 2015 that adopted three empirical methods and fmwr 2014a that an employed rainfall runoff model for the lumped ogun osun river basin the mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by the three methods by oke et al 2015 range from 232 mm to 205 mm or about 16 18 of mean annual rainfall amount while fmwr 2014a recharge estimate was 236 mm year the reasons for the differences might be due to the scale of the study area because the recharge values by the two studies were for both ogun and osun drainage basins the other reason might be due to definitions the generated recharge map by wetspass m is the spatial distributed map of potential recharge which is similar to infiltration the percentage of rainfall that recharges the aquifer in the osun drainage basin is higher than what was reported in studies in dry environment adelana et al 2006 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 babama aji 2013 and relatively lower to what was reported in temperate environment dams et al 2008 most recharge occurred between april and october which coincides with the rainy season in the study area this indicated the relevance of rainfall to groundwater recharge in the basement complex aquifer the months with the highest rainfall amount are those with higher recharge to the groundwater system the high recharge estimated for akata epe eluju iberekodo located in the southern part of the basin have high recharge in the five dry months of november to march might be due to the fact that the southern part of the basin receives early rainfall also arowomole oko ejigbo ifon etc found in the northern part of the basin have lower groundwater recharge for the same dry months this is as a consequences of late rainfall onset and early cessation in the northern part of the basin this explains why there are drying up of shallow wells in the dry months when there is little or no rainfall in the basin especially in the northern part during the dry period private owned shallow wells and some public hand pump wells usually fail oftentimes their operators keep them under lock after the first trip of water fetching in the morning this is usually done in order for the aquifer to recover a reasonable yield for households to fetch later in the evenings in the same vein the recharge to groundwater system is easily noticeable in shallow wells after individual rainfall event in wet months during these months wells and hand pump wells are hardly seen under locks because the groundwater level is usually high the high recharge to aquifer in oke imesi efon alaye etc in the northeastern part and epe ibeju lekki among many other areas in the southern parts of the basin during wet months can be attributed to the presence of permeable soils of the sandy loam and loam sand type found in high proportion in these areas coupled with the lulc types in such areas most of the built up area have a reasonable monthly mean recharge rate of between 68 87 mm month during the wet months this may be due to the nature of the built up area where the ratio of bare lands is high compared to impervious structures such as building roads and paved surfaces in the basin this result is at variant with what de smedt and batelaan 2003 reported in belgium where relatively low recharge was observed in built up area the reasons for the relatively low recharge in their study can be associated with high level of paved surfaces in built up areas in their study area compared to the relatively low level of pavement obtainable in developing countries like nigeria in spite of this general recharge pattern observed local variation in recharge rate among settlements occur from one month to another for example in april while recharge ranges between 0 21 mm in ogbomosho and ikulamberu in the northwestern part it is 21 36 mm in osogbo and ilesha in the northeastern part of the basin both osogbo and ilesha received higher rainfall than ogbomosho and ikulamberu in the northwest in addition the number of rainy days in each of these settlements are also different and could be responsible for such variation in fact most areas like ogbomosho ikulamberu osogbo ibokunimesi ile ara moko and igede that have low recharge are located in the northern part of the basin the low recharge in the northern part corroborates the study on groundwater potential and yield by akinwumiju 2015 in those settlements that fall within osun and ekiti states in the basin thus the recharge to the groundwater system in any area determines to a large extent the groundwater reserve and potential of such location especially on the basement complex terrain meanwhile high recharge rate was found in the north eastern part of the basin especially in the settlements and areas located on the uplands of oke imesi efon alaye igbajo iwaraja ijebujesa and ijeda the recharge rates in the month of september in these locations ranged between 129 213 mm high recharge rates in this part are attributed in part to high rainfall amount received due to orographic effect of the uplands the recharge rate to groundwater system therefore determines the groundwater potential and yield of the aquifers especially in a basement complex where we have shallow aquifers this may be the reason why akinwumiju 2015 ranked these places in the northeastern part of the basin as areas with high groundwater potential and groundwater yield in the basin although it can be argued that the aquifer type determines groundwater potential but the argument is more favourable in sedimentary basins with a long term storage capability rather than in the basement complex aquifer that relies on present day recharge the basement complex aquifer relying on the present day recharge becomes more visible in the dry months with little or no rainfall when some shallow wells completely dry up the shallowness of this type of aquifer makes its storage capability respond to the vagaries of the climatic conditions more sharply in addition the mean monthly groundwater recharge for different combinations of lulc and soil classes for september in the basin revealed that the largest amount of recharge occurs on loamy sand soils with forest bare surface crops shrubs lulc while the lowest values are on clay soil in built up and wetland areas the higher standard deviation values of the recharge for different lulc types table 4 indicate that recharge is more influenced by lulc type than by soil types this is at variant with the results of babama aji 2013 who reported that recharge in the lake chad basin was dependent on the soil type 6 conclusion a spatially distributed monthly water balance model was applied to evaluate the water balance of osun drainage basin nigeria with emphasis on groundwater recharge about 93 of this basin is underlain by the basement complex aquifer which makes the groundwater occurrence in most parts of the basin to be shallow most of the inhabitants of this basin depend on groundwater for their water use a result of the erratic nature of public water supply which is often sourced from the surface water in this study the major components of water balance such as actual evapotranspiration interception surface runoff and groundwater recharge were simulated to have holistic understanding of the water budget of the study area with emphases on groundwater recharge the results of water balance analysis indicate that about 27 of the total rainfall in osun drainage basin resulted in groundwater recharge while the remaining were lost through evapotranspiration 43 surface runoff 21 and interception 9 september is the month with the highest groundwater recharge rate that ranges between 0 73 mm in the north and 129 213 mm in the south and some part of northeast of the basin a reasonable amount of groundwater recharge was found in most of the built up areas which suggest that there are more bare surfaces within the urban and rural settlements in the basin that allows infiltration and percolation of rainwater groundwater resources might be vulnerable to contamination especially in areas with high recharge rates in built up areas and crops shrubs lulc types based on the nature of waste dumping and fertilizer application this is because of the shallow aquifer in majority of the basin that makes it relatively easy for contaminants to infiltrate into the deep zones as part of the recharge process this study estimated the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater recharge on a monthly time scale in a basin where the available groundwater resources depend on present day recharge the monthly spatial and temporal status of the groundwater resources in the basin should be taken into consideration in preparing sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the osun drainage basin in addition efforts should be geared towards improving meteorological and hydrological data collection in the basin on a smaller time scale such as daily which can be used to estimate daily recharge and improve groundwater management

8395,study region osun drainage basin nigeria study focus estimating spatial and temporal patterns of recharge is important for sustainable groundwater resources management this is especially true for data poor regions such as the basement complex in nigeria which has shallow aquifers a proliferation of wells and no efficient groundwater monitoring network this study evaluates the performance of a spatially distributed monthly water balance model wetspass m in estimating groundwater recharge the wetspass m model has moderate data demands which allows for comprehensive assessment of recharge new hydrological insights for the region 27 of the rainfall in osun drainage basin becomes recharge while the remaining is lost through evapotranspiration 43 surface runoff 21 and interception 9 september is the month with highest recharge ranging between 0 and 73 mm in the north and 129 up to 213 mm in the south and northeast of the basin the study revealed the significance of the applied water balance model in understanding the spatial and temporal status of recharge therefore the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge should be taken into consideration in preparing a sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the osun drainage basin artificial recharge might be adopted to store storm water runoff during wet periods to improve the groundwater supply in dry months also monthly groundwater withdrawals should be regulated in relation to spatial and temporal recharge patterns keywords groundwater recharge wetspass m groundwater management osun basin 1 introduction groundwater recharge estimation is a well established research area omorinbola 1986 lerner et al 1990 beekman et al 1996 finch 1998 arnold et al 2000 finch 2001 armbruster and leibundgut 2001 de vries and simmers 2002 lerner 2002 edmunds et al 2002 batelaan et al 2003 sophocleous 2004 goni et al 2005 adelana et al 2006 batelaan and de smedt 2007 nolan et al 2007 hamza et al 2007 jyrkama and sykes 2007 mileham et al 2008 milewski et al 2009 healy 2010 pan et al 2011 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamichael et al 2013 zomlot et al 2015 abdollahi et al 2017 however the paucity of data and limited research capacity in developing countries such as nigeria means that there is a lack of understanding recharge variability for large parts of the developing world this can be attributed to the complex nature of groundwater resources and its interaction with the ecosystem and to what taylor and tindimugaya 2012 called the limited hydrological knowledge base human and institutional capacity in the tropical regions of the world researchers in nigeria have strived to estimate groundwater recharge of locations and drainage basins across the country using different methods some of these methods include tracers isotopes adanu 1991 edmunds et al 2002 goni et al 2005 sani et al 2012 empirical relationships omorinbola 1982 1986 carter 1994 carter and alkali 1996 adeleke et al 2015 ashaolu 2016a soil moisture balance and water table fluctuation adindu et al 2013 oke et al 2014 and hydrograph separation method ifabiyi 2004 idowu and martins 2007 other scholars also adopted a combination of two or more methods adelana et al 2006 or different empirical equations oke et al 2015 with the intention of comparing the results also previous studies fmwr 2014a oke et al 2015 on groundwater recharge in southwestern nigeria lumped ogun and osun drainage basins together as a unit of investigation and reported a single mean annual recharge for the two basins the methods highlighted above have restricted spatial and temporal capability and assessed recharge on an annual or seasonal time scale thereby neglecting important smaller time scale monthly recharge variability neither did these studies examine the interconnectivity between groundwater and surface water resources despite their intrinsic role in the hydrological cycle it has been stressed that groundwater resources do not exist in isolation but are connected to surface water resources and the terrestrial ecosystems unesco 2008 hence both should be conceptualized as a combined resource winter et al 1998 adopting an integrated system approach that recognizes groundwater system as part of the hydrologic cycle is paramount when examining groundwater availability and long term aquifer sustainability healy et al 2007 unesco 2008 bredehoeft 2011 also suggested that a holistic approach is needed in assessing the relationships between groundwater and surface water because groundwater cannot be managed independently from surface water without considering their interdependencies these issues call for a need to employ an integrated approach for groundwater recharge estimation owing to the complexities in direct assessment of the water budget hydrologists and water resources engineers have widely adopted hydrological models to enable its comprehension ashaolu 2017 there are several recharge estimation models such as swat arnold et al 2000 svat armbruster and leibundgut 2001 and dream manfreda et al 2005 that are data intensive and based on complex hydrological process calculations thereby reducing their application in developing countries where hourly or daily climatic data are scarce abdollahi et al 2017 the wetspass model batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 estimate groundwater recharge on seasonal and annual basis which limited its application in the basement complex rocks terrain where intra seasonal recharge processes are important and hence a smaller time step for the recharge estimation is required for sustainable groundwater management thus the general scientific aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of the wetspass m model for its capability to estimate regional spatially and temporally monthly variable groundwater recharge under conditions of limited data availability as is typical in tropical continental climate regions and basement complex rocks terrain the choice for the wetspass m model is based on the premise that it offers an efficient approach for basins where there is sparse monitoring and lack of data on hydrological processes abdollahi et al 2017 studies in different parts of the world have adopted wetspass models in assessing the water balance which yielded satisfying results batelaan and de smedt 2001 2007 de smedt and batelaan 2003 dams et al 2007 pan et al 2011 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 zomlot et al 2015 2017 melki et al 2017 mustafa et al 2017 abdollahi et al 2017 the last three references applied wetspass m while only the bangladesh study area of mustapha et al 2017 has a similar climate albeit this study did not focus on the wetspass m performance and has very different hydrogeological conditions groundwater occurrence in the basement complex rocks aquifer in any environment is defined by the presence of a shallow water table and significant amount of natural recharge is mainly from rainfall sekhar et al 1994 nyagwambo 2006 and the groundwater residence time is about three to six months nyagwambo 2006 as there is a high temporal rainfall variability ashaolu 2018 in nigeria estimating only annual and seasonal recharge in the basement complex aquifer will not be sufficient for understanding intra and inter annual variability of the groundwater resource this study focuses on osun drainage basin which is one of the two major drainage basins in southwestern nigeria the basement complex rocks underlie about 93 of this basin it constitutes a poor aquifer although sizeable amount of groundwater is found in areas with deeply weathered regolith ashaolu 2016a ashaolu and adebayo 2014 taylor and howard 2000 azeez 1972 in addition increasing population put at 12 million in 2018 is putting pressure on water resources development within the osun drainage basin it has been argued that long term water resource planning requires both spatial and temporal information on groundwater recharge to properly manage not only water use and exploitation but also land use allocation and development jyrkama and sykes 2006 hence this study will help in the long term sustainable groundwater resources management in the study area 2 study area the osun drainage basin is located between latitudes 6 25 58 79ʺ and 8 21 3 6ʺ n and longitudes 3 47 34 8ʺ and 5 10 55 2ʺ e in south western nigeria it extends over 9 259 km2 the osun drainage system rises in oke mesi ridge about 5 km north of effon alaiye and flows north through the itawure gap to latitude 7 53ʺ before turning westwards via osogbo ede and southwards to flow into lagos lagoon about 8 km east of epe fig 1 ogun oshun river basin development authority oorbda 1982 oke et al 2013 ashaolu 2016b the basin climate is influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the quasi stationary boundary that distinguishes the sub tropical continental air mass over the sahara and the equatorial maritime air mas over the atlantic ocean the sub tropical continental air mass is marked by the dry north easterly winds known as harmattan while equatorial air mass is marked with the rain bearing south westerly winds from the gulf of guinea oorbda 1982 the basin experiences two types of seasons dry and rainy wet season the dry season is a period of minimal rainfall when the northeast trade wind dominates the rainy season starts by the end of april when the basin is under the influence of the southwest trade wind which is a rain bearing wind ifabiyi 2005 the switch from the rainy season to the dry season is abrupt while the onset of the rain after the dry season is gradual oorbda 1982 the salient feature of the rainfall pattern is its seasonal distribution fig 2 the rainy season begins earlier in the south around march and continues until the end of october or early november in the north around ogbomosho the rain begins in late april or early may and end in mid october giving six months of rainfall dry days are frequent and regular in late july and early august which was termed the little dry season the mean 1976 2015 wet season rainfall varies from 1020 mm to 1520 mm in the south of the basin to less than 1020 mm in the north on the other hand the mean dry season rainfall varies from 127 to 178 mm in the north while it varies from 178 to 254 mm in the south oorbda 1982 meanwhile the mean annual 1976 2015 rainfall amount for osun drainage basin estimated from the records of the 24 weather stations is 1620 mm the rainfall amount between 1976 and 2015 exhibits a non significant decreasing trend in osun drainage basin using mann kendall trend analysis fig 3 table 1 the months of february and march are the hottest in the basin and temperatures are high over the entire basin during this period fig 4 there is also variation in temperature from the south to the north where it is higher the lowest mean 1976 2015 minimum temperature in the north is usually in december during harmattans while it is usually recorded in july during the rainy season in the southern part of the basin oorbda 1982 the mean annual 1976 2015 temperature is about 30 c which can vary depending on the location and time of the year ifabiyi 2005 the temperature in the study area revealed a significant increasing trend over the period of 1976 2015 fig 5 table 1 in general relative humidity decreases northwards in the basin the mean annual humidity varies from 75 in the south to 55 in the north oorbda 1982 the basin is underlain by two types of rocks which are the basement complex rocks 9259 km2 or about 93 and the sedimentary deposits 668 km2 or about 7 fig 6 oorbda 1982 oke et al 2013 ashaolu 2016b the basement complex consists mainly of folded gneiss schist and quartzite complexes which belong to the older intrusive series with outcrops visible in many places oke et al 2013 the age of the basement complex rocks of the study area belong to two eras the archean age 2500ma 2750 25ma and the early proterozoic age 2000ma 2500ma ajibade et al 1987 rahman 1988 sedimentary rocks of cretaceous and later deposits are found in the southern sections of the osun basin oke et al 2013 the soils belong to the highly ferruginous tropical red soils associated with basement complex rocks four soil types were identified in the basin on basis of their texture fig 7 these are clay 29 sandy clay loam 51 sandy loam 16 and loamy sand soil 4 ashaolu 2016b the population distribution pattern of the basin is quite uneven the urban population in the basin is larger than the rural population besides available records from different investigations and surveys confirmed a migration of population from the rural areas to the cities based on the 1963 population census of western nigeria the estimated population of the basin made by ogun oshun river basin development authority in 1980 was 4 2 million and this was used as the basis of estimation for year 2015 at an annual rate of 3 to be about 12 million ashaolu 2018 3 material and methods 3 1 data the data used in this study include climatic data such as rainfall amount mm number of rainy days temperature ºc sunshine hour relative humidity and wind speed m s collected from the nigeria meteorological agency nimet also climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data on precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep were downloaded from https globalweather tamu edu website the cfsr provides a high resolution global reanalysis a best estimate of the observed state of the atmosphere of past weather at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 the available 24 weathers stations used in this study are those that fall within and close to the drainage basin fig 1 the data on all the climatic variables spanned 40 years 1976 2015 the trend in the climatic variables determined by mann kendall trend statistics is presented in table 1 however some of the stations like abeokuta and the cfsr stations did not have data to cover the period 1976 2015 therefore the missing years records were filled with data from other stations to achieve this data from abeokuta station 1981 2015 was correlated with data from other ground stations for the same period of 1981 2015 the station with the highest coefficient of correlation with abeokuta was used to fill the period 1976 1980 that have no record in abeokuta station a similar approach was adopted for the period 1976 1978 and 2015 that has no record in the cfrs data table s1 shows the summary of the climatic stations with their respective locations and years of record the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 this method was selected because it is physically based clearly incorporates both physiological and aerodynamic parameters as well as regarded as the most reliable predictor of pet rates under all climatic conditions jensen et al 1990 the eto calculator version 3 2 of fao was used to compute pet in this study raes 2012 the classified land use land cover maps of the study area for 2000 and 2015 by ashaolu et al 2019 were used in this study the classification adopted seven land use land cover classes bare surfaces built up area crops shrubs forest rock outcrops water bodies and wetland the classes fall under four main category of land use land cover vegetated cover bares soil open water and impervious surfaces as used by wetspass m for runoff parameterization table 2 shows that in the osun drainage area in 2000 crops shrubs bare surfaces and forest covered 42 27 and 21 respectively of the total basin in 2015 these coverages changed to 32 31 and 22 for respectively crops shrubs bare surface and forest while built up area accounted for 10 7 in 2015 a soil map of the study area was extracted from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 2012 prepared by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao digital elevation model dem with 30 m resolution of the study area was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission strm of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the slope and aspect maps of the study area were processed from the dem using arcgis due to the dearth of data on the depth to groundwater in the study area the mean depth to groundwater for the study area was adopted from the water level for the study area reported in the federal ministry of water resources fmwr 2014a 2014b national water resource master plan report of nigeria a 10 m depth to water was adopted for 93 of the basin underlain by the basement complex rocks and 50 m for the remaining 7 underlain by the sedimentary basin in the south the available few records from borehole logs show that depth to groundwater in the basin is more than 2 m the adoption of a mean depth to groundwater does not influence the wetspass m simulation results if the depth to groundwater in an area of investigation is more than the root depth tilahun and merkel 2009 tesfamicheal et al 2013 stream discharge data available at apoje gauging station for the period 1980 until january 2000 were collected from ogun oshun river basin development authority the hydrograph separation method was used to separate the runoff data into surface runoff interflow and baseflow using the semi logarithm method watson and burnett 1995 ifabiyi 2004 the baseflow computed is used as an approximation of long term recharge in the study area hence it is likely to be less than the amount of water that actually recharges the aquifer in osun drainage basin 3 2 wetspass wetspass m water balance modelling the wetspass m model is described in s1 the model requires two types of input data gis grid maps and parameters tables batelaan and de smedt 2001 the grid maps include slope land use land cover soil texture depth to groundwater and monthly climatic maps of rainfall amount temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed abdollahi et al 2017 all the input maps were converted into ascii grid format the monthly climatic parameters used in the model are available in all the 24 stations within and close to the basin mean monthly values of rainfall amount temperature potential evapotranspiration and wind speed for the period 1976 2015 were calculated from the available data in each station the mean monthly spatial digital maps of the parameters were determined by spatial interpolation of the values obtained in the stations using the universal kriging interpolation module in arcgis 10 4 wetspass m uses the usgs soil texture classes therefore the percentages of coarse medium and fine particle size fractions in the top soil was used to extract the soil texture map of the study area from harmonised world soil database hwsd the types of soil based on the texture are clay sandy clay loam sandy loam and loamy sand fig 7 land use number of rainy days and soil characteristic was specified as parameters tables in the model batelaan and de smedt 2001 tesfamichael et al 2013 abdollahi et al 2017 these tables were connected to the maps as attribute tables the land use attribute table include parameters related to land use type such as rooting depth leaf area index vegetation height manning coefficient among many others the soil parameter table contains soil parameters for each textural soil class such as field capacity wilting point permeability etc the runoff attribute is considered to be universal because a certain combination of slope land use and soil type will produce a certain fraction of runoff independent of location tesfamichael et al 2013 for the sake of matrix calculation all input maps into wetspass m must have uniform grid cell size i e the same spatial resolution however the data used in this study have different spatial resolutions which necessitated the need for resampling therefore all the secondary data lulc soil map and dem and the generated weather maps were resampled into 15 m resolution the nearest neighbor resampling method was adopted to resample the year 2000 and 2015 land use land cover maps and soil map because they are discrete data with distinct boundaries while bilinear technique was adopted in resampling the dem because of its continuous nature the land use land cover maps of the year 2000 fig 8 and 2015 fig 9 were selected as the lulc data input the simulation was first run using the lulc map of the year 2000 the mean monthly record of climatic variables for the period 1980 1999 was used as the weather input as well as the soil and dem of the study area for the first simulation the output of this simulation runoff and recharge were used in the calibration and validation of the model because runoff data in the study area spanned between 1980 1999 and was not available beyond january 2000 the model was calibrated manually using the following parameters soil moisture alfa coefficient α lpa calibration parameter which reduces the potential evapotranspiration depending on the soil moisture default is 0 65 interception parameter a and runoff delay factor x which were optimized according to the goodness of fit between the simulated runoff and the runoff from observed discharge at apoje station the calibration started with the soil moisture alfa coefficient abdollahi et al 2017 the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse were used for validation using the simulated and observed mean monthly discharge data of 1980 1999 at apoje gauge station the nash sutcliffe model efficiency is defined as 1 e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where e is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient q o is the mean of observed discharge q m is modeled discharge and q o t is the observed discharge at time t the result can range to 1 the closer the model efficiency is to 1 the more accurate the predicted model result in addition the hydrograph separation method was employed to estimate groundwater recharge using the runoff data from the apoje gauge station after the validation of the model for the study area the lulc of the year 2015 was adopted for simulating the mean monthly water budget for the period 1976 2015 a 10 m and 50 m mean depth to groundwater for the basement complex rocks and sedimentary basin respectively was prepared with an output cell size of 15 m while the processing extent was also set to 9977 14043 to have the same column and row and pixel size as the other variables the dem of the study area was used to produce the slope map in arcgis the prepared input data were inputted into the model to begin the simulation of the mean monthly water budget of osun drainage basin for the period 1976 2015 the outputs include several mean monthly spatio temporal hydrologic outputs but the mean interception actual evapotranspiration runoff and recharge are the main concern of this study 4 results 4 1 water budget components in osun drainage basin the mean monthly water budget and the ratio of rainfall amount to each of the water balance components are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively the results of each components of the water balance are presented in section 4 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 interception rate the monthly mean interception in osun drainage basin for the period 1976 2015 ranges from 1 mm in january to 23 mm in september while the mean annual interception is 146 mm this accounted for 9 of the mean annual rainfall amount 1620 mm from 1976 to 2015 table 3 the spatial distribution of the mean monthly interception in the osun drainage basin showed that high interception rates 3 47 mm are found in the forested areas in awaiye apomu alagutan apoje ijebu ife akata and epe etc in the middle of the basin down to the southern part low interception rate 0 3 mm is found in alawere ikoyi ogbomosho aba epo arowomole tafun iyalode and other places in the northwest zone of the basin fig 12 4 1 2 surface runoff the estimated mean monthly surface runoff ranges from 0 mm to 79 mm with a mean annual value of 348 mm year the highest mean rainfall amount occurred in september resulting in 27 becoming surface runoff the lowest surface runoff 0 mm occurred in december january and february and they coincide with the months that have the lowest mean monthly rainfall amount table 3 the mean monthly spatial pattern of surface runoff in the basin show that the highest surface runoff 209 430 mm is observed in apomu alaguntan apoje iganmeji and akata etc located in the central part towards the southern part of the basin for most of the months also high surface runoff was found in some months in the built up areas such as osogbo ilesha ede etc and on rock outcrops especially in the northeastern zone fig 12 the simulated result of runoff was compared to the observed stream discharge in apoje gauge station located in the southern part of the study area in order to validate the results of the model fig 13 the comparison suggests that wetspass m estimated lower and higher run offs in dry and wet months respectively the mean annual surface runoff for different combinations of lulc and soil classes show that the largest surface runoff 1925 mm occurred on clay soils with water body lulc while the lowest value 104 mm is on loamy sand soil in forest area table 4 the higher standard deviation values of the surface runoff for different lulc types indicate that surface runoff is less influenced by lulc type compared to the soil types in the study area 4 1 3 actual evapotranspiration the mean monthly aet in the basin ranges from 10 mm in january to 85 mm in october table 3 the annual mean aet in the basin is 696 mm year aet is the largest component of the water budget in osun basin constituting 43 of the annual rainfall amount the percentage of aet to rainfall in the basin is highest for the months of january 86 and december 86 which are the months with lowest amount of rainfall the spatial distribution of mean monthly aet in the osun basin showed that open water bodies have high evapotranspiration rate especially during the dry months november march for example the aet rate from the open water in january is between 29 190 mm the majority part of the basin experience high aet in wet months where majority of the basin in september recorded aet that ranges between 91 221 mm 4 1 4 groundwater recharge the estimated monthly distribution of groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin is presented in table 3 the mean monthly groundwater recharge varies from 0 mm in january to 102 mm in september the highest mean rainfall amount occurred in september of which 35 recharges the groundwater system while 2 of rainfall in january becomes groundwater recharge table 3 the estimated mean annual recharge in the basin was 430 mm this is 27 of the mean annual rainfall recorded in the basin for the period of study the results of the estimated recharge from baseflow separation and the wetspass m simulated recharge is presented in table 5 the correlation coefficient of the mean monthly recharge estimated from baseflow separation method and predicted by wetspass m is 0 97 which suggests a good agreement between the recharge estimation from the baseflow separation method and the wetspass m model the mean monthly spatial distribution patterns of groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin is presented in fig 12 akata epe eluju iberekodo located in the southern part of the basin have high recharge 2 5 mm in january this pattern is peculiar to all the five dry months november march in the study area arowomole oko ejigbo ifon etc found in the northern part of the basin have lower groundwater recharge for the same dry months meanwhile high recharge 129 213 mm is observed in september in the northeastern part in oke imesi efon alaye etc as well as in some southern parts of the basin in epe and ibeju lekki all the wet months in the study area have similar recharge pattern to the month of september table 6 shows the mean monthly groundwater recharge for different combinations of lulc and soil classes for september which is the month with highest groundwater recharge the highest recharge occurs on loamy sand soil with forest 181 mm bare surface 152 mm crops shrubs 133 mm lulc while the lowest values are on clay soil in built up 6 mm and wetland 32 mm areas the higher standard deviation values of the recharge for different lulc types table 6 indicate that recharge is less influenced by lulc type than by soil types 5 discussion groundwater recharge is one of the components of the hydrological cycle and this study conceptualized it as the residual of the hydrological cycle in other words it was conceptualized as the residual water that enters the groundwater system after inflow from rainfall and outflow through surface runoff stream discharge and actual evapotranspiration was estimated the direct measurement of these various components of the hydrological cycle is usually difficult because of the complex nature of the environmental system therefore it often requires the modelling of similar but simpler structures to improve its understanding the groundwater recharge in osun drainage basin varies over space and time because of the various environmental factors such as climate slope soil type lulc etc controlling the amount of direct recharge the estimation of groundwater recharge with the adoption of a spatially distributed water balance model has provided a new hydrological insight for the osun drainage basin in the basement complex rocks of nigeria this new insight particularly on groundwater recharge will assist the stakeholders and government agencies in the area to develop and use the groundwater of this region in a way that is more sustainable without resulting to unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences ashaolu 2018 alley et al 1999 it is usually better to understand and discuss the various components of the water balance of the region because of their interconnectivity hence besides groundwater recharge which is the focus of this research the other three important components interception aet surface runoff of the water balance were discussed as well the average monthly water balance viz interception surface runoff aet and groundwater recharge for the period 1974 2015 revealed that most of the water balance components follow the temporal pattern of rainfall amount in the basin fig 10 this implies that rainfall variability and the number of dry and wet episodes in the basin determines the rate and pattern of the water balance components especially the groundwater resources that depends mainly on rainfall in this type of environment for example the month of september that has the highest mean monthly rainfall amount 290 mm also has the highest recharge 102 mm and runoff 79 mm this is in agreement with an earlier study in lake chad where most of the mean seasonal water budget components follow the change in seasonal rainfall amounts babama aji 2013 the observed mean monthly hydrological feedbacks in osun drainage basin shows that most of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration 43 especially in the dry months of november to march fig 11 despite the huge percentage 43 of rainfall amount being lost to aet more water is able to infiltrate into the soil and percolate to recharge the groundwater system in the wet months particularly in september which coincides with the month of highest rainfall in the basin as expected there is more surface runoff in the wet months compared to the dry months the percentage of runoff from rainfall however varies from month to month depending on the rainfall amount rainfall intensity and the antecedent soil moisture interception is the least 9 important component of the hydrological budget in osun drainage basin the small percentage in the mean annual interception can be attributed to the fact that the original rainforest of the basin has been lost over time in fact forest area coverage as of 2015 was only 22 of the total basin area interception is the first component of the hydrological budget that respond to rainfall in an environment muzylo et al 2009 and it is a function in wetspass m of rainfall amount and intensity wind speed and leaf area index lai babama aji 2013 interception rate is shown to be high in the wet months compared to the dry months thus the rainfall interception ratio indicated that the interception percentage depends largely on the amount of rainfall received in any particular month the result is similar to the earlier observation by babama aji 2013 that the lake chad basin exhibited higher interception in the mixed forest area found in the southern part of the basin than in the open vegetation found in the west central part the study by van dijk et al 2011 also revealed that interception was higher in areas of tall forests compared to those of lower vegetation such as grassland or agricultural crops the northwest zone of the basin is characterized by lower vegetation such as grassland or agricultural crops which is responsible for the lower interception rate observed the zone also received lower rainfall amount compared to other parts of the basin le maitre et al 1999 reported that vegetation cover alters rate of recharge by directly disturbing the passage of rainfall from the atmosphere to the land surface and to the water table by deflecting part of the rainfall however the section of the basin with lower vegetation are also areas of lower recharge and rainfall meanwhile the southern part of the basin with high vegetation also recorded high rainfall amount and high recharge rate therefore the intensity and duration of rainfall windspeed can be said to be responsible for this pattern the high surface runoff in september can be attributed to the antecedent soil moisture of the preceding months this might not be unconnected to the fact that soil has become completely saturated with rainfall of the previous months thereby making infiltration low or nonexistent the low runoff in the dry months particularly january 0 mm is because soil matrix is expectedly dry during this period hence the little rainfall received was quickly absorbed thereby resulting in little or no surface runoff it was discovered that about 22 of total annual rainfall amount became surface runoff in the basin during the period under investigation this result is higher than what was found in the semi arid arid and temperate environment in earlier studies tesfamicheal et al 2013 teklebirhan et al 2012 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 dams et al 2007 for example in the arid jafr basin jordan al kuisi and el naqa 2013 observed that as low as 5 of the total annual rainfall became surface runoff the differences in the results obtained in arid environment compared to the tropical environment where osun drainage basin is located is attributed to the extreme dryness of the arid zone the highest surface runoff in the central part and towards the southern part of the basin is expected as surface runoff is usually high in areas towards and close to the mouth of a drainage basin high surface runoff of the built up areas like osogbo ilesha and on rock outcrops in the northeastern zone indicated that interaction between rainfall and surface runoff varies from place to place within the basin the high runoff observed around alaguntan apoje and other areas in the central part toward the southern part of the basin can be associated with the presence of clay soil which has low permeability the low permeability of clay soil enhanced surface runoff in this part of the basin similar results observed by babama aji 2013 in the lake chad basin was also attributed to the low permeability nature of clay soil al kuisi and el naqa 2013 also attributed the high surface runoff in jafr basin jordan to silt clay soil which have low permeability in most of the northern and the northwestern part of the basin there is less surface runoff especially during the dry months fig 12 the pattern observed is also associated with the high composition of sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils found in this part of the basin this may be connected to the fact that infiltration rate on these soils hinder high surface runoff it is important to point out that regardless of the lulc types areas with clay soil sandy clay loam tend to generate high amount of surface runoff while places with loamy sand and sandy loam soils generate lower surface runoff the results of the different combinations of lulc and soil classes revealed that surface runoff pattern in the basin is highly controlled by the effect of soil types rather than the effect of land use land cover type or slope high surface runoff has been attributed to soil texture rather than land use land cover types in some earlier studies teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 babama aji 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 the comparison of the simulated surface runoff and observed stream discharge suggests that wetspass m estimated lower and higher run offs in dry and wet months respectively this may be as a result of the same lulc used for all the months without given consideration to the variation in land cover from one month to another especially when we know that grasses and low vegetation often influence the rate of runoff between wet and dry months the pearson moment correlation coefficient of 0 98 exists between the observed and simulated surface runoff while the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 89 the results of these two coefficients showed good agreements which indicate that the wetspass m model is an efficient tool that can be used to predict surface runoff in the osun drainage basin the results of aet in osun basin are in agreement with previous studies tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 teklebirhan et al 2012 elsewhere that suggested that evapotranspiration is the major process by which water loss from a drainage basin occurred however this can further be related to the climate especially rainfall amount temperature and vegetation of such basin these studies revealed that basins in the arid and semi arid region loose higher percentage of rainfall amount received to evapotranspiration compared to basins in the tropics for example tesfamicheal et al 2013 found that 76 of precipitation was lost to evapotranspiration annually in geba basin ethiopia while it is as high as 81 in illala catchment ethiopia teklebirhan et al 2012 a very large percentage of 95 of the annual rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration in both the jaffr basin jordan al kuisi and el naqa 2013 and the lake chad basin babama aji 2013 the percentage of aet to rainfall in the basin is highest for the months of january and december which are the months with lowest amount of rainfall the sparse rainfall and few number of rainy days in these two months as well as high evaporative power of the atmosphere in these dry months is responsible for this observation however in terms of absolute aet the highest 95 mm aet occurs in october while lowest 10 mm is in january the observed pattern of high aet on water bodies can be attributed to the fact that evaporation mostly takes place on open water surfaces of streams and lakes in dry months because there is little rainfall during this time of the year generally larger percentage of evaporation takes place on open water surfaces compared to other land classes even during the wet period this result is consistent with the findings of babama aji 2013 in lake chad basin and pan et al 2011 in guishui river basin china in general ikoyi aba epo ejigbo oko inisha okuku igbajo ijero etc located in the northern part of the osun drainage basin have low evapotranspiration due to the low rainfall amount and the relatively low percentage area covered with forest the southern part of the basin on the other hand found in areas such as alaguntan ijebu ife apoje kure apomu and others have high evapotranspiration as a result of high rainfall amount and large areas with tall trees the wetspass m model predicted higher groundwater recharge in the wet months of april to october while more recharge was estimated by the hydrograph baseflow separation method in the dry months of november to march compared to the wetspass m prediction the estimated mean annual groundwater recharge was 337 mm from the hydrography separation method and 430 mm from the wetspass m model the difference in the mean annual recharge from the two methods is partly caused by the fact that the discharge data used in baseflow separation covered a period of 20 years 1980 1999 while the climatic parameters used in wetspass m model covered a period of 40 years 1976 2015 another reason might also be because baseflow discharge is not always directly equated to recharge for reasons such as pumpage evapotranspiration and underflow to deep aquifers which may also be significant in some cases scanlon et al 2002 as stated earlier that some previous studies fmwr 2014a oke et al 2015 on groundwater recharge in southwestern nigeria lumped ogun and osun drainage basins together as a unit of investigation and reported mean annual recharge for the two basins as one thus the result of wetspass m model for osun is compared with the result of ogun osun basin of these earlier studies the result of wetspass m is higher than the values given by oke et al 2015 that adopted three empirical methods and fmwr 2014a that an employed rainfall runoff model for the lumped ogun osun river basin the mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by the three methods by oke et al 2015 range from 232 mm to 205 mm or about 16 18 of mean annual rainfall amount while fmwr 2014a recharge estimate was 236 mm year the reasons for the differences might be due to the scale of the study area because the recharge values by the two studies were for both ogun and osun drainage basins the other reason might be due to definitions the generated recharge map by wetspass m is the spatial distributed map of potential recharge which is similar to infiltration the percentage of rainfall that recharges the aquifer in the osun drainage basin is higher than what was reported in studies in dry environment adelana et al 2006 teklebirhan et al 2012 tesfamicheal et al 2013 al kuisi and el naqa 2013 babama aji 2013 and relatively lower to what was reported in temperate environment dams et al 2008 most recharge occurred between april and october which coincides with the rainy season in the study area this indicated the relevance of rainfall to groundwater recharge in the basement complex aquifer the months with the highest rainfall amount are those with higher recharge to the groundwater system the high recharge estimated for akata epe eluju iberekodo located in the southern part of the basin have high recharge in the five dry months of november to march might be due to the fact that the southern part of the basin receives early rainfall also arowomole oko ejigbo ifon etc found in the northern part of the basin have lower groundwater recharge for the same dry months this is as a consequences of late rainfall onset and early cessation in the northern part of the basin this explains why there are drying up of shallow wells in the dry months when there is little or no rainfall in the basin especially in the northern part during the dry period private owned shallow wells and some public hand pump wells usually fail oftentimes their operators keep them under lock after the first trip of water fetching in the morning this is usually done in order for the aquifer to recover a reasonable yield for households to fetch later in the evenings in the same vein the recharge to groundwater system is easily noticeable in shallow wells after individual rainfall event in wet months during these months wells and hand pump wells are hardly seen under locks because the groundwater level is usually high the high recharge to aquifer in oke imesi efon alaye etc in the northeastern part and epe ibeju lekki among many other areas in the southern parts of the basin during wet months can be attributed to the presence of permeable soils of the sandy loam and loam sand type found in high proportion in these areas coupled with the lulc types in such areas most of the built up area have a reasonable monthly mean recharge rate of between 68 87 mm month during the wet months this may be due to the nature of the built up area where the ratio of bare lands is high compared to impervious structures such as building roads and paved surfaces in the basin this result is at variant with what de smedt and batelaan 2003 reported in belgium where relatively low recharge was observed in built up area the reasons for the relatively low recharge in their study can be associated with high level of paved surfaces in built up areas in their study area compared to the relatively low level of pavement obtainable in developing countries like nigeria in spite of this general recharge pattern observed local variation in recharge rate among settlements occur from one month to another for example in april while recharge ranges between 0 21 mm in ogbomosho and ikulamberu in the northwestern part it is 21 36 mm in osogbo and ilesha in the northeastern part of the basin both osogbo and ilesha received higher rainfall than ogbomosho and ikulamberu in the northwest in addition the number of rainy days in each of these settlements are also different and could be responsible for such variation in fact most areas like ogbomosho ikulamberu osogbo ibokunimesi ile ara moko and igede that have low recharge are located in the northern part of the basin the low recharge in the northern part corroborates the study on groundwater potential and yield by akinwumiju 2015 in those settlements that fall within osun and ekiti states in the basin thus the recharge to the groundwater system in any area determines to a large extent the groundwater reserve and potential of such location especially on the basement complex terrain meanwhile high recharge rate was found in the north eastern part of the basin especially in the settlements and areas located on the uplands of oke imesi efon alaye igbajo iwaraja ijebujesa and ijeda the recharge rates in the month of september in these locations ranged between 129 213 mm high recharge rates in this part are attributed in part to high rainfall amount received due to orographic effect of the uplands the recharge rate to groundwater system therefore determines the groundwater potential and yield of the aquifers especially in a basement complex where we have shallow aquifers this may be the reason why akinwumiju 2015 ranked these places in the northeastern part of the basin as areas with high groundwater potential and groundwater yield in the basin although it can be argued that the aquifer type determines groundwater potential but the argument is more favourable in sedimentary basins with a long term storage capability rather than in the basement complex aquifer that relies on present day recharge the basement complex aquifer relying on the present day recharge becomes more visible in the dry months with little or no rainfall when some shallow wells completely dry up the shallowness of this type of aquifer makes its storage capability respond to the vagaries of the climatic conditions more sharply in addition the mean monthly groundwater recharge for different combinations of lulc and soil classes for september in the basin revealed that the largest amount of recharge occurs on loamy sand soils with forest bare surface crops shrubs lulc while the lowest values are on clay soil in built up and wetland areas the higher standard deviation values of the recharge for different lulc types table 4 indicate that recharge is more influenced by lulc type than by soil types this is at variant with the results of babama aji 2013 who reported that recharge in the lake chad basin was dependent on the soil type 6 conclusion a spatially distributed monthly water balance model was applied to evaluate the water balance of osun drainage basin nigeria with emphasis on groundwater recharge about 93 of this basin is underlain by the basement complex aquifer which makes the groundwater occurrence in most parts of the basin to be shallow most of the inhabitants of this basin depend on groundwater for their water use a result of the erratic nature of public water supply which is often sourced from the surface water in this study the major components of water balance such as actual evapotranspiration interception surface runoff and groundwater recharge were simulated to have holistic understanding of the water budget of the study area with emphases on groundwater recharge the results of water balance analysis indicate that about 27 of the total rainfall in osun drainage basin resulted in groundwater recharge while the remaining were lost through evapotranspiration 43 surface runoff 21 and interception 9 september is the month with the highest groundwater recharge rate that ranges between 0 73 mm in the north and 129 213 mm in the south and some part of northeast of the basin a reasonable amount of groundwater recharge was found in most of the built up areas which suggest that there are more bare surfaces within the urban and rural settlements in the basin that allows infiltration and percolation of rainwater groundwater resources might be vulnerable to contamination especially in areas with high recharge rates in built up areas and crops shrubs lulc types based on the nature of waste dumping and fertilizer application this is because of the shallow aquifer in majority of the basin that makes it relatively easy for contaminants to infiltrate into the deep zones as part of the recharge process this study estimated the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater recharge on a monthly time scale in a basin where the available groundwater resources depend on present day recharge the monthly spatial and temporal status of the groundwater resources in the basin should be taken into consideration in preparing sustainable groundwater resources management plan for the osun drainage basin in addition efforts should be geared towards improving meteorological and hydrological data collection in the basin on a smaller time scale such as daily which can be used to estimate daily recharge and improve groundwater management

8396,study region the present study was conducted in the machángara alto and chulco rivers which belong to the paute basin in the provinces of azuay and cañar in southern ecuador study focus andean watersheds are important providers of water supply for human consumption food supply energy generation industrial water use and ecosystem services and functions for many cities in ecuador and in the rest of south america in these regions accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks in the context of flow forecasting this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models weap and gr2m and two models based on artificial neural networks ann that use meteorological data as input variables then a hybrid technique is proposed using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ann this approach aims to increase the accuracy of the simulated flow by combining and exploiting the information provided by physical and data driven models to assess the performance of the proposed methodology statistical analyses are conducted for two case studies in the andean region where comparative analyses are performed for the individual models and the hybrid technique new hydrological insights the results indicate that the proposed technique is able to improve the individual performance of physical and ann based models yielding good results in the calibration and validation stages for the two case studies specifically increases in nse were observed from 0 64 to 0 99 in the machángara alto river and from 0 88 to 0 99 in the chulco river higher accuracy of the hybrid technique was observed for all evaluation criteria considered in the analyses the performance of the hybrid technique was also reflected in terms of water supply and demand suggesting possible applications for the regional management of water resources where accurate flow predictions are of utmost importance keywords neural networks hydrological models flow forecasting andean watersheds ecuador 1 introduction andean mountains harbor a unique ecosystem known as páramo flores lópez et al 2016 currently in the countries of the andean region it is estimated that 40 million people depend directly on these ecosystems as their main sources of water josse et al 2011 nevertheless due to the geophysical complexity of the páramo its hydrological processes remain poorly studied buytaert et al 2011 flores lópez et al 2016 the use of numerical models may be a viable tool to tackle such difficulties and to provide crucial information for the regional management of water resources for instance the accuracy of flow predictions generated from different models can directly affect the planning of the operation of reservoirs used for the generation of hydroelectric energy irrigation and or human consumption jiang et al 2016 veintimilla reyes et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hydrological modeling can be divided into two categories physical methods and data driven methods weimin et al 2013 physical approaches typically involve knowledge based conceptual components which provide significant hydrological insights hosseini and mahjouri 2016 the main disadvantage of these modeling techniques is the presence of a large number of regionally dependent parameters that require calibration making their optimization difficult si min et al 2009 on the other hand the flow prediction of data driven methods is based on the statistical relationship between hydrological variables vrugt et al 2003 these techniques are capable of capturing patterns in extensive data sets based on purely numerical input output relationships consequently data driven methods have been widely used in hydrological modeling to describe rainfall runoff processes mu noz et al 2018 despite the significant predictive skills of data driven methods their black box nature lacks hydrological significance and robustness wang et al 2017 for instance failure to identify the driving factors of rainfall runoff processes strongly limits flow predictions in ungauged watersheds where models based on observable physical parameters may provide insightful information this study explores two physical models for flow simulation weap and gr2m the weap model developed by the stockholm environment institute is based on water balance at a monthly time scale where the user represents the system of water resources based on supply rivers groundwater and reservoirs water demand and ecosystem requirements mounir et al 2011 this model has shown success in studies of water supply and demand in several river basins as well as in the assessment of climate change impacts al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 abdella et al 2017 singh 2018 concerning regions relatively close to the present study area the weap model was used by lema changoluisa and plaza quezada 2009 to assess climate change scenarios for the pastaza river basin in ecuador the gr2m is a model based on parameter calibration that was proposed by the center for agricultural research and environmental engineering of france for the prediction of flows using precipitation and evapotranspiration time series at a monthly scale hernández et al 2013 the parsimony of the model guarantees robustness which allows for several applications in different countries and regions including the assessment of climate change makhlouf and michel 1994 zolfaghari et al 2013 lavado casimiro et al 2011 moreover the model has been used in conjunction with other methodologies to improve its results ytoui 2014 huard and mailhot 2008 regarding specific regions hernández et al 2013 performed the calibration and validation of the gr2m in the upper basin of the nazas river in mexico this river serves as a source of supply for the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco dams which provide water for the irrigation of 170 000 ha in

et al 2007 iliadis and maris 2007 wang et al 2017 in relation to the present study area veintimilla reyes et al 2016 implemented an ann model for real time flow prediction in the tomebamba river in the city of cuenca ecuador in other regions wang et al 2017 proposed a back propagation neural network algorithm and applied it to the semi distributed xinanjiang model at an hourly time scale the authors evaluated the procedure in the dingan river in china and reported significant improvements another hybrid approach was explored in the upper yalongjiang river basin in china by li et al 2018 the authors evaluated the swat vic and btopmc models in independent simulations and combined the results in a new ann the results indicate that the proposed methodology improves the individual results of the models at a daily time scale the objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a hybrid technique that uses the monthly simulated flow of physical and ann based models as input variables and configures a new ann with observed flow as the target variable the proposed technique aims to overcome the individual limitations of physical and data driven approaches by combining the robustness and hydrological significance of physical models with the black box predicting skills of data driven methods to this end we employ two physical models weap and gr2m and two ann based models with meteorological input variables precipitation and evapotranspiration the individual performances are analyzed and compared with the results of the hybrid technique using several evaluation criteria including a supply demand analysis for the region of interest the study is conducted for two rivers in the ecuadorian tropical andes where the complex climatic variability of the region implies significant challenges in flow forecasting 2 study area and data the study area encompasses the machángara alto and chulco rivers which cover areas of 132 km2 and 66 km2 respectively both rivers are located in the machángara sub basin of the paute river basin which is located in the provinces of azuay and cañar in southern ecuador fig 1 the machángara sub basin supplies water for two reservoirs chanlud and el labrado with storage capacities of 16 25 hm3 and 6 25 hm3 respectively these reservoirs supply water for irrigation and human consumption this region is influenced by air masses from the pacific ocean and the amazon basin and by complex climatic factors including the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the relief of orographic rainfall and marine currents from the pacific ocean particularly humboldt and el niño celleri et al 2007 coltorti and ollier 2000 pourrut and gómez 1998 sarmiento 1986 as shown by celleri et al 2007 precipitation in the machángara páramos presents a fairly uniform spatial distribution while seasonality is virtually non existent average rainfall average temperature and relative humidity range from 856 mm to 1309 mm from 8 1 c to 14 c and from 76 to 88 respectively the altitude of the machángara river basin ranges from 2500 to 4500 m a s l where topographic conditions play a significant role in meteorological processes estrella and tobar 2013 this work covers a time period from january 1979 to december 2010 for which data is widely available from the chanlud and el labrado stations located in the machángara river and the chulco river respectively fig 1 consequently both stations were selected for the analysis these meteorological stations are maintained by the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador inhami a summary of the meteorological data for both stations is provided in tables 1 and 2 3 methodology this section starts with the definition of the calibration and validation periods then the four models adopted for the analyses are presented 1 the weap physical model 2 the gr2m physical model 3 ann with precipitation data entry hereafter p nn and 4 ann with precipitation and evapotranspiration data entry hereafter p et0 nn the presentation of the hybrid technique follows which intends to increase the predictive skills of the four individual models criteria to evaluate the goodness of fit of the different approaches are explained followed by details on the validation procedure 3 1 calibration and validation periods the observed flow series were divided into two statistically similar periods 75 of the data was selected as a calibration period while the remaining 25 was used for validation to evaluate statistical similarity the presence of seasonal trends was first assessed using a mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 for each river using the computer tools developed by mcleod 2005 for the machángara river p values of 0 071 for the calibration period and 0 79 for the validation period were obtained while the chulco river presented p values of 0 06 for the calibration period and 0 77 for the validation period in both cases the p values larger than 0 05 indicate no significant trends the box plots in figs 2 and 3 show the monthly flow distribution for both periods which indicate similar temporal variability a statistical analysis for both study periods is summarized in tables 3 and 4 3 2 weap the weap physical model is a useful tool for the integrated planning of water resources it requires a calibration phase of input variables such as monthly precipitation monthly average temperature monthly relative humidity monthly wind speed and monthly flow the calibration parameters consist of water storage capacity in the root zone water storage capacity in the deep zone runoff resistance factor and root zone conductivity al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 for hydrological modeling the model adopts the soil moisture model method its operation is based on the representation of water balance in two layers of soil a higher one in which evapotranspiration is simulated considering rainfall and irrigation surface runoff subsurface runoff and deep percolation and a lower one that simulates the passage of the base flow and changes in the water content of the soil al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 the weap model is based on a semi distributed approach which divides the basin into several fractions of area each of which can represent different soil types or land uses water balance is then performed for each fraction further details on the model are presented by al omari et al 2014 and yi and sandoval solis 2015 the present calibration and validation of the weap model employ data available in the period from 1979 to 2010 the calibration phase was carried out with data between 1979 and 1999 while validation was performed between 2000 and 2010 the model was optimized by means of a trial and error procedure as such the performance of the weap model is associated with this specific calibrated product 3 3 gr2m gr2m is a conceptual physical model that estimates flows from rainfall and evapotranspiration data its calibration requires monthly precipitation monthly mean evapotranspiration and monthly flow as input variables the model operation is based on two tanks the reservoir soil related to a production function and the gravitational water reservoir where the contribution is instantaneous at the beginning and gradually empties with the passage of time the release of the gravitational water reservoir depends on the storage level mouelhi et al 2006 potential evapotranspiration is computed as a function of average temperature following the method proposed by thornthwaite et al 1954 for the latest version of the gr2m model the reader is referred to mouelhi 2003 the gr2m model consists of two parameters the tank capacity and a dimensionless constant these parameters are adjusted by optimizing an objective function for which the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse is adopted mouelhi 2003 in order to achieve an optimal set of parameters the generalized gradient code for nonlinear programming developed by lasdon et al 1976 was used in this study as for the weap model the performance of gr2m is hereby associated with this specific calibrated product 3 4 ann based models p nn and p et0 nn in ann based techniques the architecture of the neuron is represented as the sum of external stimuli z j followed by a non linear activation function y j f z j this function determines the output activity of the neuron this type of ann architecture is known as the mcculloch pitts perceptron tkacz et al 1999 fidalgo et al 2013 therein the user enters the data for both input and output variables to train the ann through a set of random weights the network begins the learning process in search for an optimal set which allows for pattern classification and error minimization crone 2002 perea et al 2016 the present study uses a feed forward back propagation neural network algorithm available in the matlab toolbox nntool zhong and xie 2012 the number of neurons in the hidden layer that yields an optimal performance was estimated by means of a trial and error procedure the hyperbolic sigmoidal tangent was used as a transfer function for training the bayesian regularization algorithm was applied which minimizes a convex combination of the mean square error this configuration of the ann is consistent with similar studies that report positive results e g fidalgo et al 2013 perea et al 2016 two ann based modeling alternatives are explored in the first p nn precipitation estimates comprised in the period from 1979 to 1999 were supplied to the ann as input data independent variable while the flow measurements in the same period were used as output data dependent variable in the second alternative p et0 nn the p nn model was enhanced by incorporating evapotranspiration input data which was calculated by means of the thornwaite method pereira and pruitt 2004 both ann models were subjected to a validation process with the corresponding input data in the period between 2000 and 2010 3 4 1 ann based hybrid technique the proposed hybrid technique is a multi model approach that aims to increase accuracy in flow predictions for this procedure the 4 time series obtained from the previously described models are used as the entry of a new ann the time series of the ann based models p nn and p et0 nn correspond to the results of the optimal number of neurons the configuration and training of the ann follows the trial and error procedure and bayesian regularization algorithm as described for p nn and p et0 nn 3 5 goodness of fit analysis a goodness of fit analysis was performed to compare the predicted time series to the observed data in both rivers the comparisons allow to observe the capability of the different models to capture temporal variation and extreme values to avoid subjectivity in the analyses a combination of graphical results absolute value error and normalized goodness of fit statistics was performed following the recommendations of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 where nse is used to indicate goodness of fit moreover following mccuen et al 2006 nse is complemented by bias quantification table 5 presents a summary of the threshold criteria for nse and pbias which are based on ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 and moriasi et al 2007 respectively this information is further complemented by root mean squared error to analyze the deviation of simulated flows 3 6 application to water resources management to evaluate the ability to integrate the present technique as a tool for the management of water resources in andean regions the weap supply demand component yates et al 2005 was used to perform a water supply demand analysis for the study area the water supply in hm3 month was computed from the simulated flow of the individual models and the hybrid technique in both rivers these quantities were then compared to the demand which was quantified as the sum of 3 demand points in the machángara catchment that are supplied by the chulco and machángara rivers the demand factors consist of water for purification in the tixán treatment plant and the irrigation channels machángara and la dolorosa these demand values are available in etapa 2016 and estrella and tobar 2013 for both reservoirs the inflows are measured through the estimation of storage volumes with respect to time the distribution model was constructed using the weap supply demand component in which water balance was performed a scheme of the system is shown in fig 4 showing the reservoirs channels diversions and demands 4 results 4 1 machángara river fig 5 shows the observed flow for the chanlud station in the machangara river and the simulated flow for the weap gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models in both calibration and validation phases the plots reveal that while weap generates a relatively good fit it is the only model that overestimates both high and low extreme values on the other hand the gr2m model adequately represents the dynamics of the flow but shows a poor estimation of peak flows and overestimates low flows 1 1 we recall that the results of the weap and gr2m models reflect the performance of the specific calibrated products used in the present study in turn p nn and p et0 nn present a relatively good fit but fail to capture the lowest flow rates in the calibration and validation phases in addition high flows are underestimated fig 6 shows the observed flow rates on the horizontal axis the simulated on the vertical axis and a 1 1 line to further visualize the accuracy of the predictions the flows simulated by the weap model are above the 1 1 line indicating bias particular for high flow rates for this model the calibration values for both nse and pbias are unsatisfactory table 5 with pbias indicating a significant overestimation of 34 67 an rmse value of 2 47 hm3 month was obtained corresponding to the highest of all 4 models in the validation stage nse increases to 0 72 corresponding to satisfactory while pbias and rmse decrease to 31 07 unsatisfactory and 2 25 hm3 month respectively as in the calibration stage bias increases for high flow rates with possible outliers in the case of the gr2m model a more dispersed distribution is observed around the 1 1 line in the calibration stage where the values below the 1 1 line indicate underestimation however in some cases higher overestimations than in the weap model are observed a satisfactory nse of 0 72 was obtained with a very good pbias of 4 15 however a high rmse of 2 17 hm3 month was obtained in the validation stage nse decreases to an unsatisfactory value of 0 60 which can be attributed to a pbias shift to underestimation and an increase in rmse to 2 66 hm3 month p nn shows a calibration satisfactory nse value of 0 75 a very good pbias of 0 29 and an rmse of 2 05 hm3 month the results indicate no significant outliers and a very low model bias showing rather acceptable

results of the proposed hybrid technique in the calibration and validation phases the time series indicate that the method accurately captures the flow dynamics of the machángara river drastically

consistent in the entire range of flow rates in the calibration stage with no significant outliers or non linear trends a very good nse of 0 991 is obtained with a very good pbias of 0 24 in the validation stage the results show an improvement with respect to all individual models yielding an nse of 0 99 moreover the persistent underestimation in the individual models apart from weap significantly decreases to a pbias of 1 33 the rmse is also remarkably low at 0 42 hm3 month table 6 presents the results of the 4 individual models in the machángara river for the calibration phase the nse coefficient corresponds to a very good fit in all cases both p nn and p et0 nn models present the best results in terms of nse with values of 0 75 weap model presents the lowest nse and an unsatisfactory pbias of 34 67 the p nn and p et0 nn models present a good fit in all coefficients in the validation phase weap presents the best results yielding an acceptable fit in terms of nse however the value of pbias was unsatisfactory presenting the lowest performance among the 4 models gr2m shows a bad nse equal to 0 60 similar bad fit is obtained for both data driven models 4 2 chulco river fig 9 shows the observed flow of the el labrado station in the chulco river and the simulated of the weap gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models for both calibration and validation phases the plots reveal that while the calibrated weap product presents a good fit it is the only model that overestimates both high and low extremes values on the other hand the product calibrated for the gr2m model adequately represents the flow dynamics but shows a poor estimation of peak flows and overestimates low flows finally the p nn and p et0 nn present a relatively good fit but fail to capture the lowest flow rates in the calibration and validation phases in addition high flows are underestimated fig 10 shows the observed flow rates on the horizontal axis the simulated on the vertical axis and a 1 1 line to further visualize the accuracy of the predictions the flows simulated by the weap model are above the 1 1 line indicating bias particular for high flow rates for this model the calibration values for both nse and pbias are unsatisfactory table 7 with pbias indicating a significant overestimation of 19 39 in addition an rmse value of 0 8 hm3 month was obtained in the validation stage nse decreases to 0 87 corresponding to good while pbias increases to 31 07 hm3 month unsatisfactory and rmse decreases 0 76hm3 month as in the calibration stage bias increases for high flow rates with possible outliers in the case of the gr2m model a more dispersed distribution is observed around the 1 1 line in the calibration stage where the values below the 1 1 line indicate underestimation however in some cases higher overestimations than in the weap model are observed a satisfactory nse of 0 78 was obtained with a very good pbias of 1 36 and an rmse of 0 95 hm3 month in the validation stage nse increases to a good value of 0 80 both pbias and rmse decrease to 0 57 and 0 92 hm3 month respectively p nn shows an acceptable calibration nse value of 0 77 a very good pbias of 1 06 and an rmse of 0 97 hm3 month the results indicate no significant outliers and a very low model bias showing rather acceptable results in the validation stage nse decreases to 0 76 accompanied by an underestimation with a pbias of 1 36 in the calibration stage the p et0 nn model presents an acceptable nse of 0 77 and a very good pbias of 0 52 with an rmse of 0 96 hm3 month the validation results for this model show an acceptable nse of 0 77 and a pbias of 0 98 the results are summarized in table 7 fig 11 shows the results of the proposed hybrid technique in the calibration and validation phases the time series indicate that the method accurately captures the flow dynamics of the chulco river drastically improving the results of the individual models shown in table 7 fig 12 shows data closely aligned to the 1 1 line indicating significant agreement with the observed data this performance remains consistent in the entire range of flow rates in the calibration stage with no significant outliers or non linear trends a very good nse of 0 99 is obtained with a very good pbias of 0 03 in the validation stage the results show an improvement with respect to all individual models yielding an nse of 0 99 moreover the persistent underestimation in the individual models apart from weap significantly decreases to a pbias of 2 61 the rmse is also remarkably low at 0 19 hm3 month table 7 presents the results of the 4 individual models in the chulco river for the calibration phase the nse coefficient corresponds to a very good fit in all cases the weap model presents the best results in terms of nse with values of 0 88 however a satisfactory pbias of 19 39 was obtained the gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models present a very good fit in all coefficients in the validation phase weap presents the best results yielding a very good fit in terms of nse however the value of pbias was satisfactory presenting the lowest performance among the 4 models 4 3 application as a tool for water resources management we compare the water supply of the individual techniques the hybrid technique and the observed data to the downstream demand obtained in terms of drinking water and irrigation in three demand sites obtained from etapa 2016 estrella and tobar 2013 the results are shown in fig 13 which presents the surplus that was obtained in all cases when compared to the observed data the calibrated weap output supply presents a significant overestimation which increases in the months of higher water supply in the cases of march april may and june overestimations are observed with a difference of up to 100 table 8 in agreement with the pbias observed in both rivers the results of gr2m pnn and p et0 nn deviate less than weap from the surplus of the observed data set however the results obtained by the gr2m model show an estimate of the surplus lower than all the models in wet months such as april and may while in most months with lower surpluses such as january august and october high overestimations occurred both ann models pnn and p et0 nn show similar results with underestimation from february to june on the other hand in the months of lower demand i e from october to december the simulations produced high overestimations in some cases such as october the overestimation was almost as high as the results of weap for the same month the hybrid technique presents very similar results to the observed surplus with small deviations throughout the different months however as expected all individual methods are consistently outperformed by the hybrid technique 5 discussion concerning the two physical models we emphasize that the results reflect the performance of the present calibrated products while improved calibration has not been studied nevertheless the results of the weap based product suggest that the accuracy of flow prediction using models that involve the calibration of several parameters is significantly compromised in regions with complex climatic conditions as in the case of andean watersheds on the other hand simpler models such as gr2m might not be able to represent the rainfall runoff processes due to the lack of representative parameters in turn the ann based models proved to be more accurate tools for flow forecasting than the products derived from the physical models in both case studies studies conducted by li et al 2018 in the upper yalongjiang basin in china apply an alternative hybrid approach that resembles the present work the authors use results from the swat vic and btopmc models as inputs and report very good results for simulations at a daily time scale with nse coefficients of 0 95 and 0 90 in the calibration and validation stages respectively consequently li et al 2018 suggest that using the results of different models as the input of a neural network can increase the goodness of fit in the prediction of flows this hypothesis was verified for the hybrid technique proposed in the present study significant improvements with respect to all four individual models were observed in both case studies with nse values around 0 99 in both calibration and validation stages to the knowledge of the authors these are the most accurate results to date in the two catchments under study this positive outcome may be attributed to the different nature of the information captured by the individual models which is combined in the hybrid neural network both the weap and gr2m physical models embed information directly related to monthly runoff processes while the p nn and p et0 nn models capture non linear relationships between the input climatic data and the output flows to further assess the capabilities of the proposed technique we compared the water supply of the individual models the hybrid technique and the observed data to the downstream demand obtained in terms of drinking water and irrigation in three demand sites when compared to the observed data as expected all individual methods are consistently outperformed by the hybrid technique 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to implement and evaluate a hybrid technique that uses the monthly simulated flow of two physical models weap and gr2m and two data driven methods with precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as input variables to configure a new ann with observed streamflow as the target variable the purpose of this technique was to overcome the limitations of physical and data driven models by combining their individual capabilities the results of the comparative statistical analyses indicate that the ann based hybrid technique provides major improvements over the individual models specifically the ability to capture peak flows is enhanced resulting in significantly better statistical values the results also reveal that the hybrid technique is more consistent than the individual models presenting similar results in the calibration and the validation phases from the present positive results the conditions under which the hybrid technique fails to improve the results of physical and data driven models could be not be addressed thus additional case studies are required to reveal such conditions in addition the performance of the physical models weap and gr2m was studied using calibrated data where the performance of the calibration procedure was not addressed consequently studies with different data sets resulting from physical models with improved calibration techniques are required to better study the enhancement capabilities of the hybrid technique this work can provide the basis for future studies for instance on the performance of the hybrid technique for extrapolating predictions to ungauged regions moreover ann based hybrid techniques for streamflow simulations emerge as a possible strategies to be used in the management of water resources where accurate predictions are of utmost importance in particular accurate streamflow predictions are required to study the supply and demand of water resources in regions where surplus levels are close to the deficit threshold for instance considering that the population in the city of cuenca grew from 104 470 to 329 928 inhabitants between 1974 and 2010 and that it is projected to reach around 861 682 by 2055 hermida et al 2015 the scarce surplus in certain months as shown in the present study for the months of january august and october implies concerns in terms of future availability to address these cases stochastic meteorological simulation methods e g for precipitation and temperature can be used to generate input data to be used in the hybrid technique this could allow to assess water availability under different scenarios at a regional scale accounting for the effects of population growth climate change and new demand sites conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest funding this work was funded by the university of cuenca through its research department diuc as part of the project titled evaluación del riesgo de sequías en cuencas andinas reguladas influenciadas por la variabilidad climática y cambio climático caso de estudio en la cuenca del río machángara acknowledgements we appreciate the provision of information of the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador 
8396,study region the present study was conducted in the machángara alto and chulco rivers which belong to the paute basin in the provinces of azuay and cañar in southern ecuador study focus andean watersheds are important providers of water supply for human consumption food supply energy generation industrial water use and ecosystem services and functions for many cities in ecuador and in the rest of south america in these regions accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks in the context of flow forecasting this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models weap and gr2m and two models based on artificial neural networks ann that use meteorological data as input variables then a hybrid technique is proposed using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ann this approach aims to increase the accuracy of the simulated flow by combining and exploiting the information provided by physical and data driven models to assess the performance of the proposed methodology statistical analyses are conducted for two case studies in the andean region where comparative analyses are performed for the individual models and the hybrid technique new hydrological insights the results indicate that the proposed technique is able to improve the individual performance of physical and ann based models yielding good results in the calibration and validation stages for the two case studies specifically increases in nse were observed from 0 64 to 0 99 in the machángara alto river and from 0 88 to 0 99 in the chulco river higher accuracy of the hybrid technique was observed for all evaluation criteria considered in the analyses the performance of the hybrid technique was also reflected in terms of water supply and demand suggesting possible applications for the regional management of water resources where accurate flow predictions are of utmost importance keywords neural networks hydrological models flow forecasting andean watersheds ecuador 1 introduction andean mountains harbor a unique ecosystem known as páramo flores lópez et al 2016 currently in the countries of the andean region it is estimated that 40 million people depend directly on these ecosystems as their main sources of water josse et al 2011 nevertheless due to the geophysical complexity of the páramo its hydrological processes remain poorly studied buytaert et al 2011 flores lópez et al 2016 the use of numerical models may be a viable tool to tackle such difficulties and to provide crucial information for the regional management of water resources for instance the accuracy of flow predictions generated from different models can directly affect the planning of the operation of reservoirs used for the generation of hydroelectric energy irrigation and or human consumption jiang et al 2016 veintimilla reyes et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hydrological modeling can be divided into two categories physical methods and data driven methods weimin et al 2013 physical approaches typically involve knowledge based conceptual components which provide significant hydrological insights hosseini and mahjouri 2016 the main disadvantage of these modeling techniques is the presence of a large number of regionally dependent parameters that require calibration making their optimization difficult si min et al 2009 on the other hand the flow prediction of data driven methods is based on the statistical relationship between hydrological variables vrugt et al 2003 these techniques are capable of capturing patterns in extensive data sets based on purely numerical input output relationships consequently data driven methods have been widely used in hydrological modeling to describe rainfall runoff processes mu noz et al 2018 despite the significant predictive skills of data driven methods their black box nature lacks hydrological significance and robustness wang et al 2017 for instance failure to identify the driving factors of rainfall runoff processes strongly limits flow predictions in ungauged watersheds where models based on observable physical parameters may provide insightful information this study explores two physical models for flow simulation weap and gr2m the weap model developed by the stockholm environment institute is based on water balance at a monthly time scale where the user represents the system of water resources based on supply rivers groundwater and reservoirs water demand and ecosystem requirements mounir et al 2011 this model has shown success in studies of water supply and demand in several river basins as well as in the assessment of climate change impacts al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 abdella et al 2017 singh 2018 concerning regions relatively close to the present study area the weap model was used by lema changoluisa and plaza quezada 2009 to assess climate change scenarios for the pastaza river basin in ecuador the gr2m is a model based on parameter calibration that was proposed by the center for agricultural research and environmental engineering of france for the prediction of flows using precipitation and evapotranspiration time series at a monthly scale hernández et al 2013 the parsimony of the model guarantees robustness which allows for several applications in different countries and regions including the assessment of climate change makhlouf and michel 1994 zolfaghari et al 2013 lavado casimiro et al 2011 moreover the model has been used in conjunction with other methodologies to improve its results ytoui 2014 huard and mailhot 2008 regarding specific regions hernández et al 2013 performed the calibration and validation of the gr2m in the upper basin of the nazas river in mexico this river serves as a source of supply for the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco dams which provide water for the irrigation of 170 000 ha in the area in peru alcántara et al 2014 reported positive results from the gr2m in the jequetepeque river artificial neural networks ann are computing systems that represent certain behavioral characteristics of the human brain li et al 2018 they have been successfully used as data driven prediction methods in reservoir operation and management of water resources maier and dandy 2000 aqil et al 2007 iliadis and maris 2007 wang et al 2017 in relation to the present study area veintimilla reyes et al 2016 implemented an ann model for real time flow prediction in the tomebamba river in the city of cuenca ecuador in other regions wang et al 2017 proposed a back propagation neural network algorithm and applied it to the semi distributed xinanjiang model at an hourly time scale the authors evaluated the procedure in the dingan river in china and reported significant improvements another hybrid approach was explored in the upper yalongjiang river basin in china by li et al 2018 the authors evaluated the swat vic and btopmc models in independent simulations and combined the results in a new ann the results indicate that the proposed methodology improves the individual results of the models at a daily time scale the objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a hybrid technique that uses the monthly simulated flow of physical and ann based models as input variables and configures a new ann with observed flow as the target variable the proposed technique aims to overcome the individual limitations of physical and data driven approaches by combining the robustness and hydrological significance of physical models with the black box predicting skills of data driven methods to this end we employ two physical models weap and gr2m and two ann based models with meteorological input variables precipitation and evapotranspiration the individual performances are analyzed and compared with the results of the hybrid technique using several evaluation criteria including a supply demand analysis for the region of interest the study is conducted for two rivers in the ecuadorian tropical andes where the complex climatic variability of the region implies significant challenges in flow forecasting 2 study area and data the study area encompasses the machángara alto and chulco rivers which cover areas of 132 km2 and 66 km2 respectively both rivers are located in the machángara sub basin of the paute river basin which is located in the provinces of azuay and cañar in southern ecuador fig 1 the machángara sub basin supplies water for two reservoirs chanlud and el labrado with storage capacities of 16 25 hm3 and 6 25 hm3 respectively these reservoirs supply water for irrigation and human consumption this region is influenced by air masses from the pacific ocean and the amazon basin and by complex climatic factors including the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the relief of orographic rainfall and marine currents from the

river respectively fig 1 consequently both stations were selected for the analysis these meteorological stations are maintained by the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador inhami a summary of the meteorological data for both stations is provided in tables 1 and 2 3 methodology this section starts with the definition of the calibration and validation periods then the four models adopted for the analyses are presented 1 the weap physical model 2 the gr2m physical model 3 ann with precipitation data entry hereafter p nn and 4 ann with precipitation and evapotranspiration data entry hereafter p et0 nn the presentation of the hybrid technique follows which intends to increase the predictive skills of the four individual models criteria to evaluate the goodness of fit of the different approaches are explained followed by details on the validation procedure 3 1 calibration and validation periods the observed flow series were divided into two statistically similar periods 75 of the data was selected as a calibration period while the remaining 25 was used for validation to evaluate statistical similarity the presence of seasonal trends was first assessed using a mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 for each river using the computer tools developed by mcleod 2005 for the machángara river p values of 0 071 for the calibration period and 0 79 for the validation period were obtained while the chulco river presented p values of 0 06 for the calibration period and 0 77 for the validation period in both cases the p values larger than 0 05 indicate no significant trends the box plots in figs 2 and 3 show the monthly flow distribution for both periods which indicate similar temporal variability a statistical analysis for both study periods is summarized in tables 3 and 4 3 2 weap the weap physical model is a useful tool for the integrated planning of water resources it requires a calibration phase of input variables such as monthly precipitation monthly average temperature monthly relative humidity monthly wind speed and monthly flow the calibration parameters consist of water storage capacity in the root zone water storage capacity in the deep zone runoff resistance factor and root zone conductivity al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 for hydrological modeling the model adopts the soil moisture model method its operation is based on the representation of water balance in two layers of soil a higher one in which evapotranspiration is simulated considering rainfall and irrigation surface runoff subsurface runoff and deep percolation and a lower one that simulates the passage of the base flow and changes in the water content of the soil al omari et al 2014 yi and sandoval solis 2015 the weap model is based on a semi distributed approach which divides the basin into several fractions of area each of which can represent different soil types or land uses water balance is then performed for each fraction further details on the model are presented by al omari et al 2014 and yi and sandoval solis 2015 the present calibration and validation of the weap model employ data available in the period from 1979 to 2010 the calibration phase was carried out with data between 1979 and 1999 while validation was performed between 2000 and 2010 the model was optimized by means of a trial and error procedure as such the performance of the weap model is associated with this specific calibrated product 3 3 gr2m gr2m is a conceptual physical model that estimates flows from rainfall and evapotranspiration data its calibration requires monthly precipitation monthly mean evapotranspiration and monthly flow as input variables the model operation is based on two tanks the reservoir soil related to a production function and the gravitational water reservoir where the contribution is instantaneous at the beginning and gradually empties with the passage of time the release of the gravitational water reservoir depends on the storage level mouelhi et al 2006 potential evapotranspiration is computed as a function of average temperature following the method proposed by thornthwaite et al 1954 for the latest version of the gr2m model the reader is referred to mouelhi 2003 the gr2m model consists of two parameters the tank capacity and a dimensionless constant these parameters are adjusted by optimizing an objective function for which the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse is adopted mouelhi 2003 in order to achieve an optimal set of parameters the generalized gradient code for nonlinear programming developed by lasdon et al 1976 was used in this study as for the weap model the performance of gr2m is hereby associated with this specific calibrated product 3 4 ann based models p nn and p et0 nn in ann based techniques the architecture of the neuron is represented as the sum of external stimuli z j followed by a non linear activation function y j f z j this function determines the output activity of the neuron this type of ann architecture is known as the mcculloch pitts perceptron tkacz et al 1999 fidalgo et al 2013 therein the user enters the data for both input and output variables to train the ann through a set of random weights the network begins the learning process in search for an optimal set which allows for pattern classification and error minimization crone 2002 perea et al 2016 the present study uses a feed forward back propagation neural network algorithm available in the matlab toolbox nntool zhong and xie 2012 the number of neurons in the hidden layer that yields an optimal performance was estimated by means of a trial and error procedure the hyperbolic sigmoidal tangent was used as a transfer function for training the bayesian regularization algorithm was applied which minimizes a convex combination of the mean square error this configuration of the ann is consistent with similar studies that report positive results e g fidalgo et al 2013 perea et al 2016 two ann based modeling alternatives are explored in the first p nn precipitation estimates comprised in the period from 1979 to 1999 were supplied to the ann as input data independent variable while the flow measurements in the same period were used as output data dependent variable in the second alternative p et0 nn the p nn model was enhanced by incorporating evapotranspiration input data which was calculated by means of the thornwaite method pereira and pruitt 2004 both ann models were subjected to a validation process with the corresponding input data in the period between 2000 and 2010 3 4 1 ann based hybrid technique the proposed hybrid technique is a multi model approach that aims to increase accuracy in flow predictions for this procedure the 4 time series obtained from the previously described models are used as the entry of a new ann the time series of the ann based models p nn and p et0 nn correspond to the results of the optimal number of neurons the configuration and training of the ann follows the trial and error procedure and bayesian regularization algorithm as described for p nn and p et0 nn 3 5 goodness of fit analysis a goodness of fit analysis was performed to compare the predicted time series to the observed data in both rivers the comparisons allow to observe the capability of the different models to capture temporal variation and extreme values to avoid subjectivity in the analyses a combination of graphical results absolute value error and normalized goodness of fit statistics was performed following the recommendations of ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 where nse is used to indicate goodness of fit moreover following mccuen et al 2006 nse is complemented by bias quantification table 5 presents a summary of the threshold criteria for nse and pbias which are based on ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 and moriasi et al 2007 respectively this information is further complemented by root mean squared error to analyze the deviation of simulated flows 3 6 application to water resources management to evaluate the ability to integrate the present technique as a tool for the management of water resources in andean regions the weap supply demand component yates et al 2005 was used to perform a water supply demand analysis for the study area the water supply in hm3 month was computed from the simulated flow of the individual models and the hybrid technique in both rivers these quantities were then compared to the demand which was quantified as the sum of 3 demand points in the machángara catchment that are supplied by the chulco and machángara rivers the demand factors consist of water for purification in the tixán treatment plant and the irrigation channels machángara and la dolorosa these demand values are available in etapa 2016 and estrella and tobar 2013 for both reservoirs the inflows are measured through the estimation of storage volumes with respect to time the distribution model was constructed using the weap supply demand component in which water balance was performed a scheme of the system is shown in fig 4 showing the reservoirs channels diversions and demands 4 results 4 1 machángara river fig 5 shows the observed flow for the chanlud station in the machangara river and the simulated flow for the weap gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models in both calibration and validation phases the plots reveal that while weap generates a relatively good fit it is the only model that overestimates both high and low extreme values on the other hand the gr2m model adequately represents the dynamics of the flow but shows a poor estimation of peak flows and overestimates low flows 1 1 we recall that the results of the weap and gr2m models reflect the performance of the specific calibrated products used in the present study in turn p nn and p et0 nn present a relatively good fit but fail to capture the lowest flow rates in the calibration and validation phases in addition high flows are underestimated fig 6 shows the observed flow rates on the horizontal axis the simulated on the vertical axis and a 1 1 line to further visualize the accuracy of the predictions the flows simulated by the weap model are above the 1 1 line indicating bias particular for high flow rates for this model the calibration values for both nse and pbias are unsatisfactory table 5 with pbias indicating a significant overestimation of 34 67 an rmse value of 2 47 hm3 month was obtained corresponding to the highest of all 4 models in the validation stage nse increases to 0 72 corresponding to satisfactory while pbias and rmse decrease to 31 07 unsatisfactory and 2 25 hm3 month respectively as in the calibration stage bias increases for high flow rates with possible outliers in the case of the gr2m model a more dispersed distribution is observed around the 1 1 line in the calibration stage where the values below the 1 1 line indicate underestimation however in some cases higher overestimations than in the weap model are observed a satisfactory nse of 0 72 was obtained with a very good pbias of 4 15 however a high rmse of 2 17 hm3 month was obtained in the validation stage nse decreases to an unsatisfactory value of 0 60 which can be attributed to a pbias shift to underestimation and an increase in rmse to 2 66 hm3 month p nn shows a calibration satisfactory nse value of 0 75 a very good pbias of 0 29 and an rmse of 2 05 hm3 month the results indicate no significant outliers and a very low model bias showing rather acceptable results in the validation stage nse decreases to 0 61 accompanied by an underestimation with a pbias of 6 23 in the calibration stage the p et0 nn model presents a satisfactory nse of 0 75 and a very good pbias of 1 16 with an rmse of 2 02 hm3 month however the validation results for this model show an unsatisfactory nse of 0 61 accompanied by underestimation with a pbias of 8 11 fig 7 shows the results of the proposed hybrid technique in the calibration and validation phases the time series indicate that the method accurately captures the flow dynamics of the machángara river drastically

consistent in the entire range of flow rates in the calibration stage with no significant outliers or non linear trends a very good nse of 0 991 is obtained with a very good pbias of 0 24 in the validation stage the results show an improvement with respect to all individual models yielding an nse of 0 99 moreover the persistent underestimation in the individual models apart from weap significantly decreases to a pbias of 1 33 the rmse is also remarkably low at 0 42 hm3 month table 6 presents the results of the 4 individual models in the machángara river for the calibration phase the nse coefficient corresponds to a very good fit in all cases both p nn and p et0 nn models present the best results in terms of nse with values of 0 75 weap model presents the lowest nse and an unsatisfactory pbias of 34 67 the p nn and p et0 nn models present a good fit in all coefficients in the validation phase weap presents the best results yielding an acceptable fit in terms of nse however the value of pbias was unsatisfactory presenting the lowest performance among the 4 models gr2m shows a bad nse equal to 0 60 similar bad fit is obtained for both data driven models 4 2 chulco river fig 9 shows the observed flow of the el labrado station in the chulco river and the simulated of the weap gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models for both calibration and validation phases the plots reveal that while the calibrated weap product presents a good fit it is the only model that overestimates both high and low extremes values on the other hand the product calibrated for the gr2m model adequately represents the flow dynamics but shows a poor estimation of peak flows and overestimates low flows finally the p nn and p et0 nn present a relatively good fit but fail to capture the lowest flow rates in the calibration and validation phases in addition high flows are underestimated fig 10 shows the observed flow rates on the horizontal axis the simulated on the vertical axis and a 1 1 line to further visualize the accuracy of the predictions the flows simulated by the weap model are above the 1 1 line indicating bias particular for high flow rates for this model the calibration values for both nse and pbias are unsatisfactory table 7 with pbias indicating a significant overestimation of 19 39 in addition an rmse value of 0 8 hm3 month was obtained in the validation stage nse decreases to 0 87 corresponding to good while pbias increases to 31 07 hm3 month unsatisfactory and rmse decreases 0 76hm3 month as in the calibration stage bias increases for high flow rates with possible outliers in the case of the gr2m model a more dispersed distribution is observed around the 1 1 line in the calibration stage where the values below the 1 1 line indicate underestimation however in some cases higher overestimations than in the weap model are observed a satisfactory nse of 0 78 was obtained with a very good pbias of 1 36 and an rmse of 0 95 hm3 month in the validation stage nse increases to a good value of 0 80 both pbias and rmse decrease to 0 57 and 0 92 hm3 month respectively p nn shows an acceptable calibration nse value of 0 77 a very good pbias of 1 06 and an rmse of 0 97 hm3 month the results indicate no significant outliers and a very low model bias showing rather acceptable results in the validation stage nse decreases to 0 76 accompanied by an underestimation with a pbias of 1 36 in the calibration stage the p et0 nn model presents an acceptable nse of 0 77 and a very good pbias of 0 52 with an rmse of 0 96 hm3 month the validation results for this model show an acceptable nse of 0 77 and a pbias of 0 98 the results are summarized in table 7 fig 11 shows the results of the proposed hybrid technique in the calibration and validation phases the time series indicate that the method accurately captures the flow dynamics of the chulco river drastically improving the results of the individual models shown in table 7 fig 12 shows data closely aligned to the 1 1 line indicating significant agreement with the observed data this performance remains consistent in the entire range of flow rates in the calibration stage with no significant outliers or non linear trends a very good nse of 0 99 is obtained with a very good pbias of 0 03 in the validation stage the results show an improvement with respect to all individual models yielding an nse of 0 99 moreover the persistent underestimation in the individual models apart from weap significantly decreases to a pbias of 2 61 the rmse is also remarkably low at 0 19 hm3 month table 7 presents the results of the 4 individual models in the chulco river for the calibration phase the nse coefficient corresponds to a very good fit in all cases the weap model presents the best results in terms of nse with values of 0 88 however a satisfactory pbias of 19 39 was obtained the gr2m p nn and p et0 nn models present a very good fit in all coefficients in the validation phase weap presents the best results yielding a very good fit in terms of nse however the value of pbias was satisfactory presenting the lowest performance among the 4 models 4 3 application as a tool for water resources management we compare the water supply of the individual techniques the hybrid technique and the observed data to the downstream demand obtained in terms of drinking water and irrigation in three demand sites obtained from etapa 2016 estrella and tobar 2013 the results are shown in fig 13 which presents the surplus that was obtained in all cases when compared to the observed data the calibrated weap output supply presents a significant overestimation which increases in the months of higher water supply in the cases of march april may and june overestimations are observed with a difference of up to 100 table 8 in agreement with the pbias observed in both rivers the results of gr2m pnn and p et0 nn deviate less than weap from the surplus of the observed data set however the results obtained by the gr2m model show an estimate of the surplus lower than all the models in wet months such as april and may while in most months with lower surpluses such as january august and october high overestimations occurred both ann models pnn and p et0 nn show similar results with underestimation from february to june on the other hand in the months of lower demand i e from october to december the simulations produced high overestimations in some cases such as october the overestimation was almost as high as the results of weap for the same month the hybrid technique presents very similar results to the observed surplus with small deviations throughout the different months however as expected all individual methods are consistently outperformed by the hybrid technique 5 discussion concerning the two physical models we emphasize that the results reflect the performance of the present calibrated products while improved calibration has not been studied nevertheless the results of the weap based product suggest that the accuracy of flow prediction using models that involve the calibration of several parameters is significantly compromised in regions with complex climatic conditions as in the case of andean watersheds on the other hand simpler models such as gr2m might not be able to represent the rainfall runoff processes due to the lack of representative parameters in turn the ann based models proved to be more accurate tools for flow forecasting than the products derived from the physical models in both case studies studies conducted by li et al 2018 in the upper yalongjiang basin in china apply an alternative hybrid approach that resembles the present work the authors use results from the swat vic and btopmc models as inputs and report very good results for simulations at a daily time scale with nse coefficients of 0 95 and 0 90 in the calibration and validation stages respectively consequently li et al 2018 suggest that using the results of different models as the input of a neural network can increase the goodness of fit in the prediction of flows this hypothesis was verified for the hybrid technique proposed in the present study significant improvements with respect to all four individual models were observed in both case studies with nse values around 0 99 in both calibration and validation stages to the knowledge of the authors these are the most accurate results to date in the two catchments under study this positive outcome may be attributed to the different nature of the information captured by the individual models which is combined in the hybrid neural network both the weap and gr2m physical models embed information directly related to monthly runoff processes while the p nn and p et0 nn models capture non linear relationships between the input climatic data and the output flows to further assess the capabilities of the proposed technique we compared the water supply of the individual models the hybrid technique and the observed data to the downstream demand obtained in terms of drinking water and irrigation in three demand sites when compared to the observed data as expected all individual methods are consistently outperformed by the hybrid technique 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to implement and evaluate a hybrid technique that uses the monthly simulated flow of two physical models weap and gr2m and two data driven methods with precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as input variables to configure a new ann with observed streamflow as the target variable the purpose of this technique was to overcome the limitations of physical and data driven models by combining their individual capabilities the results of the comparative statistical analyses indicate that the ann based hybrid technique provides major improvements over the individual models specifically the ability to capture peak flows is enhanced resulting in significantly better statistical values the results also reveal that the hybrid technique is more consistent than the individual models presenting similar results in the calibration and the validation phases from the present positive results the conditions under which the hybrid technique fails to improve the results of physical and data driven models could be not be addressed thus additional case studies are required to reveal such conditions in addition the performance of the physical models weap and gr2m was studied using calibrated data where the performance of the calibration procedure was not addressed consequently studies with different data sets resulting from physical models with improved calibration techniques are required to better study the enhancement capabilities of the hybrid technique this work can provide the basis for future studies for instance on the performance of the hybrid technique for extrapolating predictions to ungauged regions moreover ann based hybrid techniques for streamflow simulations emerge as a possible strategies to be used in the management of water resources where accurate predictions are of utmost importance in particular accurate streamflow predictions are required to study the supply and demand of water resources in regions where surplus levels are close to the deficit threshold for instance considering that the population in the city of cuenca grew from 104 470 to 329 928 inhabitants between 1974 and 2010 and that it is projected to reach around 861 682 by 2055 hermida et al 2015 the scarce surplus in certain months as shown in the present study for the months of january august and october implies concerns in terms of future availability to address these cases stochastic meteorological simulation methods e g for precipitation and temperature can be used to generate input data to be used in the hybrid technique this could allow to assess water availability under different scenarios at a regional scale accounting for the effects of population growth climate change and new demand sites conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest funding this work was funded by the university of cuenca through its research department diuc as part of the project titled evaluación del riesgo de sequías en cuencas andinas reguladas influenciadas por la variabilidad climática y cambio climático caso de estudio en la cuenca del río machángara acknowledgements we appreciate the provision of information of the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador 
8397,study region a 10 000 km2 area of southwestern ontario within the lake erie and lake ontario basins of the laurentian great lakes basin ontario canada a humid northern hydrogeological setting with abundant precipitation and recharge and a stable paleozoic sedimentary bedrock overlain by galacial sediment forming a relatively uncompressible sedimentary succession study focus examing land surface deformation in southern ontario and its connection with water storage change new hydrological insights the surface deformation observed from a set of 48 radarsat 2 insar images over five years from jan 2013 to sept 2017 presents a subsidence trend of 1 10 mm year and a seasonal variation of up to 20 mm over the region the insar results are confirmed by the gps measurements at six locations over the region the surface deformations were compared to the water storage data derived from grace satellites in situ water levels of the great lakes and precipitation data in the study area the results indicate that the multi year trend and seasonal variations in surface deformation are correlated to water storage changes suggesting that the surface deformation in southern ontario could be caused by water loading keywords surface deformation water storage insar radarsat 2 gps grace 1 introduction land surface deformation could occur as a result of changes in water storage induced by anthropogenic withdrawal surface water and drainage management and climate variations yuill et al 2009 castellazzi et al 2017 in some instances these changes or variations in water storage are large enough to produce displacements of several centimeters argus et al 2017 herring et al 2016 puskas et al 2017 for example argus et al 2017 found that the sierra nevada california rose 24 mm in elastical response to the lose of 45 km3 water during the severe drought from oct 2011 to oct 2015 the surface deformation can be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar from space global positioning system gps and other ground based techniques such as levelling gravimeters tiltmeters and inclinometers singhroy et al 2015 pearse et al 2014 castellazi et al 2016 gps provides precise mm level 3 dimensional and pointwise information of ground movement on a global scale gps can provide an accuracy of 4 mm horizontally and 8 mm vertically it has been widely used for measuring ground deformation it has merits over other ground based techniques for its higer automation at lower labor cost however placing a permanent gps receiver often involves high cost in recent years insar has been increasingly used in monitoring surface deformation due to its high precsion mm high spatial resolution and large spatial coverage 100 500 km2 when compared to ground based techniques insar is a geodetic technique that calculates the interference pattern which results from a difference in phase between images acquired by synthetic aperture radar sar at distinct times taken from the same orbital track massonnet and fiegl 1998 castellazzi et al 2016 the interference pattern produces an interferogram which maps changes in the distance between the ground and the radar instrument the repeat pass of the satellite allows for radar interferograms to detect changes in the ground surface over time massonnet and fiegl 1998 challenges for the insar technique arise when there are spatial and temporal decorrelations due to vegetation coverage rough terrain and large deformation or phase artifacts due to the atmosphere mirzaee et al 2017 which are not the cases in gps measurements furthermore insar detected change is relative to a reference point since insar deformation measurements are calculated from the interferometric phase differences between the adjacent pixels by conducting a phase unwrapping operation the relative deformations can be calibrated by either using a stable target as the reference point or using ground control points e g corner reflectors with known amplitudes of deformation e g gps measurements regardless the combination of gps measurements and insar deformation images can enhance mapping modeling and interpretation of ground deformation lu and miyagi 2005 numerous studies have used insar with or without gps to develop ground surface deformation maps and infer groundwater changes over various regions across the globe including taiwan southern netherland los angeles mexico city among others where anthropogenic overdrafting of the aquifer systems has resulted in significant land subsidence and irreversible aquitard compaction amelung et al 1999 hoffmann et al 2001 chang et al 2004 lanari et al 2004 bell et al 2008 hung et al 2010 hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 ojha et al 2018 riel et al 2018 these cases exemplify permanent land subsidence due to the irreversible compaction of aquitards from the long term groundwater overdrafting from an aquifer aquitard system normand and heggy 2015 utilized the insar technique combined with gps to determine deformation in montreal between september 2008 and november 2010 however they found that in montreal long term irreversible compaction resulting from aquifer overdrafting is not a concern since this region is characterized as humid continental with no significant observable groundwater depletion their results during the period of observation in these areas demonstrate minor uplift 2 mm yr the study further attributed ground surface fluctuations to natural seasonal changes in water mass and water availability i e floods droughts evapotranspiration ect potentially causing the clay soils to shrink and swell southern ontario is located in the great lakes basin the great lakes are estimated to host 18 and 84 of the worlds and north americas readily available freshwater respectively fuller et al 1995a 1995b epa 2019 only 1 of the great lakes water volume is estimated to recharge annually fuller et al 1995a 1995b approximately 40 of the canadian gross domestic product gdp and 25 of canadian agriculture output is generated in the area and it houses one third of the canadian population epa 2019 surface water within the basin is regulated by international agreement between the united states of america and canada that prohibits transboundary water diversion within the basin international boundary waters treaty act 1985 r s c 1985 groundwater continues to be a significant source of water supply for agriculture industry municipalities and rural users throughout southern ontario sharpe et al 2014 there may be a high threat to water availability in this region when equilibrium between withdrawals and recharge is unattainable stream discharge is reliant on groundwater baseflow contribution for approximately 5 months of the year therefore it is crucial to understand water storage variations for effective water resource management estimates of groundwater storage change are commonly measured at the local scale monitoring wells at the local scale many jurisdiction have regional monitoring networks but such networks are few in number and still lack adequate density to fully characterize water storage changes changes in water storage can be the main cause of surface deformations in some regions lanari et al 2004 hsu et al 2015 normand and heggy 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 the aforementioned insar method or the combined insar and gps method may provide an effective way for monitoring water storage changes in southern ontario the objective of this study is to examine if surface deformation occurs in southern ontario and if so if it is related to changes in water storage as such we use insar integrated with gps to measure ground deformations in southern ontario the relationship between the ground deformation and water storage change is investigated through comparisons of the surface deformations with the water storage data from grace satellites surface water level of the great lakes and precipitation data 2 study area the study area is located in southern ontario canada it covers 10 000 km2 between lake ontario lake erie and lake huron fig 1 the climate is humid continental with annual precipitation ranging from 750 to 1000 mm and annual evapotranspiration of about half of the annual precipitation wang et al 2013 2014 2015 the region has a relatively long growing season and an abundance of arable soil making it a prosperous agricultural region with established field crop livestock including pasture forages and horticulture production systems the topography of the area is low relief characterized mainly by flat plains with gently rolling hills in the study area three major soil types were identified from the database of soil landscapes of canada version 3 2 including silty clay loam silty loam and loamy sand the surficial geological setting of the region fig 1 is a mixture of glacially deposited silty clayey and sandy till complexes in the south west transitioning to sand and gravel glaciofluvial deposits in the north east and central region glaciolacustrine sand in the south central region and glaciolacustrine silt and clay deposits in the south east areas with exposed bedrock and thin drift complexes can be found along the lake ontario shoreline and the niagara escarpment paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks of the michigan and appalachian basins are the dominant bedrock of southern ontario sharpe et al 2014 the sedimentary basins in the study area are separated by the algonquin arch with groundwater flow direction controlled by togoraphy and bedrock structural dip groundwater extraction in the region is from a combination of bedrock aquifers and surficial sediment aquifers in areas with abundant sand and gravel deposits groundwater is a main resource for agricultural and potable use even with the proximity of abundant surface water in the great lakes particularly for the cities of waterloo cambridge and guelph sharpe et al 2014 3 datasets and data processing five datasets covering southern ontario were used for this study including gps weekly solutions high resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data monthly precipitation data monthly lake water level data and monthly terrestrial water storage change data derived from the grace satellites 3 1 rtk gps weekly

rtk gps stations can measure ground movement in three orthogonal directions north east and vertical the rtk networks are processed along with a global set of reference frame stations for network alignment daily data files for each network are processed using the bernese gnss software v5 2 and then combined into a weekly solution weekly measurements are reviewed for quality control with a tolerance level of 2 cm horizontally and 3 cm vertically for station compliance more details can be found in donahue 2017 seven stations were chosen in the study area fig 1 to calibrate and validate insar observations table 1 lists the geographic coordinates and time span coverages for the rtk gps stations used in this study all the gps data has been processed by the canadian geodetic survey cgs the nad83 csrs v6 velocity grid developed by cgs was used to account for isostatic rebound over time more details about the nad83 csrs v6 velocity grid are available at https webapp geod nrcan gc ca geod tools outils nad83 docs php wbdisable true the rtk gps stations are all installed on metal supports located on building roofs the nature of the locations and station structures means that temperature change is one of the greatest causes of uncertainty in weekly measurements as they may be subject to thermal expansion compression resulting from seasonal temperature changes average weekly variations at all sites was 3 mm a smoothing filter was applied to the data to reduce the noise gaussian and savitzky golay smoothing filters were both applied to the data sets and different permutations of the filters and their outputs were reviewed the savitzky golay filter with p filter order of 5 and n filter length of 25 gave the best filtering results and was selected as the final smoothing filter the gps provides surface deformation measurements in three orthogonal directions to make the gps measurements comparable to the insar measurements we converted the gps measurements to the insar line of sight los measurements by using the following equation fialko et al 2001 1 l o s c o s θ sin θ c o s α sin θ s i n α d v d e d n where θ is the insar incidence angle α is the azimuth

processing was performed with gamma insar program the images were multilooked by using 3 3 spatial averaging in range and azimuth directions a single master image was chosen and the remaining images were co registered resampled to the master image the maximum magnitude of perpendicular baselines was set to 400 m and all possible differential interferogams satisfying these baseline criteria were generated in the insar process the topographic phase was removed using the 30 m resolution srtm dem differential interferograms were filtered using the adaptive filtering with filtering function based on local fringe spectrum goldstein and werner 1998 and unwrapped using the minimum cost flow mcf algorithm costantini 1998 a baseline refinement algorithm was performed to remove the orbital ramps in the differential interferograms the algorithm is able to successfully correct linear and quadratic orbital ramps especially in the case of large perpendicular baselines and absence of long wavelength atmospheric errors samsonov et al 2011 spatial interpolation of each interferogram was performed in order to extend spatial coverage to partially incoherent regions precision of the insar deformation measurements can be improved by using radar image pairs from numerous scenes more than 25 with similar viewing geometries short perpendicular baselines short time intervals between acquisitions and correcting for the effect of topography and atmospheric conditions singhroy et al 2012 as such the small baseline subset sbas method improved by samsonov et al 2011 was applied to achieve better accuracy of the insar measurements by minimizing the influence of atmospheric effects and dem resolution the sbas method can produce a nonlinear time series of deformation over a long period of time using interferograms with short time spans which are usually more coherent in this method a high pass filtering with a gaussian window was applied to remove the residual orbital and atmospheric signals the interferograms were then calibrated against a chosen reference point assumed to be stable during the entire observation period a singular value inversion was applied to solve for the individual deformation rates and any topographic error as well as time series deformation maps from 109 highly coherent interferograms the line of sight linear deformation rates were computed with the sbas algorithm the time series were reconstructed by integration from calculated deformation rates and finally linear displacement rates were calculated by applying linear regression to the time series as aforementioned insar measurements are taken with respect to a reference point the reference point is generally placed at a location that is stable in terms of deformation however identification of a stable reference point was difficult in southern ontario as such the rtk gps site twoo was used as the reference point since this station has readings covering the same time span as the radarsat 2 acquisitions the twoo gps measurements were then also added to the insar time series deformation maps 3 3 monthly grace terrestrial water storage monthly terrestrial water storage change tws data observed by the grace satellites was used to examine the total water storage change in the region the datasets are processed by jpl jet propulsion laboratory mascon solution with 3 x 3 mascon grids at a monthly interval the jpl rl 06 mascon solution uses a priori constraints in space and time to estimate global monthly gravity fields in terms of equal area 3 x 3 spherical cap mass concentration functions to minimize the effect of measurement errors no additional empirical destriping filter has been applied to the data although the datasets are represented on a 0 5 x 0 5 grid they represent the 3 x 3 equal area caps which is the current native resolution of jpl rl06 mascons the datasets have been applied with a glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction using the ice6g d model from peltier et al 2018 each monthly tws grid represents the tws deviation for that month relative to the baseline average over jan 2004 to dec 2009 since using 3 mascons as a basis function acts as an inherent smoother on the data a set of global gain factors derived from the clm community land model hydrology model at 0 5 resolution wiese et al 2016 is applied to the datasets to aid in the interpretation of signals at sub mascon 0 5 x 0 5 resolution in addition a coastline resolution improvement cri filter is applied to mascons that straddle the land ocean boundary large lake to separate the land and water portions of the mass further information on jpl rl06 mascons tws datasets can be found in https podaac jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons the monthly jpl rl06 mascon tws data used in this study was downloaded from https podaac jpl nasa gov dataset covering the period of 2013 2017 the tws data of three sub mascons grids which covered the study area are averaged to represent the tws for the study area 3 4 monthly precipitation and water level data the monthly precipitation dataset from the global land data assimilation system gldas v2 1 over the period of 2013 2017 is also used in the study the gldas dataset has global coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 the dataset integrates satellite and ground based datasets for parameterizing forcing and constraining a few land surface models for generating fields of land surface states and fluxes the precipitation data combine microwave and infrared data and also assimilate gauge observations the regional mean monthly precipitation 2013 2017 was calculated for the study area in addition monthly lake water level data was used downloaded for the period of 2013 2017 from the environment and climate change canada eccc water office website https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html for lake ontario lake erie and lake huron 4 results and discussions the results showed surface deformations mainly in urban and suburban areas fig 2 the insar observations of surface deformation li et al 2019 in non urban regions is mostly absent likely due to the abundance of agricultural land resulting in a loss of coherence in insar signals from rapid changes in vegetation the roofs and corners of the buildings in urbanized areas can form permanent scatters resulting in more coherent signals in urban and suburban areas an subsidence rate of 1 10 mm year is observed across the study area during 2013 2017 fig 2 spatial variations in subsidence rates occur throughout the study area generally the greatest amount of subsidence 7 mm year is observed along the shore of lake ontario from where subsidences gradually decrease towarding to inlands the least amount of subsidence 1 mm year is observed in the east of brampton subsidence rates for the waterloo area 3 4 mm year are greater than those observed around cambridge 1 3 mm year subsidence rates around london demonstrate a trend of increasing subsidence rates progressing from the east 1 2 mm year to the west 4 5 mm year the spatial variability in surface deformation could be related to a combination of regional and local hydrologic geologic and environmental conditions as discussed later to support the analysis of the surface deformation observed from radarsat 2 insar we compared the insar results to the gps records for six rtk gps sites tmil tham tcmg cstd losi and clnd a seventh gps site twoo was excluded from comparison as it was used as the reference point for the calibration of insar measurements the long term time series profiles of the surface deformations observed from insar and the rtk gps records at the six sites are presented in figs 3 a f the insar measurements show a good correlation with gps measurements for most observation dates both insar and gps measurements show consistent declining trends from 2013 2017 for all of the six gps sites the results demonstrate good correlation of the seasonal variations from the insar and gps measurements with the highest uplift in late summer early fall and the lowest subsidence in spring this is especially evident from 2015 to 2017 fig 3 the amplitudes of seasonal signals vary greatly in different locations the correlation coefficients r obtained from the linear analysis of insar derived surface deformation and gps observations are provided for each rtk gps site table 2 the variance and linear relationship between the insar derived and gps observed surface deformation measurements for the six rtk gps sites are presented in figs 4 a f the correlation coefficients demonstrate that insar derived deformation and gps observations are highly correlated r 0 8 for five of the six sites table 2 the only exception is tcmg which has an r value of 0 35 the cause of the poor relationship between the insar results and the gps measurements at this site is unknown linear plots demonstrate that there is a positive bias in the results at the gps sites tmil tham tcmg and clnd and a negative bias in the results for gps sites cstd and losi fig 3 the source of the systematic bias observed could result from either the gps system or the insar imagery however it is unclear at this point from which source the bias is originating for example a source of bias in the gps systems could be systematic errors in the reference gps site twoo and or the other gps sites a source of systematic bias in the insar results could be un modelled long wavelength residual errors such as the insar phase unwrapping errors orbital errors or atmospheric effects it should also be noted that there are several outliers on some observation dates which have been highlighted by the red ellipses in fig 4 a and b the outliers correspond with abnormalities in the insar results fig 3 and have considerable decrease during the time periods of jan mar 2015 and jul sept 2017 these abnormalities could be related to residual atmospheric and orbit error despite a low pass filter being applied to reduce their effects during the sbas processing in order to mitigate these effects advanced atmospheric correction using atmospheric parameters such as water vapour collected at the same time as the insar data acquisition is recommended to further understand the insar and gps results and the role of water storage we compared these results with the grace tws precipitation and water level data of the surrounding three great lakes as such we calculated the means of insar deformation measurements over the study area and seven rtk gps measurements fig 5 a shows times series of means of insar measured deformation and time series of means of seven rtk gps measurements fig 5 a further confirms that there are consistent subsidence trends 2013 2017 occurring in both insar and gps mean deformation measurements with subsidence rates of 4 mm year and 3 mm year respectively it also shows that both insar and gps time series consistently have significant seasonal variations in which the lowest subsidence and the highest uplift generally occur in spring early summer and fall respectively fig 3 a f fig 5 a the grace data showed interannual tws changes over the study area for the period of 2013 2017 and seasonal cycles with maximum value in spring early summer and minimum value in fall fig 5 b from the de seasonalized ds tws curve an increasing trend of tws can be seen in the study area from 2013 2017 the monthly precipitation data has some abnormal changes over time fig 5 c in general it has seasonal patterns with maximum and minimum values occurring approximately one month earlier than the tws consistent with previous studies wang and li 2015 li et al 2015 the de seasonalized monthly precipitation profile for this area had little annual change for the first two years 2013 and 2014 however from 2015 to 2017 it has an increasing trend the monthly change of water levels of lake ontario lake erie and lake huron for the period of 2013 2017 fig 5 d indicate that water levels for the great lakes have large seasonal variations and an increasing trend over the study period fig 5 d similar to the patterns shown in the grace tws and precipitation the hydrological information in fig 5 b d indicates a continuous gain of water over the southern ontario region during the study period the surface deformation measured by insar and gps presents inverse seasonal phase information with the lowest subsidence mostly in spring early summer and the highest uplift generally in fall furthermore insar and gps recorded a declining trend in surface deformation in the study area from 2013 2017 which is also inverse to the multi year increasing trend for water storage both multi year trend and seasonal variations of the insar and gps observed ground displacement correspond well to the changes in water storage which may imply that the surface deformation observed by insar and gps connects with water storage changes in the southern ontario region some studies have suggested that water mass variations may result in elastic ground loading deformation fu et al 2013 van dam et al 2001 wahr et al 2013 the weight of more water depresses the ground surface which deforms elastically in response to the load as water mass decreases the earth rebounds producing uplift therefore the consistent subsidence in southern ontario could be related to increased water loading an interpretation which is supported by correlations with the tws precipitation and great lakes water levels fig 5 b d this interpretation is further supported by wahr et al 2013 who demonstrate that the surface displacements are largest closest to the lake this also helps us to understand higher rates of insar observed subsidence along the lake ontario shoreline fig 2 several studies have demonstrated that seasonal ground surface deformation occurs as a result of seasonal variations in water mass in and on the earth s surface herring et al 2016 puskas et al 2017 generally water storage fluctuations follow a seasonal cycle of increased water loading during the winter and spring resulting from more precipitation and snow accumulation and decreased water loading in fall due to less precipitation and continual water withdrawal et discharge pumping during the summer growing season wang et al 2013 2014 2015 our study also suggests the potential influence of elastic surface deformation as a result of increased water loading in winter and spring and decreased water loading in fall these analyses suggest that the surface deformation may be primarily caused by the water loadings in the southern ontario region this study shows a different ground deformation behavor induced by the changes in water storage from previous studies for some regions such as taiwan southern netherland los angeles and mexico city hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 riel et al 2018 in which poroelastic surface deformations were observed in response to the groundwater changes for the poroelastic deformation pore spaces in aquifers and aquitards are supported by interstitial fluid pressure thus removal of water results in compaction of these pore spaces and is expressed as subsidence at the ground surface in those regions some portions of the land subsidence are permanent due to the irreversible compaction of aquitards resulted from overdrafting of groundwater unlike previous studies focusing on a site or a city hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 riel et al 2018 this study examined surface deformation over a 10 000 km2 area using high resolution radarsat 2 insar data this enable us to examine the spatial variations in surface deformation consistently over a large area on the basis of signal association and data integration the deformation is associated with water storage change it is worth mentioning that the spatial variations in ground deformation may be also caused by other geolgoical and environmental conditions different sediment types can cause different ground deformation behaviors because sediments soil react differently to waterloading for example in the east of brampton the region with low subsidence corresponded well with the sediment type of glaciolacustrine mud which has low saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with the surrounding upper till sediment which has relatively high saturated hydraulic conductivity normand and heggy 2015 fig 1 the interpration of spatial patterns in displacement remains a challenge for this preliminary study when multiple displacement causes may co exist and inadequate coherent signal return occurs across different geological terrains for comparison 5 conclusion in this study radarsat 2 sar data collected over five years 2013 2017 was used to detect surface deformation for a 10 000 km2 area in southern ontario a multi year declining trend is observed with an subsidence rate of 1 mm year to 10 mm year across the study area seasonal variation of surface deformation of up to 20 mm is also observed the insar results agrees well with the gps measurement from the rtk gps network in both multi year trend and seasonal variations the insar and gps results were found to correspond well to the changes in water storage estimated from the grace tws great lakes water levels and precipitation data for the region the results suggest that the water loading could be the main cause for the surface deformation in the southern ontario the loss of coherence in vegetated and agricultural areas has been identified as one of the main challenges especially for shorter wavelength sar in the application of insar for surface deformation castellazi et al 2016 however the man made objects such as buildings such as houses barns in agriculture fields can be served as permanent scatters thus substantially improve the coherence and making insar analysis possible year round for agriculture areas as demonstrated in this study improvement in coherence can be also achieved by increasing revisit time e g 2 3 days by radarsat constellation mission or using longer sar wavelengths e g 23 cm wavelength of alos 1 2 declaration of

with abundant precipitation and recharge and a stable paleozoic sedimentary bedrock overlain by galacial sediment forming a relatively uncompressible sedimentary succession study focus examing land surface deformation in southern ontario and its connection with water storage change new hydrological insights the surface deformation observed from a set of 48 radarsat 2 insar images over five years from jan 2013 to sept 2017 presents a subsidence trend of 1 10 mm year and a seasonal variation of up to 20 mm over the region the insar results are confirmed by the gps measurements at six locations over the region the surface deformations were compared to the water storage data derived from grace satellites in situ water levels of the great lakes and precipitation data in the study area the results indicate that the multi year trend and seasonal variations in surface deformation are correlated to water storage changes suggesting that the surface deformation in southern ontario could be caused by water loading keywords surface deformation water storage insar radarsat 2 gps grace 1 introduction land surface deformation could occur as a result of changes in water storage induced by anthropogenic withdrawal surface water and drainage management and climate variations yuill et al 2009 castellazzi et al 2017 in some instances these changes or variations in water storage are large enough to produce displacements of several centimeters argus et al 2017 herring et al 2016 puskas et al 2017 for example argus et al 2017 found that the sierra nevada california rose 24 mm in elastical response to the lose of 45 km3 water during the severe drought from oct 2011 to oct 2015 the surface deformation can be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar from space global positioning system gps and other ground based techniques such as levelling gravimeters tiltmeters and inclinometers singhroy et al 2015 pearse et al 2014 castellazi et al 2016 gps provides precise mm level 3 dimensional and pointwise information of ground movement on a global scale gps can provide an accuracy of 4 mm horizontally and 8 mm vertically it has been widely used for measuring ground deformation it has merits over other ground based techniques for its higer automation at lower labor cost however placing a permanent gps receiver often involves high cost in recent years insar has been increasingly used in monitoring surface deformation due to its high precsion mm high spatial resolution and large spatial coverage 100 500 km2 when compared to ground based techniques insar is a geodetic technique that calculates the interference pattern which results from a difference in phase between images acquired by synthetic aperture radar sar at distinct times taken from the same orbital track massonnet and fiegl 1998 castellazzi et al 2016 the interference pattern produces an interferogram which maps changes in the distance between the ground and the radar instrument the repeat pass of the satellite allows for radar interferograms to detect changes in the ground surface over time massonnet and fiegl 1998 challenges for the insar technique arise when there are spatial and temporal decorrelations due to vegetation coverage rough terrain and large deformation or phase artifacts due to the atmosphere mirzaee et al 2017 which are not the cases in gps measurements furthermore insar detected change is relative to a reference point since insar deformation measurements are calculated from the interferometric phase differences between the adjacent pixels by conducting a phase unwrapping operation the relative deformations can be calibrated by either using a stable target as the reference point or using ground control points e g corner reflectors with known amplitudes of deformation e g gps measurements regardless the combination of gps measurements and insar deformation images can enhance mapping modeling and interpretation of ground deformation lu and miyagi 2005 numerous studies have used insar with or without gps to develop ground surface deformation maps and infer groundwater changes over various regions across the globe including taiwan southern netherland los angeles mexico city among others where anthropogenic overdrafting of the aquifer systems has resulted in significant land subsidence and irreversible aquitard compaction amelung et al 1999 hoffmann et al 2001 chang et al 2004 lanari et al 2004 bell et al 2008 hung et al 2010 hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 ojha et al 2018 riel et al 2018 these cases exemplify permanent land subsidence due to the irreversible compaction of aquitards from the long term groundwater overdrafting from an aquifer aquitard system normand and heggy 2015 utilized the insar technique combined with gps to determine deformation in montreal between september 2008 and november 2010 however they found that in montreal long term irreversible compaction resulting from aquifer overdrafting is not a concern since this region is characterized as humid continental with no significant observable groundwater depletion their results during the period of observation in these areas demonstrate minor uplift 2 mm yr the study further attributed ground surface fluctuations to natural seasonal changes in water mass and water availability i e floods droughts evapotranspiration ect potentially causing the clay soils to shrink and swell southern ontario is located in the great lakes basin the great lakes are estimated to host 18 and 84 of the worlds and north americas readily available freshwater respectively fuller et al 1995a 1995b epa 2019 only 1 of the great lakes water volume is estimated to recharge annually fuller et al 1995a 1995b approximately 40 of the canadian gross domestic product gdp and 25 of canadian agriculture output is generated in the area and it houses one third of the canadian population epa 2019 surface water within the basin is regulated by international agreement between the united states of america and canada that prohibits transboundary water diversion within the basin international boundary waters treaty act 1985 r s c 1985 groundwater continues to be a significant source of water supply for agriculture industry municipalities and rural users throughout southern ontario sharpe et al 2014 there may be a high threat to water availability in this region when equilibrium between withdrawals and recharge is unattainable stream discharge is reliant on groundwater baseflow contribution for approximately 5 months of the year therefore it is crucial to understand water storage variations for effective water resource management estimates of groundwater storage change are commonly measured at the local scale monitoring wells at the local scale many jurisdiction have regional monitoring networks but such networks are few in number and still lack adequate density to fully characterize water storage changes changes in water storage can be the main cause of surface deformations in some regions lanari et al 2004 hsu et al 2015 normand and heggy 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 the aforementioned insar method or the combined insar and gps method may provide an effective way for monitoring water storage changes in southern ontario the objective of this study is to examine if surface deformation occurs in southern ontario and if so if it is related to changes in water storage as such we use insar integrated with gps to measure ground deformations in southern ontario the relationship between the ground deformation and water storage change is investigated through comparisons of the surface deformations with the water storage data from grace satellites surface water level of the great lakes and precipitation data 2 study area the study area is located in southern ontario canada it covers 10 000 km2 between lake ontario lake erie and lake huron fig 1 the climate is humid continental with annual precipitation ranging from 750 to 1000 mm and annual evapotranspiration of about half of the annual precipitation wang et al 2013 2014 2015 the region has a relatively long growing season and an abundance of arable soil making it a prosperous agricultural region with established field crop livestock including pasture forages and horticulture production systems the topography of the area is low relief characterized mainly by flat plains with gently rolling hills in the study area three major soil types were identified from the database of soil landscapes of canada version 3 2 including silty clay loam silty loam and loamy sand the surficial geological setting of the region fig 1 is a mixture of glacially deposited silty clayey and sandy till complexes in the south west transitioning to sand and gravel glaciofluvial deposits in the north east and central region glaciolacustrine sand in the south central region and glaciolacustrine silt and clay deposits in the south east areas with exposed bedrock and thin drift complexes can be found along the lake ontario shoreline and the niagara escarpment paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks of the michigan and appalachian basins are the dominant bedrock of southern ontario sharpe et al 2014 the sedimentary basins in the study area are separated by the algonquin arch with groundwater flow direction controlled by togoraphy and bedrock structural dip groundwater extraction in the region is from a combination of bedrock aquifers and surficial sediment aquifers in areas with abundant sand and gravel deposits groundwater is a main resource for agricultural and potable use even with the proximity of abundant surface water in the great lakes particularly for the cities of waterloo cambridge and guelph sharpe et al 2014 3 datasets and data processing five datasets covering southern ontario were used for this study including gps weekly solutions high resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data monthly precipitation data monthly lake water level data and monthly terrestrial water storage change data derived from the grace satellites 3 1 rtk gps weekly

insar observations table 1 lists the geographic coordinates and time span coverages for the rtk gps stations used in this study all the gps data has been processed by the canadian geodetic survey cgs the nad83 csrs v6 velocity grid developed by cgs was used to account for isostatic rebound over time more details about the nad83 csrs v6 velocity grid are available at https webapp geod nrcan gc ca geod tools outils nad83 docs php wbdisable true the rtk gps stations are all installed on metal supports located on building roofs the nature of the locations and station structures means that temperature change is one of the greatest causes of uncertainty in weekly measurements as they may be subject to thermal expansion compression resulting from seasonal temperature changes average weekly variations at all sites was 3 mm a smoothing filter was applied to the data to reduce the noise gaussian and savitzky golay smoothing filters were both applied to the data sets and different permutations of the filters and their outputs were reviewed the savitzky golay filter with p filter order of 5 and n filter length of 25 gave the best filtering results and was selected as the final smoothing filter the gps provides surface deformation measurements in three orthogonal directions to make the gps measurements comparable to the insar measurements we converted the gps measurements to the insar line of sight los measurements by using the following equation fialko et al 2001 1 l o s c o s θ sin θ c o s α sin θ s i n α d v d e d n where θ is the insar incidence angle α is the azimuth of the insar satellite heading vector positive clockwise from north dv is the displacement in the vertical direction de is the displacement in the easting direction dn is the displacement in the northing direction 3 2 radarsat 2 insar data to map the surface deformation five years 48 scenes of hh polarized radarsat 2 rs 2 wide fine data were collected in single look complex slc format from jan 2013 to sept 2017 over southern canada fig 1 all the images were acquired in ascending mode the wide fine beam mode images have a pixel spacing of 4 7 m in range and 5 2 m in azimuth in addition a 30 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data covering the study area was downloaded from http eros usgs gov for radarsat 2 insar image processing insar processing was performed with gamma insar program the images were multilooked by using 3 3 spatial averaging in range and azimuth directions a single master image was chosen and the remaining images were co registered resampled to the master image the maximum magnitude of perpendicular baselines was set to 400 m and all possible differential interferogams satisfying these baseline criteria were generated in the insar process the topographic phase was removed using the 30 m resolution srtm dem differential interferograms were filtered using the adaptive filtering with filtering function based on local fringe spectrum goldstein and werner 1998 and unwrapped using the minimum cost flow mcf algorithm costantini 1998 a baseline refinement algorithm was performed to remove the orbital ramps in the differential interferograms the algorithm is able to successfully correct linear and quadratic orbital ramps especially in the case of large perpendicular baselines and absence of long wavelength atmospheric errors samsonov et al 2011 spatial interpolation of each interferogram was performed in order to extend spatial coverage to partially incoherent regions precision of the insar deformation measurements can be improved by using radar image pairs from numerous scenes more than 25 with similar viewing geometries short perpendicular baselines short time intervals between acquisitions and correcting for the effect of topography and atmospheric conditions singhroy et al 2012 as such the small baseline subset sbas method improved by samsonov et al 2011 was applied to achieve better accuracy of the insar measurements by minimizing the influence of atmospheric effects and dem resolution the sbas method can produce a nonlinear time series of deformation over a long period of time using interferograms with short time spans which are usually more coherent in this method a high pass filtering with a gaussian window was applied to remove the residual orbital and atmospheric signals the interferograms were then calibrated against a chosen reference point assumed to be stable during the entire observation period a singular value inversion was applied to solve for the individual deformation rates and any topographic error as well as time series deformation maps from 109 highly coherent interferograms the line of sight linear deformation rates were computed with the sbas algorithm the time series were reconstructed by integration from calculated deformation rates and finally linear displacement rates were calculated by applying linear regression to the time series as aforementioned insar measurements are taken with respect to a reference point the reference point is generally placed at a location that is stable in terms of deformation however identification of a stable reference point was difficult in southern ontario as such the rtk gps site twoo was used as the reference point since this station has readings covering the same time span as the radarsat 2 acquisitions the twoo gps measurements were then also added to the insar time series deformation maps 3 3 monthly grace terrestrial water storage monthly terrestrial water storage change tws data observed by the grace satellites was used to examine the total water storage change in the region the datasets are processed by jpl jet propulsion laboratory mascon solution with 3 x 3

they represent the 3 x 3 equal area caps which is the current native resolution of jpl rl06 mascons the datasets have been applied with a glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction using the ice6g d

signals in urban and suburban areas an subsidence rate of 1 10 mm year is observed across the study area during 2013 2017 fig 2 spatial variations in subsidence rates occur throughout the study area generally the greatest amount of subsidence 7 mm year is observed along the shore of lake ontario from where subsidences gradually decrease towarding to inlands the least amount of subsidence 1 mm year is observed in the east of brampton subsidence rates for the waterloo area 3 4 mm year are greater than those observed around cambridge 1 3 mm year subsidence rates around london demonstrate a trend of increasing subsidence rates progressing from the east 1 2 mm year to the west 4 5 mm year the spatial variability in surface deformation could be related to a combination of regional and local hydrologic geologic and environmental conditions as discussed later to support the analysis of the surface deformation observed from radarsat 2 insar we compared the insar results to the gps records for six rtk gps sites tmil tham tcmg cstd losi and clnd a seventh gps site twoo was excluded from comparison as it was used as the reference point for the calibration of insar measurements the long term time series profiles of the surface deformations observed from insar and the rtk gps records at the six sites are presented in figs 3 a f the insar measurements show a good correlation with gps measurements for most observation dates both insar and gps measurements show consistent declining trends from 2013 2017 for all of the six gps sites the results demonstrate good correlation of the seasonal variations from the insar and gps measurements with the highest uplift in late summer early fall and the lowest subsidence in spring this is especially evident from 2015 to 2017 fig 3 the amplitudes of seasonal signals vary greatly in different locations the correlation coefficients r obtained from the linear analysis of insar derived surface deformation and gps observations are provided for each rtk gps site table 2 the variance and linear relationship between the insar derived and gps observed surface deformation measurements for the six rtk gps sites are presented in figs 4 a f the correlation coefficients demonstrate that insar derived deformation and gps observations are highly correlated r 0 8 for five of the six sites table 2 the only exception is tcmg which has an r value of 0 35 the cause of the poor relationship between the insar results and the gps measurements at this site is unknown linear plots demonstrate that there is a positive bias in the results at the gps sites tmil tham tcmg and clnd and a negative bias in the results for gps sites cstd and losi fig 3 the source of the systematic bias observed could result from either the gps system or the insar imagery however it is unclear at this point from which source the bias is originating for example a source of bias in the gps systems could be systematic errors in the reference gps site twoo and or the other gps sites a source of systematic bias in the insar results could be un modelled long wavelength residual errors such as the insar phase unwrapping errors orbital errors or atmospheric effects it should also be noted that there are several outliers on some observation dates which have been highlighted by the red ellipses in fig 4 a and b the outliers correspond with abnormalities in the insar results fig 3 and have considerable decrease during the time periods of jan mar 2015 and jul sept 2017 these abnormalities could be related to residual atmospheric and orbit error despite a low pass filter being applied to reduce their effects during the sbas processing in order to mitigate these effects advanced atmospheric correction using atmospheric parameters such as water vapour collected at the same time as the insar data acquisition is recommended to further understand the insar and gps results and the role of water storage we compared these results with the grace tws precipitation and water level data of the surrounding three great lakes as such we calculated the means of insar deformation measurements over the study area and seven rtk gps measurements fig 5 a shows times series of means of insar measured deformation and time series of means of seven rtk gps measurements fig 5 a further confirms that there are consistent subsidence trends 2013 2017 occurring in both insar and gps mean deformation measurements with subsidence rates of 4 mm year and 3 mm year respectively it also shows that both insar and gps time series consistently have significant seasonal variations in which the lowest subsidence and the highest uplift generally occur in spring early summer and fall respectively fig 3 a f fig 5 a the grace data showed interannual tws changes over the study area for the period of 2013 2017 and seasonal cycles with maximum value in spring early summer and minimum value in fall fig 5 b from the de seasonalized ds tws curve an increasing trend of tws can be seen in the study area from 2013 2017 the monthly precipitation data has some abnormal changes over time fig 5 c in general it has seasonal patterns with maximum and minimum values occurring approximately one month earlier than the tws consistent with previous studies wang and li 2015 li et al 2015 the de seasonalized monthly precipitation profile for this area had little annual change for the first two years 2013 and 2014 however from 2015 to 2017 it has an increasing trend the monthly change of water levels of lake ontario lake erie and lake huron for the period of 2013 2017 fig 5 d indicate that water levels for the great lakes have large seasonal variations and an increasing trend over the study period fig 5 d similar to the patterns shown in the grace tws and precipitation the hydrological information in fig 5 b d indicates a continuous gain of water over the southern ontario region during the study period the surface deformation measured by insar and gps presents inverse seasonal phase information with the lowest subsidence mostly in spring early summer and the highest uplift generally in fall furthermore insar and gps recorded a declining trend in surface deformation in the study area from 2013 2017 which is also inverse to the multi year increasing trend for water storage both multi year trend and seasonal variations of the insar and gps observed ground displacement correspond well to the changes in water storage which may imply that the surface deformation observed by insar and gps connects with water storage changes in the southern ontario region some studies have suggested that water mass variations may result in elastic ground loading deformation fu et al 2013 van dam et al 2001 wahr et al 2013 the weight of more water depresses the ground surface which deforms elastically in response to the load as water mass decreases the earth rebounds producing uplift therefore the consistent subsidence in southern ontario could be related to increased water loading an interpretation which is supported by correlations with the tws precipitation and great lakes water levels fig 5 b d this interpretation is further supported by wahr et al 2013 who demonstrate that the surface displacements are largest closest to the lake this also helps us to understand higher rates of insar observed subsidence along the lake ontario shoreline fig 2 several studies have demonstrated that seasonal ground surface deformation occurs as a result of seasonal variations in water mass in and on the earth s surface herring et al 2016 puskas et al 2017 generally water storage fluctuations follow a seasonal cycle of increased water loading during the winter and spring resulting from more precipitation and snow accumulation and decreased water loading in fall due to less precipitation and continual water withdrawal et discharge pumping during the summer growing season wang et al 2013 2014 2015 our study also suggests the potential influence of elastic surface deformation as a result of increased water loading in winter and spring and decreased water loading in fall these analyses suggest that the surface deformation may be primarily caused by the water loadings in the southern ontario region this study shows a different ground deformation behavor induced by the changes in water storage from previous studies for some regions such as taiwan southern netherland los angeles and mexico city hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 riel et al 2018 in which poroelastic surface deformations were observed in response to the groundwater changes for the poroelastic deformation pore spaces in aquifers and aquitards are supported by interstitial fluid pressure thus removal of water results in compaction of these pore spaces and is expressed as subsidence at the ground surface in those regions some portions of the land subsidence are permanent due to the irreversible compaction of aquitards resulted from overdrafting of groundwater unlike previous studies focusing on a site or a city hsu et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2017 2018 riel et al 2018 this study examined surface deformation over a 10 000 km2 area using high resolution radarsat 2 insar data this enable us to examine the spatial variations in surface deformation consistently over a large area on the basis of signal association and data integration the deformation is associated with water storage change it is worth mentioning that the spatial variations in ground deformation may be also caused by other geolgoical and environmental conditions different sediment types can cause different ground deformation behaviors because sediments soil react differently to waterloading for example in the east of brampton the region with low subsidence corresponded well with the sediment type of glaciolacustrine mud which has low saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with the surrounding upper till sediment which has relatively high saturated hydraulic conductivity normand and heggy 2015 fig 1 the interpration of spatial patterns in displacement remains a challenge for this preliminary study when multiple displacement causes may co exist and inadequate coherent signal return occurs across different geological terrains for comparison 5 conclusion in this study radarsat 2 sar data collected over five years 2013 2017 was used to detect surface deformation for a 10 000 km2 area in southern ontario a multi year declining trend is observed with an subsidence rate of 1 mm year to 10 mm year across the study area seasonal variation of surface deformation of up to 20 mm is also observed the insar results agrees well with the gps measurement from the rtk gps network in both multi year trend and seasonal variations the insar and gps results were found to correspond well to the changes in water storage estimated from the grace tws great lakes water levels and precipitation data for the region the results suggest that the water loading could be the main cause for the surface deformation in the southern ontario the loss of coherence in vegetated and agricultural areas has been identified as one of the main challenges especially for shorter wavelength sar in the application of insar for surface deformation castellazi et al 2016 however the man made objects such as buildings such as houses barns in agriculture fields can be served as permanent scatters thus substantially improve the coherence and making insar analysis possible year round for agriculture areas as demonstrated in this study improvement in coherence can be also achieved by increasing revisit time e g 2 3 days by radarsat constellation mission or using longer sar wavelengths e g 23 cm wavelength of alos 1 2 declaration of

8398,study region the semi arid wine region of guadalupe valley located in nw baja california méxico study focus recently recurrent dry years have diminishing groundwater resources threatening agricultural activities and the well being population in the northwest of baja california the climate variability through changes in precipitation and temperature might further the present situation this study presents the observed long term 1979 2016 hydro climatic and temperature trends extreme events and drought periods in the guadalupe valley for its economic and social relevance in the region new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed the annual seasonal precipitation rate reduction from 110 to 172 mm and an increase in mean annual seasonal temperature from 0 76 to 1 82 c we detected an abrupt downward change in annual precipitation in 1998 and a continuous period of reduction in precipitation rate from 1999 to 2016 at least 17 years also we detected an upward change in maximum temperature at 90 95 99th percentiles and an increase in dry seasonal annual periods after 1998 we linked the length of the meteorological drought to precipitation rate downward and drought severity to years with the lowest annual precipitation the decrease of precipitation and increase in temperature have had negative impacts on groundwater availability that have affected agriculture and population hence specific adaptation strategies are necessary to mitigate regional hydrological impacts keywords guadalupe valley bc homogeneity analysis mann kendall overexploited aquifer reconnaissance drought index semi arid wine region sen s slope 1 introduction the effects of climate variability on water resources have been the subjects of critical studies to improve water management at the local scale velasco et al 2017 the combined effect of the changes in precipitation patterns with increasing temperatures may negatively influence water availability and increase the occurrence of droughts li et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2019 also changes in precipitation may alter groundwater recharge yu and lin 2015 while changes in temperature may increase evaporation from terrain surface and lead to extreme precipitation events trenberth et al 2005 at a local scale to mitigate hydrologic impacts and to sustainably use water resources it is important to understand climate variability consequences on hydrological responses in the last three decades several studies around the world showed changes in precipitation and temperature patterns liu et al 2008 martinez et al 2012 sharma et al 2016 also the intensity and frequency of extreme events kousari et al 2013 pakalidou and karacosta 2018 ramkar and yadav 2018 due to the greenhouse effect since the late 19th century alexander et al 2006 long term precipitation and temperature trend analyses have been used to monitor climate variability and climate change at several spatial and temporal scales xu et al 2018 overall climate change has shown negative precipitation trends and positive temperature trends in arid and semi arid lands tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 rosmann et al 2016 salman et al 2017 araghi et al 2017 here we focus on northwest nw of baja california méxico and long term precipitation measures mean temperature extreme events and drought episodes high interannual variability describes this semi arid region arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 therefore it is vulnerable to adverse effects associated with precipitation variability and high temperatures facing a high impact on climate change in this century diffenbaugh et al 2008 at interannual and decadal timescales precipitation variations have been linked with el niño southern oscillation enso pavia et al 2006 arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 and with the pacific decadal oscillation mantua and hare 2002 higgins et al 2007 this hydroclimatic variations have produced sustained droughts episodes in the region del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 velasco et al 2017 furthermore drought conditions have been persistently extending across nw méxico since 1994 stahle et al 2009 given the regional vulnerability the socio economic and social impacts may be associated with climatic variability and drought periods hallack alegria et al 2012 studied the frequency and severity of meteorological drought at the basin scale performing the standardized precipitation index spi methodology and precipitation frequency analyses although they found statistically non significant trends concerning the variation in precipitation they observed a reduction in spi values towards the end of 2008 associated with an arid trend recently montecelos zamora 2018 conducted a basin scale study analyzing the effect of climate change with the swat soil and water assessment tool hydrological model and with the regcm4 3 regional circulation model rcm the calibration period for the model 30 years 1970 2000 to produce a future forecast an increase in annual precipitation related to winter summer rainfall of 8 and a mean annual temperature of 1 2 c over the next 19 years is expected we believe that analyses of climatic variability performed at spatial medium scales regional tend to minimize the hydrological effects on a particular region therefore we presented local research on climatic precipitation temperature trends and a historical drought characterization in the nw of baja california méxico specifically at the guadalupe valley for its regional economic and social relevance this research aimed to identify long term temporal changes in precipitation mean temperature in monthly seasonal and annual basis extreme one day precipitation maximum temperature events and assessing the meteorological drought at the meso betha scale these results will provide new information on climate trends in this semi arid mediterranean region its relationship with the recurring scarcity of water and may lead to comparisons with similar climate regions 2 methods 2 1 regional water issues overview northwestern baja california is characterized by a temperate arid climate garcía 2004 and a low water availability del toro guerrero et al 2014 the largest source of the water supply comes from the colorado river 60 national water commission conagua 2017 used mainly by the northernmost state cities mexicali tijuana tecate rosarito local groundwater extraction provides the rest campos gaytan et al 2014 and southern cities populations depend almost exclusively on groundwater supply and seawater desalination in 2017 the conagua reported ten aquifers with saline intrusion or saline groundwater fig 1 a nine are overexploited aquifers located in the most relevant agricultural zones valleys of guadalupe maneadero ojos negros santo tomás and san quintín and population centers cities of ensenada and mexicali the guadalupe valley study site fig 1b produces nearly 90 of the wines table nation daesslé et al 2006 the guadalupe aquifer has supplied the agricultural activities the entire local population and up to 40 to the city of ensenada conagua 2008 in 2014 the ensenada city water supply was reduced to 30 campos gaytan et al 2014 and since 2016 the contribution towards the city ceased fig 1a the primaries groundwater use is agricultural 72 6 and urban public use 18 4 the rest used by other activities 9 domestic industrial cattle conagua 2013 the demand for water has multiplied in recent years due to population growth and principally the expansion of the agricultural and industrial sectors therefore guadalupe aquifer has been affected by overuse and regular dry periods low precipitation conagua 2017 both factors have limited the replenishment process of the groundwater table 2 2 site description the guadalupe valley is located in the nw of baja california méxico limits between parallels 32 08 58 and 32 00 10 north latitude and between meridians 116 41 25 and 116 29 06 west longitude fig 1 it is an intermountain valley with an area of about 80 km2 del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 the primary use of land is agricultural and viticulture is the most representative practice the region has a semi arid mediterranean climate climate classification bsks garcía 2004 and surface water supplies are limited therefore economic agricultural and human well being depended on groundwater availability from the guadalupe aquifer the rainy season has a winter regime from december to march with an annual average of 298 mm and annual mean temperature of 17 9 c calculated with the historical average of the weather stations agua caliente and el porvenir from conagua fig 1b the altitude of the valley varies between 300 370 meters above sea level masl and the surrounding mountains between 400 1400 masl fig 1b 2 3 data the network of weather stations in northwestern méxico is extensive however time series often present incomplete data or less than 20 years of information therefore it becomes complicated to link the same time series between two or more weather stations del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 in this research we evaluated climatic data from eight weather stations near the study site and only two recorded continuous climatic data with more than 20 years of information agua caliente ac and el porvenir por weather stations fig 1b according to the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 the radius of the climatic influence of each weather station is 5 km fig 1b the ac and por climatic time sgeries record were 38 1979 2016 and 25 years 1992 2016 respectively fig 2 we use monthly seasonal annual precipitation and mean temperature data also we calculated potential evapotranspiration with the thornthwaite methodology 1948 fig 2 we use ac daily precipitation data from the climate computing program system clicom 2015 to study extreme precipitation events and maximum temperature tmax that exceeded the 90th p90 tmax90 95th p95 tmax95 and 99th p99 tmax99 percentiles during the 1979 2012 mean annual climatic data showed seasonal differences between both weather stations for instance precipitation 60 mm y por ac mean temperature almost one degree celsius ac por and potential evapotranspiration 50 mm y ac por table 1 2 4 statistical analysis of time series tests for the detection of long term climatic trends and changes can be classified into parametric and non parametric methods gocic and trajkovic 2013 in this study we used two non parametric methods the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and the sen slope estimator ss sen 1968 both methodologies contribute to the detection of monotonic upward or downward trends in time series and to changes in climate scenarios at various historical time intervals monthly seasonal and annual e g tabari et al 2011 tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 martinez et al 2012 kousari et al 2013 sharma et al 2016 rosmann et al 2016 bayer altın and barak 2017 mohammed and scholz 2017 pakalidou and karacosta 2018 salman et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2 4 1 the mann kendall test below is a brief explanation of the mann kendall analysis mentioned above for our data sets the mann kendall test statistic for a time series is calculated as follows mann 1945 kendall 1975 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of data points xj and xi are the data values of the time series and sgn represents the sign function defined as 2 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 the variance of the s statistic is calculated as follows 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 t i 5 18 where m represents the tied groups and ti represents the number of ties in rank i a tied group refers to a set of data from a sample that have the same value when the sample size is n 10 the standardized statistical test z s is calculated as follows 4 m k s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 positive and negative mk values indicate positive or negative trends respectively gocic and trajkovic 2013 the trend test is performed at the specific level of significance hypothesis testing for a 5 significance values α 0 05 as used in this study the null hypothesis is rejected when z 1 96 2 4 2 the sen s slope estimator when a linear trend is present in a series of seasonal climate data the change per unit time can be estimated using the sen s slope methodology ss tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 developed by sen in 1968 for n pairs of data 5 q i x j x k j k f o r i n where xj and xk are the values of the data at a time j and k j k respectively the values of n of qi are classified from lowest to highest the median of the slope or the sen s slope estimator ss is calculated with the following equation 6 s s q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d 1 2 q n 2 q n 1 2 i f n i s e v e n a serial correlation was tested using the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient r1 with a significance level of 5 for the two tailed test to prevent the effect of autocorrelation and its sequel to trend detection in time series hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 yue et al 2002 7 r 1 i 1 n 1 x t x x t 1 x i 1 n x t x 2 where x is the average of the sample n and xt is the value of the variable in time t the statistic r1 is tested against the null hypothesis using the two tailed test limit anderson 1942 duhan and pandey 2013 8 r 1 95 1 1 96 n 2 n 1 if the calculated value of r1 is within the confidence interval given by r1 95 the data are assumed to be independent of autocorrelation otherwise the data are considered to carry a serial correlation duhan and pandey 2013 2 4 3 homogeneity test the homogeneity tests for the assessment of climate data are based on a partial adjustment of the sums from the average buishand 1982 they are used for the timely detection of abrupt changes in climate series gocic and trajkovic 2013 the cumulative variances from the average value are calculated as 9 s o i 1 k x i x k 1 2 3 n the re scaled adjustment of the partial sums is determined by dividing the values of so with the standard deviation of the sample 10 s o s o d x k 0 n where dx is the standard deviation of the sample based on the values of so a y statistic which is sensitive to departures from homogeneity is defined as buishand 1982 11 y m a x s o 1 k n if the values of y are high this indicates a change in the time series buishand 1982 duhan and pandey 2013 if the magnitude of y n is greater than 1 3 then the time series is heterogeneous yu et al 2006 duhan and pandey 2013 2 4 4 calculation of reconnaissance drought index rdi the reconnaissance drought index rdi is a meteorological index for drought evaluation the calculation is based on the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration resulting in the deficit of the two aggregate quantities ramkar and yadav 2018 i e the climatic moisture deficiency xu et al 2015 therefore is more comprehensive than spi with a more reliable scientific basis tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the calculation of the initial value of the rdi ak for a given period starting in a given month k and for a given year is calculated with the following equation tsakiris and vangelis 2005 12 а k j 1 j k p j j 1 j k p e t j where pj and petj represent the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of the j th month respectively of the hydrological year the initial value of the rdi is consistent with the aridity index proposed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao for the assessment of aridity in a given area tsakiris et al 2007 in this region the hydrological year begins in october therefore october k 1 following the methodology proposed by thornthwaite 1948 we calculated the potential evapotranspiration by using mean temperature data of the weather stations ac and por fig 2 there are two expressions for calculating the rdi normalized rdi rdi n and standardized rdi rdi std the following equation is applied to normalize the rdi 13 r d i n а k а k 1 where āk symbolizes the arithmetic mean of ak performing a similar process used for spi calculation we standardized rdi 14 r d i s t d l n a k a k d s k where dsk represents the standard deviation it s found that ak follows a log normal distribution and makes it possible to assess the severity of the drought tsakiris and vangelis 2005 a positive rdi value shows wet periods and negative values dry periods the rdi results are similar to spi tsakiris and pangalou 2009 therefore the interpretation of the results was performed under the same criteria table 2 values between 0 1 represents a normal wet environmental condition and between 0 0 5 are considered within a normal dry environmental range tigkas 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological seasons historic p and mean t ac por data allowed us to identify four hydrological seasons in the year a wet winter season ws a dry summer season ds and two transition seasons from wet to dry months ts1 and dry to wet months ts2 fig 3 del toro guerrero et al 2018 the inter annual precipitation contribution has been more representative during ws 77 february has had a peak in average precipitation historically is the rainiest month followed by january march and december the p contribution in ds has been close to zero however transition seasons provided about 21 of the annual contribution appeared to be slightly more significant in autumn ts2 than in spring ts1 mean monthly temperature has been lower during ws ranged between 12 15 c avg 13 4 c in ds the temperature reached maximum values between 20 25 c avg 23 1 c historically august has been the hottest month avg 24 7 c the transition months showed a temperature intermediate range 15 20 c the annual thermal oscillation is about 12 c 3 2 trends in climate variables 3 2 1 mean temperature table 3 shows the mean temperature statistics α 0 05 and results we found changes on a monthly seasonal and annual basis at both weather stations indicating different rates increase in temperature for instance the rise in winter temperature affected both weather stations the increase in monthly temperature was 1 9 c at the ac in dec jan and mar on the other hand the temperature increase at the por ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 c from dec mar feb was the most affected month 2 6 c in seasonal ts2 and ws and annual ann terms the temperature increased between 0 76 1 52 c at ac while only a significant increased during ws 1 82 c was observed at por our findings are consistent with the average temperature increase of recent decades in northwestern méxico martínez austria et al 2016 and around the world e g tabari et al 2011 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 regional wet winter mean temperature increase may lead to an intensification of the evaporation rate as a result water vapor surplus can saturate the air quickly and cause more frequent and sudden extreme precipitations trenberth et al 2005 3 2 2 precipitation table 4 summarizes the descriptive statistics and the results of precipitation analysis we identified statistically significant trends α 0 05 in some periods and calculated the magnitude of hydro meteorological monthly seasonal and annual changes the average and maximum precipitation were highest during january and february in both weather stations ac por historically there is a peak in winter precipitation during these months driven by the weakening of the north pacific semi permanent anticyclone arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 overall we found representative changes around the reduction of the precipitation rate a total reduction was estimated in december ac 34 2 mm por 49 4 mm january ac 22 8 mm por 80 6 mm and march ac 57 mm por 44 2 mm throughout the period furthermore we estimated a seasonal and annual reduction in precipitation during ws ac 110 2 mm por 172 5 mm and ann ac 136 8 mm por 167 5 mm precipitation reduction in ws affects the total annual amount directly due to the maximum contribution occurs during that season during spring ts1 both weather stations showed an increase in the precipitation rate between 7 6 13 mm in autumn ts2 the precipitation decreased in the ac station 15 2 mm and increases in the por station 28 6 mm when comparing the average annual precipitation of both weather stations ac 267 2 mm por 329 3 mm we observed that the annual precipitation has decreased by 50 concerning the historical average in both sites the precipitation reduction is lower and less severe at the ac weather station in all periods this difference in reduction effect could be associated with the topographic variation liu et al 2008 at the weather station sites and to the spatial distribution of precipitation 3 2 3 analysis of one day extreme events we calculate the relative event frequency of one day extreme precipitation p90 22 5 mm day p95 30 5 mm day p99 50 3 mm day and maximum daily temperature tmax90 35 c day tmax95 37 c day tmax99 40 c day and its distribution in the hydrological year from 1979 to 2012 fig 4 the p and tmax 90 and 95 events showed a similar distribution to the annual hydrological year represented in fig 3 p90 events were more abundant than p95 p99 during the period mainly were presented between jan mar and increased month by month from oct feb fig 4 only a few events were observed in april may and august the p95 events occurred in a 6 month time window oct mar more regularly during jan mar the more extreme events p99 are the least recurrent and were presented during january february december and october in that order 3 2 3 1 maximum temperature analysis a pearson s correlation analysis r showed that the annual events of tmax90 r 0 09 tmax95 r 0 03 and tmax99 r 0 02 have a slight increase however the results are not statistically significant α 0 05 to note the long term fluctuations of the annual tmax average we smoothen the time series with a five year moving average we calculated tmax90 99 trends mk and the magnitude of change ss and found no statistically significant results α 0 05 when evaluating the whole period fig 5 however the homogeneity test results revealed a one year in which tmax time series trends change in direction the year of change occurred in 2001 tmax90 fig 5a 2000 tmax95 fig 5b and 1994 tmax99 fig 5c in all three cases we found statistically significant results α 0 05 corresponding trend direction shift from negative positive indicating an increase in tmax after the year of change for instance tmax90 total increment after 2001 was 0 66 c mk 0 95 ss 0 06 c year fig 5a tmax95 total increment after 2000 was 0 30 c mk 0 84 ss 0 026 c year fig 5b and tmax99 total increment after 1994 was 0 90 c mk 0 81 ss 0 05 c year fig 5c it is important to note that the slight increase in daily events of the maximum temperature during the year was not statistically significant instead the severity of the events after the year of the change was statistically significant mainly in the tmax99 tmax99 tmax90 tmax95 3 2 3 2 extreme precipitation analysis during the period 1979 2012 we calculated the number of days of extreme precipitation events in total 93 days exceeded the p90 threshold 22 5 mm 46 days p95 30 5 mm 10 days p99 50 3 mm also the most extreme precipitation event in the historical record occurred in 1980 with 122 mm day in order to analyze extreme precipitation events and the temporal variation we divided the time series into two periods a frequency analysis showed the extreme precipitation events in the first period 1980 1996 amounted to 51 events p90 25 p95 and 5 p99 while in the second period 1997 2012 the extreme events were reduced to 42 p90 21 p95 and p99 events remained unchanged fig 6 a these results suggested a second half extreme events p90 p95 reduction findings were consistent with arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 also we found that the occurrence of some extreme precipitation events corresponds to the warming phase of the sea temperature el niño in 1983 1993 and 1998 fig 6a b cavazos and rivas 2004 however during 2004 and 2010 we observed extreme precipitation events in neutral years fig 6b analyses of the historical precipitation time series 33 years showed the occurrence of extreme events p90 in 28 years p95 in 20 years and p99 in 7 years therefore the annual probability of at least one extreme event occurring in the area is approximately 85 p90 61 p95 and 21 p99 3 3 meteorological drought assessment 3 3 1 detection of change in precipitation time series based on the statistically significant mk results table 4 we applied a homogeneity test to detect the year of change in the precipitation time series trends table 5 during 1998 ws and annual we detect the most representative change in both weather stations the transition trends went from ascending to descending wet periods before and after 1998 respectively table 5 fig 7 in the historical record 1998 was classified as a strong phase of el niño cavazos and rivas 2004 el niño oceanic index climate prediction center oni 2018 the year of change detection indicated the origin of precipitation rate reduction and the transition from a positive stable state to a negative stable we calculate a cumulative frequency analysis by the difference between annual precipitation and the average historical annual precipitation year by year fig 7 the results revealed that the increase in precipitation rate before 1998 without being statistically significant however the reduction in precipitation rate after 1998 was statistically significant α 0 01 the year of change 1998 marked the shift from a stage with abundant wet years 1980 1998 ac fig 7a 1992 1998 por fig 7b to another with a repetitive reduction in the annual precipitation rate 1999 2016 figs 7a b 3 3 2 detection of drought periods in this section we evaluated the temporal variation and severity of the meteorological drought the results of the reconnaissance drought index rdi shown that meteorological drought episodes co occur in both weather stations fig 8 pearson s correlation analysis revealed a close positive relationship between the rdi values of both weather stations in the transition seasons wet season and annual r 0 76 ts2 r 0 79 ts1 r 0 84 ws r 0 88 annual α 0 05 we found years with non precipitation in the transitional and dry seasons at both weather stations symbolized by the triangles in fig 8 for instance in ts2 ts1 and ds the non precipitation episodes occurred in two hydrological years at ac por fig 8a and f in two at por fig 8h and six at por fig 8i respectively the results suggested that the por weather station climatic zone the absence of precipitation has been more recurrent than the ac weather station climatic zone mainly during ds the shift between the strong el niño event 1998 to la niña event fig 6b marked the onset of drought periods on an annual scale drought periods were evident fig 8e and j after that during the wet season fig 8b and g in both weather stations 1998 has been one of the wettest years in the regional hydro climatic record cavazos and rivas 2004 hallack alegria et al 2012 and presented the highest positive rdi value figs 8e and j classified as severely wet table 2 on the contrary the dry years classified as extreme and severe drought were represented by the highest negative rdi values table 2 the rdi s highest negative values co occur with the lowest annual precipitation years fig 2a b fig 8e and j 2002 2004 2006 2007 2014 however those years were cataloged with a normal condition according to the oni register fig 6b we analyzed the frequency of wet and dry periods that have occurred in the region before and after the precipitation year of change 1998 in table 6 we summarize the observations we found a reduction in wet years and an increase in dry years in the area after the year of change 1998 table 6 the years cataloged as el niño and la niña followed the same pattern in the analysis we interpreted the periods of meteorological drought considering the cumulative frequency analysis results of annual precipitation cfa ap in fig 7 and annual rdi values fig 8e and j although an abnormally wet year was observed during the drought periods e g 2005 the cumulative reduction of annual precipitation since 1998 fig 7 and the succession of dry years fig 8e and j could intervene with the progressive reduction of the guadalupe aquifer water table tirivarombo et al 2018 indicated that intermediate wet years are not sufficient to reduce the water deficit at the hydrological level due to the accumulated hydric scarcity and cumulated reduction of the groundwater table of previous years even moderate droughts have been shown to cause significant problems if they persist for several years tigkas 2008 we cataloged two drought periods during the study period the first period persisted for at least ten years 1999 2009 and the second period occurred four years later 2013 2016 fig 8e and j the drought periods affected both weather station zones the most severe drought years occurred after 1998 in 2002 2007 and 2014 which were classified as years with extreme and severe drought table 2 and were the driest years in the region p 100 mm overall the meteorological drought periods are related to the occurrence of a succession of years in which the annual precipitation is lower than the historical average groisman and knight in 2008 reported a sequence of abnormally dry periods between 2000 and 2002 in the sw of the united states extending across the nw of méxico also identified 2002 as the driest year in the last 40 years the national aeronautics and space administration nasa reported that 2014 and 2018 were the warmest years in the world in the recent climate record several technical assessments have been shown that the groundwater level of the guadalupe aquifer has progressively decreased the aquifer water table has shown only a partial recovery of the water table in some extraordinary precipitation years e g 2010 conagua 2008 2013 2017 2018 the estimated hydric deficit has been 12 04 mm3 in 2013 the official journal of the federation dof 2013 12 21 mm3 in 2014 dof 2015 and more recently 18 23 mm3 in 2015 dof 2018 therefore we consider that the phenomenon of long term meteorological drought has had repercussions on the groundwater replenishment process in the region without taking into account the intensive and extensive anthropogenic use of groundwater e g pumping extraction the combination of pet and p fluxes provides a description of the drought phenomenon thomas et al 2016 because meteorological drought conceived as a water deficit and addressed through a balance between the relative inputs p and outputs pet of the water resource tsakiris and vangelis 2005 we fitted logarithmic regression models to annual rdi with annual pet and annual p for both weather stations ac por the models suggested that rdi pet relations were marginal on the other hand the highest correlations were observed for the rdi p r2 0 99 α 0 01 this order applied for both weather stations the rdi p logarithmic regression models are summarized below 15 r d i a c 1

drought severity periods in the guadalupe valley located nw of baja california mexico variability of climatic factors as precipitation and temperature was observed to be both spatially and temporally related at ac por weather stations results revealed annual seasonal precipitation rate reduction from 110 to 172 mm and an increase in mean annual seasonal temperature from 0 76 to 1 82 c changes that occurred mainly in the wet winter months during which aquifers are replenished we detected an abrupt downward change in annual precipitation in 1998 and then a downward trend for at least 17 years 1999 2016 also we detected an upward change in maximum temperature more severe events and an increase in dry seasonal annual periods after 1998 we linked the meteorological drought periods and drought severity years to precipitation rate downward and the lowest annual precipitation years respectively the decrease of precipitation and increase in temperature have had negative impacts on groundwater availability that have affected agriculture and population although climate variability on a local scale is not often investigated we find relevant local changes in precipitation and temperature patterns associated with regional and global climate projections therefore the identified patterns of precipitation temperature and periods of drought in the study area can be a reference for the

8398,study region the semi arid wine region of guadalupe valley located in nw baja california méxico study focus recently recurrent dry years have diminishing groundwater resources threatening agricultural activities and the well being population in the northwest of baja california the climate variability through changes in precipitation and temperature might further the present situation this study presents the observed long term 1979 2016 hydro climatic and temperature trends extreme events and drought periods in the guadalupe valley for its economic and social relevance in the region new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed the annual seasonal precipitation rate reduction from 110 to 172 mm and an increase in mean annual seasonal temperature from 0 76 to 1 82 c we detected an abrupt downward change in annual precipitation in 1998 and a continuous period of reduction in precipitation rate from 1999 to 2016 at least 17 years also we detected an upward change in maximum temperature at 90 95 99th percentiles and an increase in dry seasonal annual periods after 1998 we linked the length of the meteorological drought to precipitation rate downward and drought severity to years with the lowest annual precipitation the decrease of precipitation and increase in temperature have had negative impacts on groundwater availability that have affected agriculture and population hence specific adaptation strategies are necessary to mitigate regional hydrological impacts keywords guadalupe valley bc homogeneity analysis mann kendall overexploited aquifer reconnaissance drought index semi arid wine region sen s slope 1 introduction the effects of climate variability on water resources have been the subjects of critical studies to improve water management at the local scale velasco et al 2017 the combined effect of the changes in precipitation patterns with increasing temperatures may negatively influence water availability and increase the occurrence of droughts li et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2019 also changes in precipitation may alter groundwater recharge yu and lin 2015 while changes in temperature may increase evaporation from terrain surface and lead to extreme precipitation events trenberth et al 2005 at a local scale to mitigate hydrologic impacts and to sustainably use water resources it is important to understand climate variability consequences on hydrological responses in the last three decades several studies around the world showed changes in precipitation and temperature patterns liu et al 2008 martinez et al 2012 sharma et al 2016 also the intensity and frequency of extreme events kousari et al 2013 pakalidou and karacosta 2018 ramkar and yadav 2018 due to the greenhouse effect since the late 19th century alexander et al 2006 long term precipitation and temperature trend analyses have been used to monitor climate variability and climate change at several spatial and temporal scales xu et al 2018 overall climate change has shown negative precipitation trends and positive temperature trends in arid and semi arid lands tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 rosmann et al 2016 salman et al 2017 araghi et al 2017 here we focus on northwest nw of baja california méxico and long term precipitation measures mean temperature extreme events and drought episodes high interannual variability describes this semi arid region arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 therefore it is vulnerable to adverse effects associated with precipitation variability and high temperatures facing a high impact on climate change in this century diffenbaugh et al 2008 at interannual and decadal timescales precipitation variations have been linked with el niño southern oscillation enso pavia et al 2006 arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 and with the pacific decadal oscillation mantua and hare 2002 higgins et al 2007 this hydroclimatic variations have produced sustained droughts episodes in the region del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 velasco et al 2017 furthermore drought conditions have been persistently extending across nw méxico since 1994 stahle et al 2009 given the regional vulnerability the socio economic and social impacts may be associated with climatic variability and drought periods hallack alegria et al 2012 studied the frequency and severity of meteorological drought at the basin scale performing the standardized precipitation index spi methodology and precipitation frequency analyses although they found statistically non significant trends concerning the variation in precipitation they observed a reduction in spi values towards the end of 2008 associated with an arid trend recently montecelos zamora 2018 conducted a basin scale study analyzing the effect of climate change with the swat soil and water assessment tool hydrological model and with the regcm4 3 regional circulation model rcm the calibration period for the model 30 years 1970 2000 to produce a future forecast an increase in annual precipitation related to winter summer rainfall of 8 and a mean annual temperature of 1 2 c over the next 19 years is expected we believe that analyses of climatic variability performed at spatial medium scales regional tend to minimize the hydrological effects on a particular region therefore we presented local research on climatic precipitation temperature trends and a historical drought characterization in the nw of baja california méxico specifically at the guadalupe valley for its regional economic and social relevance this research aimed to identify long term temporal changes in precipitation mean temperature in monthly seasonal and annual basis extreme one day precipitation maximum temperature events and assessing the meteorological drought at the meso betha scale these results will provide new information on climate trends in this semi arid mediterranean region its relationship with the recurring scarcity of water and may lead to comparisons with similar climate regions 2 methods 2 1 regional water issues overview northwestern baja california is characterized by a temperate arid climate garcía 2004 and a low water availability del toro guerrero et al 2014 the largest source of the water supply comes from the colorado river 60 national water commission conagua 2017 used mainly by the northernmost state cities mexicali tijuana tecate rosarito local groundwater extraction provides the rest campos gaytan et al 2014 and southern cities populations depend almost exclusively on groundwater supply and seawater desalination in 2017 the conagua reported ten aquifers with saline intrusion or saline groundwater fig 1 a nine are overexploited aquifers located in the most relevant agricultural zones valleys of guadalupe maneadero ojos negros santo tomás and san quintín and population centers cities of ensenada and mexicali the guadalupe valley study site fig 1b produces nearly 90 of the wines table nation daesslé et al 2006 the guadalupe aquifer has supplied the agricultural activities the entire local population and up to 40 to the city of ensenada conagua 2008 in 2014 the ensenada city water supply was reduced to 30 campos gaytan et al 2014 and since 2016 the contribution towards the city ceased fig 1a the primaries groundwater use is agricultural 72 6 and urban public use 18 4 the rest used by other activities 9 domestic industrial cattle conagua 2013 the demand for water has multiplied in recent years due to population growth and principally the expansion of the agricultural and industrial sectors therefore guadalupe aquifer has been affected by overuse and regular dry periods low precipitation conagua 2017 both factors have limited the replenishment process of the groundwater table 2 2 site description the guadalupe valley is located in the nw of baja california méxico limits between parallels 32 08 58 and 32 00 10 north latitude and between meridians 116 41 25 and 116 29 06 west longitude fig 1 it is an intermountain valley with an area of about 80 km2 del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 the primary use of land is agricultural and viticulture is the most representative practice the region has a semi arid mediterranean climate climate classification bsks garcía 2004 and surface water supplies are limited therefore economic agricultural and human well being depended on groundwater availability from the guadalupe aquifer the rainy season has a winter regime from december to march with an annual average of 298 mm and annual mean temperature of 17 9 c calculated with the historical average of the weather stations agua caliente and el porvenir from conagua fig 1b the altitude of the valley varies between 300 370 meters above sea level masl and the surrounding mountains between 400 1400 masl fig 1b 2 3 data the network of weather stations in northwestern méxico is extensive however time series often present incomplete data or less than 20 years of information therefore it becomes complicated to link the same time series between two or more weather stations del toro guerrero and gunter kretzschmar 2017 in this research we evaluated climatic data from eight weather stations near the study site and only two recorded continuous climatic data with more than 20 years of information agua caliente ac and el porvenir por weather stations fig 1b according to the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 the radius of the climatic influence of each weather station is 5 km fig 1b the ac and por climatic time sgeries record were 38 1979 2016 and 25 years 1992 2016 respectively fig 2 we use monthly seasonal annual precipitation and mean temperature data also we calculated potential evapotranspiration with the thornthwaite methodology 1948 fig 2 we use ac daily precipitation data from the climate computing program system clicom 2015 to study extreme precipitation events and maximum temperature tmax that exceeded the 90th p90 tmax90 95th p95 tmax95 and 99th p99 tmax99 percentiles during the 1979 2012 mean annual climatic data showed seasonal differences between both weather stations for instance precipitation 60 mm y por ac mean temperature almost one degree celsius ac por and potential evapotranspiration 50 mm y ac por table 1 2 4 statistical analysis of time series tests for the detection of long term climatic trends and changes can be classified into parametric and non parametric methods gocic and trajkovic 2013 in this study we used two non parametric methods the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and the sen slope estimator ss sen 1968 both methodologies contribute to the detection of monotonic upward or downward trends in time series and to changes in climate scenarios at various historical time intervals monthly seasonal and annual e g tabari et al 2011 tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 martinez et al 2012 kousari et al 2013 sharma et al 2016 rosmann et al 2016 bayer altın and barak 2017 mohammed and scholz 2017 pakalidou and karacosta 2018 salman et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2 4 1 the mann kendall test below is a brief explanation of the mann kendall analysis mentioned above for our data sets the mann kendall test statistic for a time series is calculated as follows mann 1945 kendall 1975 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of data points xj and xi are the data values of the time series and sgn represents the sign function defined as 2 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 the variance of the s statistic is calculated as follows 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 t i 5 18 where m represents the tied groups and ti represents the number of ties in rank i a tied group refers to a set of data from a sample that have the same value when the sample size is n 10 the standardized statistical test z s is calculated as follows 4 m k s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 positive and negative mk values indicate positive or negative trends respectively gocic and trajkovic 2013 the trend test is performed at the specific level of significance hypothesis testing for a 5 significance values α 0 05 as used in this study the null hypothesis is rejected when z 1 96 2 4 2 the sen s slope estimator when a linear trend is present in a series of seasonal climate data the change per unit time can be estimated using the sen s slope methodology ss tabari and hosseinzadeh talaee 2011 developed by sen in 1968 for n pairs of data 5 q i x j x k j k f o r i n where xj and xk are the values of the data at a time j and k j k respectively the values of n of qi are classified from lowest to highest the median of the slope or the sen s slope estimator ss is calculated with the following equation 6 s s q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d 1 2 q n 2 q n 1 2 i f n i s e v e n a serial correlation was tested using the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient r1 with a significance level of 5 for the two tailed test to prevent the effect of autocorrelation and its sequel to trend detection in time series hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 yue et al 2002 7 r 1 i 1 n 1 x t x x t 1 x i 1 n x t x 2 where x is the average of the sample n and xt is the value of the variable in time t the statistic r1 is tested against the null hypothesis using the two tailed test limit anderson 1942 duhan and pandey 2013 8 r 1 95 1 1 96 n 2 n 1 if the calculated value of r1 is within the confidence interval given by r1 95 the data are assumed to be independent of autocorrelation otherwise the data are considered to carry a serial correlation duhan and pandey 2013 2 4 3 homogeneity test the homogeneity tests for the assessment of climate data are based on a partial adjustment of the sums from the average buishand 1982 they are used for the timely detection of abrupt changes in climate series gocic and trajkovic 2013 the cumulative variances from the average value are calculated as 9 s o i 1 k x i x k 1 2 3 n the re scaled adjustment of the partial sums is determined by dividing the values of so with the standard deviation of the sample 10 s o s o d x k 0 n where dx is the standard deviation of the sample based on the values of so a y statistic which is sensitive to departures from homogeneity is defined as buishand 1982 11 y m a x s o 1 k n if the values of y are high this indicates a change in the time series buishand 1982 duhan and pandey 2013 if the magnitude of y n is greater than 1 3 then the time series is heterogeneous yu et al 2006 duhan and pandey 2013 2 4 4 calculation of reconnaissance drought index rdi the reconnaissance drought index rdi is a meteorological index for drought evaluation the calculation is based on the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration resulting in the deficit of the two aggregate quantities ramkar and yadav 2018 i e the climatic moisture deficiency xu et al 2015 therefore is more comprehensive than spi with a more reliable scientific basis tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the calculation of the initial value of the rdi ak for a given period starting in a given month k and for a given year is calculated with the following equation tsakiris and vangelis 2005 12 а k j 1 j k p j j 1 j k p e t j where pj and petj represent the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of the j th month respectively of the hydrological year the initial value of the rdi is consistent with the aridity index proposed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao for the assessment of aridity in a given area tsakiris et al 2007 in this region the hydrological year begins in october therefore october k 1 following the methodology proposed by thornthwaite 1948 we calculated the potential evapotranspiration by using mean temperature data of the weather stations ac and por fig 2 there are two expressions for calculating the rdi normalized rdi rdi n and standardized rdi rdi std the following equation is applied to normalize the rdi 13 r d i n а k а k 1 where āk symbolizes the arithmetic mean of ak performing a similar process used for spi calculation we standardized rdi 14 r d i s t d l n a k a k d s k where dsk represents the standard deviation it s found that ak follows a log normal distribution and makes it possible to assess the severity of the drought tsakiris and vangelis 2005 a positive rdi value shows wet periods and negative values dry periods the rdi results are similar to spi tsakiris and pangalou 2009 therefore the interpretation of the results was performed under the same criteria table 2 values between 0 1 represents a normal wet environmental condition and between 0 0 5 are considered within a normal dry environmental range tigkas 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological seasons historic p and mean t ac por data allowed us to identify four hydrological seasons in the year a wet winter season ws a dry summer season ds and two transition seasons from wet to dry months ts1 and dry to wet months ts2 fig 3 del toro guerrero et al 2018 the inter annual precipitation contribution has been more representative during ws 77 february has had a peak in average precipitation historically is the rainiest month followed by january march and december the p contribution in ds has been close to zero however transition seasons provided about 21 of the annual contribution appeared to be slightly more significant in autumn ts2 than in spring ts1 mean monthly temperature has been lower during ws ranged between 12 15 c avg 13 4 c in ds the temperature reached maximum values between 20 25 c avg 23 1 c historically august has been the hottest month avg 24 7 c the transition months showed a temperature intermediate range 15 20 c the annual thermal oscillation is about 12 c 3 2 trends in climate variables 3 2 1 mean temperature table 3 shows the mean temperature statistics α 0 05 and results we found changes on a monthly seasonal and annual basis at both weather stations indicating different rates increase in temperature for instance the rise in winter temperature affected both weather stations the increase in monthly temperature was 1 9 c at the ac in dec jan and mar on the other hand the temperature increase at the por ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 c from dec mar feb was the most affected month 2 6 c in seasonal ts2 and ws and annual ann terms the temperature increased between 0 76 1 52 c at ac while only a significant increased during ws 1 82 c was observed at por our findings are consistent with the average temperature increase of recent decades in northwestern méxico martínez austria et al 2016 and around the world e g tabari et al 2011 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2018 regional wet winter mean temperature increase may lead to an intensification of the evaporation rate as a result water vapor surplus can saturate the air quickly and cause more frequent and sudden extreme precipitations trenberth et al 2005 3 2 2 precipitation table 4 summarizes the descriptive statistics and the results of precipitation analysis we identified statistically significant trends α 0 05 in some periods and calculated the magnitude of hydro meteorological monthly seasonal and annual changes the average and maximum precipitation were highest during january and february in both weather stations ac por historically there is a peak in winter precipitation during these months driven by the weakening of the north pacific semi permanent anticyclone arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 overall we found representative changes around the reduction of the precipitation rate a total reduction was estimated in december ac 34 2 mm por 49 4 mm january ac 22 8 mm por 80 6 mm and march ac 57 mm por 44 2 mm throughout the period furthermore we estimated a seasonal and annual reduction in precipitation during ws ac 110 2 mm por 172 5 mm and ann ac 136 8 mm por 167 5 mm precipitation reduction in ws affects the total annual amount directly due to the maximum contribution occurs during that season during spring ts1 both weather stations showed an increase in the precipitation rate between 7 6 13 mm in autumn ts2 the precipitation decreased in the ac station 15 2 mm and increases in the por station 28 6 mm when comparing the average annual precipitation of both weather stations ac 267 2 mm por 329 3 mm we observed that the annual precipitation has decreased by 50 concerning the historical average in both sites the precipitation reduction is lower and less severe at the ac weather station in all periods this difference in reduction effect could be associated with the topographic variation liu et al 2008 at the weather station sites and to the spatial distribution of precipitation 3 2 3 analysis of one day extreme events we calculate the relative event frequency of one day extreme precipitation p90 22 5 mm day p95 30 5 mm day p99 50 3 mm day and maximum daily temperature tmax90 35 c day tmax95 37 c day tmax99 40 c day and its distribution in the hydrological year from 1979 to 2012 fig 4 the p and tmax 90 and 95 events showed a similar distribution to the annual hydrological year represented in fig 3 p90 events were more abundant than p95 p99 during the period mainly were presented between jan mar and increased month by month from oct feb fig 4 only a few events were observed in april may and august the p95 events occurred in a 6 month time window oct mar more regularly during jan mar the more extreme events p99 are the least recurrent and were presented during january february december and october in that order 3 2 3 1 maximum temperature analysis a pearson s correlation analysis r showed that the annual events of tmax90 r 0 09 tmax95 r 0 03 and tmax99 r 0 02 have a slight increase however the results are not statistically significant α 0 05 to note the long term fluctuations of the annual tmax average we smoothen the time series with a five year moving average we calculated tmax90 99 trends mk and the magnitude of change ss and found no statistically significant results α 0 05 when evaluating the whole period fig 5 however the homogeneity test results revealed a one year in which tmax time series trends change in direction the year of change occurred in 2001 tmax90 fig 5a 2000 tmax95 fig 5b and 1994 tmax99 fig 5c in all three cases we found statistically significant results α 0 05 corresponding trend direction shift from negative positive indicating an increase in tmax after the year of change for instance tmax90 total increment after 2001 was 0 66 c mk 0 95 ss 0 06 c year fig 5a tmax95 total increment after 2000 was 0 30 c mk 0 84 ss 0 026 c year fig 5b and tmax99 total increment after 1994 was 0 90 c mk 0 81 ss 0 05 c year fig 5c it is important to note that the slight increase in daily events of the maximum temperature during the year was not statistically significant instead the severity of the events after the year of the change was statistically significant mainly in the tmax99 tmax99 tmax90 tmax95 3 2 3 2 extreme precipitation analysis during the period 1979 2012 we calculated the number of days of extreme precipitation events in total 93 days exceeded the p90 threshold 22 5 mm 46 days p95 30 5 mm 10 days p99 50 3 mm also the most extreme precipitation event in the historical record occurred in 1980 with 122 mm day in order to analyze extreme precipitation events and the temporal variation we divided the time series into two periods a frequency analysis showed the extreme precipitation events in the first period 1980 1996 amounted to 51 events p90 25 p95 and 5 p99 while in the second period 1997 2012 the extreme events were reduced to 42 p90 21 p95 and p99 events remained unchanged fig 6 a these results suggested a second half extreme events p90 p95 reduction findings were consistent with arriaga ramírez and cavazos 2010 also we found that the occurrence of some extreme precipitation events corresponds to the warming phase of the sea temperature el niño in 1983 1993 and 1998 fig 6a b cavazos and rivas 2004 however during 2004 and 2010 we observed extreme precipitation events in neutral years fig 6b analyses of the historical precipitation time series 33 years showed the occurrence of extreme events p90 in 28 years p95 in 20 years and p99 in 7 years therefore the annual probability of at least one extreme event occurring in the area is approximately 85 p90 61 p95 and 21 p99 3 3 meteorological drought assessment 3 3 1 detection of change in precipitation time series based on the statistically significant mk results table 4 we applied a homogeneity test to detect the year of change in the precipitation time series trends table 5 during 1998 ws and annual we detect the most representative change in both weather stations the transition trends went from ascending to descending wet periods before and after 1998 respectively table 5 fig 7 in the historical record 1998 was classified as a strong phase of el niño cavazos and rivas 2004 el niño oceanic index climate prediction center oni 2018 the year of change detection indicated the origin of precipitation rate reduction and the transition from a positive stable state to a negative stable we calculate a cumulative frequency analysis by the difference between annual precipitation and the average historical annual precipitation year by year fig 7 the results revealed that the increase in precipitation rate before 1998 without being statistically significant however the reduction in precipitation rate after 1998 was statistically significant α 0 01 the year of change 1998 marked the shift from a stage with abundant wet years 1980 1998 ac fig 7a 1992 1998 por fig 7b to another with a repetitive reduction in the annual precipitation rate 1999 2016 figs 7a b 3 3 2 detection of drought periods in this section we evaluated the temporal variation and severity of the meteorological drought the results of the reconnaissance drought index rdi shown that meteorological drought episodes co occur in both weather stations fig 8 pearson s correlation analysis revealed a close positive relationship between the rdi values of both weather stations in the transition seasons wet season and annual r 0 76 ts2 r 0 79 ts1 r 0 84 ws r 0 88 annual α 0 05 we found years with non precipitation in the transitional and dry seasons at both weather stations symbolized by the triangles in fig 8 for instance in ts2 ts1 and ds the non precipitation episodes occurred in two hydrological years at ac por fig 8a and f in two at por fig 8h and six at por fig 8i respectively the results suggested that the por weather station climatic zone the absence of precipitation has been more recurrent than the ac weather station climatic zone mainly during ds the shift between the strong el niño event 1998 to la niña event fig 6b marked the onset of drought periods on an annual scale drought periods were evident fig 8e and j after that during the wet season fig 8b and g in both weather stations 1998 has been one of the wettest years in the regional hydro climatic record cavazos and rivas 2004 hallack alegria et al 2012 and presented the highest positive rdi value figs 8e and j classified as severely wet table 2 on the contrary the dry years classified as extreme and severe drought were represented by the highest negative rdi values table 2 the rdi s highest negative values co occur with the lowest annual precipitation years fig 2a b fig 8e and j 2002 2004 2006 2007 2014 however those years were cataloged with a normal condition according to the oni register fig 6b we analyzed the frequency of wet and dry periods that have occurred in the region before and after the precipitation year of change 1998 in table 6 we summarize the observations we found a reduction in wet years and an increase in dry years in the area after the year of change 1998 table 6 the years cataloged as el niño and la niña followed the same pattern in the analysis we interpreted the periods of meteorological drought considering the cumulative frequency analysis results of annual precipitation cfa ap in fig 7 and annual rdi values fig 8e and j although an abnormally wet year was observed during the drought periods e g 2005 the cumulative reduction of annual precipitation since 1998 fig 7 and the succession of dry years fig 8e and j could intervene with the progressive reduction of the guadalupe aquifer water table tirivarombo et al 2018 indicated that intermediate wet years are not sufficient to reduce the water deficit at the hydrological level due to the accumulated hydric scarcity and cumulated reduction of the groundwater table of previous years even moderate droughts have been shown to cause significant problems if they persist for several years tigkas 2008 we cataloged two drought periods during the study period the first period persisted for at least ten years 1999 2009 and the second period occurred four years later 2013 2016 fig 8e and j the drought periods affected both weather station zones the most severe drought years occurred after 1998 in 2002 2007 and 2014 which were classified as years with extreme and severe drought table 2 and were the driest years in the region p 100 mm overall the meteorological drought periods are related to the occurrence of a succession of years in which the annual precipitation is lower than the historical average groisman and knight in 2008 reported a sequence of abnormally dry periods between 2000 and 2002 in the sw of the united states extending across the nw of méxico also identified 2002 as the driest year in the last 40 years the national aeronautics and space administration nasa reported that 2014 and 2018 were the warmest years in the world in the recent climate record several technical assessments have been shown that the groundwater level of the guadalupe aquifer has progressively decreased the aquifer water table has shown only a partial recovery of the water table in some extraordinary precipitation years e g 2010 conagua 2008 2013 2017 2018 the estimated hydric deficit has been 12 04 mm3 in 2013 the official journal of the federation dof 2013 12 21 mm3 in 2014 dof 2015 and more recently 18 23 mm3 in 2015 dof 2018 therefore we consider that the phenomenon of long term meteorological drought has had repercussions on the groundwater replenishment process in the region without taking into account the intensive and extensive anthropogenic use of groundwater e g pumping extraction the combination of pet and p fluxes provides a description of the drought phenomenon thomas et al 2016 because meteorological drought conceived as a water deficit and addressed through a balance between the relative inputs p and outputs pet of the water resource tsakiris and vangelis 2005 we fitted logarithmic regression models to annual rdi with annual pet and annual p for both weather stations ac por the models suggested that rdi pet relations were marginal on the other hand the highest correlations were observed for the rdi p r2 0 99 α 0 01 this order applied for both weather stations the rdi p logarithmic regression models are summarized below 15 r d i a c 1 8603 ln a p a c 10 138 p 0 0001 16 r d i p o r 1 9807 ln a p p o r 11 243 p 0 0001 4 conclusion this study investigated long term 1979 2016 trends in precipitation mean temperature extreme events and drought severity periods in the guadalupe valley located nw of baja california mexico variability of climatic factors as precipitation and temperature was observed to be both spatially and temporally related at ac por weather stations results revealed annual seasonal precipitation rate reduction from 110 to 172 mm and an increase in mean annual seasonal temperature from 0 76 to 1 82 c changes that occurred mainly in the wet winter months during which aquifers are replenished we detected an abrupt downward change in annual precipitation in 1998 and then a downward trend for at least 17 years 1999 2016 also we detected an upward change in maximum temperature more severe events and an increase in dry seasonal annual periods after 1998 we linked the meteorological drought periods and drought severity years to precipitation rate downward and the lowest annual precipitation years respectively the decrease of precipitation and increase in temperature have had negative impacts on groundwater availability that have affected agriculture and population although climate variability on a local scale is not often investigated we find relevant local changes in precipitation and temperature patterns associated with regional and global climate projections therefore the identified patterns of precipitation temperature and periods of drought in the study area can be a reference for the

8399,study region seneca river basin south carolina usa study focus this study focuses on evaluating different precipitation products on streamflow and water quality modeling we used 13 years 2001 2014 of daily data from multiple precipitation products the precipitation products are classified into three categories 1 products based on observed precipitation data rain gauges located within the study area and prism data 2 five satellite based precipitation products 3b42 3b42rt persiann cdr persiann and gpcp 1dd and 3 one reanalysis product cfsr the soil and water assessment tool swat was calibrated and validated using these precipitation products against monthly observed streamflow total nitrogen tn loads and total phosphorus tp loads within the seneca river basin situated in northwest of south carolina usa for each precipitation product the best performing model parameters was determined using the sequential uncertainty fitting procedure sufp2 new hydrological insights for the region results showed that the spatio temporal pattern of precipitation products varies and further influenced the streamflow and water quality simulations most of the precipitation products achieved at least satisfactory performance r2 0 50 ns 0 50 and pbias 15 for streamflow and water quality prism product showed the best overall performance followed by 3b42 and persiann cdr whereas cfsr and persiann products comparatively performed poorly for streamflow and water quality simulations the uncertainty in the precipitation products was reflected in the streamflow that further affected the water quality simulations tn and tp loads in addition this study showed that the parameter uncertainty significantly varies among precipitation products leading to a considerable uncertainty in simulation results especially for tn and tp our results suggest that using multiple precipitation products can increase the level of confidence in hydrologic model simulation particularly in water quality modeling keywords precipitation swat uncertainty streamflow water quality 1 introduction watershed models have been widely used to predict hydrological processes and the transport of non point source nps pollution engel et al 1993 easton et al 2008 the ability of these models to predict runoff and the transport of nps at a watershed level depends largely on how well the model inputs are spatially distributed chaplot et al 2005 guzman et al 2015 typically precipitation is an important driving force of hydrological processes and nps pollution cho et al 2009 masih et al 2010 price et al 2014 hence an accurate representation of temporal and spatial variability of precipitation patterns is crucial for investigating streamflow patterns as well as transport of nps pollution and identifying the critical source areas within a watershed numerous studies show that neglecting spatial distribution of precipitation can have a significant effect on the model outputs e g dawdy and bergmann 1969 troutman 1983 duncan et al 1993 faurès et al 1995 lopes 1996 andréassian et al 2001 bárdossy and das 2008 in general rain gauge networks do not fully represent the spatial patterns of rainfall in small watersheds a uniform distribution of rainfall is usually assumed in modeling hydrological behavior due to lack of gauge data faurès et al 1995 goodrich et al 1995 cho et al 2009 this assumption of spatially uniform rainfall may not be valid for larger watersheds or even small scale watersheds since it can lead to large uncertainties in runoff estimation faurès et al 1995 cho et al 2009 several approaches are available for processing precipitation data to account for the spatial variation one of the simplest approaches is the thiessen polygon method where precipitation is assumed constant within each polygon thiessen 1911 the inverse distance weighting idw and spline tension spline techniques are an improvement over thiessen polygon method but neither account for factors such as elevation which influences areal distribution especially in mountainous watersheds goovaerts 2000 geostatistical approaches on the other hand take into account the effect of topographic variables such as elevation slope and orientation on precipitation goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 moral et al 2010 however the performance of the spatial interpolation methods strongly depends on the sampling density and variation in the precipitation data hence the application of geostatistical interpolation methods would not be appropriate for a watershed with a very low sampling density and flat topography li and heap 2011 weather forecasts and precipitation data from radars and satellites can also be used to improve precipitation estimates over complex terrains e g clark and slater 2006 crochet 2009 price et al 2014 a number of studies have discussed different ways to account for the uncertainty in the hydrological models e g swat output due to variability in the precipitation data interpolation schemes based on rain gauge data e g idw spline ordinary kriging satellite products e g tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann and doppler weather radar e g next generation radar nexrad have been widely applied to different hydrological models to increase their performances hernandez et al 2000 chaplot et al 2005 tobin and bennett 2009 cho et al 2009 strauch et al 2012 price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 elhassan et al 2016 although these ensembles can improve the models accuracy results especially in the case of spatially varied precipitation patterns the quality of these inputs varies with region season and elevation therefore the choice of the best precipitation product for any hydrological model should be based on the spatial and temporal scales of the selected location zhang and srinivasan 2009 price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 to date the effects of precipitation variation on hydrological models output was mainly evaluated on the simulations of streamflow rather than water quality e g nutrient loads many factors can affect the location of nutrient yields within a watershed such as soil type land use and population density chatterjee and bhattacharjee 2014 however precipitation is perhaps the most important factor triggering nutrient pollution huang et al 2015 this is because precipitation has high spatial and temporal variation compared to other factors in a watershed huang et al 2015 in fact the overestimation of nutrient loads in a subbasin within a watershed may only be a consequence of overprediction of precipitation few studies have accounted for the precipitation variability in the swat model to simulate water quality constituents chaplot et al 2005 cho et al 2009 shen et al 2012 to illustrate using ground based rain gauge data chaplot et al 2005 concluded that increasing the number of rain gauge data resulted in better simulation results cho et al 2009 found thiessen polygon method of assigning rainfall to subwatershed as a better alternative to using averaged rainfall over the whole watershed in addition shen et al 2012 indicated that interpolating rain gauge data to assign rainfall to subbasins a is preferable alternative these three studies emphasized the importance of accurate representation of spatial variability of precipitation in the watershed modeling particularly in the case of modeling nutrient loads although pervious research encourages the use of high resolution precipitation products in place of rain gauge data it has remained unclear how the accuracy of water quality simulations differs between various high spatial resolution precipitation products and ground rain gauge data at different spatial scales to be more specific no study has attempted to validate whether high resolution precipitation products could be used in place of rain gauge data when simulating water quality especially in dense gauged watersheds the overall hypothesis of this study is that if the spatio temporal distribution of gauge data and high resolution precipitation products varies then these products are likely to affect the hydrologic simulations particularly water quantity and quality validation of such hypothesis is important given the increase availability of the high resolution gridded satellite and reanalysis precipitation products to test this hypothesis we selected seven high resolution precipitation products and then evaluate their performance as a forcing data in a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of seven high resolution precipitation products with respect to the gauge data within seneca river basin srb 2 to compare the performance of high resolution precipitation products to simulate streamflow and water quality within the study area and 3 to evaluate the influence of the model parameters for each precipitation product on the streamflow and water quality simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area swat model the input data and provides a brief description of the precipitation products and the rain gauge stations the model calibration uncertainty analysis evaluation methods and statistical metrics are also presented in section 2 section 3 presents the evaluation results modeling results and discussion finally the conclusions drawn are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area seneca river basin srb lies within the south west atlantic region of the us fig 1 it has a drainage area of 2584 km2 of which more than 95 is located in the state of south carolina the srb encompasses seven watersheds lake keowee little river north twelve mile creek twelve mile creek coneross creek eighteen mile creek and three and twenty mile creek scdhec 2010 the srb is characterized by a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters the mean annual temperature is 17o c while the mean annual evapotranspiration is 635 mm year scdhec 2010 the annual rainfall amounts decrease from approximately 2100 mm in the northern part of the basin to 1200 mm in the southern part the srb runs from the northwest to the southwest with elevation ranging from 1400 m to 153 m above sea level fig 1 the land use is dominated by forested land approximately 59 mainly located in the northern and western side of the basin fig s1 the agricultural and urban lands comprise 23 and 9 of the basin area respectively while 7 of the basin is covered by water fig s1 the primary investigation was given to two watersheds within srb fig 1 twelve mile creek watershed tmcw and eighteen mile creek watershed emcw these two watersheds were selected because the only united states geological survey usgs gauge stations within the srb are located at the outlets of these two watersheds this allowed us to investigate the precipitation spatial variabilities over three watersheds emcw tmcw and the whole srb that vary in area 126 274 and 2584 km2 respectively and then assess the influence of the selected precipitation products on the modeling results at emcw and tmcw 2 2 swat model and input data soil water assessment tool swat is a physically based model developed by the usda agricultural research service arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat was initially developed to predict the impact of management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large watersheds arnold et al 1998 in swat model a uniform precipitation is assumed for each subbasin and is based on the rain gauge closest to the centroid of that subbasin neitsch et al 2011 the swat model is a continuous simulation watershed model runs on a daily time step arnold and fohrer 2005 swat divides watersheds into subbasins based on topographic features each subbasin is further delineated into hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous topography land use and soil the soil water content surface runoff sediment yield nutrient cycles and crop growth are simulated at the hru level and then aggregated for the subbasin by a weighted average the hydrological components of the swat model are based on the water balance equation applied to water movement through soil arnold and fohrer 2005 swat simulates nitrogen and phosphorus cycles using five and six different pools respectively neitsch et al 2011 the sum of mineral phosphorus minp and organic phosphorus orgp loads represent the total phosphorus tp load whereas the simulation loads of nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and organic nitrogen orgn represent the total nitrogen tn neitsch et al 2011 swat calculates orgn and orgp associated with the sediment as a function of the concentration in the top soil layer top 10 mm of soil the sediment yield on a given day and enrichment ratio neitsch et al 2011 the model considers the crop rotation and management practice combinations in the nutrients cycle simulation moreover swat accounts for natural sources as nutrient inputs such as organic matter mineralization and anthropogenic contributions e g fertilizer applications further details can be found in neitsch et al 2011 monthly streamflow data for the period from 2001 to 2014 were obtained from the two usgs gauge stations located at the outlets of tmcw and emcw fig 1 water quality data at the same locations were obtained from the water quality portal provides data from usgs and the environmental protection agency epa the available monthly information of tn and tp for each station was obtained and expressed as a concentration mg l tn and tp loads were calculated using their concentrations and streamflow based on weighted concentrations method proposed by moatar and meybeck 2005 the main swat model inputs consist of digital elevation model dem soil type map land use map weather climate data precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity and agricultural management practices a dem at a 3 meter resolution was obtained from united state geological survey usgs the land use information was obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd the soil data was downloaded from the ssurgo database while the meteorological precipitation and temperature data from 2001 to 2014 for each watershed were obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2 3 precipitation products this section briefly describes the precipitation products used in this study table 1 summarizes the spatial and temporal resolutions available periods and coverage of the selected products these products can be classified into three categories 1 observed precipitation data from rain gauges located within srb 2 five gridded satellite remote sensing products 3 and one reanalysis gridded product all available rain gauge data 12 rain gauges fig 1 located within the srb were interpolated and used an input for the swat model many interpolation methods were developed to spatially interpolate precipitation data e g li and heap 2011 zhang and srinivasan 2009 ly et al 2011 following the recommendations provided in previous works babak and deutsch 2009 ly et al 2011 idw was used to interpolate the rain gauge data idw is one of the simplest interpolation methods that does not depend on a specific statistical assumption babak and deutsch 2009 in addition idw is commonly used on studies focused on precipitation products evaluation e g zhang and srinivasan 2009 ly et al 2011 shen et al 2012 shope et al 2014 duan et al 2016 tuo et al 2016 idw is based on predicting values at unknown points by the weighted average of observed data at neighboring points shepard 1968 however as each interpolation method has drawbacks and their performance depends on various factors hofstra et al 2008 li and heap 2011 it is impossible to identify the optimal scheme applicable to all sites duan et al 2016 as a test we applied spline tension interpolation method to interpolate the rain gauge data we found that both idw and spline provided almost identical results r2 0 97 and hence only idw was used here to interpolate the rain gauge data this interpolated rain gauge data using idw will be referred to as rg rain gauge and accordingly results will be referred to as swat model using rg product for the gridded satellite products the near real time version 3b42rt and the post real time version 3b42 of the seventh edition of the trmm products were used in this study both products share the same temporal and spatial resolutions table 1 3b42rt is produced using trmm combined instrument tci dataset tci dataset consists the trmm precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi where both are used to calibrate precipitation estimates from the available low earth orbit leo microwave mw radiometers ochoa et al 2014 the 3b42rt then merges to provide a near global 3 h intervals filling the gaps in the analysis with the geosynchronous infrared ir measurements the geosynchronous infrared ir measurements are regionally calibrated using passive microwave pmw however no rain gauge data is used to correct the estimation in the 3b42rt product the 3b42 product is a gauge corrected utilizing precipitation information from 6000 to 7000 stations across the globe schneider et al 2014 the 3b42 adjusts the monthly accumulations of the 3 h fields from 3b42rt using a monthly gauge analysis including global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis and climate assessment and monitoring system cams monthly rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 although many studies evaluated the performance of 3b42 and 3b42rt with the ground rain gauge data or ground based radar estimates e g moazami et al 2013 maggioni et al 2014 yong et al 2015 chen et al 2018 only few studies focused on evaluating them as forcing products in the hydrological and water quality modelling tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 li et al 2018a b in addition persiann and persiann cdr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record were used persiann algorithm uses infrared ir satellite data provided by geostationary satellites to estimate the surface rainfall using an artificial neural network function persiann product is evolving since 2000 with a spatial resolution of 0 25o 0 25o table 1 as rain gauge data was not included persiann to correct bias estimation in the precipitations the persiann cdr product was included in this study persiann cdr is a new retrospective satellite based precipitation data developed for hydrological modeling studies ashouri et al 2015 persiann cdr was also included in this study as it provides long term availability more than 30 years and it is derived from multiple data sources in addition persiann cdr is validated and adjusted using other precipitation products ashouri et al 2015 specifically persiann cdr was developed from the persiann algorithm using gridded satellite infrared data gridsat b1 and adjusted using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly products huffman et al 2001 the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 1dd was developed by the world climate research program wcrp which is a complement to the gpcp version 2 sg combination sg product huffman et al 2001 the gpcp 1dd provides rainfall information at a spatial resolution of 1 starting from 1996 table 1 gpcp 1dd uses the threshold matched precipitation index tmpi to compute rainfall estimates from geostationary satellite ir sensors and pmw gpcp 1dd is then scaled to match the monthly accumulation provided by the sg product that combines satellite and gauge observations at a monthly time scale at a spatial resolution of 2 5 the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product contains hourly forecasts generated by the national weather service global forecast system decker et al 2012 national weather service global forecast system is used to interpolate product based with a spatial resolution of 0 38 km with a daily time step table 1 the cfsr includes variables such as maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed relative air humidity and solar radiation cfsr is included here as it is widely used in many studies especially in swat model e g yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 radcliffe and mukundan 2017 pervious research utilized cfsr product for hydrological modeling showed somehow satisfactory to poor performance compared with rain gauge data radcliffe and mukundan 2017 the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism is developed to address spatially sparse location climatology of global historical climatology ghcn daly 2006 daly et al 2008 rain gauge data and interpolation techniques are used to develop prism the daily precipitation and temperature evolving from 1981 were developed using a process called climatologically aided interpolation daly et al 2008 the prism product uses a model that fits local linear regression curves of climate against elevation dem with slopes that vary with elevation to account for factors such as coastal proximity topographic facet orientation vertical atmospheric layer topographic position and orographic effectiveness of the terrain daly 2006 daly et al 2008 prism product was used here as it has not been commonly used or tested in the swat model radcliffe and mukundan 2017 2 4 model calibration and uncertainty analysis sufi2 algorithm swat model was calibrated and evaluated against the observed streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads at two sampling locations within the srb the sufi2 optimization algorithm developed by abbaspour et al 2004 was used for the model calibration and validation the primary objective of the calibration process is to identify the most sensitive parameters that control the streamflow tn loads and tp loads the sensitivity analysis was performed using the global sensitivity tool in the sufi2 algorithm the statistical significance of a parameter using the global sensitivity tool is estimated based on t stat and p value each model consists of uncertainty in the predictions as a result of the uncertainty associated with the observed data and model parameters sufi2 optimization algorithm reduces the range of uncertainty by identifying a range of parameters that decrease the overall uncertainty in the selected output e g streamflow the model output is quantified by 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at 2 5 and 97 5 sufi 2 algorithm has been widely used and proved to be an efficient optimization algorithm for hydrological modeling e g bilondi et al 2013 mehan et al 2017 the model parameters during the calibration process are usually sensitive and can be influenced by the uncertainty in the model inputs e g precipitation generally the calibration process operates to correct the bias in the input data by parameters adjustment price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 because of this the parameter sensitivity analysis of swat model was conducted by performing an individual calibration process for each precipitation product swat model was calibrated individually for each precipitation product to investigate how model s parameters differs with different precipitation products swat model was calibrated at the usgs gauge usgs 02186000 located at the outlet of tmcw and at usgs gauge usgs 02186699 02186702 situated at the outlet of emcw the first four years 1997 2000 were used as a warm up period to eliminate initialization bias for emcw all models were calibrated using the available observed data from 2001 to 2006 and validated using the available data from 2007 to 2014 streamflow data is missing from august 2008 and october 2012 for tmcw all models were calibrated using all available observed data from 2001 to 2008 streamflow data is missing from september 2001 and october 2004 and validated from 2009 to 2014 2 5 evaluation methods and statistics fig 2 presents the methodology flowchart adapted in this study the precipitation products were evaluated against the available ground rain gauge data and then they were evaluated as forcing data using the swat model specifically the daily precipitation data was interpolated using idw and then was averaged over each watershed the flowchart process is shown in fig s4 the interpolation and the averaging were computed using idw and the zonal statistics tools in arcmap esri 2015 this interpolated rain gauge data was used as a baseline to evaluate all other precipitation products at the watershed scale the evaluation of the selected precipitation products was performed at two temporal scales daily and monthly for each temporal scale the evaluation was performed over three watersheds tmcw emcw and srb in addition as previous research showed that the occurrence frequency of precipitation with different intensities could have a significant impact on streamflow and flooding modelling tian et al 2007 the occurrence frequency of the daily precipitation was also computed to illustrate the occurrence frequency of the daily precipitation was calculated to evaluate the probability of different rainfall intensities between the gauge data and each precipitation product the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation was evaluated based on the rainfall intensity classification of the world meteorological organization wmo standard tan et al 2015 the second method used to evaluate the precipitation products involved using the selected precipitation products as forcing data in swat model to simulate streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads at the outlets of two watersheds tmcw and emcw the evaluation was performed using an individual calibration process for each precipitation product keeping other model inputs constant e g dem soil data land use daily temperature etc for the statistics evaluation all precipitation products the first seven products in table 1 were evaluated using four statistical metrics liu et al 2015 tan et al 2015 duan et al 2016 while three metrics were used to evaluate the products in the swat model as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the equations and optimal values of the four metrics are summarized in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of collinearity between the observed and gridded precipitation data the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns calculates how well a plot of observed data and precipitation products fits a 1 1 line mean absolute error mae measures the difference between the observed and gridded precipitation while percent bias pbias value indicates the average tendency of the gridded precipitation products to be larger or smaller than observations where negative value means underestimation and positively value means overestimation moriasi et al 2015 to assess the performance of each swat model for calibration and

based on the recommendation of moriasi et al 2015 for watershed models 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the precipitation products at the daily and monthly scales comparisons were performed using scatterplots of daily precipitation from all precipitation products and the interpolated rain gauge data over three watersheds tmcw emcw and srb the best and worst performing products over the three watersheds are shown in fig 3 while statistical evaluation of the precipitation products against the interpolated rain gauge data is shown in fig 4 a overall prism product performed the best while persiann product had the poorest performance with respect to r2 ns and pbias values except for prism and 3b42 all other products showed significant underestimation of the daily precipitation compared to the interpolated rain gauge data indicated by the pbias values fig 4a nevertheless these products tend to overestimate light rain 15 mm and underestimate the heavy rain 75 mm figs s3 s5 the statistical metrics for most precipitation products were slightly better in the emcw and srb than those in the tmcw but still failed to perform satisfactorily in terms of r2 ns and pbias compared with 3b42rt and persiann 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed better in terms of r2 ns and pbias this better performance may be due to the assimilation with the ground gauge data for 3b42 and persiann cdr products compared with 3b42rt persiann showed low accuracy as represented by r2 ns and pbias values this could imply that the retrieval algorithm used by persiann still needs to be improved in fact 3b42rt is primarily mw based when mw data are available while persiann is only ir based hirpa et al 2010 several studies showed that ir based rainfall algorithms have major limitations in reproducing rainfall fields in many regions around the world e g hirpa et al 2010 derin et al 2016 sahlu et al 2017 a correction of rainfall estimates from ir based algorithms with the rain gauge data at different elevations is suggested to improve their overall performance thorne et al 2001 prism product is the only product that outperformed others in terms of all the statistical criteria the reason why prism outperforms other products is that prism is a gauge based product developed based on specifics of dem and interpolation methods daly 2006 daly et al 2008 moreover the good performance of prism might also be due to the high spatial resolution of the product 4 4 km2 the spatial resolution of precipitation products assists in capturing the local microclimate effectively local microclimate effectively ward et al 2011 fuka et al 2014 the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation with seven different intensity ranges for the interpolated rain gauge and the precipitation products over tmcw are shown in fig 5 the frequency of occurrence is defined here as the number of events of any precipitation intensity class e g 0 1 mm divided by the number of samples expressed in percentage the frequency of occurrence for 0 1 mm d is plotted separately in the left panel of fig 5 this frequency of occurrence 0 1 mm exhibits the no rain shallow precipitation events for each precipitation product for tmcw 65 of the interpolated rain gauge data fell within the 0 1 mm d range overall all products except persiann cdr slightly overestimated the occurrence frequency within 0 1 mm d range although persiann cdr slightly underestimated the dry days 0 1 mm d the occurrence frequency was closest to the interpolated rain gage data similar underestimation in the dry days from persiann cdr was reported in malaysia and italy tan et al 2015 duan et al 2016 alijanian et al 2017 all products expect prism 3b42 and persiann cdr consistently underestimated the daily precipitation beyond 1 mm d thereby resulting in large negative values for the pbias fig 4a table s1 3b42 products showed underestimation within 1 20 mm d range but then displayed slight overestimation beyond 20 mm d while persiann cdr product showed significant overestimated within 5 20 mm d and underestimation beyond 20 mm d prism product exhibited underestimation within 1 50 mm d range but showed slight overestimation beyond 50 mm d almost similar trends were found over emcw and srb fig s6 and table s1 the differences in the occurrence frequencies of precipitation between the seven products would have significant implications for hydrological and water quality modeling due to the nonlinearity in the related processes duan et al 2016 for the monthly time scale the daily precipitation data was aggregated to monthly total precipitation for each precipitation product and then similar evaluation was conducted over tmcw emcw and srb fig 6 shows monthly total precipitation for two gridded products the best and worst performing products against the interpolated rain gauge data over the three watersheds while the statistical metrics evaluation is shown in fig 4b increasing the temporal scale daily to monthly resulted in better agreements between the interpolated rain gauge data and other precipitation products conti et al 2014 showed that the overall performance of satellite products increases from one to five days and to then remain stable at higher temporal aggregation it should be noted that all the products underestimated the monthly total precipitation based on pbias values the only exception was for 3b42 product at emcw where 3b42rt slightly overestimated the interpolated rain gauge data based on the r2 ns and mae values the prism has the best performance followed by 3b42 persiann cdr gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed poor performance in all metrics in general five products prism 3b42 persiann cdr gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt can be considered as the top five performers for the monthly total precipitation estimation based on the statistical metrics based on this preliminary analysis we expect that cfsr and persiann products may not be a good choice for streamflow and water quality simulations fig 7 presents the mean monthly precipitation right y axis from interpolated rain gauge data and all the seven precipitation products over tmcw during the whole period 2001 2014 fig 7 also shows the mean absolute error mae for the evaluated products the mae for any month is the average absolute error over the whole period the gauge corrected products 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd and prism product are plotted separately in the left panel of fig 7 the mean monthly precipitation over the tmcw is characterized by three peaks occurring in march july and december the months of february and october receives low precipitation with the lowest precipitation occurring in october this seasonal pattern is captured by most products except cfsr and persiann where the peak in july was underestimated considering the mae the prism product performed the best in reproducing the monthly precipitation followed by 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd gauge corrected products these four products prism 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd have lower errors over the 12 months with the average value of mae of 9 23 29 and 32 respectively fig 7 the cfsr and persiann products had the largest errors with the average mae of 43 and 53 respectively fig 7 similar findings are valid for emcw and srb fig s10 the relatively good performance of the gauge corrected products in capturing seasonal pattern compared to those with no bias adjustment 3b42rt and persiann may rise the importance of the bias correction in precipitation products and hence increase the results accuracy in the streamflow and water quality simulations 3 2 evaluation of precipitation products for streamflow and water quality the performance of each of the precipitation product was evaluated using swat model utilizing two calibration procedures first all precipitation products were evaluated by performing an individual calibration process specifically the calibration and validation of each model was performed using sufi2 algorithm at the outlet of tmcw and emcw overall 21 hydrologic parameters were evaluated for streamflow 14 parameters for tn and 15 parameters for tp the sufi2 algorithm was applied to determine the most sensitive parameters and determine the uncertainty range of the evaluated parameters as a result 9 parameters for discharge 4 parameters for tn and 4 parameters related to tp were found to be sensitive based on the t stat and p value table 3 in addition to the individual calibration process all precipitation products were calibrated using fixed set of parameters based on the model that uses ground rain data used as a baseline to evaluate all other precipitation products 3 2 1 performance of streamflow and water quality simulations the statistical evaluation of the simulated discharge tn and tp at the outlets of the tmcw and emcw for the all precipitation products is presented in table 4 for discharge simulations all swat models except those utilizing 3b42rt cfsr persiann products showed at least satisfactory performance rating based on the classification of moriasiet al 2015 during the calibration and validation periods at both outlets table 4 for tmcw the models using rg prism and 3b42 data achieved very good performance in the calibration and validation periods while models utilizing persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd data attained good performance in the calibration period only the 3b42rt products failed to achieve satisfactory performance for the validation period in terms of r2 values while cfsr and persiann products showed unsatisfactory performance based on r2 ns and pbias values only the model uses interpolated rg data reached values of r2 and ns of more than 0 89 for both calibration and validation periods considering emcw during the calibration period the use of rg and prism products led to very good performance models utilizing 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products attained the level of good performance while models using 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed satisfactory performance in terms of r2 and ns for the validation period the values of r2 and ns increased for all models with the exception of the model using gpcp 1dd and persiann products using rg prism and 3b42 products led to very good performance while persiann cdr 3b42rt gpcp 1dd and cfsr attained good ratings as the case in tmcw persiann failed to achieve a satisfactory model performance for the validation period for tn simulations at the outlet of tmcw models utilizing rg prism 3b42 and persiann cdr products attained very good performance for both calibration and validation periods based on r2 ns and pbias gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt products showed good model performance in both calibration and validation periods while the model using cfsr product achieved satisfactory performance in the calibration period and unsatisfactory performance in the validation period in terms of ns value the persiann model failed to achieve satisfactory performance in both calibration and validation periods for emcw the model using rg data achieved very good performance in the calibration period while during the validation period very good performance was achieved in terms of r2 value and satisfactory performance was attained in terms of ns value using prism an 3b42 products led to good performance for calibration and validation periods utilizing persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products led to satisfactory performance for both calibration validation periods while using 3b42rt and cfsr product showed at least satisfactory performance only in the calibration period based on r2 and ns values although the model using persiann performed better than its performance at tmcw it failed to attain at least satisfactory performance in term of ns values in the case of tp simulations rg and prism performed better than the other products for tmcw models using rg prism 3b42 and persiann cdr products led to a good model performance in the calibration period and satisfactory performance during validation period while the model using 3b42rt products showed satisfactory performance during both calibration and validation periods gpcp 1dd cfsr and persiann models failed to show satisfactory performance during the calibration and validation periods for emcw models using rg and prism 3b42 persiann cdr showed satisfactory performance for both calibration and the validation periods models utilizing gpcp 1dd 3b42rt and cfsr products failed to attain satisfactory performance at least at one period generally the average performance of the satellite and reanalysis products increased with decreasing the watershed size emcw compared to tmcw prism product performed the best followed by 3b42 and persiann cdr these three products are either gauge based prsim or gauge corrected satellite 3b42 and persiann cdr products with high spatial resolutions all the three products could be feasible choices for simulating streamflow and water quality as they showed reasonably good performance they achieved at least satisfactory model performance at tmcw and emcw although cfsr product showed satisfactory model performance in emcw it showed unacceptable performance in the tmcw the smaller percent bias of cfsr over emcw 20 compared to that over the tmcw 27 probably explains the results of the streamflow predictions fig 4 additionally the general poor performance of persiann product can be attributed to the large bias values in precipitation estimations 38 for tmcw and 31 for emcw fig 4 these findings are consistent with other studies that found poor streamflow simulations utilizing cfsr and persiann e g zhu et al 2016 and alijanian et al 2017 the tn and tp loads are generally consistent with the streamflow pattern and are significantly influenced by the characteristics of the precipitation the differences in the performance obtained by the selected precipitation products could be related to the distribution of the daily mean precipitation over the two watersheds as well as the spatial resolution of each precipitation product products with high spatial resolution performed better compared to those with low spatial resolution the monthly time series plots of simulated and observed streamflow tn and tp at the outlets of tmcw and emcw are shown in figs 8 10 the results shown in these figures are based on the best fit simulations obtained from sufi2 algorithm for both calibration and validation periods simulated streamflow results from cfsr and persiann products had the poorest performance both significantly underestimated the observed streamflow especially at tmcw cfsr product overpredicted the streamflow in the validation period in tmcw this underestimation or overestimation was reflected with more strength in tn and tp simulations although most of the products performed well in capturing base flow especially in the calibration periods persiann 1dd gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt underpredicted the peak flows during calibration and validation periods models based on rg and prism products performed well for observed streamflow tn and tp both captured the peaks low flows and tn and tp loads at the outlets of tmcw and emcw although most models underpredicted the peak flows they performed well in capturing the peaks in both tn and tp simulations figs 9 and 10 this may be evident that the calibration process improved the simulation results by adjusting and optimizing the model parameters especially for tn and tp simulations in fact previous studies raised a concern that parameter adjustments may lead to differences in water budget partitioning especially when there is no physical meaning for such a change e g price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 our results for streamflow tn and tp corroborate these findings indicating that model parameters played an important role in correcting the bias in the modeling results caused by the use of different precipitation products most of the models were able to predicate the streamflow tn and tp by adjusting the sensitive hydrological and water quality parameters to different values and intervals within the calibrated process for example at tmcw the model calibrated for tn loads using cfsr data had higher optimal lat orgn ranges compare to other models fig s13 this suggests that having the same watershed characteristics e g land use soil information topography the model utilizing cfsr data tends to produce higher concentration of organic nitrogen compare to other models this parameter uncertainty would propagate leads to uncertainties in predicting and understanding the interaction between hydrologic and landscape patterns which further impacts the policy decision making processes e g regional environmental flows management 3 2 2 evaluation of precipitation products using fixed model parameters in the previous section we showed the performance of the selected precipitation products when an individual calibration process for each precipitation product was performed although the two watersheds tmcw and emcw have similar characteristics in term of land use soil type and slopes each precipitation product led to different parameterizations figs s11 s14 additionally although most of the models achieved satisfactory performance in streamflow tn and tp simulations at watersheds outlet the prediction would vary significantly at various points within the srb because of the change in the model parameters as a test a fixed set of parameters based on the rg product for tmcw and emcw was applied to all other precipitation products the rg was used for parameter selection as it performed the best in both streamflow and water quality simulations the aim was to focus on the effect of the precipitation input on streamflow and water quality simulations the fixed hydrological and water quality parameters are shown in table s2 the performance of all precipitation products for the calibration period based on the fixed set of parameters fp and the individual calibration parameters ip the best performing set of parameters of each product are shown in fig 11 comparisons between the products were performed using only ns metric this is because most models performed well in terms of r2 indicating that they described well the observed streamflow tn and tp variation in general the fp simulations performed poorly compared to ip simulation the precipitation products prism 3b42 perssiann cdr and gpcp 1dd were less sensitive in the tmcw the most sensitive models for fp are 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products and may be related to the fact that these models underestimated the mean daily precipitation pbias values in fig 4 therefore the ip accommodate the bias in precipitation to match observed data the uncertainty in parameters has affected mostly the water quality simulations where most products showed poor performance at least one outlet for tn and tp simulations additionally tmcw simulations were less sensitive for fp compared to emcw and may be related landscape heterogeneity higher landscape heterogeneity in the case of emcw furthermore the results achieved using the prism 3b42 perssiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products showed less variability in terms of ns values compared to the other precipitation products overall ns values varied between 5 to 50 for the fp compare to ip to further evaluate the precipitation products for the streamflow tn and tp simulations statistical boxplots at the outlets of tmcw and emcw were developed for ip set and are shown in fig 12 for all models model using persiann showed the lowest median for simulated streamflow while models based on rg and prism products had the closest median to the observed streamflow data followed by models utilizing 3b42 and persiann cdr products the average monthly simulated discharge using 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed an underestimation compared to the observed data the differences in the streamflow simulations were propagated to water quality simulations with larger uncertainty more peaks in tn and tp loads were observed more in emcw compare to tmcw this may be attribute to the extensive human and agricultural activities in the emcw fig 1s 4 conclusion in this study we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven precipitation products against a dense rain gauge network this study investigated the potential influence of precipitation products on streamflow and water quality simulations using swat model at two srb watersheds the selected precipitation products include prsim 3b42 3b42rt persiann cdr persiann gpcp 1dd and cfsr it was observed that the prsim aggregated pbias 2 5 3b42 aggregated pbias 5 5 and persiann cdr aggregated pbias 8 5 performed better compare to other products on the other hand cfsr and persiann products performed poorly based on the higher pbias values 24 and 34 the gauge corrected satellite products 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd performed better in capturing seasonal pattern compared to those with no bias adjustment products 3b42rt and persiann although 3b42rt and persiann are both non corrected gauge products the 3b42rt performed better than persiann which is primarily due to the retrieval algorithm used by 3b42rt the swat model was used to compare the performance of precipitation products to simulate the streamflow and water quality tn and tp loads the sufi2 optimization algorithm was used to calibrate swat model for each precipitation products based on the observed streamflow and water quality variables it was observed that the prism product performed similar to the interpolated rain gauge data this was expected as prism is a gauge based product with a high spatial resolution the swat models based on the 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed better in simulating streamflow and capturing the base and peaks flow in comparison to other satellite and reanalysis products in addition both products achieved at least satisfactory performance for tn and tp simulations although 3b42 slightly outperforms persiann cdr it may not be useful for climate change studies due to its short data period persiann cdr has a longer period 1983 present and it performed reasonably well in comparison to the observed precipitation as well as for streamflow and water quality simulations at both watersheds other products failed to exhibit satisfactory results for streamflow tn and or tp simulations the poor performance was achieved by persiann followed by cfsr 3b42rt and gpcp 1dd both 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed significantly better than gpcp 1dd this may be due to relatively larger grid size of gpcp 1dd product table 1 the uncertainty associated with tp simulation was higher compared to streamflow and tn simulations the lower performance in tp simulations may be due to the limitation for the swat models to capture high concentrations during storm events that can contribute to the errors in sediment flux estimates me et al 2015 malagó et al 2017 it was observed that the model parameters varies with the precipitation products and therefore precipitation products and model parameters should be evaluated carefully while simulating streamflow and water quality variables using any hydrologic models this is especially important when interpreting the simulation results driven by different precipitation products if the precipitation products differ then the quantification of hydrologic fluxes e g streamflow and water quality variables e g sediment and nutrients likely to be different due to the propagation of the uncertainty from precipitation products to model parameters this study shows that precipitation as a model input has a direct and significant effect on the model performance and parameter uncertainties in streamflow and more importantly in water quality simulations one of the key limitation in our analysis is inconsistency in spatial resolution coverage of precipitation products in small watersheds for example the precipitation likely to be uniformly distributed over tmcw due to the limited number of grids less than three available at 0 25 spatial resolution another key limitation is lack of adequate water quality data at daily time scale to evaluate the performance of precipitation products future research is needed to understand how water quality variables and parameter sensitivity are changing under different hydrological conditions e g storm events and drought based on different precipitation products although our findings can be applicable to small and forest dominated watersheds more number of studies are required in different

8399,study region seneca river basin south carolina usa study focus this study focuses on evaluating different precipitation products on streamflow and water quality modeling we used 13 years 2001 2014 of daily data from multiple precipitation products the precipitation products are classified into three categories 1 products based on observed precipitation data rain gauges located within the study area and prism data 2 five satellite based precipitation products 3b42 3b42rt persiann cdr persiann and gpcp 1dd and 3 one reanalysis product cfsr the soil and water assessment tool swat was calibrated and validated using these precipitation products against monthly observed streamflow total nitrogen tn loads and total phosphorus tp loads within the seneca river basin situated in northwest of south carolina usa for each precipitation product the best performing model parameters was determined using the sequential uncertainty fitting procedure sufp2 new hydrological insights for the region results showed that the spatio temporal pattern of precipitation products varies and further influenced the streamflow and water quality simulations most of the precipitation products achieved at least satisfactory performance r2 0 50 ns 0 50 and pbias 15 for streamflow and water quality prism product showed the best overall performance followed by 3b42 and persiann cdr whereas cfsr and persiann products comparatively performed poorly for streamflow and water quality simulations the uncertainty in the precipitation products was reflected in the streamflow that further affected the water quality simulations tn and tp loads in addition this study showed that the parameter uncertainty significantly varies among precipitation products leading to a considerable uncertainty in simulation results especially for tn and tp our results suggest that using multiple precipitation products can increase the level of confidence in hydrologic model simulation particularly in water quality modeling keywords precipitation swat uncertainty streamflow water quality 1 introduction watershed models have been widely used to predict hydrological processes and the transport of non point source nps pollution engel et al 1993 easton et al 2008 the ability of these models to predict runoff and the transport of nps at a watershed level depends largely on how well the model inputs are spatially distributed chaplot et al 2005 guzman et al 2015 typically precipitation is an important driving force of hydrological processes and nps pollution cho et al 2009 masih et al 2010 price et al 2014 hence an accurate representation of temporal and spatial variability of precipitation patterns is crucial for investigating streamflow patterns as well as transport of nps pollution and identifying the critical source areas within a watershed numerous studies show that neglecting spatial distribution of precipitation can have a significant effect on the model outputs e g dawdy and bergmann 1969 troutman 1983 duncan et al 1993 faurès et al 1995 lopes 1996 andréassian et al 2001 bárdossy and das 2008 in general rain gauge networks do not fully represent the spatial patterns of rainfall in small watersheds a uniform distribution of rainfall is usually assumed in modeling hydrological behavior due to lack of gauge data faurès et al 1995 goodrich et al 1995 cho et al 2009 this assumption of spatially uniform rainfall may not be valid for larger watersheds or even small scale watersheds since it can lead to large uncertainties in runoff estimation faurès et al 1995 cho et al 2009 several approaches are available for processing precipitation data to account for the spatial variation one of the simplest approaches is the thiessen polygon method where precipitation is assumed constant within each polygon thiessen 1911 the inverse distance weighting idw and spline tension spline techniques are an improvement over thiessen polygon method but neither account for factors such as elevation which influences areal distribution especially in mountainous watersheds goovaerts 2000 geostatistical approaches on the other hand take into account the effect of topographic variables such as elevation slope and orientation on precipitation goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 moral et al 2010 however the performance of the spatial interpolation methods strongly depends on the sampling density and variation in the precipitation data hence the application of geostatistical interpolation methods would not be appropriate for a watershed with a very low sampling density and flat topography li and heap 2011 weather forecasts and precipitation data from radars and satellites can also be used to improve precipitation estimates over complex terrains e g clark and slater 2006 crochet 2009 price et al 2014 a number of studies have discussed different ways to account for the uncertainty in the hydrological models e g swat output due to variability in the precipitation data interpolation schemes based on rain gauge data e g idw spline ordinary kriging satellite products e g tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann and doppler weather radar e g next generation radar nexrad have been widely applied to different hydrological models to increase their performances hernandez et al 2000 chaplot et al 2005 tobin and bennett 2009 cho et al 2009 strauch et al 2012 price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 elhassan et al 2016 although these ensembles can improve the models accuracy results especially in the case of spatially varied precipitation patterns the quality of these inputs varies with region season and elevation therefore the choice of the best precipitation product for any hydrological model should be based on the spatial and temporal scales of the selected location zhang and srinivasan 2009 price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 to date the effects of precipitation variation on hydrological models output was mainly evaluated on the simulations of streamflow rather than water quality e g nutrient loads many factors can affect the location of nutrient yields within a watershed such as soil type land use and population density chatterjee and bhattacharjee 2014 however precipitation is perhaps the most important factor triggering nutrient pollution huang et al 2015 this is because precipitation has high spatial and temporal variation compared to other factors in a watershed huang et al 2015 in fact the overestimation of nutrient loads in a subbasin within a watershed may only be a consequence of overprediction of precipitation few studies have accounted for the precipitation variability in the swat model to simulate water quality constituents chaplot et al 2005 cho et al 2009 shen et al 2012 to illustrate using ground based rain gauge data chaplot et al 2005 concluded that increasing the number of rain gauge data resulted in better simulation results cho et al 2009 found thiessen polygon method of assigning rainfall to subwatershed as a better alternative to using averaged rainfall over the whole watershed in addition shen et al 2012 indicated that interpolating rain gauge data to assign rainfall to subbasins a is preferable alternative these three studies emphasized the importance of accurate representation of spatial variability of precipitation in the watershed modeling particularly in the case of modeling nutrient loads although pervious research encourages the use of high resolution precipitation products in place of rain gauge data it has remained unclear how the accuracy of water quality simulations differs between various high spatial resolution precipitation products and ground rain gauge data at different spatial scales to be more specific no study has attempted to validate whether high resolution precipitation products could be used in place of rain gauge data when simulating water quality especially in dense gauged watersheds the overall hypothesis of this study is that if the spatio temporal distribution of gauge data and high resolution precipitation products varies then these products are likely to affect the hydrologic simulations particularly water quantity and quality validation of such hypothesis is important given the increase availability of the high resolution gridded satellite and reanalysis precipitation products to test this hypothesis we selected seven high resolution precipitation products and then evaluate their performance as a forcing data in a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of seven high resolution precipitation products with respect to the gauge data within seneca river basin srb 2 to compare the performance of high resolution precipitation products to simulate streamflow and water quality within the study area and 3 to evaluate the influence of the model parameters for each precipitation product on the streamflow and water quality simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area swat model the input data and provides a brief description of the precipitation products and the rain gauge stations the model calibration uncertainty analysis evaluation methods and statistical metrics are also presented in section 2 section 3 presents the evaluation results modeling results and discussion finally the conclusions drawn are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area seneca river basin srb lies within the south west atlantic region of the us fig 1 it has a drainage area of 2584 km2 of which more than 95 is located in the state of south carolina the srb encompasses seven watersheds lake keowee little river north twelve mile creek twelve mile creek coneross creek eighteen mile creek and three and twenty mile creek scdhec 2010 the srb is characterized by a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters the mean annual temperature is 17o c while the mean annual evapotranspiration is 635 mm year scdhec 2010 the annual rainfall amounts decrease from approximately 2100 mm in the northern part of the basin to 1200 mm in the southern part the srb runs from the northwest to the southwest with elevation ranging from 1400 m to 153 m above sea level fig 1 the land use is dominated by forested land approximately 59 mainly located in the northern and western side of the basin fig s1 the agricultural and urban lands comprise 23 and 9 of the basin area respectively while 7 of the basin is covered by water fig s1 the primary investigation was given to two watersheds within srb fig 1 twelve mile creek watershed tmcw and eighteen mile creek watershed emcw these two watersheds were selected because the only united states geological survey usgs gauge stations within the srb are located at the outlets of these two watersheds this allowed us to investigate the precipitation spatial variabilities over three watersheds emcw tmcw and the whole srb that vary in area 126 274 and 2584 km2 respectively and then assess the influence of the selected precipitation products on the modeling results at emcw and tmcw 2 2 swat model and input data soil water assessment tool swat is a physically based model developed by the usda agricultural research service arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat was initially developed to predict the impact of management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large watersheds arnold et al 1998 in swat model a uniform precipitation is assumed for each subbasin and is based on the rain gauge closest to the centroid of that subbasin neitsch et al 2011 the swat model is a continuous simulation watershed model runs on a daily time step arnold and fohrer 2005 swat divides watersheds into subbasins based on topographic features each subbasin is further delineated into hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous topography land use and soil the soil water content surface runoff sediment yield nutrient cycles and crop growth are simulated at the hru level and then aggregated for the subbasin by a weighted average the hydrological components of the swat model are based on the water balance equation applied to water movement through soil arnold and fohrer 2005 swat simulates nitrogen and phosphorus cycles using five and six different pools respectively neitsch et al 2011 the sum of mineral phosphorus minp and organic phosphorus orgp loads represent the total phosphorus tp load whereas the simulation loads of nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and organic nitrogen orgn represent the total nitrogen tn neitsch et al 2011 swat calculates orgn and orgp associated with the sediment as a function of the concentration in the top soil layer top 10 mm of soil the sediment yield on a given day and enrichment ratio neitsch et al 2011 the model considers the crop rotation and management practice combinations in the nutrients cycle simulation moreover swat accounts for natural sources as nutrient inputs such as organic matter mineralization and anthropogenic contributions e g fertilizer applications further details can be found in neitsch et al 2011 monthly streamflow data for the period from 2001 to 2014 were obtained from the two usgs gauge stations located at the outlets of tmcw and emcw fig 1 water quality data at the same locations were obtained from the water quality portal provides data from usgs and the environmental protection agency epa the available monthly information of tn and tp for each station was obtained and expressed as a concentration mg l tn and tp loads were calculated using their concentrations and streamflow based on weighted concentrations method proposed by moatar and meybeck 2005 the main swat model inputs consist of digital elevation model dem soil type map land use map weather climate data precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity and agricultural management practices a dem at a 3 meter resolution was obtained from united state geological survey usgs the land use information was obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd the soil data was downloaded from the ssurgo database while the meteorological precipitation and temperature data from 2001 to 2014 for each watershed were obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2 3 precipitation products this section briefly describes the precipitation products used in this study table 1 summarizes the spatial and temporal resolutions available periods and coverage of the selected products these products can be classified into three categories 1 observed precipitation data from rain gauges located within srb 2 five gridded satellite remote sensing products 3 and one reanalysis gridded product all available rain gauge data 12 rain gauges fig 1 located within the srb were interpolated and used an input for the swat model many interpolation methods were developed to spatially interpolate precipitation data e g li and heap 2011 zhang and srinivasan 2009 ly et al 2011 following the recommendations provided in previous works babak and deutsch 2009 ly et al 2011 idw was used to interpolate the rain gauge data idw is one of the simplest interpolation methods that does not depend on a specific statistical assumption babak and deutsch 2009 in addition idw is commonly used on studies focused on precipitation products evaluation e g zhang and srinivasan 2009 ly et al 2011 shen et al 2012 shope et al 2014 duan et al 2016 tuo et al 2016 idw is based on predicting values at unknown points by the weighted average of observed data at neighboring points shepard 1968 however as each interpolation method has drawbacks and their performance depends on various factors hofstra et al 2008 li and heap 2011 it is impossible to identify the optimal scheme applicable to all sites duan et al 2016 as a test we applied spline tension interpolation method to interpolate the rain gauge data we found that both idw and spline provided almost identical results r2 0 97 and hence only idw was used here to interpolate the rain gauge data this interpolated rain gauge data using idw will be referred to as rg rain gauge and accordingly results will be referred to as swat model using rg product for the gridded satellite products the near real time version 3b42rt and the post real time version 3b42 of the seventh edition of the trmm products were used in this study both products share the same temporal and spatial resolutions table 1 3b42rt is produced using trmm combined instrument tci dataset tci dataset consists the trmm precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi where both are used to calibrate precipitation estimates from the available low earth orbit leo microwave mw radiometers ochoa et al 2014 the 3b42rt then merges to provide a near global 3 h intervals filling the gaps in the analysis with the geosynchronous infrared ir measurements the geosynchronous infrared ir measurements are regionally calibrated using passive microwave pmw however no rain gauge data is used to correct the estimation in the 3b42rt product the 3b42 product is a gauge corrected utilizing precipitation information from 6000 to 7000 stations across the globe schneider et al 2014 the 3b42 adjusts the monthly accumulations of the 3 h fields from 3b42rt using a monthly gauge analysis including global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis and climate assessment and monitoring system cams monthly rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2007 although many studies evaluated the performance of 3b42 and 3b42rt with the ground rain gauge data or ground based radar estimates e g moazami et al 2013 maggioni et al 2014 yong et al 2015 chen et al 2018 only few studies focused on evaluating them as forcing products in the hydrological and water quality modelling tong et al 2014 zulkafli et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 li et al 2018a b in addition persiann and persiann cdr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record were used persiann algorithm uses infrared ir satellite data provided by geostationary satellites to estimate the surface rainfall using an artificial neural network function persiann product is evolving since 2000 with a spatial resolution of 0 25o 0 25o table 1 as rain gauge data was not included persiann to correct bias estimation in the precipitations the persiann cdr product was included in this study persiann cdr is a new retrospective satellite based precipitation data developed for hydrological modeling studies ashouri et al 2015 persiann cdr was also included in this study as it provides long term availability more than 30 years and it is derived from multiple data sources in addition persiann cdr is validated and adjusted using other precipitation products ashouri et al 2015 specifically persiann cdr was developed from the persiann algorithm using gridded satellite infrared data gridsat b1 and adjusted using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly products huffman et al 2001 the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 1dd was developed by the world climate research program wcrp which is a complement to the gpcp version 2 sg combination sg product huffman et al 2001 the gpcp 1dd provides rainfall information at a spatial resolution of 1 starting from 1996 table 1 gpcp 1dd uses the threshold matched precipitation index tmpi to compute rainfall estimates from geostationary satellite ir sensors and pmw gpcp 1dd is then scaled to match the monthly accumulation provided by the sg product that combines satellite and gauge observations at a monthly time scale at a spatial resolution of 2 5 the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product contains hourly forecasts generated by the national weather service global forecast system decker et al 2012 national weather service global forecast system is used to interpolate product based with a spatial resolution of 0 38 km with a daily time step table 1 the cfsr includes variables such as maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed relative air humidity and solar radiation cfsr is included here as it is widely used in many studies especially in swat model e g yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 radcliffe and mukundan 2017 pervious research utilized cfsr product for hydrological modeling showed somehow satisfactory to poor performance compared with rain gauge data radcliffe and mukundan 2017 the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism is developed to address spatially sparse location climatology of global historical climatology ghcn daly 2006 daly et al 2008 rain gauge data and interpolation techniques are used to develop prism the daily precipitation and temperature evolving from 1981 were developed using a process called climatologically aided interpolation daly et al 2008 the prism product uses a model that fits local linear regression curves of climate against elevation dem with slopes that vary with elevation to account for factors such as coastal proximity topographic facet orientation vertical atmospheric layer topographic position and orographic effectiveness of the terrain daly 2006 daly et al 2008 prism product was used here as it has not been commonly used or tested in the swat model radcliffe and mukundan 2017 2 4 model calibration and uncertainty analysis sufi2 algorithm swat model was calibrated and evaluated against the observed streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads at two sampling locations within the srb the sufi2 optimization algorithm developed by abbaspour et al 2004 was used for the model calibration and validation the primary objective of the calibration process is to identify the most sensitive parameters that control the streamflow tn loads and tp loads the sensitivity analysis was performed using the global sensitivity tool in the sufi2 algorithm the statistical significance of a parameter using the global sensitivity tool is estimated based on t stat and p value each model consists of uncertainty in the predictions as a result of the uncertainty associated with the observed data and model parameters sufi2 optimization algorithm reduces the range of uncertainty by identifying a range of parameters that decrease the overall uncertainty in the selected output e g streamflow the model output is quantified by 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at 2 5 and 97 5 sufi 2 algorithm has been widely used and proved to be an efficient optimization algorithm for hydrological modeling e g bilondi et al 2013 mehan et al 2017 the model parameters during the calibration process are usually sensitive and can be influenced by the uncertainty in the model inputs e g precipitation generally the calibration process operates to correct the bias in the input data by parameters adjustment price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 because of this the parameter sensitivity analysis of swat model was conducted by performing an individual calibration process for each precipitation product swat model was calibrated individually for each precipitation product to investigate how model s parameters differs with different precipitation products swat model was calibrated at the usgs gauge usgs 02186000 located at the outlet of tmcw and at usgs gauge usgs 02186699 02186702 situated at the outlet of emcw the first four years 1997 2000 were used as a warm up period to eliminate initialization bias for emcw all models were calibrated using the available observed data from 2001 to 2006 and validated using the available data from 2007 to 2014 streamflow data is missing from august 2008 and october 2012 for tmcw all models were calibrated using all available observed data from 2001 to 2008 streamflow data is missing from september 2001 and october 2004 and validated from 2009 to 2014 2 5 evaluation methods and statistics fig 2 presents the methodology flowchart adapted in this study the precipitation products were evaluated against the available ground rain gauge data and then they were evaluated as forcing data using the swat model specifically the daily precipitation data was interpolated using idw and then was averaged over each watershed the flowchart process is shown in fig s4 the interpolation and the averaging were computed using idw and the zonal statistics tools in arcmap esri 2015 this interpolated rain gauge data was used as a baseline to evaluate all other precipitation products at the watershed scale the evaluation of the selected precipitation products was performed at two temporal scales daily and monthly for each temporal scale the evaluation was performed over three watersheds tmcw emcw and srb in addition as previous research showed that the occurrence frequency of precipitation with different intensities could have a significant impact on streamflow and flooding modelling tian et al 2007 the occurrence frequency of the daily precipitation was also computed to illustrate the occurrence frequency of the daily precipitation was calculated to evaluate the probability of different rainfall intensities between the gauge data and each precipitation product the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation was evaluated based on the rainfall intensity classification of the world meteorological organization wmo standard tan et al 2015 the second method used to evaluate the precipitation products involved using the selected precipitation products as forcing data in swat model to simulate streamflow and water quality variables tn and tp loads at the outlets of two watersheds tmcw and emcw the evaluation was performed using an individual calibration process for each precipitation product keeping other model inputs constant e g dem soil data land use daily temperature etc for the statistics evaluation all precipitation products the first seven products in table 1 were evaluated using four statistical metrics liu et al 2015 tan et al 2015 duan et al 2016 while three metrics were used to evaluate the products in the swat model as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the equations and optimal values of the four metrics are summarized in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of collinearity between the observed and gridded precipitation data the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns calculates how well a plot of observed data and precipitation products fits a 1 1 line mean absolute error mae measures the difference between the observed and gridded precipitation while percent bias pbias value indicates the average tendency of the gridded precipitation products to be larger or smaller than observations where negative value means underestimation and positively value means overestimation moriasi et al 2015 to assess the performance of each swat model for calibration and validation periods r2 ns pbias were used for streamflow simulations the performance of a model is deemed as a very good ns 0 80 r2 0 85 and pbias 5 good 0 70 ns 0 80 0 75 r2 0 85 5 pbias 10 satisfactory 0 50 ns 0 70 0 60 r2 0 75 10 and 10 pbias 15 and unsatisfactory ns 0 50 r2 0 60 pbias 15 for tn and tp simulations the performance of a model is deemed as a very good ns 0 65 r2 0 70 pbias 15 good 0 50 ns 0 65 0 60 r2 0 70 and 15 pbias 20 satisfactory 0 35 ns 0 50 0 30 r2 0 60 and 20 pbias 30 and unsatisfactory ns 0 35 r2 0 30 and pbias 30 the performance evaluation criteria were based on the recommendation of moriasi et al 2015 for watershed models 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the precipitation products at the daily and monthly scales comparisons were performed using scatterplots of daily precipitation from all precipitation products and the interpolated rain gauge data over three watersheds tmcw emcw and srb the best and worst performing products over the three watersheds are shown in fig 3 while statistical evaluation of the precipitation products against the interpolated rain gauge data is shown in fig 4 a overall prism product performed the best while persiann product had the poorest performance with respect to r2 ns and pbias values except for prism and 3b42 all other products showed significant underestimation of the daily precipitation compared to the interpolated rain gauge data indicated by the pbias values fig 4a nevertheless these products tend to overestimate light rain 15 mm and underestimate the heavy rain 75 mm figs s3 s5 the statistical metrics for most precipitation products were slightly better in the emcw and srb than those in the tmcw but still failed to perform satisfactorily in terms of r2 ns and pbias compared with 3b42rt and persiann 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed better in terms of r2 ns and pbias this better performance may be due to the assimilation with the ground gauge data for 3b42 and persiann cdr products compared with 3b42rt persiann showed low accuracy as represented by r2 ns and pbias values this could imply that the retrieval algorithm used by persiann still needs to be improved in fact 3b42rt is primarily mw based when mw data are available while persiann is only ir based hirpa et al 2010 several studies showed that ir based rainfall algorithms have major limitations in reproducing rainfall fields in many regions around the world e g hirpa et al 2010 derin et al 2016 sahlu et al 2017 a correction of rainfall estimates from ir based algorithms with the rain gauge data at different elevations is suggested to improve their overall performance thorne et al 2001 prism product is the only product that outperformed others in terms of all the statistical criteria the reason why prism outperforms other products is that prism is a gauge based product developed based on specifics of dem and interpolation methods daly 2006 daly et al 2008 moreover the good performance of prism might also be due to the high spatial resolution of the product 4 4 km2 the spatial resolution of precipitation products assists in capturing the local microclimate effectively local microclimate effectively ward et al 2011 fuka et al 2014 the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation with seven different intensity ranges for the interpolated rain gauge and the precipitation products over tmcw are shown in fig 5 the frequency of occurrence is defined here as the number of events of any precipitation intensity class e g 0 1 mm divided by the number of samples expressed in percentage the frequency of occurrence for 0 1 mm d is plotted separately in the left panel of fig 5 this frequency of occurrence 0 1 mm exhibits the no rain shallow precipitation events for each precipitation product for tmcw 65 of the interpolated rain gauge data fell within the 0 1 mm d range overall all products except persiann cdr slightly overestimated the occurrence frequency within 0 1 mm d range although persiann cdr slightly underestimated the dry days 0 1 mm d the occurrence frequency was closest to the interpolated rain gage data similar underestimation in the dry days from persiann cdr was reported in malaysia and italy tan et al 2015 duan et al 2016 alijanian et al 2017 all products expect prism 3b42 and persiann cdr consistently underestimated the daily precipitation beyond 1 mm d thereby resulting in large negative values for the pbias fig 4a table s1 3b42 products showed underestimation within 1 20 mm d range but then displayed slight overestimation beyond 20 mm d while persiann cdr product showed significant overestimated within 5 20 mm d and underestimation beyond 20 mm d prism product exhibited underestimation within 1 50 mm d range but showed slight overestimation beyond 50 mm d almost similar trends were found over emcw and srb fig s6 and table s1 the differences in the occurrence frequencies of precipitation between the seven products would have significant implications for hydrological and water quality modeling due to the nonlinearity in the related processes duan et al 2016 for the monthly time scale the daily precipitation data was aggregated to monthly total precipitation for each precipitation product and then similar evaluation was conducted over tmcw emcw and srb fig 6 shows monthly total precipitation for two gridded products the best and worst performing products against the interpolated rain gauge data over the three watersheds while the statistical metrics evaluation is shown in fig 4b increasing the temporal scale daily to monthly resulted in better agreements between the interpolated rain gauge data and other precipitation products conti et al 2014 showed that the overall performance of satellite products increases from one to five days and to then remain stable at higher temporal aggregation it should be noted that all the products underestimated the monthly total precipitation based on pbias values the only exception was for 3b42 product at emcw where 3b42rt slightly overestimated the interpolated rain gauge data based on the r2 ns and mae values the prism has the best performance followed by 3b42 persiann cdr gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed poor performance in all metrics in general five products prism 3b42 persiann cdr gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt can be considered as the top five performers for the monthly total precipitation estimation based on the statistical metrics based on this preliminary analysis we expect that cfsr and persiann products may not be a good choice for streamflow and water quality simulations fig 7 presents the mean monthly precipitation right y axis from interpolated rain gauge data and all the seven precipitation products over tmcw during the whole period 2001 2014 fig 7 also shows the mean absolute error mae for the evaluated products the mae for any month is the average absolute error over the whole period the gauge corrected products 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd and prism product are plotted separately in the left panel of fig 7 the mean monthly precipitation over the tmcw is characterized by three peaks occurring in march july and december the months of february and october receives low precipitation with the lowest precipitation occurring in october this seasonal pattern is captured by most products except cfsr and persiann where the peak in july was underestimated considering the mae the prism product performed the best in reproducing the monthly precipitation followed by 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd gauge corrected products these four products prism 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd have lower errors over the 12 months with the average value of mae of 9 23 29 and 32 respectively fig 7 the cfsr and persiann products had the largest errors with the average mae of 43 and 53 respectively fig 7 similar findings are valid for emcw and srb fig s10 the relatively good performance of the gauge corrected products in capturing seasonal pattern compared to those with no bias adjustment 3b42rt and persiann may rise the importance of the bias correction in precipitation products and hence increase the results accuracy in the streamflow and water quality simulations 3 2 evaluation of precipitation products for streamflow and water quality the performance of each of the precipitation product was evaluated using swat model utilizing two calibration procedures first all precipitation products were evaluated by performing an individual calibration process specifically the calibration and validation of each model was performed using sufi2 algorithm at the outlet of tmcw and emcw overall 21 hydrologic parameters were evaluated for streamflow 14 parameters for tn and 15 parameters for tp the sufi2 algorithm was applied to determine the most sensitive parameters and determine the uncertainty range of the evaluated parameters as a result 9 parameters for discharge 4 parameters for tn and 4 parameters related to tp were found to be sensitive based on the t stat and p value table 3 in addition to the individual calibration process all precipitation products were calibrated using fixed set of parameters based on the model that uses ground rain data used as a baseline to evaluate all other precipitation products 3 2 1 performance of streamflow and water quality simulations the statistical evaluation of the simulated discharge tn and tp at the outlets of the tmcw and emcw for the all precipitation products is presented in table 4 for discharge simulations all swat models except those utilizing 3b42rt cfsr persiann products showed at least satisfactory performance rating based on the classification of moriasiet al 2015 during the calibration and validation periods at both outlets table 4 for tmcw the models using rg prism and 3b42 data achieved very good performance in the calibration and validation periods while models utilizing persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd data attained good performance in the calibration period only the 3b42rt products failed to achieve satisfactory performance for the validation period in terms of r2 values while cfsr and persiann products showed unsatisfactory performance based on r2 ns and pbias values only the model uses interpolated rg data reached values of r2 and ns of more than 0 89 for both calibration and validation periods considering emcw during the calibration period the use of rg and prism products led to very good performance models utilizing 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products attained the level of good performance while models using 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed satisfactory performance in terms of r2 and ns for the validation period the values of r2 and ns increased for all models with the exception of the model using gpcp 1dd and persiann products using rg prism and 3b42 products led to very good performance while persiann cdr 3b42rt gpcp 1dd and cfsr attained good ratings as the case in tmcw persiann failed to achieve a satisfactory model performance for the validation period for tn simulations at the outlet of tmcw models utilizing rg prism 3b42 and persiann cdr products attained very good performance for both calibration and validation periods based on r2 ns and pbias gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt products showed good model performance in both calibration and validation periods while the model using cfsr product achieved satisfactory performance in the calibration period and unsatisfactory performance in the validation period in terms of ns value the persiann model failed to achieve satisfactory performance in both calibration and validation periods for emcw the model using rg data achieved very good performance in the calibration period while during the validation period very good performance was achieved in terms of r2 value and satisfactory performance was attained in terms of ns value using prism an 3b42 products led to good performance for calibration and validation periods utilizing persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products led to satisfactory performance for both calibration validation periods while using 3b42rt and cfsr product showed at least satisfactory performance only in the calibration period based on r2 and ns values although the model using persiann performed better than its performance at tmcw it failed to attain at least satisfactory performance in term of ns values in the case of tp simulations rg and prism performed better than the other products for tmcw models using rg prism 3b42 and persiann cdr products led to a good model performance in the calibration period and satisfactory performance during validation period while the model using 3b42rt products showed satisfactory performance during both calibration and validation periods gpcp 1dd cfsr and persiann models failed to show satisfactory performance during the calibration and validation periods for emcw models using rg and prism 3b42 persiann cdr showed satisfactory performance for both calibration and the validation periods models utilizing gpcp 1dd 3b42rt and cfsr products failed to attain satisfactory performance at least at one period generally the average performance of the satellite and reanalysis products increased with decreasing the watershed size emcw compared to tmcw prism product performed the best followed by 3b42 and persiann cdr these three products are either gauge based prsim or gauge corrected satellite 3b42 and persiann cdr products with high spatial resolutions all the three products could be feasible choices for simulating streamflow and water quality as they showed reasonably good performance they achieved at least satisfactory model performance at tmcw and emcw although cfsr product showed satisfactory model performance in emcw it showed unacceptable performance in the tmcw the smaller percent bias of cfsr over emcw 20 compared to that over the tmcw 27 probably explains the results of the streamflow predictions fig 4 additionally the general poor performance of persiann product can be attributed to the large bias values in precipitation estimations 38 for tmcw and 31 for emcw fig 4 these findings are consistent with other studies that found poor streamflow simulations utilizing cfsr and persiann e g zhu et al 2016 and alijanian et al 2017 the tn and tp loads are generally consistent with the streamflow pattern and are significantly influenced by the characteristics of the precipitation the differences in the performance obtained by the selected precipitation products could be related to the distribution of the daily mean precipitation over the two watersheds as well as the spatial resolution of each precipitation product products with high spatial resolution performed better compared to those with low spatial resolution the monthly time series plots of simulated and observed streamflow tn and tp at the outlets of tmcw and emcw are shown in figs 8 10 the results shown in these figures are based on the best fit simulations obtained from sufi2 algorithm for both calibration and validation periods simulated streamflow results from cfsr and persiann products had the poorest performance both significantly underestimated the observed streamflow especially at tmcw cfsr product overpredicted the streamflow in the validation period in tmcw this underestimation or overestimation was reflected with more strength in tn and tp simulations although most of the products performed well in capturing base flow especially in the calibration periods persiann 1dd gpcp 1dd and 3b42rt underpredicted the peak flows during calibration and validation periods models based on rg and prism products performed well for observed streamflow tn and tp both captured the peaks low flows and tn and tp loads at the outlets of tmcw and emcw although most models underpredicted the peak flows they performed well in capturing the peaks in both tn and tp simulations figs 9 and 10 this may be evident that the calibration process improved the simulation results by adjusting and optimizing the model parameters especially for tn and tp simulations in fact previous studies raised a concern that parameter adjustments may lead to differences in water budget partitioning especially when there is no physical meaning for such a change e g price et al 2014 tuo et al 2016 our results for streamflow tn and tp corroborate these findings indicating that model parameters played an important role in correcting the bias in the modeling results caused by the use of different precipitation products most of the models were able to predicate the streamflow tn and tp by adjusting the sensitive hydrological and water quality parameters to different values and intervals within the calibrated process for example at tmcw the model calibrated for tn loads using cfsr data had higher optimal lat orgn ranges compare to other models fig s13 this suggests that having the same watershed characteristics e g land use soil information topography the model utilizing cfsr data tends to produce higher concentration of organic nitrogen compare to other models this parameter uncertainty would propagate leads to uncertainties in predicting and understanding the interaction between hydrologic and landscape patterns which further impacts the policy decision making processes e g regional environmental flows management 3 2 2 evaluation of precipitation products using fixed model parameters in the previous section we showed the performance of the selected precipitation products when an individual calibration process for each precipitation product was performed although the two watersheds tmcw and emcw have similar characteristics in term of land use soil type and slopes each precipitation product led to different parameterizations figs s11 s14 additionally although most of the models achieved satisfactory performance in streamflow tn and tp simulations at watersheds outlet the prediction would vary significantly at various points within the srb because of the change in the model parameters as a test a fixed set of parameters based on the rg product for tmcw and emcw was applied to all other precipitation products the rg was used for parameter selection as it performed the best in both streamflow and water quality simulations the aim was to focus on the effect of the precipitation input on streamflow and water quality simulations the fixed hydrological and water quality parameters are shown in table s2 the performance of all precipitation products for the calibration period based on the fixed set of parameters fp and the individual calibration parameters ip the best performing set of parameters of each product are shown in fig 11 comparisons between the products were performed using only ns metric this is because most models performed well in terms of r2 indicating that they described well the observed streamflow tn and tp variation in general the fp simulations performed poorly compared to ip simulation the precipitation products prism 3b42 perssiann cdr and gpcp 1dd were less sensitive in the tmcw the most sensitive models for fp are 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products and may be related to the fact that these models underestimated the mean daily precipitation pbias values in fig 4 therefore the ip accommodate the bias in precipitation to match observed data the uncertainty in parameters has affected mostly the water quality simulations where most products showed poor performance at least one outlet for tn and tp simulations additionally tmcw simulations were less sensitive for fp compared to emcw and may be related landscape heterogeneity higher landscape heterogeneity in the case of emcw furthermore the results achieved using the prism 3b42 perssiann cdr and gpcp 1dd products showed less variability in terms of ns values compared to the other precipitation products overall ns values varied between 5 to 50 for the fp compare to ip to further evaluate the precipitation products for the streamflow tn and tp simulations statistical boxplots at the outlets of tmcw and emcw were developed for ip set and are shown in fig 12 for all models model using persiann showed the lowest median for simulated streamflow while models based on rg and prism products had the closest median to the observed streamflow data followed by models utilizing 3b42 and persiann cdr products the average monthly simulated discharge using 3b42rt cfsr and persiann products showed an underestimation compared to the observed data the differences in the streamflow simulations were propagated to water quality simulations with larger uncertainty more peaks in tn and tp loads were observed more in emcw compare to tmcw this may be attribute to the extensive human and agricultural activities in the emcw fig 1s 4 conclusion in this study we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven precipitation products against a dense rain gauge network this study investigated the potential influence of precipitation products on streamflow and water quality simulations using swat model at two srb watersheds the selected precipitation products include prsim 3b42 3b42rt persiann cdr persiann gpcp 1dd and cfsr it was observed that the prsim aggregated pbias 2 5 3b42 aggregated pbias 5 5 and persiann cdr aggregated pbias 8 5 performed better compare to other products on the other hand cfsr and persiann products performed poorly based on the higher pbias values 24 and 34 the gauge corrected satellite products 3b42 persiann cdr and gpcp 1dd performed better in capturing seasonal pattern compared to those with no bias adjustment products 3b42rt and persiann although 3b42rt and persiann are both non corrected gauge products the 3b42rt performed better than persiann which is primarily due to the retrieval algorithm used by 3b42rt the swat model was used to compare the performance of precipitation products to simulate the streamflow and water quality tn and tp loads the sufi2 optimization algorithm was used to calibrate swat model for each precipitation products based on the observed streamflow and water quality variables it was observed that the prism product performed similar to the interpolated rain gauge data this was expected as prism is a gauge based product with a high spatial resolution the swat models based on the 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed better in simulating streamflow and capturing the base and peaks flow in comparison to other satellite and reanalysis products in addition both products achieved at least satisfactory performance for tn and tp simulations although 3b42 slightly outperforms persiann cdr it may not be useful for climate change studies due to its short data period persiann cdr has a longer period 1983 present and it performed reasonably well in comparison to the observed precipitation as well as for streamflow and water quality simulations at both watersheds other products failed to exhibit satisfactory results for streamflow tn and or tp simulations the poor performance was achieved by persiann followed by cfsr 3b42rt and gpcp 1dd both 3b42 and persiann cdr products performed significantly better than gpcp 1dd this may be due to relatively larger grid size of gpcp 1dd product table 1 the uncertainty associated with tp simulation was higher compared to streamflow and tn simulations the lower performance in tp simulations may be due to the limitation for the swat models to capture high concentrations during storm events that can contribute to the errors in sediment flux estimates me et al 2015 malagó et al 2017 it was observed that the model parameters varies with the precipitation products and therefore precipitation products and model parameters should be evaluated carefully while simulating streamflow and water quality variables using any hydrologic models this is especially important when interpreting the simulation results driven by different precipitation products if the precipitation products differ then the quantification of hydrologic fluxes e g streamflow and water quality variables e g sediment and nutrients likely to be different due to the propagation of the uncertainty from precipitation products to model parameters this study shows that precipitation as a model input has a direct and significant effect on the model performance and parameter uncertainties in streamflow and more importantly in water quality simulations one of the key limitation in our analysis is inconsistency in spatial resolution coverage of precipitation products in small watersheds for example the precipitation likely to be uniformly distributed over tmcw due to the limited number of grids less than three available at 0 25 spatial resolution another key limitation is lack of adequate water quality data at daily time scale to evaluate the performance of precipitation products future research is needed to understand how water quality variables and parameter sensitivity are changing under different hydrological conditions e g storm events and drought based on different precipitation products although our findings can be applicable to small and forest dominated watersheds more number of studies are required in different land use settings as well as under extreme hydrologic scenarios declaration of competing interest we acknowledge that our manuscript is original and it is not submitted for review in another journal
