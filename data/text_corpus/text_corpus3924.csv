19620,the coagulation flocculation flotation c f f process is becoming a popular method for algae laden water treatment however the efficiency of flotation is highly dependent on the ability of the preceding coagulation flocculation process to form flocculated algae flocs this study aims to improve the microcystis aeruginosa flotation efficiency from algae cell and organic matter aspects by applying fe ii regulated pretreatment enhanced al coagulation process the ability of the c f f process to remove cyanobacterial cells can be enhanced from 8 to 99 at a fe ii dose of 30 μm the al dose needed can be reduced by more than half while achieving successful flotation the introduced fe ii after kmno4 can not only realize moderate pre oxidation of cyanobacterial cells but also form in situ fe iii the doc value can also be decreased significantly due to the formation of in situ fe iii which is more efficient in dissolved organic matter dom removal compared with pre formed fe iii in addition the gradually hydrolyzed in situ fe iii can facilitate the hydrolysis of al as a dual coagulant and promote the clustering and cross linking of al hydrolyzates which can enhance the formation of size controlled algae flocs finally the size controlled algae flocs can be effectively floated by the bubbles released in the flotation process due to the efficient collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles therefore the efficient flotation of algae cell and organic matter can be realized by the fe ii regulated moderate pre oxidation of m aeruginosa and formation of size controlled

cyanobacteria is ubiquitous in water sources i e lakes and reservoirs and relatively low algae populations do not pose challenges for drinking water treatment plants dwtps however the algae population density can dramatically increase during the seasonal algae bloom period which can significantly impair the water treatment process efficiency henderson et al 2008a 2010b takaara et al 2010 ineffective treatment can result in a series of subsequent problems such as the high effluent turbidity existence of toxins chen et al 2008a b al tebrineh et al 2010 and shortened filtration cycle buisine and oemcke 2003 to minimize the impact of algae bloom in the subsequent treatment process it would be preferable to remove cyanobacterial cells from drinking water during the initial stages cyanobacteria can be floated easily due to their low specific density the dissolved air flotation daf process is becoming a popular clarification method for algae removal teixeira and rosa 2006 edzwald 2010 the microscopic bubbles released from the daf system can collide and attach to the algae cells and remove them by floating them to the surface however successful flotation is highly dependent on the algae bubble collision and attachment efficiencies similar to algae cells the microbubbles are negatively charged which might be due to the existence of asymmetric dipoles at bubble gas liquid interfaces oliveira and rubio 2011 the similar charge between algae cells and microbubbles is not favorable for algae bubble collision and attachment and would limit the efficiency of daf in algae removal the introduction of surfactants has been proposed to promote bubble adherence but this could not achieve high algae removal efficiency henderson et al 2008b alternatively effective algae removal can be obtained by using polymers through the polymer bridging effect but the treated water would contain cationic impurities and high concentrations of polymer as polymers do not easily adhere to the bubbles henderson et al 2010a hence further enhancement of the daf process is needed to avoid treatment problems during the algae bloom period coagulation flocculation has been applied to increase particle size and ensure the subsequent algae removal efficiency in the daf process teixeira and rosa 2007 edzwald 2010 successful flotation is heavily reliant upon the coagulant demand and the formation of flocculated algae flocs during the coagulation flocculation process henderson et al 2008a previous studies have reported that the algae flocs with diameter of 30 μm or more are easily floated edzwald 1995 han et al 2001 however the traditional al coagulation process has difficulty in controlling the algae floc size not only due to the high motility and diverse cell morphology of algae cells but also because of the interference of algal organic matter aom pieterse and cloot 1997 ma et al 2007 takaara et al 2010 these characteristics would increase the coagulant demand which cannot be forecasted on a stoichiometric basis bernhardt et al 1985 and induce ineffective flotation henderson et al 2010b ineffective flotation finally leads to drinking water quality deterioration due to the presence of algae in treated water and the release of toxins and odor and taste substances westerhoff et al 2005 wert et al 2014 sukenik et al 2017 therefore further optimization of the coagulation flocculation process before the daf process is important to avoid the aforementioned problems during algae blooms the introduction of oxidants such as potassium permanganate chlorine and ozone prior to coagulation has been reported in many studies to improve the pretreatment effect of the coagulation flocculation process chen and yeh 2005 chen et al 2008a b 2009 shen et al 2011 wang et al 2013 naceradska et al 2017 however over dosed oxidants can induce significant algae cell lysis and undesirable intracellular organic matter iom release which would not only increase the disinfection byproduct dbp formation but also interfere with the subsequent coagulation process garzon sanabria et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 to realize the optimum level of pre oxidation a novel kmno4 fe ii pretreatment process was proposed in our earlier study to achieve moderate oxidation of cyanobacterial cells without cell lysis ma et al 2012a the optimum

and al as dual coagulants play an important role in enhancing the flocculation efficiency ma et al 2014 therefore a novel fe ii regulated pretreatment before the coagulation flocculation flotation c f

the air compressor and dissolved in the milli q water to investigate the role of fe ii in kmno4 fe ii pretreatment enhanced c f f process the coagulation process was conducted in a jar test unit with a coagulation paddle fig 1 using 500 ml sample samples were mixed at 250 rpm for 5 min soon after dosing with kmno4 solutions 0 10 μm next fe ii solutions at the rkmno4 fe ii values of 1 3 i e 0 30 μm were added with mixing speed at 200 rpm for 2 min then al2 so4 3 solution at 20 μm was added and the samples were mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min and 40 rpm for 15 min for evaluating the algae removal efficiency of c f f process al2 so4 3 dose of 10 50 μm was added into the algal suspension without pretreatment finally the air saturated deionized water was supplied at a pressure of 400 kpa and

discussion 3 1 effects of fe ii on moderate pre oxidation and enhanced al coagulation for m aeruginosa removal by c f f process to evaluate the role of fe ii in algae removal by the c f f process the algae removal efficiency was tested with various doses of fe ii fig 2 a the pretreatment at fe ii doses of 21 and 30 μm dramatically increased algae removal by the c f f process to 56 and 99 respectively without pretreatment only 8 of algae could be removed by the c f f process after 20 μm al coagulation and an al dose of 50 μm was required to achieve the algae removal efficiency of 89 fig 2b the introduced kmno4 can react with organic matter during the oxidation period such as the surface adsorbed aom s aom on algae cells and the dissolved organics xie et al 2013 s aom refers to all the organic matter adsorbed on algae cells including both the natural organic matter nom and extracellular organic matter eom the thickness of s aom under natural conditions could be reached to more than 20 μm when the algae cells form colonies of different sizes with sheaths or mucilage reynolds 2007 wu et al 2007 fan et al 2016 s aom has been proved to serve as a protective barrier and stabilize the cyanobacterial cells which can inhibit the algae removal by conventional processes takaara et al 2010 qi et al 2016b the oxidation of s aom promotes the destabilization of cyanobacterial cells by destroying the protective barrier however the more effective destruction induced by the elevated kmno4 doses might result in the cell lysis this can be prevented by the regulation role of introduced fe ii and finally realize moderate pre oxidation in addition the introduced fe ii can serve as the source of in situ formed fe iii which has been found to more effectively promote floc growth due to its more plentiful reactive surface area than pre formed fe iii ma et al 2012a compared to pre formed fe iii fe iii formed in situ hydrolyzes much more gradually and can further facilitate the hydrolysis of al as a dual coagulant ma et al 2014 the positively charged fe hydrolyzates can promote the clustering and cross linking of al hydrolyzates and aom al complexes which can enhance the formation of flocculated algae flocs the al coagulant dose needed can finally be decreased by more than half and is easy to control after the fe ii regulated pretreatment with a fe ii dose of as low as 30 μm this can be explained by the in situ fe iii enhanced flocculated algae flocs formation which has been reported to play fundamental role in successful flotation henderson et al 2008a the enhancement of algae removal with elevated fe ii doses directly proved that fe ii regulated pretreatment could show positive effects on algae removal by the c f f process 3 2 effects of in situ formed fe iii on the characteristics of residual dom by c f f process the treatment of algae laden water involves not only the removal of cyanobacterial cells but also that of dom fe coagulants have been reported to exhibit higher efficiency towards dom removal than al knocke et al 1986 cheng et al 2003 to further evaluate the effects of in situ formed fe iii on the residual dom by fe ii regulated pretreatment enhanced c f f process the variation of dom characteristics after flotation was investigated from doc eem and mw distribution aspects table 1 shows the variation of doc in the algal suspension after c f f with fe ii regulated pretreatment at various doses the doc value of algal suspensions after the c f f process decreased from 4 51 mg l to 3 79 mg l while it increased from 3 79 mg l to 3 96 mg l with fe ii doses of 9 μm further increased fe ii doses from 15 μm to 30 μm could finally decrease the doc value to 2 33 mg l kmno4 at doses of below 10 μm was proved to have little effect on algae cell integrity even though it could cause the s aom desorption effect during oxidation qi et al 2016a thus the slight doc increase with the kmno4 dose of 3 μm should be ascribed to the inefficient removal of desorbed s aom by the subsequent c f f process which is consistent with the low algae removal efficiency result in fig 2 further elevated kmno4 doses can not only lead to more effective s aom destruction but also result in a large amount of in situ fe iii formation after the subsequent introduction of fe ii the in situ fe iii formed by the oxidation of fe ii has been reported to be more efficient in dom removal compared with pre formed fe iii ma et al 2012a in addition the fe compounds coexisting with the al coagulant prefer to hydrolyze rather than form aom fe complexes which can induce a greater coagulation efficiency of fe for dom removal knocke et al 1986 the contents of dom in the algal suspension can reflect not only the viability of algae cells but also the removal effect of dom by the c f f process with or without fe ii regulated pretreatment the eem spectral result in fig 3 a shows that the main types of organic matter in the raw algal suspension are protein like or org n rich substances peak flu 3 4 and 5 they can be partially removed by the al c f f process without pretreatment even though the corresponding algae removal efficiency is very limited fig 3b this might be explained by the complexation between al and protein like substances ma et al 2012b which can be partially removed by the flotation in addition the slightly increased intensity for protein like or org n rich substances in fig 3c can further prove the s aom desorption effect of kmno4 pre oxidation however further increased kmno4 and fe ii doses decreased the intensity sharply especially with 10 μm kmno4 and 30 μm fe ii pretreatment fig 3f this result is consistent with the doc decrease in table 1 which can also be explained by the high hydrolysis efficiency of in situ fe iii when coexisting with al as a dual coagulant the mw distribution of dom in the algal suspension was also investigated to determine the changes induced by fe ii regulated pretreatment fig 4 the mw distribution for the dom in algal suspension was from 18617 da to 806 da as a comparison the results for the mw distribution of dom in the algal suspension after the c f f process without fe ii regulated pretreatment are also presented as shown in fig 4 dom over almost the whole mw distribution can be partially removed after the al c f f process which is consistent with the doc table 1 and eem spectral intensity fig 3 results additionally the results for samples under different fe ii regulated pretreatment conditions showed that the dom with large and medium mw were removed much faster than those of small mw the most obvious response decrease occurred for the mw value of 9912 da especially with 10 μm kmno4 and 30 μm fe ii pretreatment the responses for the mw value of 9912 da were higher than the ones for 7459 da only if the kmno4 dose was less than 5 μm further increase of kmno4 dose made the intensity response for the mw value of 9912 da lower than that of 7459 da the aom with higher mw has been reported to improve the fe coagulation process through the bridging mechanism baresova et al 2017 which can simultaneously induce the preferential removal result of organic matter with higher mw by the in situ formed fe iii 3 3 relationship between the fe ii regulated algae floc variation and the flotation effect fig 5 shows the fe ii regulated particle size distribution for the algae flocs formed during al coagulation the peaks shifted to the higher particle size direction with the increase of fe ii dose these results are consistent with the previous report that the introduction of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment can improve the size of particles formed in al coagulation qi et al 2016a table 2 illustrates the d0 1 d0 5 and d0 9 values of algae flocs formed in al coagulation with a wide range of fe ii doses from 0 to 30 μm at fe ii doses of above 21 μm the value of d0 1 reached 29 6 μm which indicated that the particle size for more than 90 of algae flocs was higher than 29 6 μm the algae flocs with diameter of 30 μm or more have been reported to be easily floated by bubbles edzwald 1995 han et al 2001 additionally the efficient collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles can be achieved when they have similar size han et al 2001 and the formed bubble attached algae flocs have high stability the average diameter of bubbles released from the ts i releaser is 20 40 μm qi et al 2004 combined with the released bubble size the flotation process can achieve high efficiency when most of the floc sizes are greater than 20 μm this can also explain the higher algae fig 2 and dom table 1 removal efficiency when the fe ii dose is higher than 21 μm the microscopic images of the float after the c f f process directly proved that fe ii regulated pretreatment could promote the formation of size controlled algae flocs especially when the fe ii dose was higher than 21 μm fig 6 s aom has been found to play two roles in algae removal not only inhibiting coagulation but also protecting the cell integrity from oxidation damage qi et al 2016b the fe ii regulated moderate pre oxidation can eliminate the inhibitory role of s aom by desorbing the s aom from cyanobacterial cells without damaging the cell integrity qi et al 2016a the s aom desorbed cyanobacterial cells can be easily captured by the flocs which is helpful for the formation of size controlled algae flocs during al coagulation moreover the formation of bubble cell networks as shown in fig 6d e indicates that the size controlled algae flocs can be easily attached to the subsequently released bubbles to form bubble cell networks han et al 2001 the rapid formation of bubble cell networks visible to the naked eye after the release of the recycle stream can finally facilitate the removal of algae and dom cyanobacterial cells are the main contents of float after the c f f process while the al and fe hydrolyzates and mn oxides are also contained even though the increased fe ii and kmno4 doses can finally increase the contents of fe hydrolyzates and mn oxides in the float the amount of al hydrolyzates can be significantly decreased 3 4 mechanisms in the removal of m aeruginosa and organic matter by fe ii regulated c f f process the above results show that the algae and dom removal can be dramatically improved by the fe ii regulated c f f process on the basis of the above results the possible influence mechanisms are illustrated in the schematic diagram fig 7 when coagulation is applied in enhancing the daf process the treatment efficiency is dependent on the ability of the preceding coagulation flocculation process to form flocculated algae flocs henderson et al 2008a s aom has been reported to play an inhibitory role in the coagulation flocculation process takaara et al 2010 when fe ii regulated pretreatment is applied to enhance the c f f process s aom can be desorbed without damaging the cyanobacterial cells by moderate pre oxidation qi et al 2016a the s aom desorbed cyanobacterial cells can be easily caught by the flocs formed in the subsequent flocculation process qi et al 2016b on the other hand kmno4 rapidly transforms to in situ mno2 after its interaction with cyanobacterial cells and fe ii the in situ mno2 can not only precipitate on algae cell surfaces but also adsorb dom in the algal suspension and can act as the nuclei of heterogeneous coagulation and benefit the floc growth chen and yeh 2005 moreover the in situ fe iii and al can serve as dual coagulants to effectively flocculate with the destabilized cyanobacterial cells dom and in situ mno2 by their co hydrolysis function ma et al 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b the in situ fe iii prefers to hydrolyze rather than form aom fe when coexisting with al which can result in greater removal efficiency for the fe hydrolyzates towards dom ma et al 2014 on the other hand the positively charged fe hydrolyzates can facilitate the clustering and cross linking of al hydrolyzates and aom al complexes and improve the formation of size controlled algae flocs the formed algae flocs can be easily attached to the similar size bubbles released in the flotation process edzwald 1995 han et al 2001 and finally enhance the algae and dom removal efficiency 4 conclusions this study indicated that the enhanced c f f process by fe ii regulated pretreatment could remove not only algae but also dom effectively with lower al coagulant doses the desorption of s aom from cyanobacterial cells by fe ii regulated moderate pre oxidation can induce the destabilization of cyanobacterial cells and facilitate the generation of size controlled algae flocs by the dual coagulation of in situ fe iii and al in addition the high hydrolysis efficiency of in situ fe iii when coexisting with al as a dual coagulant can result in the greater coagulation efficiency for fe in dom removal the size controlled algae flocs formed in the enhanced al coagulation process can finally promote efficient flotation due to the improved collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles the implementation of fe ii regulated pretreatment requires little reconstruction of the existing dwtps especially for the one with c f f process and the significantly shortened filtration cycle in case of algae bloom may be greatly avoided due to the much higher algae removal prior to the filters thus the implementation of the fe ii regulated pretreatment in the c f f process may be practically applicable to many dwtps for enhancing algae laden water treatment it should be noted that all the findings were obtained with m aeruginosa and further verification is needed to generalize the findings to other algal species acknowledgements this work was

detector uv temperature 25 c 2 3 5 size distribution measurement of flocs the size distribution measurement of flocs involved in the abovementioned experiments was carried out with a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern uk the algae suspension was drawn from the jar through a latex tube to the sample cell of the laser particle size analyzer and then was returned back to the jar by a peristaltic pump bt00 300m longer china the light source comes from a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm during the laser diffraction measurement particles pass through a focused laser beam and the particles scatter light at an angle inversely proportional to their size the angular intensity of the scattered light is then measured by a series of photosensitive detectors 2 3 6 microscopic observation of the float the microscopic observation of the float was conducted by an electric microscope axioskop 2 mot plus germany zeiss 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fe ii on moderate pre oxidation and enhanced al coagulation for m aeruginosa removal by c f f process to evaluate the role of fe ii in algae removal by the c f f process the algae removal efficiency was tested with various doses of fe ii fig 2 a the pretreatment at fe ii doses of 21 and 30 μm dramatically increased algae removal by the c f f process to 56 and 99 respectively without pretreatment only 8 of algae could be removed by the c f f process after 20 μm al coagulation and an al dose of 50 μm was required to achieve the algae removal efficiency of 89 fig 2b the introduced kmno4 can react with organic matter during the oxidation period such as the surface adsorbed aom s aom on algae cells and the dissolved organics xie et al 2013 s aom refers to all the organic matter adsorbed on algae cells including both the natural organic matter nom and extracellular organic matter eom the thickness of s aom under natural conditions could be reached to more than 20 μm when the algae cells form colonies of different sizes with sheaths or mucilage reynolds 2007 wu et al 2007 fan et al 2016 s aom has been proved to serve as a protective barrier and stabilize the cyanobacterial cells which can inhibit the algae removal by conventional processes takaara et al 2010 qi et al 2016b the oxidation of s aom promotes the destabilization of cyanobacterial cells by destroying the protective barrier however the more effective destruction induced by the elevated kmno4 doses might result in the cell lysis this can be prevented by the regulation role of introduced fe ii and finally realize moderate pre oxidation in addition the introduced fe ii can serve as the source of in situ formed fe iii which has been found to more effectively promote floc growth due to its more plentiful reactive surface area than pre formed fe iii ma et al 2012a compared to pre formed fe iii fe iii formed in situ hydrolyzes much more gradually and can further facilitate the hydrolysis of al as a dual coagulant ma et al 2014 the positively charged fe hydrolyzates can promote the clustering and cross linking of al hydrolyzates and aom al complexes which can enhance the formation of flocculated algae flocs the al coagulant dose needed can finally be decreased by more than half and is easy to control after the fe ii regulated pretreatment with a fe ii dose of as low as 30 μm this can be explained by the in situ fe iii enhanced flocculated algae flocs formation which has been reported to play fundamental role in successful flotation henderson et al 2008a the enhancement of algae removal with elevated fe ii doses directly proved that fe ii regulated pretreatment could show positive effects on algae removal by the c f f process 3 2 effects of in situ formed fe iii on the characteristics of residual dom by c f f process the treatment of algae laden water involves not only the removal of cyanobacterial cells but also that of dom fe coagulants have been reported to exhibit higher efficiency towards dom removal than al knocke et al 1986 cheng et al 2003 to further evaluate the effects of in situ formed fe iii on the residual dom by fe ii regulated pretreatment enhanced c f f process the variation of dom characteristics after flotation was investigated from doc eem and mw distribution aspects table 1 shows the variation of doc in the algal suspension after c f f with fe ii regulated pretreatment at various doses the doc value of algal suspensions after the c f f process decreased from 4 51 mg l to 3 79 mg l while it increased from 3 79 mg l to 3 96 mg l with fe ii doses of 9 μm further increased fe ii doses from 15 μm to 30 μm could finally decrease the doc value to 2 33 mg l kmno4 at doses of below 10 μm was proved to have little effect on algae cell integrity even though it could cause the s aom desorption effect during oxidation qi et al 2016a thus the slight doc increase with the kmno4 dose of 3 μm should be ascribed to the inefficient removal of desorbed s aom by the subsequent c f f process which is consistent with the low algae removal efficiency result in fig 2 further elevated kmno4 doses can not only lead to more effective s aom destruction but also result in a large amount of in situ fe iii formation after the subsequent introduction of fe ii the in situ fe iii formed by the oxidation of fe ii has been reported to be more efficient in dom removal compared with pre formed fe iii ma et al 2012a in addition the fe compounds coexisting with the al coagulant prefer to hydrolyze rather than form aom fe complexes which can induce a greater coagulation efficiency of fe for dom removal knocke et al 1986 the contents of dom in the algal suspension can reflect not only the viability of algae cells but also the removal effect of dom by the c f f process with or without fe ii regulated pretreatment the eem spectral result in fig 3 a shows that the main types of organic matter in the raw algal suspension are protein like or org n rich substances peak flu 3 4 and 5 they can be partially removed by the al c f f process without pretreatment even though the corresponding algae removal efficiency is very limited fig 3b this might be explained by the complexation between al and protein like substances ma et al 2012b which can be partially removed by the flotation in addition the slightly increased intensity for protein like or org n rich substances in fig 3c can further prove the s aom desorption effect of kmno4 pre oxidation however further increased kmno4 and fe ii doses decreased the intensity sharply especially with 10 μm kmno4 and 30 μm fe ii pretreatment fig 3f this result is consistent with the doc decrease in table 1 which can also be explained by the high hydrolysis efficiency of in situ fe iii when coexisting with al as a dual coagulant the mw distribution of dom in the algal suspension was also investigated to determine the changes induced by fe ii regulated pretreatment fig 4 the mw distribution for the dom in algal suspension was from 18617 da to 806 da as a comparison the results for the mw distribution of dom in the algal suspension after the c f f process without fe ii regulated pretreatment are also presented as shown in fig 4 dom over almost the whole mw distribution can be partially removed after the al c f f process which is consistent with the doc table 1 and eem spectral intensity fig 3 results additionally the results for samples under different fe ii regulated pretreatment conditions showed that the dom with large and medium mw were removed much faster than those of small mw the most obvious response decrease occurred for the mw value of 9912 da especially with 10 μm kmno4 and 30 μm fe ii pretreatment the responses for the mw value of 9912 da were higher than the ones for 7459 da only if the kmno4 dose was less than 5 μm further increase of kmno4 dose made the intensity response for the mw value of 9912 da lower than that of 7459 da the aom with higher mw has been reported to improve the fe coagulation process through the bridging mechanism baresova et al 2017 which can simultaneously induce the preferential removal result of organic matter with higher mw by the in situ formed fe iii 3 3 relationship between the fe ii regulated algae floc variation and the flotation effect fig 5 shows the fe ii regulated particle size distribution for the algae flocs formed during al coagulation the peaks shifted to the higher particle size direction with the increase of fe ii dose these results are consistent with the previous report that the introduction of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment can improve the size of particles formed in al coagulation qi et al 2016a table 2 illustrates the d0 1 d0 5 and d0 9 values of algae flocs formed in al coagulation with a wide range of fe ii doses from 0 to 30 μm at fe ii doses of above 21 μm the value of d0 1 reached 29 6 μm which indicated that the particle size for more than 90 of algae flocs was higher than 29 6 μm the algae flocs with diameter of 30 μm or more have been reported to be easily floated by bubbles edzwald 1995 han et al 2001 additionally the efficient collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles can be achieved when they have similar size han et al 2001 and the formed bubble attached algae flocs have high stability the average diameter of bubbles released from the ts i releaser is 20 40 μm qi et al 2004 combined with the released bubble size the flotation process can achieve high efficiency when most of the floc sizes are greater than 20 μm this can also explain the higher algae fig 2 and dom table 1 removal efficiency when the fe ii dose is higher than 21 μm the microscopic images of the float after the c f f process directly proved that fe ii regulated pretreatment could promote the formation of size controlled algae flocs especially when the fe ii dose was higher than 21 μm fig 6 s aom has been found to play two roles in algae removal not only inhibiting coagulation but also protecting the cell integrity from oxidation damage qi et al 2016b the fe ii regulated moderate pre oxidation can eliminate the inhibitory role of s aom by desorbing the s aom from cyanobacterial cells without damaging the cell integrity qi et al 2016a the s aom desorbed cyanobacterial cells can be easily captured by the flocs which is helpful for the formation of size controlled algae flocs during al coagulation moreover the formation of bubble cell networks as shown in fig 6d e indicates that the size controlled algae flocs can be easily attached to the subsequently released bubbles to form bubble cell networks han et al 2001 the rapid formation of bubble cell networks visible to the naked eye after the release of the recycle stream can finally facilitate the removal of algae and dom cyanobacterial cells are the main contents of float after the c f f process while the al and fe hydrolyzates and mn oxides are also contained even though the increased fe ii and kmno4 doses can finally increase the contents of fe hydrolyzates and mn oxides in the float the amount of al hydrolyzates can be significantly decreased 3 4 mechanisms in the removal of m aeruginosa and organic matter by fe ii regulated c f f process the above results show that the algae and dom removal can be dramatically improved by the fe ii regulated c f f process on the basis of the above results the possible influence mechanisms are illustrated in the schematic diagram fig 7 when coagulation is applied in enhancing the daf process the treatment efficiency is dependent on the ability of the preceding coagulation flocculation process to form flocculated algae flocs henderson et al 2008a s aom has been reported to play an inhibitory role in the coagulation flocculation process takaara et al 2010 when fe ii regulated pretreatment is applied to enhance the c f f process s aom can be desorbed without damaging the cyanobacterial cells by moderate pre oxidation qi et al 2016a the s aom desorbed cyanobacterial cells can be easily caught by the flocs formed in the subsequent flocculation process qi et al 2016b on the other hand kmno4 rapidly transforms to in situ mno2 after its interaction with cyanobacterial cells and fe ii the in situ mno2 can not only precipitate on algae cell surfaces but also adsorb dom in the algal suspension and can act as the nuclei of heterogeneous coagulation and benefit the floc growth chen and yeh 2005 moreover the in situ fe iii and al can serve as dual coagulants to effectively flocculate with the destabilized cyanobacterial cells dom and in situ mno2 by their co hydrolysis function ma et al 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b the in situ fe iii prefers to hydrolyze rather than form aom fe when coexisting with al which can result in greater removal efficiency for the fe hydrolyzates towards dom ma et al 2014 on the other hand the positively charged fe hydrolyzates can facilitate the clustering and cross linking of al hydrolyzates and aom al complexes and improve the formation of size controlled algae flocs the formed algae flocs can be easily attached to the similar size bubbles released in the flotation process edzwald 1995 han et al 2001 and finally enhance the algae and dom removal efficiency 4 conclusions this study indicated that the enhanced c f f process by fe ii regulated pretreatment could remove not only algae but also dom effectively with lower al coagulant doses the desorption of s aom from cyanobacterial cells by fe ii regulated moderate pre oxidation can induce the destabilization of cyanobacterial cells and facilitate the generation of size controlled algae flocs by the dual coagulation of in situ fe iii and al in addition the high hydrolysis efficiency of in situ fe iii when coexisting with al as a dual coagulant can result in the greater coagulation efficiency for fe in dom removal the size controlled algae flocs formed in the enhanced al coagulation process can finally promote efficient flotation due to the improved collision and attachment between flocs and bubbles the implementation of fe ii regulated pretreatment requires little reconstruction of the existing dwtps especially for the one with c f f process and the significantly shortened filtration cycle in case of algae bloom may be greatly avoided due to the much higher algae removal prior to the filters thus the implementation of the fe ii regulated pretreatment in the c f f process may be practically applicable to many dwtps for enhancing algae laden water treatment it should be noted that all the findings were obtained with m aeruginosa and further verification is needed to generalize the findings to other algal species acknowledgements this work was

19621,vast numbers of xenobiotics are known still to be present in treated municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents some of these possess endocrine disrupting potency and pose risks for exposed aquatic animals we searched for 17 potential environmental contaminants having affinity to the progesterone receptor relative potency values of these progesterone receptor active chemicals were obtained on the basis of relative potencies and measured environmental concentrations the contribution of progestins to measured progestagenic activities was evaluated wastewaters influent and effluent and surrounding surface waters upstream and downstream at six municipal wwtps were screened using instrumental chemical analysis and in vitro reporter gene bioassay we showed the presence of target compounds and anti progestagenic activities in municipal wastewater and surface water nine and seven progestins were identified in influent and effluent wastewaters respectively only two compounds progesterone and medroxyprogesterone were found in surface waters progestagenic agonistic activities in influents were partially masked by strong anti progestagenic activities that were detected in all influents and ranged from 2 63 to 83 ng l of mifepristone equivalents eqs progestagenic activities were detected in all effluents and ranged from 0 06 to 0 47 ng l of reference compound org 2058 eqs a synthetic progestin equivalents thus indicating incomplete removal of progestins during wastewater treatment processing this activity poses a continuing risk for the aquatic environment by contrast anti progestagenic activities showed better removal efficiency in wwtps compared to progestagenic agonistic activities anti progestagenic activities were found in only three of six effluents and ranged from 0 26 to 2 1 ng l mifepristone eqs we explained most of the progestagenic activity in municipal wwtp effluents by the presence of synthetic progestins and progesterone which contributed 65 96 of such activity in samples where no antagonistic activity was found the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone contributed most to the progestagenic activity detected in municipal effluents anti progestagenic activities were found in some municipal effluents but no causative agents were revealed because two analysed selective progesterone receptor modulators sprms with anti progestagenic activities mifepristone and ulipristal acetate were not present in the effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords lc apci appi hrps progestogens pollution pr calux assay solid phase extraction 1 introduction it is well known that many chemicals are daily discharged into sewage and that some of them pass through municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore wwtp effluents still contain certain amounts of xenobiotics that subsequently enter the aquatic environment some of these environmental contaminants may impair the endocrine systems of exposed organisms colborn et al 1993 jobling and tyler 2003 lange et al 2001 sumpter 1998 one group of endocrine disrupting pollutants synthetic progestins have recently come under suspicion of causing a significant toxic burden and substantial risk to the aquatic environment fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 synthetic progestins are mainly used as the active ingredients in women s contraceptives but also in other hormonal preparations sitruk ware 2004 zeilinger et al 2009 as a result they are consumed in relatively large amounts ranging from 0 34 to 9864 kg year as reported from various european countries besse and garric 2009 runnalls et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 including the czech republic golovko et al 2018 therefore municipal wwtps might be important sources of synthetic progestins chang et al 2009 the naturally occurring progestin progesterone originates from farmed animals such as swine cattle and chickens as well as from humans shore and shemesh 2003 in addition progesterone is an active ingredient of several widely prescribed drugs golovko et al 2018 some synthetic progestins and progesterone already have been detected in wwtp effluents fan et al 2011 liu et al 2014 viglino et al 2008 thereby indicating insufficient elimination of these compounds during wastewater treatment processes accumulating evidence indicates that municipal wwtp discharges may also contaminate surface waters kumar et al 2015 several analytical surveys conducted to date have confirmed the presence of synthetic progestins at concentrations up to tens of ng l in aquatic environments throughout the world al odaini et al 2010 chang et al 2011 kolpin et al 2002 liu et al 2011 viglino et al 2008 vulliet et al 2007 and progesterone even at concentrations as high as 199 ng l kolpin et al 2002 nevertheless only limited knowledge about environmental levels of synthetic progestins appears in the literature fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 this topic deserves greater attention as it has been demonstrated that exposure of aquatic organisms to progestins at even low ng l levels affects their reproduction paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 zeilinger et al 2009 zucchi et al 2012 namely levonorgestrel norethisterone and gestodene have been shown to decrease egg production and diminish development of secondary male characteristics in fathead minnow pimephales promelas at concentrations as low as 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 ng l respectively paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 zeilinger et al 2009 furthermore levonorgestrel was shown to negatively affect oocyte development in western clawed frog xenopus tropicalis after sub chronic exposure to concentration of 1 3 ng l säfholm et al 2012 although not all synthetic progestins are structurally similar to the natural progestin progesterone africander et al 2011 they were designed to be progesterone receptor pr agonists and thus mimic progesterone function stanczyk et al 2013 most synthetic progestins are even more potent than natural progesterone besse and garric 2009 surprisingly there is a paucity of information regarding the contribution of progestins to progestagenic activity in municipal wastewaters and surface waters creusot et al 2014 estrogenic activities have been studied very thoroughly and androgenic activities also have attracted a certain interest but the other hormonal activities have not been given the proper research focus compounds exhibiting these activities such as progestins are nevertheless known environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors kumar et al 2015 therefore there exists a real need for further investigation of progestagenic activity in combination with thorough chemical analysis to the best of our knowledge only one study has been directed to revealing causative compounds of progestagenic activity downstream from a pharmaceutical factory creusot et al 2014 the first goals of the present study were to determine whether 1 progestins are present in wastewaters and surface waters 2 municipal wastewaters contain progestagenic activities 3 progestagenic activities are removed during wastewater treatment processes and 4 progestagenic activities emerging from the studied wwtps affect receiving surface waters subsequently we aimed to discover the extent to which detected progestins contribute to progestagenic activities in municipal wwtps effluents and in receiving surface waters because investigation of antagonistic activities should always be included into such an analysis ihara et al 2014 weiss et al 2009 we also assessed each sampling locality in parallel for the presence of anti progestagenic activities and for two selective progesterone receptor modulators mifepristone and ulipristal acetate

recipient surface waters the sample preparation is described in detail in a paper by golovko et al 2018 samples from each sampling site were stored at 4 c and analysed within 72 h prior to extraction for each site a procedural blank demineralized water was extracted and analysed to distinguish between positive detections and potential sample contamination matrix matching standards corresponding to analysed matrices were used for correction of matrix effects briefly the matrix standards were prepared by adding both is and native compounds at amount of 10 ng and 200 ng into extract of corresponding matrix prepared the same way as real samples but without addition of is the peak area internal standard ratio determined in non spiked samples was subtracted from the peak area internal standard ratio in matrix matched standards to achieve the matrix affected response factor if matrix effect was lower than 20 we used response factors derived from calibration curve 2 4 pr calux and resazurin reduction assays to detect anti progestagenic activities either in water extracts or pure chemicals pr calux in vitro reporter gene bioassay was carried out as described elsewhere sonneveld et al 2005 pr calux bioassay was selected because it is a highly sensitive in vitro bioassay and responds selectively to anti progestagenic compounds sonneveld et al 2011 the reference compound for progestagenic activity was org 2058 while mifepristone was the reference compound for assessing anti progestagenic activity all samples including pure chemicals were tested for cytotoxicity using resazurin reduction assay first pr calux cells exposed to samples were visually inspected for cytotoxicity under a microscope subsequently we carried out resazurin reduction assay using a resazurin based in vitro toxicology assay kit sigma aldrich to evaluate the potential effect of the sample on cell viability o brien et al 2000 the procedures of pr calux assay and cytotoxicity testing are

municipal wwtp influents contained nine progestins cyproterone acetate dienogest drospirenone gestodene medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate nomegestrol acetate and progesterone in the range of 0 19 48 ng l tables 1 and 2 three compounds dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone were found in all assessed influents there was only one positive detection of an sprm all through the sampling period and all studied types of matrices this was mifepristone at a concentration of 0 65 ng l in influent of české budějovice s wwtp seven progestins cyproterone acetate dienogest drospirenone megestrol acetate medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate and progesterone were detected in effluents at concentrations ranging from 0 11 to 3 2 ng l tables 1 and 2 those three compounds most widespread in influents dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone were also those most frequently present in effluents with four megestrol acetate and progesterone and three dienogest positive detections out of six attempts through the sampling campaign tables 1 and 2 only medroxyprogesterone and progesterone occurred even in surface waters progesterone was found three times both up and downstream in concentration ranges of 0 20 0 42 ng l median 0 23 ng l and 0 17 1 2 ng l median 0 21 ng l respectively the concentrations of progesterone are comparable with data reported from china where progesterone was found upstream and downstream at concentrations of 0 5 and 2 5 ng l respectively liu et al 2011 in the present study most wwtp discharges did not significantly increase progesterone levels in surface waters the exception was the wwtp at bratislava petržalka where progesterone was found at considerably higher concentration table 2 downstream 1 2 ng l than upstream 0 42 ng l medroxyprogesterone is the only synthetic progestin found in surface water it was detected only once 0 12 ng l that being in the river svratka downstream from wwtp brno occurrence of medroxyprogesterone in surface water has once been reported in the united states kolodziej et al 2003 and in municipal wwtp effluent in the czech republic golovko et al 2018 medroxyprogesterone appears to be a specific pollutant among synthetic progestins for wwtp brno because this compound has already been detected in untreated wastewater from a hospital in brno macikova et al 2014 therefore the main source of medroxyprogesterone is likely this local hospital medroxyprogesterone is not prescribed in the czech republic and it may occur as a product of biotransformation from medroxyprogesterone acetate golovko et al 2018 3 2 anti progestagenic activity of pure compounds it was possible to obtain complete dose response curves for all studied progestins fig 1 in order to derive ec50 pc10 and relative potency rep values table s3 ulipristal acetate showed a full antagonistic dose response curve fig 2 and this was used to derive ic50 pc20 and antagonistic rep value for the sprm table s4 six of the 17 compounds analysed in this study cyproterone acetate dydrogesterone levonorgestrel medroxyprogesterone mifepristone norethisterone and progesterone have already been tested by other authors using pr calux assay houtman et al 2009 rižner et al 2011 to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic and comprehensive in vitro profiling of progestagenic activity of progestins that are relevant for the aquatic environment in addition medroxyprogesterone has been tested in the present study in in vitro reporter gene bioassay for the first time ulipristal acetate was the only compound tested for anti progestagenic activity it has shown similar potency as a reference compound mifepristone for anti progestagenic activity table s4 our results together show that ulipristal acetate is the first environmentally relevant compound with anti progestagenic activity similar to that of mifepristone 3 3 anti progestagenic activity in wastewater and surface water unlike estrogenic activities there have been only a few attempts to date to detect anti progestagenic activities in aquatic environments table s5 in the present study progestagenic agonistic activities were found in four of six wwtp influents in the range of 0 09 0 6 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 38 ng l org 2058 eqs the pr calux assay revealed also the presence of progestagenic activity ranging from 0 04 to 0 47 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 15 ng l org 2058 eqs in all six wwtp effluents that roughly corresponds to 0 5 6 1 ng l progesterone eqs such contamination is still of considerable concern when bearing in mind that org 2058 is approximately 13 times more potent than is progesterone table s3 van der linden et al 2008 activities found in the present study were in the same order of magnitude as those reported for effluents in the netherlands van der linden et al 2008 and india viswanath et al 2008 higher concentrations reaching to 5 4 ng l org 2058 eqs have been found in effluents in australia bain et al 2014 leusch et al 2014 surprisingly no progestagenic activities were found in worldwide inter laboratory screening escher et al 2014 and at some sites in australia scott et al 2014 china rao et al 2014 france bellet et al 2012 and tunisia mnif et al 2010 some non detects however might be attributed to high limits of detection such as 5 ng l org 2058 eqs scott et al 2014 progestagenic activities detected in surface water were one order of magnitude lower than those found in effluents they were detected at three sampling points and ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 04 ng l org 2058 which corresponds to approximately 0 4 0 8 ng l progesterone eqs surprisingly weak progestagenic activities at 0 03 and 0 04 ng l org 2058 eqs occurred twice in upstream but not in downstream surface waters at the české budějovice and bratislava petržalka sampling sites to sum up czech and slovak surface waters did not seem to be seriously affected by progestagenic activity from municipal wwtp discharges in most cases only once did the progestagenic activity persist in surface water 50 m downstream and then at a concentration of 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs such concentration is approximately equivalent to 0 8 ng l of progesterone the highest reported concentration of progestagenic activity has been as high as 4 5 ng l org 2058 eqs in a netherlands stream van der linden et al 2008 anti progestagenic activities were detected in all six influents and at three out of six investigated wwtp effluents with concentrations ranging between 2 63 and 83 ng l mifepristone eqs median 6 97 ng l mifepristone eqs and 0 77 to 1 01 ng l mifepristone eqs median 0 89 ng l mifepristone eqs respectively strong anti progestagenic activities in effluent and surface water up to 31 5 and 121 μg l mifepristone eqs respectively had previously been detected in china rao et al 2014 potent anti progestagenic activities up to 32 μg l mifepristone eqs were also reported in australian surface water scott et al 2014 somewhat weaker anti progestagenic activities were found in france with maximal concentration of 3 8 ng l mifepristone eqs bellet et al 2012 high anti progestagenic loads detected at all six studied influents were completely or significantly removed during the treatment process in the case of effluents at wwtp tábor klokoty and wwtp bratislava petržalka anti progestagenic activities co occurred with progestagenic agonistic activities no anti progestagenic activity has been found in surface water samples tables 1 and 2 3 4 comparison of chem teqs and bio teqs in effluents and surface water predicted chem teqs of synthetic progestins and progesterone have accounted to measured bio teqs in effluents with 65 70 76 and 96 on the basis of reps calculated from ec50 and 58 64 78 and 114 based on the latter approach with reps calculated from pc10 the unexplained portions of progestagenic activities remaining to bio teq table 3 and table s6 might be attributed either to the presence of unknown compounds or to synergy between compounds table 3 when anti progestagenic activities suppress the signal of agonists the chem teqs are higher than the bio teqs tables 1 and 2 this phenomenon is known as masking effect creusot et al 2014 ihara et al 2014 weiss et al 2009 all influent samples exhibited masking effects while among wwtp effluents only those at tábor klokoty and bratislava petržalka were observed to have masking effects tables 1 and 2 additionally contributions of the individual compounds to bio teqs in effluents and surface waters were estimated table 3 in effluents medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone were the main contributors to progestagenic activities in two out of six studied wwtp effluents interestingly progesterone was the greatest contributor in those effluents where masking effects were observed it is noteworthy that the main contributors to progestagenic activity were progesterone derivatives cyproterone acetate medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate while there was only one contributing testosterone dienogest and one spironolactone drospirenone derivative to date only one study has described a contribution of progestins to progestagenic activities in that case it was found that a single progestin levonorgestrel can contribute as much as approximately 50 to progestagenic activities in surface water creusot et al 2014 regarding surface waters progestins contributed as much as 83 to overall progestagenic activities there was only one case in which progestagenic activity was detectable in surface water contaminated with progestins the recipient of effluent from wwtp prachatice the živný brook manifested progestagenic activities of 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs which is equivalent to almost 1 ng l of progesterone this can be attributed to the fact that živný brook is a small stream and so the dilution is less than in the other studied recipients moreover we revealed that progesterone was responsible for 45 of progestagenic activity upstream but only for 28 downstream from wwtp prachatice this indicates discharging of some unknown pr active compounds in the effluent co occurrence of progestagenic activity 0 04 ng l org 2058 eqs and the natural progestin progesterone 0 5 ng l has also been recorded upstream from wwtp bratislava petržalka and progesterone was responsible for most of the progestagenic activity 83 in the present study we revealed only one substance contributing to anti progestagenic activity of wastewater and that was mifepristone in influent of wwtp české budějovice it was responsible however for only 7 8 of detected mifepristone eq as no sprm was revealed in effluents and surface waters the causative anti progestagenic compounds remained unknown we can speculate that it might originate from various industrial by products and compounds included in personal care products such as uv filters or polycyclic musks that are present in the aquatic environment and known to possess anti progestagenic activities hamers et al 2006 schreurs et al 2005 3 5 potential adverse effects in aquatic animals of the three compounds dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone that occurred most frequently in effluents effects on aquatic animals only of progesterone are reported in the literature kumar et al 2015 the lowest observed effect concentration loec for progesterone in fish has been reported to be as low as 2 ng l zucchi et al 2012 which amount was exceeded in effluent of wwtp bratislava petržalka and is quite close to the concentration of 1 2 ng l detected even in surface water downstream from this wwtp among the compounds detected less frequently in effluents cyproterone acetate drospirenone and medroxyprogesterone acetate only the concentration of cyproterone acetate 0 5 ng l was close to its loec value reported by sharpe et al 2004 to be 1 ng l medroxyprogesterone acetate which was detected twice and drospirenone which was found once have loecs zhao et al 2015 zucchi et al 2014 much higher than the respective concentrations in effluents if however the compounds occur in the water together they may act in synergy and their loec values can then be significantly lower than determined under laboratory conditions zhao et al 2015 describe such a synergy in the case of dydrogesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate particular attention should be devoted to medroxyprogesterone which was the only synthetic progestin detected in surface water unfortunately there are no toxicological data available for this compound progestins have been found to be very weak drospirenone gestodene and progesterone or non agonists e g levonorgestrel or etonogestrel of pr in fish bain et al 2015 nevertheless some of them do considerably transactivate fish androgen receptor bain et al 2015 ellestad et al 2014 the mode of action in fish is likely different from what we know in humans kumar et al 2015 and using pr calux which is based on human pr may not be appropriate regarding aquatic vertebrates activity detected by pr calux assay seems to be a better risk indicator for amphibians than for fish as amphibian pr is believed to have high amino acids sequence similarity within the hormone binding domain with pr in humans bayaa et al 2000 moreover adverse effects of exposure to progesterone and synthetic progestins in amphibians seem to be similar to the effects in higher vertebrates including humans kvarnryd et al 2011 säfholm et al 2014 2016 4 conclusions results of the present study show that synthetic progestins together with progesterone constitute the majority of causative agents of progestagenic activity in municipal wwtp effluents with medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone being the most important of the progestins that occurred most frequently in water only four have been tested on aquatic vertebrates even in these cases knowledge as to their possible adverse effects is very limited although strong anti progestagenic activities were detected in two effluents no causative agents were revealed despite that anti progestagenic activities have been detected by various authors and were detected also in this study in vivo anti progestagenic effects on aquatic biota are practically not

19621,vast numbers of xenobiotics are known still to be present in treated municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents some of these possess endocrine disrupting potency and pose risks for exposed aquatic animals we searched for 17 potential environmental contaminants having affinity to the progesterone receptor relative potency values of these progesterone receptor active chemicals were obtained on the basis of relative potencies and measured environmental concentrations the contribution of progestins to measured progestagenic activities was evaluated wastewaters influent and effluent and surrounding surface waters upstream and downstream at six municipal wwtps were screened using instrumental chemical analysis and in vitro reporter gene bioassay we showed the presence of target compounds and anti progestagenic activities in municipal wastewater and surface water nine and seven progestins were identified in influent and effluent wastewaters respectively only two compounds progesterone and medroxyprogesterone were found in surface waters progestagenic agonistic activities in influents were partially masked by strong anti progestagenic activities that were detected in all influents and ranged from 2 63 to 83 ng l of mifepristone equivalents eqs progestagenic activities were detected in all effluents and ranged from 0 06 to 0 47 ng l of reference compound org 2058 eqs a synthetic progestin equivalents thus indicating incomplete removal of progestins during wastewater treatment processing this activity poses a continuing risk for the aquatic environment by contrast anti progestagenic activities showed better removal efficiency in wwtps compared to progestagenic agonistic activities anti progestagenic activities were found in only three of six effluents and ranged from 0 26 to 2 1 ng l mifepristone eqs we explained most of the progestagenic activity in municipal wwtp effluents by the presence of synthetic progestins and progesterone which contributed 65 96 of such activity in samples where no antagonistic activity was found the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone contributed most to the progestagenic activity detected in municipal effluents anti progestagenic activities were found in some municipal effluents but no causative agents were revealed because two analysed selective progesterone receptor modulators sprms with anti progestagenic activities mifepristone and ulipristal acetate were not present in the effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords lc apci appi hrps progestogens pollution pr calux assay solid phase extraction 1 introduction it is well known that many chemicals are daily discharged into sewage and that some of them pass through municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore wwtp effluents still contain certain amounts of xenobiotics that subsequently enter the aquatic environment some of these environmental contaminants may impair the endocrine systems of exposed organisms colborn et al 1993 jobling and tyler 2003 lange et al 2001 sumpter 1998 one group of endocrine disrupting pollutants synthetic progestins have recently come under suspicion of causing a significant toxic burden and substantial risk to the aquatic environment fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 synthetic progestins are mainly used as the active ingredients in women s contraceptives but also in other hormonal preparations sitruk ware 2004 zeilinger et al 2009 as a result they are consumed in relatively large amounts ranging from 0 34 to 9864 kg year as reported from various european countries besse and garric 2009 runnalls et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 including the czech republic golovko et al 2018 therefore municipal wwtps might be important sources of synthetic progestins chang et al 2009 the naturally occurring progestin progesterone originates from farmed animals such as swine cattle and chickens as well as from humans shore and shemesh 2003 in addition progesterone is an active ingredient of several widely prescribed drugs golovko et al 2018 some synthetic progestins and progesterone already have been detected in wwtp effluents fan et al 2011 liu et al 2014 viglino et al 2008 thereby indicating insufficient elimination of these compounds during wastewater treatment processes accumulating evidence indicates that municipal wwtp discharges may also contaminate surface waters kumar et al 2015 several analytical surveys conducted to date have confirmed the presence of synthetic progestins at concentrations up to tens of ng l in aquatic environments throughout the world al odaini et al 2010 chang et al 2011 kolpin et al 2002 liu et al 2011 viglino et al 2008 vulliet et al 2007 and progesterone even at concentrations as high as 199 ng l kolpin et al 2002 nevertheless only limited knowledge about environmental levels of synthetic progestins appears in the literature fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 this topic deserves greater attention as it has been demonstrated that exposure of aquatic organisms to progestins at even low ng l levels affects their reproduction paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 zeilinger et al 2009 zucchi et al 2012 namely levonorgestrel norethisterone and gestodene have been shown to decrease egg production and diminish development of secondary male characteristics in fathead minnow pimephales promelas at concentrations as low as 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 ng l respectively paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 zeilinger et al 2009 furthermore levonorgestrel was shown to negatively affect oocyte development in western clawed frog xenopus tropicalis after sub chronic exposure to concentration of 1 3 ng l säfholm et al 2012 although not all synthetic progestins are structurally similar to the natural progestin progesterone africander et al 2011 they were designed to be progesterone receptor pr agonists and thus mimic progesterone function stanczyk et al 2013 most synthetic progestins are even more potent than natural progesterone besse and garric 2009 surprisingly there is a paucity of information regarding the contribution of progestins to progestagenic activity in municipal wastewaters and surface waters creusot et al 2014 estrogenic activities have been studied very thoroughly and androgenic activities also have attracted a certain interest but the other hormonal activities have not been given the proper research focus compounds exhibiting these activities such as progestins are nevertheless known environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors kumar et al 2015 therefore there exists a real need for further investigation of progestagenic activity in combination with thorough chemical analysis to the best of our knowledge only one study has been directed to revealing causative compounds of progestagenic activity downstream from a pharmaceutical factory creusot et al 2014 the first goals of the present study were to determine whether 1 progestins are present in wastewaters and surface waters 2 municipal wastewaters contain progestagenic activities 3 progestagenic activities are removed during wastewater treatment processes and 4 progestagenic activities emerging from the studied wwtps affect receiving surface waters subsequently we aimed to discover the extent to which detected progestins contribute to progestagenic activities in municipal wwtps effluents and in receiving surface waters because investigation of antagonistic activities should always be included into such an analysis ihara et al 2014 weiss et al 2009 we also assessed each sampling locality in parallel for the presence of anti progestagenic activities and for two selective progesterone receptor modulators mifepristone and ulipristal acetate

recipient surface waters the sample preparation is described in detail in a paper by golovko et al 2018 samples from each sampling site were stored at 4 c and analysed within 72 h prior to extraction for each site a procedural blank demineralized water was extracted and analysed to distinguish between positive detections and potential sample contamination matrix matching standards corresponding to analysed matrices were used for correction of matrix effects briefly the matrix standards were prepared by adding both is and native compounds at amount of 10 ng and 200 ng into extract of corresponding matrix prepared the same way as real samples but without addition of is the peak area internal standard ratio determined in non spiked samples was subtracted from the peak area internal standard ratio in matrix matched standards to achieve the matrix affected response factor if matrix effect was lower than 20 we used response factors derived from calibration curve 2 4 pr calux and resazurin reduction assays to detect anti progestagenic activities either in water extracts or pure chemicals pr calux in vitro reporter gene bioassay was carried out as described elsewhere sonneveld et al 2005 pr calux bioassay was selected because it is a highly sensitive in vitro bioassay and responds selectively to anti progestagenic compounds sonneveld et al 2011 the reference compound for progestagenic activity was org 2058 while mifepristone was the reference compound for assessing anti progestagenic activity all samples including pure chemicals were tested for cytotoxicity using resazurin reduction assay first pr calux cells exposed to samples were visually inspected for cytotoxicity under a microscope subsequently we carried out resazurin reduction assay using a resazurin based in vitro toxicology assay kit sigma aldrich to evaluate the potential effect of the sample on cell viability o brien et al 2000 the procedures of pr calux assay and cytotoxicity testing are

municipal wwtp influents contained nine progestins cyproterone acetate dienogest drospirenone gestodene medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate nomegestrol acetate and progesterone in the range of 0 19 48 ng l tables 1 and 2 three compounds dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone were found in all assessed influents there was only one positive detection of an sprm all through the sampling period and all studied types of matrices this was mifepristone at a concentration of 0 65 ng l in influent of české budějovice s wwtp seven progestins cyproterone acetate dienogest drospirenone megestrol acetate medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate and progesterone were detected in effluents at concentrations ranging from 0 11 to 3 2 ng l tables 1 and 2 those three compounds most widespread in influents dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone were also those most frequently present in effluents with four megestrol acetate and progesterone and three dienogest positive detections out of six attempts through the sampling campaign tables 1 and 2 only medroxyprogesterone and progesterone occurred even in surface waters progesterone was found three times both up and downstream in concentration ranges of 0 20 0 42 ng l median 0 23 ng l and 0 17 1 2 ng l median 0 21 ng l respectively the concentrations of progesterone are comparable with data reported from china where progesterone was found upstream and downstream at concentrations of 0 5 and 2 5 ng l respectively liu et al 2011 in the present study most wwtp discharges did not significantly increase progesterone levels in surface waters the exception was the wwtp at bratislava petržalka where progesterone was found at considerably higher concentration table 2 downstream 1 2 ng l than upstream 0 42 ng l medroxyprogesterone is the only synthetic progestin found in surface water it was detected only once 0 12 ng l that being in the river svratka downstream from wwtp brno occurrence of medroxyprogesterone in surface water has once been reported in the united states kolodziej et al 2003 and in municipal wwtp effluent in the czech republic golovko et al 2018 medroxyprogesterone appears to be a specific pollutant among synthetic progestins for wwtp brno because this compound has already been detected in untreated wastewater from a hospital in brno macikova et al 2014 therefore the main source of medroxyprogesterone is likely this local hospital medroxyprogesterone is not prescribed in the czech republic and it may occur as a product of biotransformation from medroxyprogesterone acetate golovko et al 2018 3 2 anti progestagenic activity of pure compounds it was possible to obtain complete dose response curves for all studied progestins fig 1 in order to derive ec50 pc10 and relative potency rep values table s3 ulipristal acetate showed a full antagonistic dose response curve fig 2 and this was used to derive ic50 pc20 and antagonistic rep value for the sprm table s4 six of the 17 compounds analysed in this study cyproterone acetate dydrogesterone levonorgestrel medroxyprogesterone mifepristone norethisterone and progesterone have already been tested by other authors using pr calux assay houtman et al 2009 rižner et al 2011 to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic and comprehensive in vitro profiling of progestagenic activity of progestins that are relevant for the aquatic environment in addition medroxyprogesterone has been tested in the present study in in vitro reporter gene bioassay for the first time ulipristal acetate was the only compound tested for anti progestagenic activity it has shown similar potency as a reference compound mifepristone for anti progestagenic activity table s4 our results together show that ulipristal acetate is the first environmentally relevant compound with anti progestagenic activity similar to that of mifepristone 3 3 anti progestagenic activity in wastewater and surface water unlike estrogenic activities there have been only a few attempts to date to detect anti progestagenic activities in aquatic environments table s5 in the present study progestagenic agonistic activities were found in four of six wwtp influents in the range of 0 09 0 6 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 38 ng l org 2058 eqs the pr calux assay revealed also the presence of progestagenic activity ranging from 0 04 to 0 47 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 15 ng l org 2058 eqs in all six wwtp effluents that roughly corresponds to 0 5 6 1 ng l progesterone eqs such contamination is still of considerable concern when bearing in mind that org 2058 is approximately 13 times more potent than is progesterone table s3 van der linden et al 2008 activities found in the present study were in the same order of magnitude as those reported for effluents in the netherlands van der linden et al 2008 and india viswanath et al 2008 higher concentrations reaching to 5 4 ng l org 2058 eqs have been found in effluents in australia bain et al 2014 leusch et al 2014 surprisingly no progestagenic activities were found in worldwide inter laboratory screening escher et al 2014 and at some sites in australia scott et al 2014 china rao et al 2014 france bellet et al 2012 and tunisia mnif et al 2010 some non detects however might be attributed to high limits of detection such as 5 ng l org 2058 eqs scott et al 2014 progestagenic activities detected in surface water were one order of magnitude lower than those found in effluents they were detected at three sampling points and ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs median 0 04 ng l org 2058 which corresponds to approximately 0 4 0 8 ng l progesterone eqs surprisingly weak progestagenic activities at 0 03 and 0 04 ng l org 2058 eqs occurred twice in upstream but not in downstream surface waters at the české budějovice and bratislava petržalka sampling sites to sum up czech and slovak surface waters did not seem to be seriously affected by progestagenic activity from municipal wwtp discharges in most cases only once did the progestagenic activity persist in surface water 50 m downstream and then at a concentration of 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs such concentration is approximately equivalent to 0 8 ng l of progesterone the highest reported concentration of progestagenic activity has been as high as 4 5 ng l org 2058 eqs in a netherlands stream van der linden et al 2008 anti progestagenic activities were detected in all six influents and at three out of six investigated wwtp effluents with concentrations ranging between 2 63 and 83 ng l mifepristone eqs median 6 97 ng l mifepristone eqs and 0 77 to 1 01 ng l mifepristone eqs median 0 89 ng l mifepristone eqs respectively strong anti progestagenic activities in effluent and surface water up to 31 5 and 121 μg l mifepristone eqs respectively had previously been detected in china rao et al 2014 potent anti progestagenic activities up to 32 μg l mifepristone eqs were also reported in australian surface water scott et al 2014 somewhat weaker anti progestagenic activities were found in france with maximal concentration of 3 8 ng l mifepristone eqs bellet et al 2012 high anti progestagenic loads detected at all six studied influents were completely or significantly removed during the treatment process in the case of effluents at wwtp tábor klokoty and wwtp bratislava petržalka anti progestagenic activities co occurred with progestagenic agonistic activities no anti progestagenic activity has been found in surface water samples tables 1 and 2 3 4

table 3 and table s6 might be attributed either to the presence of unknown compounds or to synergy between compounds table 3 when anti progestagenic activities suppress the signal of agonists the chem teqs are higher than the bio teqs tables 1 and 2 this phenomenon is known as masking effect creusot et al 2014 ihara et al 2014 weiss et al 2009 all influent samples exhibited masking effects while among wwtp effluents only those at tábor klokoty and bratislava petržalka were observed to have masking effects tables 1 and 2 additionally contributions of the individual compounds to bio teqs in effluents and surface waters were estimated table 3 in effluents medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone were the main contributors to progestagenic activities in two out of six studied wwtp effluents interestingly progesterone was the greatest contributor in those effluents where masking effects were observed it is noteworthy that the main contributors to progestagenic activity were progesterone derivatives cyproterone acetate medroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate while there was only one contributing testosterone dienogest and one spironolactone drospirenone derivative to date only one study has described a contribution of progestins to progestagenic activities in that case it was found that a single progestin levonorgestrel can contribute as much as approximately 50 to progestagenic activities in surface water creusot et al 2014 regarding surface waters progestins contributed as much as 83 to overall progestagenic activities there was only one case in which progestagenic activity was detectable in surface water contaminated with progestins the recipient of effluent from wwtp prachatice the živný brook manifested progestagenic activities of 0 06 ng l org 2058 eqs which is equivalent to almost 1 ng l of progesterone this can be attributed to the fact that živný brook is a small stream and so the dilution is less than in the other studied recipients moreover we revealed that progesterone was responsible for 45 of progestagenic activity upstream but only for 28 downstream from wwtp prachatice this indicates discharging of some unknown pr active compounds in the effluent co occurrence of progestagenic activity 0 04 ng l org 2058 eqs and the natural progestin progesterone 0 5 ng l has also been recorded upstream from wwtp bratislava petržalka and progesterone was responsible for most of the progestagenic activity 83 in the present study we revealed only one substance contributing to anti progestagenic activity of wastewater and that was mifepristone in influent of wwtp české budějovice it was responsible however for only 7 8 of detected mifepristone eq as no sprm was revealed in effluents and surface waters the causative anti progestagenic compounds remained unknown we can speculate that it might originate from various industrial by products and compounds included in personal care products such as uv filters or polycyclic musks that are present in the aquatic environment and known to possess anti progestagenic activities hamers et al 2006 schreurs et al 2005 3 5 potential adverse effects in aquatic animals of the three compounds dienogest megestrol acetate and progesterone that occurred most frequently in effluents effects on aquatic animals only of progesterone are reported in the literature kumar et al 2015 the lowest observed effect concentration loec for progesterone in fish has been reported to be as low as 2 ng l zucchi et al 2012 which amount was exceeded in effluent of wwtp bratislava petržalka and is quite close to the concentration of 1 2 ng l detected even in surface water downstream from this wwtp among the compounds detected less frequently in effluents cyproterone acetate drospirenone and medroxyprogesterone acetate only the concentration of cyproterone acetate 0 5 ng l was close to its loec value reported by sharpe et al 2004 to be 1 ng l medroxyprogesterone acetate which was detected twice and drospirenone which was found once have loecs zhao et al 2015 zucchi et al 2014 much higher than the respective concentrations in effluents if however the compounds occur in the water together they may act in synergy and their loec values can then be significantly lower than determined under laboratory conditions zhao et al 2015 describe such a synergy in the case of dydrogesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate particular attention should be devoted to medroxyprogesterone which was the only synthetic progestin detected in surface water unfortunately there are no toxicological data available for this compound progestins have been found to be very weak drospirenone gestodene and progesterone or non agonists e g levonorgestrel or etonogestrel of pr in fish bain et al 2015 nevertheless some of them do considerably transactivate fish androgen receptor bain et al 2015 ellestad et al 2014 the mode of action in fish is likely different from what we know in humans kumar et al 2015 and using pr calux which is based on human pr may not be appropriate regarding aquatic vertebrates activity detected by pr calux assay seems to be a better risk indicator for amphibians than for fish as amphibian pr is believed to have high amino acids sequence similarity within the hormone binding domain with pr in humans bayaa et al 2000 moreover adverse effects of exposure to progesterone and synthetic progestins in amphibians seem to be similar to the effects in higher vertebrates including humans kvarnryd et al 2011 säfholm et al 2014 2016 4 conclusions results of the present study show that synthetic progestins together with progesterone constitute the majority of causative agents of progestagenic activity in municipal wwtp effluents with medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate and progesterone being the most important of the progestins that occurred most frequently in water only four have been tested on aquatic vertebrates even in these cases knowledge as to their possible adverse effects is very limited although strong anti progestagenic activities were detected in two effluents no causative agents were revealed despite that anti progestagenic activities have been detected by various authors and were detected also in this study in vivo anti progestagenic effects on aquatic biota are practically not

19622,many studies have quantified pharmaceuticals in the environment few however have incorporated detailed temporal and spatial variability due to associated costs in terms of time and materials here we target 33 physico chemically diverse pharmaceuticals in a spatiotemporal exposure study into the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater system and the rivers ouse and foss two diverse river systems in the city of york uk removal rates in two of the wwtps sampled a conventional activated sludge cas and trickling filter plant ranged from not eliminated carbamazepine to 99 paracetamol data comparisons indicate that pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally in part due to variability in prescribing practices hydrology wastewater management and urbanisation and that select annual median pharmaceutical concentrations observed in this study were higher than those previously observed in the european union and asia thus far significant spatial variability was found between all sites in both river systems while seasonal variability was significant for 86 and 50 of compounds in the river foss and ouse respectively seasonal variations in flow in stream attenuation usage and septic effluent releases are suspected drivers behind some of the observed temporal exposure variability when the data were used to evaluate a simple environmental exposure model for pharmaceuticals mean ratios of predicted environmental concentrations pecs obtained using the model to measured environmental concentrations mecs were 0 51 and 0 04 for the river foss and river ouse respectively such pec mec ratios indicate that the model underestimates actual concentrations in both river systems but to a much greater extent in the larger river ouse graphical abstract image 1 keywords lc ms ms surface water wastewater seasonal exposure predicted environmental concentration 1 introduction determining pharmaceutical exposures in environmental matrices has become a substantial area of research since the 1990s daughton 2016 the presence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater systems has now been documented globally with research especially focused in europe and north america aus der beek et al 2016 pharmaceuticals primarily enter the environment through patient use when an unmetabolised fraction is excreted and subsequently passes through wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are typically not designed to remove such organic contaminants luo et al 2014 consequently wwtps are significant sources of pharmaceuticals to the environment lindholm lehto et al 2016 a recent study of united kingdom uk wwtps estimated that 13 of effluent discharges could pose risks to the receiving environment regarding pharmaceutical exposures comber et al 2018 removal rates are highly variable between treatment types kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 seasons golovko et al 2014 and even within treatment plants themselves verlicchi et al 2012 moreover removal rates have only been estimated for a small fraction of the total number of pharmaceuticals in use boxall et al 2014 and only a few studies have reported wwtp removals in the uk specifically comber et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 2008 wwtp removal rates are valuable parameters and their inclusion in occurrence modelling substantially improves the accuracy of pharmaceutical exposure predictions burns et al 2017 verlicchi et al 2014 the potential for and extent of effects posed by pharmaceutical exposure to non target organisms such as fish or invertebrates is largely unknown vasquez et al 2014 however there is mounting evidence that select pharmaceuticals are having deleterious effects at environmentally relevant i e real world concentrations examples of documented effects at environmentally relevant concentrations include antidepressants causing behavioural changes in fish fluoxetine mccallum et al 2017 disruption during early development venlafaxine thompson et al 2017 the equivalent of human side effects from exposure to the anti diabetic drug metformin niemuth et al 2015 or the feminization of wild fish populations downstream of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in france sanchez et al 2011 it is therefore important to characterise the source and fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment to aid in risk assessment as approaches evaluating potential adverse effect concentrations emerge to adequately characterise the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment robust monitoring campaigns which include seasonal or year long sampling covering a range of compounds at a reasonable spatial resolution are required however only a small number of spatiotemporal exposure studies have been performed that meet these criteria baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 daneshvar et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 paíga et al 2016 these exposure studies are extremely valuable as they provide detailed information which can be related back to the myriad of factors many varying both seasonally and temporally that influence environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals including hydrology kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 wwtp removal efficiency silva et al 2014 pharmaceutical usage sun et al 2014 and in stream removal processes e g biodegradation and sorption to sediment daneshvar et al 2010 camacho munoz et al 2010 moreno gonzález et al 2014 in combination the impact of these processes on pharmaceutical exposure and fate is largely unknown but if better defined could improve exposure prediction approaches and offer greater confidence in terms of exposure when evaluating risks that pharmaceuticals may pose to the environment recently a handful of aqueous rapid pharmaceutical determination high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms methods have been developed that achieve comparable limits of detection lods to those including sample pre concentration or clean up anumol et al 2015 boix et al 2015 campos mãnas et al 2017 furlong et al 2014 oliveira et al 2015 such methods involve utilising larger than normal injection volumes 100 μl to increase the likelihood of detection petrie et al 2016 removal of the extraction step reduces sample preparation time and can increase the number of samples that can be processed highly beneficial to large spatiotemporal exposure campaigns a significant analytical problem arising during pharmaceutical quantification is matrix effects typically mass spectrometric ionisation enhancement or suppression the presence of background interferences in dirty matrices e g streams wwtp effluent etc can co elute with target analytes and impair quantification past the point of suitability petrović et al 2005 several approaches have been attempted to reduce matrix effects including sample pre concentration and clean up to help isolate target pharmaceuticals van de steene et al 2006 such pre concentration however is difficult to optimise time consuming costly and may also concentrate interfering analytes thus unintentionally increasing matrix effects yu et al 2012 matrix interferences have been reported to be comparatively lower for rapid determination methods than more costly and laborious sample pre concentration clean up methods anumol et al 2015 in this study which was performed in the frame of the innovative medicines initiative ipie project on intelligent assessment of pharmaceuticals in the environment we validate and apply a rapid determination aqueous hplc ms ms method for the quantification of 33 physico chemically diverse pharmaceuticals to a year long surface water exposure campaign monitoring was conducted during 2016 at 11 sites along the urbanised and larger river ouse and smaller more rural river foss which converge within the city of york uk fig 1 the monthly sampling design provided good temporal resolution while unparalleled spatial resolution was achieved in the two contrasting river systems in addition influent and effluent samples from two of the wwtps that serve the city were collected when possible and removal efficiencies estimated predicted exposure concentrations pecs were calculated for both rivers using a simple model and the model was then evaluated against annually averaged measured environmental concentrations mecs calculated from the monthly sampling data 2 methods 2 1 study area and sample collection 2 1 1 study compounds study compounds were selected based on those previously detected in the york river system during an initial scoping study in which 95 pharmaceuticals and degradation products were surveyed burns et al 2017 from these results 32 pharmaceuticals were selected due to either their known or expected presence an additional pharmaceutical gabapentin was also included in the study due to its high usage resistance to environmental degradation and ecotoxic potential herrmann et al 2015 2 1 2 study area the river ouse and river foss were chosen for the study as they flow through the city of york uk and converge downstream of the city centre fig 1 the two rivers represent differing levels of urbanisation and size to minimise potential variability grab water samples were collected from the network of 11 sampling sites in the same order and on approximately the same day and time each month from january to december 2016 site locations were strategically chosen based on their ease of access and position in relation to wwtp outfalls both rivers were sampled with sufficient spatial resolution to build concentration profiles and increase the probability of detecting transient pharmaceuticals in the absence of composite sampling techniques three wwtps serve the city within the sampling network fig 1 wwtp a is a trickling filter plant and serves a population of 18 600 wwtp b is a conventional activated sludge cas facility serving a population of 27 900 while wwtp c is a surplus activated sludge sas plant serving a population of 180 500 sampling site and wwtp characteristics along with dates of sampling are detailed in the supplementary material tables s1 and s2 2 1 3 sample collection all samples collected were subject to the same sampling protocol at each site three 1 l field replicates were collected from the centroid of flow when possible sampling sites had been previously determined to be well mixed therefore sampling in a single location was deemed appropriate supplementary material fig s1 for each field replicate a 10 ml aliquot was drawn into a 24 ml disposable syringe and filtered through a primed 0 7 μm glass fibre filter gf f whatman inc into an amber glass vial and immediately frozen in the field using dry ice to demonstrate that field filtration and collection did not contaminate samples three field blanks per sampling visit were collected hplc grade water was brought to the field filtered and prepared identically to field samples samples were then returned to the laboratory and stored at 18 c until analysis which occurred within seven days the concentration reported for each sample per site is the median of the three field replicates collected the filtering of samples in the field is beneficial as it removes particulates which can extend hplc column life reduce instrument maintenance as well as remove bacteria associated with particulates that could facilitate analyte degradation there is a possibility that analytes could be retained on the filter however pharmaceutical filtration studies including 26 compounds acids bases and amphoteres ranging in hydrophobicity logkow 2 3 to 6 3 suggest these losses will be insignificant 5 mompelat et al 2013 thus an assessment of filter losses has not been repeated here 2 2 high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry a thermo scientific tsq endura ms operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode interfaced with an easy max ng heated electrospray source operating in positive mode was used for pharmaceutical detection two transitions were monitored for each analyte and the m z and collision energy optimised using the thermo tune 2 0 software summarised in the supplementary material table s3 chromatographic separation was achieved with a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc thermo scientific equipped with a 100 μl sample injection loop and autosampler maintained at 4 c mobile phase a consisted of hplc grade water amended with 12 ml of 1 m formic acid and 10 ml of 1 m ammonium hydroxide for a total volume of 1 l and mobile phase b was 100 methanol furlong et al 2014 the chromatographic conditions and program are reported in the supplementary material table s4 internal standard is calibration was used to quantify the pharmaceuticals in the method described for reasons of expense and availability not all pharmaceuticals had a corresponding isotopically labelled internal standard ilis supplementary material table s3 in these cases atrazine d5 was used and has been previously determined suitable for this role furlong et al 2014 samples were fully thawed and a 995 μl aliquot pipetted into a 1 5 ml lc vial and a 5 μl spike of is solution 80 ng l added samples were immediately analysed after preparation peak detection criteria were in accordance with commission decision 2002 657 ec european commission 2002 due to analytical complications fexofenadine could not be quantified in the april surface water samples further details of peak qualification and quantitation are provided in the supplementary material the use of ilis is a good strategy to compensate for matrix effects stüber and reemtsma 2004 this is not a perfect solution as matrix effects can still influence quantification possibly due to a slight difference in retention time t r between the ilis and target analyte resulting in differing ionisation efficiencies wang et al 2007 therefore sample matrix spikes were routinely prepared and analysed with all sample batches to provide an indication of the presence of interferences which cause signal suppression enhancement and could impact quantification in this study acceptable matrix recovery was considered to be 70 120 in accordance with previously published methods boix et al 2015 usepa 2016 furlong et al 2014 matrix recovery falling outside this range indicates signal suppression enhancement could be occurring and samples should quantitatively be interpreted with caution at least three matrix spike samples from different sampling sites were prepared per analytical batch to monitor for matrix effects throughout the sampling campaign as the sample matrices are heterogenous and likely to vary temporally surface water matrix spikes were prepared by spiking 20 μl of 80 ng l or 200 ng l calibration solution into a sample replicate with 5 μl of is solution the much higher ambient concentration of pharmaceuticals in wwtp influent and effluent required the matrix spike samples to be prepared at a higher concentration 4000 ng l matrix recovery was calculated by subtracting the ambient sample concentration and dividing by the concentration spiked with each sample batch at least three calibration check samples ccss were prepared to monitor accuracy throughout the analytical batch injected every 10 samples these ccss were prepared to a concentration of 80 ng l by pipetting 20 μl of the relevant calibration solution into 975 μl of hplc grade water and spiked with 5 μl of is solution at the end of each batch a 4 ng l calibration solution spike prepared similarly was also injected the accuracy of these ccss was required to be within 20 or affected samples were re analysed furlong et al 2014 usepa 2016 this formed part of a rigorous quality control plan which was followed during environmental sample analysis using a series of sample matrix spikes calibration solution spikes field blanks and laboratory blanks randomly dispersed throughout analytical batches further detail of quality control how these samples were prepared and results are reported in the supplementary material 2 3 analytical method validation method validation included an assessment of precision inter and intra day limits of detection limits of quantification and recovery from all studied matrices the methods and results with which each of these parameters were assessed are reported in the supplementary material 2 4 wwtp removal efficiency due to access restrictions 24 h composite samples for influent and effluent could only be collected once from wwtp a and b during summer 2016 supplementary material table s2 only grab samples which are unsuitable for estimating removals could be collected from wwtp c wwtp removal efficiency was estimated when appropriate for wwtp a and b based on mean influent and effluent concentrations according to equation 1 in this context removal is the change in concentration between influent and effluent which does not represent true removal but rather partitioning to the solid phase and or the formation of transformation products negative removals can occur potentially due to sampling limitations e g longer than 24 h hydraulic sludge retention time ort et al 2010 from the conversion of conjugated metabolites back to the parent compound during treatment verlicchi et al 2012 or desorption from sludge during secondary treatment blair et al 2015 1 r e m o v a l 1 e f f l u e n t i n f l u e n t x 100 2 5 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using graphpad prism graphpad software 2017 to use statistical tests when non detects were present data substitution according to equation 2 was undertaken this approach was suggested to be appropriate for left censoring of up to 40 of a dataset antweiler 2015 if the non detect frequency for a compound was greater than 40 it was not included in statistical testing to determine whether significant spatial differences existed between sites pairwise t tests were conducted based on the monthly concentrations furlong et al 2017 to determine whether any analytes were seasonally variable in each river concentrations from sites f3 f4 and o3 o4 were grouped by season and a friedman s test followed by a dunn s multiple comparisons post hoc test was undertaken these sites were used in the seasonality test due to their downstream location in relation to wwtp a and b as well as their location in relation to environment agency flow gauges fig 1 as the flow recorded at these gauges was not representative of flow conditions at the remaining study sites center for ecology and hydrology 2016 2 s u b s t i t u t i o n 2 2 l o d 2 6 predicted environmental concentrations annual average mecs were compared to pecs to gauge the accuracy of simple exposure algorithms commonly used for the prioritisation of pharmaceuticals and for risk assessment burns et al 2017 local annual pharmaceutical usage data were obtained from the national health service business authority national health service 2016 while wastewater generation was assumed to be 200 l person day european medicines agency 2006 experimental wwtp removal rates eqn 1 were used with river specific dilution factors based on the average flow from sampling days to generate a pec for both rivers pec calculations were based on the approach suggested by the european medicines agency 2006 parameters and equations used to predict the pecs are provided in the supplementary material table s6 3 results discussion 3 1 method performance and quality control the method was determined to be sufficiently reproducible as assessed by the relative standard deviation of multiple injections n 8 during 5 5 rsd and across 7 5 rsd analysis days according to usepa 2016 guidelines and boix et al 2015 where an rsd 20 above the loq i e 80 ng l is desirable the limits of detections lod ranged from 0 9 ng l carbamazepine to 12 4 ng l gabapentin and an lod 10 ng l was achieved for 91 of analytes table s5 there were no quantifiable concentrations of any of the target pharmaceuticals in field blanks collected routinely throughout the monitoring campaign routine matrix spikes in surface water fell within the acceptable 70 120 recovery range for concentrations of 80 and 200 ng l indicating that throughout the sample analysis quantification was not unacceptably impaired due to matrix effects fig 2 matrix effects were observed in wwtp effluent and influent a phenomenon also reported by others and suggested to be due to the presence of a greater proportion of chemical species that can affect consistent ionisation in comparison to surface water boix et al 2015 oliveira et al 2015 in effluent 13 and in influent 19 of analytes fell outside the acceptable matrix signal response identified in figs 2 and 3 signal enhancement was most prominent for diphenhydramine in both influent and effluent 442 and 375 respectively while metformin 214 and tramadol 156 also exhibited significant signal enhancement in influent in this study a slight shift in relative t r of the analyte with respect to its ilis was observed in wwtp influent and effluent in comparison to surface water which in addition to it containing a larger number of chemical constituents could help explain why matrix effects were not well compensated for all analytes using isotopically labelled internal standards wwtp influent and effluent matrix spikes indicate that caution is needed when interpreting quantitative results and removal efficiencies due to significant matrix effects while matrix spikes in surface water indicate that matrix effects are sufficiently compensated for by the internal standards 3 2 pharmaceuticals in wwtps the highest summed pharmaceutical concentrations in influent were observed in samples from wwtp b while highest summed concentrations in effluent were observed in samples taken at wwtp a paracetamol had the highest concentration in all wwtp influents 282319 185878 and 116810 ng l at wwtp b a and c respectively in effluent gabapentin had the highest concentration 8541 ng l at wwtp c followed by metformin 6111 ng l at wwtp a and fexofenadine 2094 ng l in effluent at wwtp c seven pharmaceuticals diphenhydramine norethisterone oseltamivir raloxifene sertraline triamterene and verapamil were not detected in any wwtp sample average concentration and standard deviation sd of wwtp influent and effluent samples are reported in the supplementary material table s10 in a global review of pharmaceuticals in wwtps verlicchi et al 2012 reported influent concentrations for many compounds also observed in the wwtp samples in this study codeine paracetamol gabapentin hydrocodone tramadol erythromycin trimethoprim diltiazem atenolol propranolol carbamazepine gabapentin cimetidine and ranitidine influent concentrations all fell within the ranges reported by verlicchi et al 2012 while concentrations of amitriptyline were an order of magnitude lower a study of effluents in the european union eu reported average concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those determined here for tramadol codeine citalopram fexofenadine diltiazem ranitidine and amitriptyline while effluent concentrations were similar for venlafaxine trimethoprim carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in the york samples loos et al 2013 the estimated removal efficiency in each wwtp is presented for all detected analytes in fig 3 the median removal efficiency was estimated to be 75 in wwtp a and 38 in wwtp b paracetamol was the analyte most efficiently removed at both treatment plants 99 while removals greater than 75 were reported for gabapentin ranitidine atenolol sulfamethoxazole metformin and codeine despite being a trickling filter plant which might be expected to have poorer pharmaceutical removal than cas systems kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 wwtp a had similar and even greater removals for select compounds i e carbamazepine diltiazem citalopram erythromycin cimetidine and ranitidine in the uk specifically similar removals were reported previously kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 for trimethoprim amitriptyline diltiazem cimetidine gabapentin and paracetamol while sulfamethoxazole erythromycin codeine tramadol carbamazepine propranolol and ranitidine were in general more efficiently removed for this study wwtps with similar treatment capabilities were also studied previously in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in comparison with results reported here wwtp removal rates were highly variable despite operating in the same region and employing similar treatments a conclusion also observed in other regions verlicchi et al 2012 the single sampling event in the wwtps is limited however these estimates are still useful for comparative purposes for example sitagliptin removal efficiency 25 40 has not been previously reported to the authors knowledge therefore while wwtps are significant sources of pharmaceuticals entering the environment analysis of wwtp removal efficiencies i e reduction in parent pharmaceutical concentration from influent to effluent as documented in this and previously published studies demonstrate that wwtps are generally decreasing the aquatic environmental burden by significantly reducing certain parent pharmaceutical concentrations not considering degradates or transformation products for many of the compounds studied 3 3 pharmaceuticals in surface water of the 33 pharmaceuticals monitored 21 were detected in all 12 months in samples from the river foss three compounds oxazepam verapamil and triamterene were not detected in any foss sample the remaining nine study compounds diazepam diphenhydramine loratadine norethisterone oseltamivir raloxifene sulfamethoxazole sertraline and temazepam were sporadically detected from month to month in this river in comparison ten compounds carbamazepine codeine fexofenadine gabapentin hydrocodone lidocaine metformin paracetamol tramadol and trimethoprim were detected in all 12 months in the river ouse samples eight compounds were not detected in any ouse sample diazepam loratadine oseltamivir oxazepam raloxifene sulfamethoxazole triamterene and verapamil the highest five annual median concentrations followed the same trend in both rivers metformin gabapentin paracetamol fexofenadine tramadol indicating that usage patterns wwtp removal and environmental fate for the most prevalent pharmaceuticals are similar in these two systems the range detection frequency and annual median for each pharmaceutical in both river systems is reported in tables 1 and 2 monthly total pharmaceutical concentrations at each sampling site are presented in figs 4 and 5 these concentration figures provide a spatiotemporal overview of the relationship between sampling sites rivers and wwtps serving the city monthly summed concentrations are higher in the river foss e g above 2000 ng l at sites downstream of the wwtp in comparison to the river ouse where most monthly summed concentrations are below 1000 ng l despite the wwtps on the river ouse serving a larger population this is due to greater dilution of discharged effluent in the ouse for example flow ranged from 9 2 to 233 m3 s in the ouse compared with 0 0096 1 68 m3 s in the foss on sampling days fig 1 for the sites immediately downstream of the wwtps o3 o6 and f2 the months with the lowest flows july and june yielded both the most analytes and the highest concentrations thus concentrations appear to be inversely proportional to flow at site f2 similarly to observations reported previously kolpin et al 2004 the trend was not continued moving downstream in the river foss sites f3 f5 potentially due to pharmaceutical losses stemming from dilution or in stream removal processes such as biodegradation or sorption to sediment moreno gonzález et al 2014 or due to pharmaceutical contributions from domestic septic systems carmona et al 2014 and or inputs from combined sewer overflows cso phillips et al 2012 in the foss a substantial spike downstream of f2 in paracetamol 9822 ng l was detected in the march sampling along with less intense spikes from other pharmaceuticals such as metformin 2592 ng l these observations may be explained by local septic tank effluent entering the river downstream of the f2 site captured during the march sampling period paracetamol can be 99 removed and metformin 93 in conventional water treatment fig 3 therefore the spike in march concentrations might be explained by releases of septic effluent james et al 2016 james et al 2016 reported paracetamol concentrations of 5000 ng l at a septic effluent impacted site and identified it as a possible tracer of septic system contamination combined sewer overflow cso releases could provide an alternative explanation for the concentration spike phillips et al 2012 as a cso is located just upstream of the f3 site low rainfall university of york 2018 prior to sampling suggest csos would not likely be in operation therefore septic effluent releases provide a plausible explanation concentrations in the river ouse varied less month to month than in the foss and a relationship with flow was less clear with march and may in general having slightly greater total concentrations march has also been reported to have the highest monthly concentration in recent temporal studies padhye et al 2014 sun et al 2014 sun et al 2014 suggested march coincided with a spike in pharmaceutical usage and reduced wwtp removal capacity this may explain the slightly higher concentrations observed in the river ouse at sites upstream of the foss confluence o1 o4 while the spike in may river ouse coincides with decreased river flow fig 1 metformin a type ii diabetes drug had the highest annual median concentration 1117 and 237 ng l in the foss and ouse respectively followed by gabapentin anti convulsant 843 and 230 ng l foss and ouse respectively and paracetamol analgesic 209 and 77 6 ng l foss and ouse respectively this trend is different from those observed in previous temporal exposure campaigns studying similar compounds throughout the world for example in china zhang et al 2015 studied urbanized rivers and found antibiotics to be the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals they did however report atenolol as having one of the highest annual median concentrations 53 ng l which is similar to the median concentration for this compound reported at site f2 55 4 ng l in the current study in spain camacho muñoz et al 2010 reported propranolol most frequently detected in surface water with a higher average concentration 80 ng l than the median concentration observed in this study 20 1 ng l in portugal paíga et al 2016 reported carbamazepine the most frequently detected pharmaceutical with an annual median of 31 7 ng l while other similarly studied compounds citalopram and venlafaxine had annual median concentrations of 0 86 and 40 1 ng l respectively and trimethoprim was not detected in the river foss the highest annual median concentrations for carbamazepine citalopram and venlafaxine was 66 15 4 and 21 ng l respectively while trimethoprim was detected in 100 of samples with an annual median of 30 ng l in sweden carbamazepine was also most frequently detected and at a higher annual mean than observed in york 204 ng l versus 66 ng l in the river foss while atenolol concentration was similar to that reported here 60 2 ng l compared to 55 4 ng l daneshvar et al 2010 in a similar temporal study in wales tramadol and gabapentin had the highest annual median concentrations 968 ng l and 227 ng l respectively kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 median concentrations of gabapentin tramadol trimethoprim paracetamol carbamazepine cimetidine and atenolol in wales were higher than we saw in york while concentrations of diltiazem atenolol sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin concentrations in the river foss were lower than observed in wales kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 these comparisons suggest that annual pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally in part due to variability in prescribing practices hydrology wastewater management and the degree of urbanisation in addition certain annual median concentrations of pharmaceuticals observed in this study are higher than those previously observed in the european union and asia 3 3 1 spatial trends the spatial trends for both rivers are presented in fig 6 significant differences between a site and the adjacent downstream site are also noted spatial trends are apparent in both rivers the greatest number of significant differences p 0 05 were found between the sites upstream and downstream of the wwtps i e f1 f2 o3 o4 and o5 o6 fig 6 in addition significant differences increased when comparing to sites further downstream wwtps make a significant contribution to pharmaceutical concentrations in both river systems however upstream sources of certain pharmaceuticals exist in both rivers as significance was not achieved for cimetidine in the foss and paracetamol codeine trimethoprim and atenolol in the ouse there are wwtps along the river nidd fig 5 and upstream of sites o1 and f1 10 km demonstrating that pharmaceuticals from upstream sources are transported into the city concentrations are generally highest immediately downstream of the wwtps and decreased moving to downstream sites evidenced by difference in height i e concentration between the bars from each site fig 6 similarly to observations in previous studies kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 the decrease in concentrations moving downstream is variable between compounds indicating that in stream attenuation is compound specific for example carbamazepine concentrations are similar between sites downstream of the wwtp in the river foss i e f2 f5 while over the same stretch of river concentrations of hydrocodone and citalopram decreased by 51 and 38 respectively fig 6 in the ouse all concentrations decreased slightly from o3 to o4 however there was a slight increase occurring at o5 likely due to the confluence with the river foss and again at o6 which is downstream of wwtp c in the river foss carbamazepine had only a single significant spatial difference between the site upstream of wwtp a discharge site f1 and the sites downstream of the discharge carbamazepine has been reported to be resistant to biodegradation and stable in the environment moreno gonzález et al 2014 in the river ouse all pharmaceuticals exhibited spatially significant trends carbamazepine was significantly different between each site downstream of wwtp b tested i e o3 to o6 since this did not occur in the river foss over a similar distance 13 3 km between sites f2 and f5 versus 11 km between sites o3 and o6 and the literature agrees that carbamazepine is resistant to biotransformation a combination of dilution e g urban drainage runoff and other pharmaceutical sources i e river foss moving downstream could be a plausible explanation overall these results indicate that a wide variety of environmental processes such as dilution and in stream degradation are operating to differing extents in neighbouring rivers leading to different spatial patterns in pharmaceutical concentrations between sampling sites for example the reduction in concentrations moving downstream in the river foss may be symptomatic of in stream removal processes such as photolysis or microbial degradation daneshvar et al 2010 while fluctuating concentrations in the river ouse could be due to a complex dynamic between dilution and other pharmaceutical sources i e tributaries urban drainage while natural removal processes potentially operating in the foss may be masked or occur to a lesser extent in the larger ouse system 3 3 2 seasonal variability temporal variability between the seasons fig 7 is presented similarly to the approach for displaying spatial variability between sampling sites fig 6 seasonal differences in pharmaceutical concentrations exist in the two river systems especially in the river foss in both rivers the lowest concentrations correspond with winter the season which had the highest average flow 2 7 times higher than the next highest season autumn conversely the highest mass loads occur in winter 1 4 times higher than the next highest season spring lower concentrations in winter have also been reported previously baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 however several studies report higher concentrations in winter kot wasik et al 2016 lindholm lehto et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in addition the extent of concentration variability between seasons differs between compounds which could be due to seasonal patterns in usage sun et al 2014 or seasonal variability in photodegradation or biodegradation of which both processes can peak in summer thus having a greater impact on more readily biodegradable compounds lindholm lehto et al 2016 in general autumn was the season with the second highest median concentrations except for paracetamol where highest median values were observed during spring in both rivers this could be due to increased usage coinciding with symptomatic treatment of illnesses more common in spring such as colds vatovec et al 2016 in conjunction with lower flows than winter to determine whether concentrations between seasons were significant friedman s test was used for pharmaceuticals with sufficient detections concentrations of 17 compounds 86 were found to vary significantly by season in the river foss while amitriptyline codeine cimetidine metformin and ranitidine did not vary seasonally nine compounds 50 had significant seasonal differences in the river ouse atenolol carbamazepine codeine desvenlafaxine gabapentin lidocaine ranitidine sitagliptin and trimethoprim the reasons for temporal variations in pharmaceutical concentrations have varied between studies with several reporting flow as the major driver observing higher concentrations during times of low flow kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 kolpin et al 2004 others suggest higher pharmaceutical concentrations in winter months coincide with higher winter usage patterns sun et al 2014 or decreased biodegradation in winter moreno gonzález et al 2014 while others found no significant differences between sampled seasons camacho muñoz et al 2010 due to higher concentrations coinciding with low flow months in this study we also suggest that flow appears to be a major driver behind the observed seasonal variability in pharmaceutical concentrations in the current study the lack of significant seasonal differences found in the river ouse could be explained by a lower annual variability in flow on sampling days than the river foss i e two orders of magnitude versus three further detailed investigation into the drivers behind the pharmaceutical concentrations observed both temporally and spatially is required to differentiate between the possible explanations and could include comparing results with prescription data and flow and estimating the impact of in stream losses seasonally in different climates and in river hydrological properties e g depth and flow such analyses will be facilitated by the detailed pharmaceutical monitoring data reported in this study 3 4 comparisons of pecs and mecs the pec mec ratios for each compound for which it was possible to calculate an annual average mec are reported in fig 8 a ratio greater than 1 indicates pecs were higher than mecs and lower when less than 1 the pecs are severely underestimated in the ouse this may be due to pharmaceuticals being transported from upstream or problems with sewer connectivity within the sampling network not being accounted for in the simplistic pec calculation several studies have attempted to gauge the accuracy of pecs by calculating a ratio with mecs however the criterion for what constitutes accurate is variable across studies burns et al 2017 this assessment has been previously limited to a small number of compounds and based on a limited number of sampling events not representative of the annual average mec which the pec was designed to predict in this way we present novel findings that indicate when annual average mecs are calculated less hydrologically complex river systems where pharmaceutical sources are limited i e river foss pecs characterise annual exposure within a factor 2 for 41 of compounds in this study average factor 2 8 with no factor greater than 11 however paracetamol is an exception underestimated by a factor of 73 the usage estimate did not incorporate over the counter contributions therefore underestimates were not unexpected burns et al 2017 conversely the results from the river ouse indicate that major limitations are associated with this predictive approach all ratios were off by a factor of at least 7 average 27 and up to 139 which according to studies characterising the pec mec is outside an acceptable range verlicchi et al 2014 as the simple exposure model is routinely used for regulatory environmental risk assessment era of new pharmaceuticals our findings have important regulatory implications the predictions of exposure currently being used to assess new compounds are likely under or over estimating concentrations depending on the type of compound the use of a spatially referenced down the drain hydrological model such as lf2000 wqx williams et al 2012 or great er feijtel et al 1997 would likely result in improved predictions as these models have the capacity to incorporate inputs from upstream sources this is appropriate as many rivers in the region pass through multiple urbanised areas and thus are subject to multiple wwtp inputs in addition the hydrological aspect can incorporate contributions or dilutions from the confluence with other river systems work currently being performed in the ipie project involves the development of a spatially resolved model for european surface waters the high quality monitoring data presented in this study will be used to help evaluate this model our work also shows that inputs from other sources potentially septic effluent can be very important for some compounds at certain time of year the consideration of these direct inputs in the risk assessment process may therefore be warranted 4 conclusion a rapid determination hplc ms ms method for 33 pharmaceuticals was validated and applied in a 12 month spatiotemporal pharmaceutical exposure campaign wwtp removal efficiency was found to be similar between cas and trickling filter technology for the target pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical concentrations in two contrasting river systems that run through the city of york uk were found to vary significantly spatially and temporally with the greatest variation observed for paracetamol in the river foss ranging from not detected to over 9822 ng l temporal variations in concentration were less frequently observed in the larger river ouse potentially due to the lower variability in flow which could be an important driver behind pharmaceutical concentrations in the study system pec mec ratios indicated that compounds in both rivers were generally underestimated by commonly used simple predictive exposure algorithms in total 41 of pec mec ratios for the river foss data were within a factor of 2 while for the river ouse average ratios indicated predictions were off by a factor of 27 this

19622,many studies have quantified pharmaceuticals in the environment few however have incorporated detailed temporal and spatial variability due to associated costs in terms of time and materials here we target 33 physico chemically diverse pharmaceuticals in a spatiotemporal exposure study into the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater system and the rivers ouse and foss two diverse river systems in the city of york uk removal rates in two of the wwtps sampled a conventional activated sludge cas and trickling filter plant ranged from not eliminated carbamazepine to 99 paracetamol data comparisons indicate that pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally in part due to variability in prescribing practices hydrology wastewater management and urbanisation and that select annual median pharmaceutical concentrations observed in this study were higher than those previously observed in the european union and asia thus far significant spatial variability was found between all sites in both river systems while seasonal variability was significant for 86 and 50 of compounds in the river foss and ouse respectively seasonal variations in flow in stream attenuation usage and septic effluent releases are suspected drivers behind some of the observed temporal exposure variability when the data were used to evaluate a simple environmental exposure model for pharmaceuticals mean ratios of predicted environmental concentrations pecs obtained using the model to measured environmental concentrations mecs were 0 51 and 0 04 for the river foss and river ouse respectively such pec mec ratios indicate that the model underestimates actual concentrations in both river systems but to a much greater extent in the larger river ouse graphical abstract image 1 keywords lc ms ms surface water wastewater seasonal exposure predicted environmental concentration 1 introduction determining pharmaceutical exposures in environmental matrices has become a substantial area of research since the 1990s daughton 2016 the presence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater systems has now been documented globally with research especially focused in europe and north america aus der beek et al 2016 pharmaceuticals primarily enter the environment through patient use when an unmetabolised fraction is excreted and subsequently passes through wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are typically not designed to remove such organic contaminants luo et al 2014 consequently wwtps are significant sources of pharmaceuticals to the environment lindholm lehto et al 2016 a recent study of united kingdom uk wwtps estimated that 13 of effluent discharges could pose risks to the receiving environment regarding pharmaceutical exposures comber et al 2018 removal rates are highly variable between treatment types kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 luo et al 2014 seasons golovko et al 2014 and even within treatment plants themselves verlicchi et al 2012 moreover removal rates have only been estimated for a small fraction of the total number of pharmaceuticals in use boxall et al 2014 and only a few studies have reported wwtp removals in the uk specifically comber et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 2008 wwtp removal rates are valuable parameters and their inclusion in occurrence modelling substantially improves the accuracy of pharmaceutical exposure predictions burns et al 2017 verlicchi et al 2014 the potential for and extent of effects posed by pharmaceutical exposure to non target organisms such as fish or invertebrates is largely unknown vasquez et al 2014 however there is mounting evidence that select pharmaceuticals are having deleterious effects at environmentally relevant i e real world concentrations examples of documented effects at environmentally relevant concentrations include antidepressants causing behavioural changes in fish fluoxetine mccallum et al 2017 disruption during early development venlafaxine thompson et al 2017 the equivalent of human side effects from exposure to the anti diabetic drug metformin niemuth et al 2015 or the feminization of wild fish populations downstream of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in france sanchez et al 2011 it is therefore important to characterise the source and fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment to aid in risk assessment as approaches evaluating potential adverse effect concentrations emerge to adequately characterise the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment robust monitoring campaigns which include seasonal or year long sampling covering a range of compounds at a reasonable spatial resolution are required however only a small number of spatiotemporal exposure studies have been performed that meet these criteria baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 daneshvar et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 paíga et al 2016 these exposure studies are extremely valuable as they provide detailed information which can be related back to the myriad of factors many varying both seasonally and temporally that influence environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals including hydrology kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 wwtp removal efficiency silva et al 2014 pharmaceutical usage sun et al 2014 and in stream removal processes e g biodegradation and sorption to sediment daneshvar et al 2010 camacho munoz et al 2010 moreno gonzález et al 2014 in combination the impact of these processes on pharmaceutical exposure and fate is largely unknown but if better defined could improve exposure prediction approaches and offer greater confidence in terms of exposure when evaluating risks that pharmaceuticals may pose to the environment recently a handful of aqueous rapid pharmaceutical determination high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms methods have been developed that achieve comparable limits of detection lods to those including sample pre concentration or clean up anumol et al 2015 boix et al 2015 campos mãnas et al 2017 furlong et al 2014 oliveira et al 2015 such methods involve utilising larger than normal injection volumes 100 μl to increase the likelihood of detection petrie et al 2016 removal of the extraction step reduces sample preparation time and can increase the number of samples that can be processed highly beneficial to large spatiotemporal exposure campaigns a significant analytical problem arising during pharmaceutical quantification is matrix effects typically mass spectrometric ionisation enhancement or suppression the presence of background interferences in dirty matrices e g streams wwtp effluent etc can co elute with target analytes and impair quantification past the point of suitability petrović et al 2005 several approaches have been attempted to reduce matrix effects including sample pre concentration and clean up to help isolate target pharmaceuticals van de steene et al 2006 such pre concentration however is difficult to optimise time consuming costly and may also concentrate interfering analytes thus unintentionally increasing matrix effects yu et al 2012 matrix interferences have been reported to be comparatively lower for rapid determination methods than more costly and laborious sample pre concentration clean up methods anumol et al 2015 in this study which was performed in the frame of the innovative medicines initiative ipie project on intelligent assessment of pharmaceuticals in the environment we validate and apply a rapid determination aqueous hplc ms ms method for the quantification of 33 physico chemically diverse pharmaceuticals to a year long surface water exposure campaign monitoring was conducted during 2016 at 11 sites along the urbanised and larger river ouse and smaller more rural river foss which converge within the city of york uk fig 1 the monthly sampling design provided good temporal resolution while unparalleled spatial resolution was achieved in the two contrasting river systems in addition influent and effluent samples from two of the wwtps that serve the city were collected when possible and removal efficiencies estimated predicted exposure concentrations pecs were calculated for both rivers using a simple model and the model was then evaluated against annually averaged measured environmental concentrations mecs calculated from the monthly sampling data 2 methods 2 1 study area and sample collection 2 1 1 study compounds study compounds were selected based on those previously detected in the york river system during an initial scoping study in which 95 pharmaceuticals and degradation products were surveyed burns et al 2017 from these results 32 pharmaceuticals were selected due to either their known or expected presence an additional pharmaceutical gabapentin was also included in the study due to its high usage resistance to environmental degradation and ecotoxic potential herrmann et al 2015 2 1 2 study area the river ouse and river foss were chosen for the study as they flow through the city of york uk and converge downstream of the city centre fig 1 the two rivers represent differing levels of urbanisation and size to minimise potential variability grab water samples were collected from the network of 11 sampling sites in the same order and on approximately the same day and time each month from january to december 2016 site locations were strategically chosen based on their ease of access and position in relation to wwtp outfalls both rivers were sampled with sufficient spatial resolution to build concentration profiles and increase the probability of detecting transient pharmaceuticals in the absence of composite sampling techniques three wwtps serve the city within the sampling network fig 1 wwtp a is a trickling filter plant and serves a population of 18 600 wwtp b is a conventional activated sludge cas facility serving a population of 27 900 while wwtp c is a surplus activated sludge sas plant serving a population of 180 500 sampling site and wwtp characteristics along with dates of sampling are detailed in the supplementary material tables s1 and s2 2 1 3 sample collection all samples collected were subject to the same sampling protocol at each site three 1 l field replicates were collected from the centroid of flow when possible sampling sites had been previously determined to be well mixed therefore sampling in a single location was deemed appropriate supplementary material fig s1 for each field replicate a 10 ml aliquot was drawn into a 24 ml disposable syringe and filtered through a primed 0 7 μm glass fibre filter gf f whatman inc into an amber glass vial and immediately frozen in the field using dry ice to demonstrate that field filtration and collection did not contaminate samples three field blanks per sampling visit were collected hplc grade water was brought to the field filtered and prepared identically to field samples samples were then returned to the laboratory and stored at 18 c until analysis which occurred within seven days the concentration reported for each sample per site is the median of the three field replicates collected the filtering of samples in the field is beneficial as it removes particulates which can extend hplc column life reduce instrument maintenance as well as remove bacteria associated with particulates that could facilitate analyte degradation there is a possibility that analytes could be retained on the filter however pharmaceutical filtration studies including 26 compounds acids bases and amphoteres ranging in hydrophobicity logkow 2 3 to 6 3 suggest these losses will be insignificant 5 mompelat et al 2013 thus an assessment of filter losses has not been repeated here 2 2 high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry a thermo scientific tsq endura ms operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode interfaced with an easy max ng heated electrospray source operating in positive mode was used for pharmaceutical detection two transitions were monitored for each analyte and the m z and collision energy optimised using the thermo tune 2 0 software summarised in the supplementary material table s3 chromatographic separation was achieved with a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc thermo scientific equipped with a 100 μl sample injection loop and autosampler maintained at 4 c mobile phase a consisted of hplc grade water amended with 12 ml of 1 m formic acid and 10 ml of 1 m ammonium hydroxide for a total volume of 1 l and mobile phase b was 100 methanol furlong et al 2014 the chromatographic conditions and program are reported in the supplementary material table s4 internal standard is calibration was used to quantify the pharmaceuticals in the method described for reasons of expense and availability not all pharmaceuticals had a corresponding isotopically labelled internal standard ilis supplementary material table s3 in these cases atrazine d5 was used and has been previously determined suitable for this role furlong et al 2014 samples were fully thawed and a 995 μl aliquot pipetted into a 1 5 ml lc vial and a 5 μl spike of is solution 80 ng l added samples were immediately analysed after preparation peak detection criteria were in accordance with commission decision 2002 657 ec european commission 2002 due to analytical complications fexofenadine could not be quantified in the april surface water samples further details of peak qualification and quantitation are provided in the supplementary material the use of ilis is a good strategy to compensate for matrix effects stüber and reemtsma 2004 this is not a perfect solution as matrix effects can still influence quantification possibly due to a slight difference in retention time t r between the ilis and target analyte resulting in differing ionisation efficiencies wang et al 2007 therefore sample matrix spikes were routinely prepared and analysed with all sample batches to provide an indication of the presence of interferences which cause signal suppression enhancement and could impact quantification in this study acceptable matrix recovery was considered to be 70 120 in accordance with previously published methods boix et al 2015 usepa 2016 furlong et al 2014 matrix recovery falling outside this range indicates signal suppression enhancement could be occurring and samples should quantitatively be interpreted with caution at least three matrix spike samples from different sampling sites were prepared per analytical batch to monitor for matrix effects throughout the sampling campaign as the sample matrices are heterogenous and likely to vary temporally surface water matrix spikes were prepared by spiking 20 μl of 80 ng l or 200 ng l calibration solution into a sample replicate with 5 μl of is solution the much higher ambient concentration of pharmaceuticals in wwtp influent and effluent required the matrix spike samples to be prepared at a higher concentration 4000 ng l matrix recovery was calculated by subtracting the ambient sample concentration and dividing by the concentration spiked with each sample batch at least three calibration check samples ccss were prepared to monitor accuracy throughout the analytical batch injected every 10 samples these ccss were prepared to a concentration of 80 ng l by pipetting 20 μl of the relevant calibration solution into 975 μl of hplc grade water and spiked with 5 μl of is solution at the end of each batch a 4 ng l calibration solution spike prepared similarly was also injected the accuracy of these ccss was required to be within 20 or affected samples were re analysed furlong et al 2014 usepa 2016 this formed part of a rigorous quality control plan which was followed during environmental sample analysis using a series of sample matrix spikes calibration solution spikes field blanks and laboratory blanks randomly dispersed throughout analytical batches further detail of quality control how these samples were prepared and results are reported in the supplementary material 2 3 analytical method validation method validation included an assessment of precision inter and intra day limits of detection limits of quantification and recovery from all studied matrices the methods and results with which each of these parameters were assessed are reported in the supplementary material 2 4 wwtp removal efficiency due to access restrictions 24 h composite samples for influent and effluent could only be collected once from wwtp a and b during summer 2016 supplementary material table s2 only grab samples which are unsuitable for estimating removals could be collected from wwtp c wwtp removal efficiency was estimated when appropriate for wwtp a and b based on mean influent and effluent concentrations according to equation 1 in this context removal is the change in concentration between influent and effluent which does not represent true removal but rather partitioning to the solid phase and or the formation of transformation products negative removals can occur potentially due to sampling limitations e g longer than 24 h hydraulic sludge retention time ort et al 2010 from the conversion of conjugated metabolites back to the parent compound during treatment verlicchi et al 2012 or desorption from sludge during secondary treatment blair et al 2015 1 r e m o v a l 1 e f f l u e n t i n f l u e n t x 100 2 5 statistical analysis data analysis was performed using graphpad prism graphpad software 2017 to use statistical tests when non detects were present data substitution according to equation 2 was undertaken this approach was suggested to be appropriate for left censoring of up to 40 of a dataset antweiler 2015 if the non detect frequency for a compound was greater than 40 it was not included in statistical testing to determine whether significant spatial differences existed between sites pairwise t tests were conducted based on the monthly concentrations furlong et al 2017 to determine whether any analytes were seasonally variable in each river concentrations from sites f3 f4 and o3 o4 were grouped by season and a friedman s test followed by a dunn s multiple comparisons post hoc test was undertaken these sites were used in the seasonality test due to their downstream location in relation to wwtp a and b as well as their location in relation to environment agency flow gauges fig 1 as the flow recorded at these gauges was not representative of flow conditions at the remaining study sites center for ecology and hydrology 2016 2 s u b s t i t u t i o n 2 2 l o d 2 6 predicted environmental concentrations annual average mecs were compared to pecs to gauge the accuracy of simple exposure algorithms commonly used for the prioritisation of pharmaceuticals and for risk assessment burns et al 2017 local annual pharmaceutical usage data were obtained from the national health service business authority national health service 2016 while wastewater generation was assumed to be 200 l person day european medicines agency 2006 experimental wwtp removal rates eqn 1 were used with river specific dilution factors based on the average flow from sampling days to generate a pec for both rivers pec calculations were based on the approach suggested by the european medicines agency 2006 parameters and equations used to predict the pecs are provided in the supplementary material table s6 3 results discussion 3 1 method performance and quality control the method was determined to be sufficiently reproducible as assessed by the relative standard deviation of multiple injections n 8 during 5 5 rsd and across 7 5 rsd analysis days according to usepa 2016 guidelines and boix et al 2015 where an rsd 20 above the loq i e 80 ng l is desirable the limits of detections lod ranged from 0 9 ng l carbamazepine to 12 4 ng l gabapentin and an lod 10 ng l was achieved for 91 of analytes table s5 there were no quantifiable concentrations of any of the target pharmaceuticals in field blanks collected routinely throughout the monitoring campaign routine matrix spikes in surface water fell within the acceptable 70 120 recovery range for concentrations of 80 and 200 ng l indicating that throughout the sample analysis quantification was not unacceptably impaired due to matrix effects fig 2 matrix effects were observed in wwtp effluent and influent a phenomenon also reported by others and suggested to be due to the presence of a greater proportion of chemical species that can affect consistent ionisation in comparison to surface water boix et al 2015 oliveira et al 2015 in effluent 13 and in influent 19 of analytes fell outside the acceptable matrix signal response identified in figs 2 and 3 signal enhancement was most prominent for diphenhydramine in both influent and effluent 442 and 375 respectively while metformin 214 and tramadol 156 also exhibited significant signal enhancement in influent in this study a slight shift in relative t r of the analyte with respect to its ilis was observed in wwtp influent and effluent in comparison to surface water which in addition to it containing a larger number of chemical constituents could help explain why matrix effects were not well compensated for all analytes using isotopically labelled internal standards wwtp influent and effluent matrix spikes indicate that caution is needed when interpreting quantitative results and removal efficiencies due to significant matrix effects while matrix spikes in surface water indicate that matrix effects are sufficiently compensated for by the internal standards 3 2 pharmaceuticals in wwtps the highest summed pharmaceutical concentrations in influent were observed in samples from wwtp b while highest summed concentrations in effluent were observed in samples taken at wwtp a paracetamol had the highest concentration in all wwtp influents 282319 185878 and 116810 ng l at wwtp b a and c respectively in effluent gabapentin had the highest concentration 8541 ng l at wwtp c followed by metformin 6111 ng l at wwtp a and fexofenadine 2094 ng l in effluent at wwtp c seven pharmaceuticals diphenhydramine norethisterone oseltamivir raloxifene sertraline triamterene and verapamil were not detected in any wwtp sample average concentration and standard deviation sd of wwtp influent and effluent samples are reported in the supplementary material table s10 in a global review of pharmaceuticals in wwtps verlicchi et al 2012 reported influent concentrations for many compounds also observed in the wwtp samples in this study codeine paracetamol gabapentin hydrocodone tramadol erythromycin trimethoprim diltiazem atenolol propranolol carbamazepine gabapentin cimetidine and ranitidine influent concentrations all fell within the ranges reported by verlicchi et al 2012 while concentrations of amitriptyline were an order of magnitude lower a study of effluents in the european union eu reported average concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those determined here for tramadol codeine citalopram fexofenadine diltiazem ranitidine and amitriptyline while effluent concentrations were similar for venlafaxine trimethoprim carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in the york samples loos et al 2013 the estimated removal efficiency in each wwtp is presented for all detected analytes in fig 3 the median removal efficiency was estimated to be 75 in wwtp a and 38 in wwtp b paracetamol was the analyte most efficiently removed at both treatment plants 99 while removals greater than 75 were reported for gabapentin ranitidine atenolol sulfamethoxazole metformin and codeine despite being a trickling filter plant which might be expected to have poorer pharmaceutical removal than cas systems kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 wwtp a had similar and even greater removals for select compounds i e carbamazepine diltiazem citalopram erythromycin cimetidine and ranitidine in the uk specifically similar removals were reported previously kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 for trimethoprim amitriptyline diltiazem cimetidine gabapentin and paracetamol while sulfamethoxazole erythromycin codeine tramadol carbamazepine propranolol and ranitidine were in general more efficiently removed for this study wwtps with similar treatment capabilities were also studied previously in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in comparison with results reported here wwtp removal rates were highly variable despite operating in the same region and employing similar treatments a conclusion also observed in other regions verlicchi et al 2012 the single sampling event in the wwtps is limited however these estimates are still useful for comparative purposes for example sitagliptin removal efficiency 25 40 has not been previously reported to the authors knowledge therefore while wwtps are significant sources of pharmaceuticals entering the environment analysis of wwtp removal efficiencies i e reduction in parent pharmaceutical concentration from influent to effluent as documented in this and previously published studies demonstrate that wwtps are generally decreasing the aquatic environmental burden by significantly reducing certain parent pharmaceutical concentrations not considering degradates or transformation products for many of the compounds studied 3 3 pharmaceuticals in surface water of the 33 pharmaceuticals monitored 21 were detected in all 12 months in samples from the river foss three compounds oxazepam verapamil and triamterene were not detected in any foss sample the remaining nine study compounds diazepam diphenhydramine loratadine norethisterone oseltamivir raloxifene sulfamethoxazole sertraline and temazepam were sporadically detected from month to month in this river in comparison ten compounds carbamazepine codeine fexofenadine gabapentin hydrocodone lidocaine metformin paracetamol tramadol and trimethoprim were detected in all 12 months in the river ouse samples eight compounds were not detected in any ouse sample diazepam loratadine oseltamivir oxazepam raloxifene sulfamethoxazole triamterene and verapamil the highest five annual median concentrations followed the same trend in both rivers metformin gabapentin paracetamol fexofenadine tramadol indicating that usage patterns wwtp removal and environmental fate for the most prevalent pharmaceuticals are similar in these two systems the range detection frequency and annual median for each pharmaceutical in both river systems is reported in tables 1 and 2 monthly total pharmaceutical concentrations at each sampling site are presented in figs 4 and 5 these concentration figures provide a spatiotemporal overview of the relationship between sampling sites rivers and wwtps serving the city monthly summed concentrations are higher in the river foss e g above 2000 ng l at sites downstream of the wwtp in comparison to the river ouse where most monthly summed concentrations are below 1000 ng l despite the wwtps on the river ouse serving a larger population this is due to greater dilution of discharged effluent in the ouse for example flow ranged from 9 2 to 233 m3 s in the ouse compared with 0 0096 1 68 m3 s in the foss on sampling days fig 1 for the sites immediately downstream of the wwtps o3 o6 and f2 the months with the lowest flows july and june yielded both the most analytes and the highest concentrations thus concentrations appear to be inversely proportional to flow at site f2 similarly to observations reported previously kolpin et al 2004 the trend was not continued moving downstream in the river foss sites f3 f5 potentially due to pharmaceutical losses stemming from dilution or in stream removal processes such as biodegradation or sorption to sediment moreno gonzález et al 2014 or due to pharmaceutical contributions from domestic septic systems carmona et al 2014 and or inputs from combined sewer overflows cso phillips et al 2012 in the foss a substantial spike downstream of f2 in paracetamol 9822 ng l was detected in the march sampling along with less intense spikes from other pharmaceuticals such as metformin 2592 ng l these observations may be explained by local septic tank effluent entering the river downstream of the f2 site captured during the march sampling period paracetamol can be 99 removed and metformin 93 in conventional water treatment fig 3 therefore the spike in march concentrations might be explained by releases of septic effluent james et al 2016 james et al 2016 reported paracetamol concentrations of 5000 ng l at a septic effluent impacted site and identified it as a possible tracer of septic system contamination combined sewer overflow cso releases could provide an alternative explanation for the concentration spike phillips et al 2012 as a cso is located just upstream of the f3 site low rainfall university of york 2018 prior to sampling suggest csos would not likely be in operation therefore septic effluent releases provide a plausible explanation concentrations in the river ouse varied less month to month than in the foss and a relationship with flow was less clear with march and may in general having slightly greater total concentrations march has also been reported to have the highest monthly concentration in recent temporal studies padhye et al 2014 sun et al 2014 sun et al 2014 suggested march coincided with a spike in pharmaceutical usage and reduced wwtp removal capacity this may explain the slightly higher concentrations observed in the river ouse at sites upstream of the foss confluence o1 o4 while the spike in may river ouse coincides with decreased river flow fig 1 metformin a type ii diabetes drug had the highest annual median concentration 1117 and 237 ng l in the foss and ouse respectively followed by gabapentin anti convulsant 843 and 230 ng l foss and ouse respectively and paracetamol analgesic 209 and 77 6 ng l foss and ouse respectively this trend is different from those observed in previous temporal exposure campaigns studying similar compounds throughout the world for example in china zhang et al 2015 studied urbanized rivers and found antibiotics to be the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals they did however report atenolol as having one of the highest annual median concentrations 53 ng l which is similar to the median concentration for this compound reported at site f2 55 4 ng l in the current study in spain camacho muñoz et al 2010 reported propranolol most frequently detected in surface water with a higher average concentration 80 ng l than the median concentration observed in this study 20 1 ng l in portugal paíga et al 2016 reported carbamazepine the most frequently detected pharmaceutical with an annual median of 31 7 ng l while other similarly studied compounds citalopram and venlafaxine had annual median concentrations of 0 86 and 40 1 ng l respectively and trimethoprim was not detected in the river foss the highest annual median concentrations for carbamazepine citalopram and venlafaxine was 66 15 4 and 21 ng l respectively while trimethoprim was detected in 100 of samples with an annual median of 30 ng l in sweden carbamazepine was also most frequently detected and at a higher annual mean than observed in york 204 ng l versus 66 ng l in the river foss while atenolol concentration was similar to that reported here 60 2 ng l compared to 55 4 ng l daneshvar et al 2010 in a similar temporal study in wales tramadol and gabapentin had the highest annual median concentrations 968 ng l and 227 ng l respectively kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 median concentrations of gabapentin tramadol trimethoprim paracetamol carbamazepine cimetidine and atenolol in wales were higher than we saw in york while concentrations of diltiazem atenolol sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin concentrations in the river foss were lower than observed in wales kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 these comparisons suggest that annual pharmaceutical exposures in river systems are highly variable regionally in part due to variability in prescribing practices hydrology wastewater management and the degree of urbanisation in addition certain annual median concentrations of pharmaceuticals observed in this study are higher than those previously observed in the european union and asia 3 3 1 spatial trends the spatial trends for both rivers are presented in fig 6 significant differences between a site and the adjacent downstream site are also noted spatial trends are apparent in both rivers the greatest number of significant differences p 0 05 were found between the sites upstream and downstream of the wwtps i e f1 f2 o3 o4 and o5 o6 fig 6 in addition significant differences increased when comparing to sites further downstream wwtps make a significant contribution to pharmaceutical concentrations in both river systems however upstream sources of certain pharmaceuticals exist in both rivers as significance was not achieved for cimetidine in the foss and paracetamol codeine trimethoprim and atenolol in the ouse there are wwtps along the river nidd fig 5 and upstream of sites o1 and f1 10 km demonstrating that pharmaceuticals from upstream sources are transported into the city concentrations are generally highest immediately downstream of the wwtps and decreased moving to downstream sites evidenced by difference in height i e concentration between the bars from each site fig 6 similarly to observations in previous studies kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 the decrease in concentrations moving downstream is variable between compounds indicating that in stream attenuation is compound specific for example carbamazepine concentrations are similar between sites downstream of the wwtp in the river foss i e f2 f5 while over the same stretch of river concentrations of hydrocodone and citalopram decreased by 51 and 38 respectively fig 6 in the ouse all concentrations decreased slightly from o3 to o4 however there was a slight increase occurring at o5 likely due to the confluence with the river foss and again at o6 which is downstream of wwtp c in the river foss carbamazepine had only a single significant spatial difference between the site upstream of wwtp a discharge site f1 and the sites downstream of the discharge carbamazepine has been reported to be resistant to biodegradation and stable in the environment moreno gonzález et al 2014 in the river ouse all pharmaceuticals exhibited spatially significant trends carbamazepine was significantly different between each site downstream of wwtp b tested i e o3 to o6 since this did not occur in the river foss over a similar distance 13 3 km between sites f2 and f5 versus 11 km between sites o3 and o6 and the literature agrees that carbamazepine is resistant to biotransformation a combination of dilution e g urban drainage runoff and other pharmaceutical sources i e river foss moving downstream could be a plausible explanation overall these results indicate that a wide variety of environmental processes such as dilution and in stream degradation are operating to differing extents in neighbouring rivers leading to different spatial patterns in pharmaceutical concentrations between sampling sites for example the reduction in concentrations moving downstream in the river foss may be symptomatic of in stream removal processes such as photolysis or microbial degradation daneshvar et al 2010 while fluctuating concentrations in the river ouse could be due to a complex dynamic between dilution and other pharmaceutical sources i e tributaries urban drainage while natural removal processes potentially operating in the foss may be masked or occur to a lesser extent in the larger ouse system 3 3 2 seasonal variability temporal variability between the seasons fig 7 is presented similarly to the approach for displaying spatial variability between sampling sites fig 6 seasonal differences in pharmaceutical concentrations exist in the two river systems especially in the river foss in both rivers the lowest concentrations correspond with winter the season which had the highest average flow 2 7 times higher than the next highest season autumn conversely the highest mass loads occur in winter 1 4 times higher than the next highest season spring lower concentrations in winter have also been reported previously baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 however several studies report higher concentrations in winter kot wasik et al 2016 lindholm lehto et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in addition the extent of concentration variability between seasons differs between compounds which could be due to seasonal patterns in usage sun et al 2014 or seasonal variability in photodegradation or biodegradation of which both processes can peak in summer thus having a greater impact on more readily biodegradable compounds lindholm lehto et al 2016 in general autumn was the season with the second highest median concentrations except for paracetamol where highest median values were observed during spring in both rivers this could be due to increased usage coinciding with symptomatic treatment of illnesses more common in spring such as colds vatovec et al 2016 in conjunction with lower flows than winter to determine whether concentrations between seasons were significant friedman s test was used for pharmaceuticals with sufficient detections concentrations of 17 compounds 86 were found to vary significantly by season in the river foss while amitriptyline codeine cimetidine metformin and ranitidine did not vary seasonally nine compounds 50 had significant seasonal differences in the river ouse atenolol carbamazepine codeine desvenlafaxine gabapentin lidocaine ranitidine sitagliptin and trimethoprim the reasons for temporal variations in pharmaceutical concentrations have varied between studies with several reporting flow as the major driver observing higher concentrations during times of low flow kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 kolpin et al 2004 others suggest higher pharmaceutical concentrations in winter months coincide with higher winter usage patterns sun et al 2014 or decreased biodegradation in winter moreno gonzález et al 2014 while others found no significant differences between sampled seasons camacho muñoz et al 2010 due to higher concentrations coinciding with low flow months in this study we also suggest that flow appears to be a major driver behind the observed seasonal variability in pharmaceutical concentrations in the current study the lack of significant seasonal differences found in the river ouse could be explained by a lower annual variability in flow on sampling days than the river foss i e two orders of magnitude versus three further detailed investigation into the drivers behind the pharmaceutical concentrations observed both temporally and spatially is required to differentiate between the possible explanations and could include comparing results with prescription data and flow and estimating the impact of in stream losses seasonally in different climates and in river hydrological properties e g depth and flow such analyses will be facilitated by the detailed pharmaceutical monitoring data reported in this study 3 4 comparisons of pecs and mecs the pec mec ratios for each compound for which it was possible to calculate an annual average mec are reported in fig 8 a ratio greater than 1 indicates pecs were higher than mecs and lower when less than 1 the pecs are severely underestimated in the ouse this may be due to pharmaceuticals being transported from upstream or problems with sewer connectivity within the sampling network not being accounted for in the simplistic pec calculation several studies have attempted to gauge the accuracy of pecs by calculating a ratio with mecs however the criterion for what constitutes accurate is variable across studies burns et al 2017 this assessment has been previously limited to a small number of compounds and based on a limited number of sampling events not representative of the annual average mec which the pec was designed to predict in this way we present novel findings that indicate when annual average mecs are calculated less hydrologically complex river systems where pharmaceutical sources are limited i e river foss pecs characterise annual exposure within a factor 2 for 41 of compounds in this study average factor 2 8 with no factor greater than 11 however paracetamol is an exception underestimated by a factor of 73 the usage estimate did not incorporate over the counter contributions therefore underestimates were not unexpected burns et al 2017 conversely the results from the river ouse indicate that major limitations are associated with this predictive approach all ratios were off by a factor of at least 7 average 27 and up to 139 which according to studies characterising the pec mec is outside an acceptable range verlicchi et al 2014 as the simple exposure model is routinely used for regulatory environmental risk assessment era of new pharmaceuticals our findings have important regulatory implications the predictions of exposure currently being used to assess new compounds are likely under or over estimating concentrations depending on the type of compound the use of a spatially referenced down the drain hydrological model such as lf2000 wqx williams et al 2012 or great er feijtel et al 1997 would likely result in improved predictions as these models have the capacity to incorporate inputs from upstream sources this is appropriate as many rivers in the region pass through multiple urbanised areas and thus are subject to multiple wwtp inputs in addition the hydrological aspect can incorporate contributions or dilutions from the confluence with other river systems work currently being performed in the ipie project involves the development of a spatially resolved model for european surface waters the high quality monitoring data presented in this study will be used to help evaluate this model our work also shows that inputs from other sources potentially septic effluent can be very important for some compounds at certain time of year the consideration of these direct inputs in the risk assessment process may therefore be warranted 4 conclusion a rapid determination hplc ms ms method for 33 pharmaceuticals was validated and applied in a 12 month spatiotemporal pharmaceutical exposure campaign wwtp removal efficiency was found to be similar between cas and trickling filter technology for the target pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical concentrations in two contrasting river systems that run through the city of york uk were found to vary significantly spatially and temporally with the greatest variation observed for paracetamol in the river foss ranging from not detected to over 9822 ng l temporal variations in concentration were less frequently observed in the larger river ouse potentially due to the lower variability in flow which could be an important driver behind pharmaceutical concentrations in the study system pec mec ratios indicated that compounds in both rivers were generally underestimated by commonly used simple predictive exposure algorithms in total 41 of pec mec ratios for the river foss data were within a factor of 2 while for the river ouse average ratios indicated predictions were off by a factor of 27 this

19623,this study evaluated the performance of five different sorbents granular activated carbon gac gac polonite gac p xylit lignite and sand for a set of 83 micropollutants mps pharmaceuticals perfluoroalkyl substances pfass personal care products artificial sweeteners parabens pesticide stimulants together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties treatment with gac and gac p provided the highest removal efficiencies with average values above 97 removal rates were generally lower for xylit on average 74 and lignite on average 68 although they proved to be highly efficient for a few individual mps the average removal efficiency for sand was only 47 it was observed that the mps behaved differently depending on their physicochemical properties the physicochemical properties of pfass i e molecular weight topological molecular surface area log octanol water partition coefficient k ow and distribution coefficient between octanol and water log d were positively correlated to observed removal efficiency for the sorbents xylit lignite and sand p 0 05 indicating a strong influence of perfluorocarbon chain length and associated hydrophobic characteristics in contrast for the other mps the ratio between apolar and polar surface area sa sp was positively correlated with the removal efficiency indicating that hydrophobic adsorption may be a key feature of their sorption mechanisms gac showed to be the most promising filter medium to improve the removal of mps in on site sewage treatment facilities however more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of mps in field trials graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction the release of micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and synthetic organic compounds into the environment can affect water quality and may trigger unwanted ecological effects eggen et al 2014 mps originate from different point and diffuse sources but discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are one of their main pathways into the environment due to partial removal or non removal of mps in conventional wastewater treatment luo et al 2014 in sparsely populated areas the use of small scale on site sewage treatment facilities ossfs is widespread similarly to the wwtps the treatment techniques used in ossfs have a low removal efficiency for mps blum et al 2016 gros et al 2017 potentially leading to decreased water quality blum et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2017 aquatic ecosystem disturbance and reduced ecosystem service functions such as impaired drinking water quality schaider et al 2017 current wastewater treatment techniques mainly focus on removal of nutrients and pathogens that are released into the environment cucarella and renman 2009 gustafsson et al 2008 renman and renman 2010 however interest in the removal of mps from wastewater is increasing but research to date has mainly focused on a limited number of mps luo et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 in particular research on treatment techniques for ossfs is lacking matamoros et al 2009 stanford and weinberg 2010 teerlink et al 2012 there is thus an urgent need for improved knowledge on efficient wastewater treatment techniques for mps in particular for ossfs additional treatment steps for such facilities mostly serving one or a few households require simple design high cost efficiency and little maintenance so that they can be easily implemented filter beds are one of the most commonly used treatment techniques in ossfs these beds are mostly based on biosolids removal with a sand filter only and showed low to moderate ability to remove mps d alessio et al 2015 paredes et al 2016 gros et al 2017 blum et al 2018 activated carbon ac has been widely investigated for the removal of mps altmann et al 2016 and is a promising water treatment technique for ossfs another promising adsorbent is lignite which has been studied in both its natural and activated form for removal of a limited set of mps aivalioti et al 2012 compared with ac raw lignite shows low removal efficiency for btex benzene toluene ethyl benzene and m p and o xylenes methyl tertiary butyl ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether aivalioti et al 2012 but high potential in removing phenolic substances from wastewater polat et al 2006 moreover adsorbents that are based on agricultural waste have been studied on their capacity to remove methylene blue mb senthil kumar et al 2011a since mb has similar carbon chains that are present in pharmaceuticals mb could be used for screening of potential materials with a potential capacity to remove mps senthil kumar et al 2011b the sorption mechanisms of mps in wastewater depend on the physicochemical properties of the mps the wastewater characteristics e g effect of ph or inorganic ions the properties of the sorbent e g particle size pore size and surface area and interaction with other substances du et al 2014 rattier et al 2014 reungoat et al 2011 putra et al 2009 studied the adsorption of a broad spectrum of antibiotic amoxicillin onto ac and bentonite they found both physisorption and chemisorption with the highest removal capacity at the point of zero charge for ac bentonite significantly reduced amoxicillin according to adsorption isotherm data based on langmuir and freundlich equations the removal efficiency of mps can be also affected by the surface functional groups of the adsorbent which has been shown for mb sorbed to saw dust cashew nut shell raw and modified mango senthil kumar et al 2011a 2014 previous studies have also shown the impact of the physicochemical properties of mps on the removal efficiency for example the perfluorocarbon chain length and functional group of perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have a great influence on their removal rate using granular ac gac and anion exchange resins mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 however comprehensive studies relating the physicochemical properties of a broad range of mps to the removal efficiency achieved using various sorbents are lacking the aim of the present study was to evaluate the removal of mps from wastewater using organic and inorganic sorbents gac xylit lignite sand and polonite in a long term 12 week column experiment a set of 83 mps were selected including pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic categories pfass stimulants personal care products and parabens together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties the removal efficiency by the sorbents was correlated with the physicochemical properties of the mps to our knowledge this is the first study of its kind and will help in future assessments of sorbent performance for removal of mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical and reagents the 83 mps evaluated comprised artificial

resulting in 2 μg l 1 of each compound table s1 in the si the wastewater was kept in darkness in a glass container at 4 c during the experiment and was stirred during feeding of the columns for quality control non spiked distilled water was used for a non absorbent filled reference column with the same dimensions as the other columns the spiked wastewater was pumped through the five treatment columns and the distilled water was pumped with a peristaltic pump through the reference column for 10 5 h day 1 at a pumping rate at 0 07 l h 1 column 1 resulting in a total volume of 0 74

dilution method the identification and confirmation criteria for analysis of the target compounds were based on commission decision 2002 657 ec 2 6 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova without replication was used to compare the overall removal efficiency of the mps obtained with the different sorbents the significance level was set to α 0 05 for statistical analysis concentrations below the mlod were set to half the mlod for the corresponding compound the physicochemical characteristics of the mps predictor variables x and their removal efficiencies response variable y were analysed by partial least squares pls using the simca 14 0 software package umetrics umeå sweden pls transforms x variables table s5 in the si into unrelated scores and then attempts to find a linear relationship with the least residuals between the x and the y scores the fitted intercept regression lines for r2y should not exceed 0 4 and q2 should not exceed 0 05 if the values are higher this implies an over fitted model or that the correlations might be due to chance rybacka and andersson 2016 r2x should not be below 0 3 as then the model does not explain enough of the variance in the data and this would result in an underfitted model in general for the different plots two principal components pcs were used pc1 explaining on average 29 of the variance within the data and pc2 explaining on average 22 the different sorbents were evaluated separately correlations between the various physicochemical properties and the removal efficiencies obtained with the different sorbent materials were investigated using pearson correlation all variables were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of micropollutants from wastewater residues of 57 out of 83 mps analysed were detected in the initial non spiked inlet samples table s1 in the si the mps were present in a wide range of concentrations from values close to mlod up to levels above 5000 ng l 1 e g acetaminophen caffeine diclofenac ibuprofen metformin metoprolol nicotine and sucralose overall concentrations of mps present in the wastewater were within the range reported previously luo et al 2014 in the spiked inlet samples 67 of the 83 target mps were detected including all of the spiked target analytes the removal efficiency for mps using lignite xylit sand gac and gac polonite p column tests is shown in fig 1 in general the highest mean removal efficiency for all mps was found for gac 98 and gac p 97 followed by xylit 74 lignite 68 and sand 47 fig 1a the sand treatment is comparable to infiltration beds in ossf facilities which is the most widely used treatment system in northern europe olshammar et al 2015 low removal efficiencies of mps have been reported in ossfs using sand filters blum et al 2016 gros et al 2017 on the other hand good removal capabilities of mps when employing gac and gac p have been reported previously altmann et al 2014 boehler et al 2012 hernandez leal et al 2011 margot et al 2013 the high removal efficiency in this study even after 12 weeks and a high hydraulic loading rate of 357 l m 2 d 1 indicates that the capacity limit for mps was not reached so a longer trial is needed to investigate the duration of steady state there was a significant difference between the removal efficiency of gac and gac p compared to xylit two way anova p 0 001 lignite p 0 001 and sand p 0 001 however there was no statistically significant difference between gac and gac p p 0 42 suggesting a non significant contribution of polonite to removal of the mps however the polonite medium received treated water after the efficient gac filter furthermore no statistically significant differences were found between xylit and lignite whereas sand showed significantly lower removal efficiencies than all other sorbents p 0 05 the target pfass except perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa are negatively charged at environmentally relevant ph ranges and hence pfass showed different sorption behaviour and removal efficiency than other mps gonzalez barreiro et al 2006 therefore this compound class was evaluated separately fig 1b gac and gac p showed the highest average removal efficiencies for pfass with a mean of 94 and 96 respectively which was comparable to the average efficiencies for the remaining mps 97 and 99 respectively when excluding pfass n 41 there was no significant difference between gac and gac p two way anova p 0 21 again showing that no post sorption occurred using polonite for the other sorbents lower mean removal efficiencies were observed for pfass lignite 41 xylit 37 sand 28 than for the other mps lignite 76 xylit 86 sand 54 lower adsorption of pfass can be expected because of their high polarity which results in high water solubility in particular for the shorter chain pfass mccleaf et al 2017 changes in removal efficiencies over time were assessed fig 2 but determination of breakthrough curves and adsorption isotherms was outside the scope of the present study however time trends can provide important information in evaluation of the potential longevity of sorbents the removal efficiencies increased slightly during the first week for gac gac p and sand and during first three weeks for lignite and xylit potentially due to adsorption of organic matter before the start of the experiment hence it appears that an equilibrium time is required until the sorbents is performing at their maximum capacity this assumption is in line with previous suggestions in studies focussing on soil retention of mps murillo torres et al 2012 and gac adsorption of atrazine knappe et al 1999 in batch and column experiments after the equilibration time all sorbents tested in the present study showed a decreasing trend in removal efficiency gac and gac p showed similar behaviour with a slow decrease in the average removal efficiency during 12 weeks from 99 and 98 in week 2 95 and 96 in week 12 indicating higher potential longevity in comparison with the other sorbents after equilibration 4 weeks 80 removal efficiency lignite and xylit both showed decreased efficiency until week 12 with a minor reduction for xylit to 78 and a steeper decrease for lignin to 60 sand also showed a clear decrease in the removal efficiency from 47 in week 2 35 in week 12 the removal efficiency of mps was expected to decrease after a certain time due to partial saturation of the sorbents hernandez leal et al 2011 however the behaviour of the 67 individual mps detected was not consistent for example comparing the removal efficiency of selected mps n 9 fig s2 in the si the efficiencies were always close to 100 in the gac and gac p columns but for the other sorbents the individual mps showed differing removal behaviour the pore size surface area and surface functional group of the sorbents are very important when to determine the adsorption capacity of various mps not surprisingly gac reached the highest removal efficiency in our study which can be explained by its large specific surface area of 950 m2 g 1 and average pore size of 2 2 nm table 1 this indicates that meso and macropores serve as passages for the sorbate to reach micropores where most of the sorption occurs priya and radha 2017 kose 2010 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed on the studied sorbents to investigate the occurrence of surface functional groups the organic sorbents are expected to have more surface functional groups than the inorganic ones for instance a high peak appeared in the spectra curves near 1508 cm 1 for xylit and 1624 cm 1 for lignite due to c c aromatic stretch which confirmed the presence of benzene peaks at similar positions were observed for ac in a previous study putra et al 2009 however the peak was missing in the ftir spectra curves for the inorganic sorbents sand and polonite results not shown meanwhile the missing of a benzene band or very weak peaks were found near this position for other mineral based filter materials gustafsson et al 2008 which confirms that inorganic sorbents are less efficient on the removal of benzene compounds and other related mps effects of biofilm formation cannot be excluded in our study after four weeks operation of the columns the removal of a number of deet carbamazepine and oxazepam and pfos respectively improved using xylit lignite and sand between week four and eight molecules of these chemicals are not readily biodegradable so their reduction is most probably due to adsorption by the biofilm 3 2 clustering of micropollutants according to their physicochemical properties and removal in evaluating the removal of individual mps by different sorbents it is important to select mps that have a wide range of physicochemical properties in this study the wide variety of mps included were characterised by their molecular weight mw acid dissociation constant pka log k ow water solubility s w distribution coefficient between octanol and water at ph 5 5 and at ph 7 4 log d ph 5 5 and log d ph 7 4 respectively solvent accessible surface area s apolar surface area sa polar surface area sp the ratio between apolar and polar surface area sa sp and number of aromatic bonds ab fig 3 table s5 in the si these variables were selected based on their potential to affect the sorption behaviour of mps e g s w or log k ow and based on the literature ab s sa sp and sa sp svahn and bjorklund 2015 the score scatter plots of the pls are shown for gac in fig 3 and for lignite xylit gac p and sand in figs s3 s10 in the si it should be noted that in cases where the removal efficiencies for the selected mps were very similar e g gac and gac p the main factor affecting the pls analysis and possible object clustering was the combination of the selected physicochemical properties while the removal efficiencies contributed to the grouping to a smaller extent pfass formed a group of their own demonstrating that their physicochemical properties are clearly different from those of the other mps analysed within the pfas class the individual pfass lined up according to their perfluorocarbon chain length fig 3a i e in order of hydrophobicity it has been shown that chain length and functional group i e carboxylate and sulfonate head group for the perfluoroalkyl carboxyates pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas are the main factors influencing the removal efficiencies of pfass when using gac and anion resins mccleaf et al 2017 however in this study there was no clear trend for different removal efficiencies depending on the functional group using gac due to the low number of treated bed volumes i e 62 fosa did not group with the other pfass probably because it has a neutral sulfonamide head group pfass were clustered separately in relation to the other mps for all sorbents highlighting the different characteristics of these compounds pharmaceuticals and stimulants were grouped together for gac fig 3 see figs s3 s6 in the si for the other sorbents however some pharmaceuticals and stimulants were not clustered with the others even when they had similar removal efficiencies close to 100 in most cases this can be explained by the fact that they have unique physicochemical properties e g in the case of metformin low mw 129 da no ab salicylic acid low mw 138 da and low pka 2 9 nicotine high s w 1 000 000 mg l 1 simvastatin high s 646 å2 and amitriptyline high sa sp ratio 174 the three parabens analysed were located very close to each other in the score scatter plots showing a high correlation for other categories of mps i e pesticides artificial sweeteners and personal care products the number of substances was too low to draw any conclusions pharmaceuticals include very heterogeneous types of compounds and their potential grouping in subcategories including stimulants was also evaluated for gac fig 3b and other sorbents figs s7 s10 in the si as can be observed in fig 3 the compounds belonging to the same therapeutic classes clearly grouped together e g antidepressants antiepileptics antihypertensives beta blockers or nsaids the explanation lies in the fact that pharmaceuticals with a similar mode of action often with the same chemical functional groups have more similar physicochemical properties and might behave similarly with the different sorbents 3 3 relationship between removal efficiency and physicochemical properties of mps pearson correlation analysis was used to search for correlations between the removal efficiency of mps n 54 and their physicochemical properties including mw pka log k ow sw log d ph 5 5 and log d ph 7 4 s sa sp ratio sa sp and ab table 2 and table s5 in the si when examining the influence of the variables on the removal efficiency of the mps it is important to consider that some of them may be intercorrelated table s7 in the si this is the case for mw and s since both parameters describe the molecular size r 0 73 in addition log d ph5 5 and ph7 4 were highly correlated with each other r 0 90 and also with log k ow r 0 76 for ph5 5 and r 0 75 for ph7 4 therefore in future studies only a few variables need to be selected in order to evaluate and predict the potential correlation between removal efficiency and physicochemical properties of mps table 2 summarises the correlation between the removal efficiency of mps and their physicochemical properties pfass were evaluated separately from the other mps since their physicochemical properties and behaviour were very different fig 3a five variables mw log k ow log d ph5 5 log d ph7 4 and s were strongly positively correlated with the removal efficiency of pfass using xylit lignite and sand p 0 01 for all fig 4 the high correlation of the removal efficiency of pfass with mw p 0 001 and s p 0 001 using xylit lignite and sand can be explained by the fact that the removal efficiency increased with increasing perfluorocarbon chain length as shown in fig 5 for pfcas and pfsas these results are in agreement with previous findings obtained for gac and anion exchange resins eschauzier et al 2012 du et al 2014 appleman et al 2013 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 the physicochemical properties of pfass relating to the polarity of the molecule log k ow log d ph5 5 and log d ph7 4 were also strongly positively correlated with the removal efficiencies using lignite xylit and sand p 0 05 based on these results it seems that in the case of pfass these variables are also related to their perfluorocarbon chain length hence pfass with longer perfluorocarbon chain length are more hydrophobic and therefore the removal efficiency showed a stronger correlation with log k ow log d ph5 and log d ph7 4 several studies have found that pfsas are more efficiently removed than the corresponding pfcas comparing the same perfluorocarbon chain length when using gac and other anion exchange resins e g purolite appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 this difference can be attributed to the greater electrostatic effect of the sulfonic functional group compared with the carboxylic group zaggia et al 2016 however in the present study no significant differences between pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluorocarbon chain length were found for lignite xylit and sand p 0 05 which may be due to the use of different sorbents or the influence of the wastewater fosa with a sulfonamide group showed higher removal efficiency in agreement with the aforementioned studies the other variables i e pka s w s sa sp ratio sa sp did not show any correlation in the studies performed with gac and gac p it was not possible to draw conclusions since the variations in removal efficiency values were in a very small range close to 100 which created artificially strong negative correlations as can be observed in fig 6 for the other mps excluding pfass the characteristics mw log k ow or log d ph5 5 did not show any significant effect on the removal efficiency p 0 05 which is in contrast to the results obtained for pfass table 2 similarly no correlation with these variables has been found in previous works evaluating adsorption of mps to anthracite and gac rattier et al 2012 2014 suggesting that hydrophobicity alone is not the dominant attribute of mps governing the sorption it is worth mentioning that a correlation between log d in combination with the halogen content and the removal efficiency of mps in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor was found in another study hai et al 2011 however in that study only eight halogenated compounds were considered the charge of the compounds was also considered we used the measured values of ph for each sample of wastewater to determine the log d for individual compound to consider the charge of each compound see table s6 in the si however results showed that the charge had only a minor effect on the sorption behaviour and other physiochemical properties seem to have higher correlation than the ph adjusted log kow log d in the present work the variables sa and sp as well as sa sp ratio were correlated with the removal efficiency higher sa sp ratio favoured better removal efficiency the other mps excluding pfass using lignit and xylit this is in agreement with results obtained by svahn and bjorklund 2015 who showed that sa sp ratio positively affected retention of selected pharmaceuticals in sediments and sewage sludge therefore sa sp ratio is a parameter to consider when selecting adsorbents for removal of mps since it can significantly affect the performance of the different approaches however more studies are necessary in order to determine the extent to which sa sp contributes to enhancing the removal efficiency with a given treatment other weaker correlations were found namely pk a with xylit and sand log s and log d ph 7 4 with lignite and log sp 10 with sand figs s11 and s12 in the si more experiments are needed to evaluate such correlations 4 conclusions this study evaluated five different sorbents that could act as a sustainable alternative or complement to current sand based treatments and examined how the physicochemical properties of different families of mps affected the sorption process treatment with gac and gac p showed the best removal efficiencies of mps throughout the 12 weeks of the study and were significantly higher than those obtained with xylit median 82 and lignite median 72 removal rates obtained with sand which is the treatment most commonly applied in infiltration bed systems used in ossfs were low median 40 the present study correlated for the first time different physicochemical properties of a large number of mps with the removal efficiencies obtained with different sorbents for pfass properties related to the hydrophobicity such as mw s log k ow log d ph5 5 and log d ph7 4 which are related to perfluoroalkyl chain length were positively correlated to the removal efficiency it is noteworthy that for the other mps analysed different properties were positively correlated to the removal efficiency i e s sa sp indicating that other factors can influence the sorption processes of individual compounds sa sp ratio showed the highest positive correlation with the removal efficiency for the other mps excluding pfass indicating that hydrophobic adsorption is an important feature in sorption mechanisms the pls score scatter plots comparing physicochemical properties and calculated removal efficiency showed a clear grouping of the different classes of mps i e pharmaceuticals pfass and parabens as well as clustering according to different therapeutic families of pharmaceuticals in cases where the removal efficiencies showed low variability e g for gac and gac p the clustering reflected variations in physicochemical properties rather than variations in removal efficiencies the findings on compound clustering can help in future selection of representative mps from the different groups of interests to examine for example sorption kinetics thermodynamics and isotherms for selective sorbents one of the main conclusions of this study is that the removal mechanism is specific for each compound or family of compounds and is strongly affected by different physicochemical properties therefore depending on the objective of the treatment different approaches should be adopted for instance sa sp ratio should be taken into account in studies dealing with a large set of mps since it can affect the performance of the different approaches based on our results the use of gac as a filter medium seems to be promising alternative to improve the removal of a large set of mps in filter bed systems in ossfs however more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of mps in field trials in order to reduce emissions of mps to the environment and to investigate

19623,this study evaluated the performance of five different sorbents granular activated carbon gac gac polonite gac p xylit lignite and sand for a set of 83 micropollutants mps pharmaceuticals perfluoroalkyl substances pfass personal care products artificial sweeteners parabens pesticide stimulants together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties treatment with gac and gac p provided the highest removal efficiencies with average values above 97 removal rates were generally lower for xylit on average 74 and lignite on average 68 although they proved to be highly efficient for a few individual mps the average removal efficiency for sand was only 47 it was observed that the mps behaved differently depending on their physicochemical properties the physicochemical properties of pfass i e molecular weight topological molecular surface area log octanol water partition coefficient k ow and distribution coefficient between octanol and water log d were positively correlated to observed removal efficiency for the sorbents xylit lignite and sand p 0 05 indicating a strong influence of perfluorocarbon chain length and associated hydrophobic characteristics in contrast for the other mps the ratio between apolar and polar surface area sa sp was positively correlated with the removal efficiency indicating that hydrophobic adsorption may be a key feature of their sorption mechanisms gac showed to be the most promising filter medium to improve the removal of mps in on site sewage treatment facilities however more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of mps in field trials graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction the release of micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals and synthetic organic compounds into the environment can affect water quality and may trigger unwanted ecological effects eggen et al 2014 mps originate from different point and diffuse sources but discharges from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are one of their main pathways into the environment due to partial removal or non removal of mps in conventional wastewater treatment luo et al 2014 in sparsely populated areas the use of small scale on site sewage treatment facilities ossfs is widespread similarly to the wwtps the treatment techniques used in ossfs have a low removal efficiency for mps blum et al 2016 gros et al 2017 potentially leading to decreased water quality blum et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2017 aquatic ecosystem disturbance and reduced ecosystem service functions such as impaired drinking water quality schaider et al 2017 current wastewater treatment techniques mainly focus on removal of nutrients and pathogens that are released into the environment cucarella and renman 2009 gustafsson et al 2008 renman and renman 2010 however interest in the removal of mps from wastewater is increasing but research to date has mainly focused on a limited number of mps luo et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 in particular research on treatment techniques for ossfs is lacking matamoros et al 2009 stanford and weinberg 2010 teerlink et al 2012 there is thus an urgent need for improved knowledge on efficient wastewater treatment techniques for mps in particular for ossfs additional treatment steps for such facilities mostly serving one or a few households require simple design high cost efficiency and little maintenance so that they can be easily implemented filter beds are one of the most commonly used treatment techniques in ossfs these beds are mostly based on biosolids removal with a sand filter only and showed low to moderate ability to remove mps d alessio et al 2015 paredes et al 2016 gros et al 2017 blum et al 2018 activated carbon ac has been widely investigated for the removal of mps altmann et al 2016 and is a promising water treatment technique for ossfs another promising adsorbent is lignite which has been studied in both its natural and activated form for removal of a limited set of mps aivalioti et

methylene blue mb senthil kumar et al 2011a since mb has similar carbon chains that are present in pharmaceuticals mb could be used for screening of potential materials with a potential capacity to remove mps senthil kumar et al 2011b the sorption mechanisms of mps in wastewater depend on the physicochemical properties of the mps the wastewater characteristics e g effect of ph or inorganic ions the properties of the sorbent e g particle size pore size and surface area and interaction with other substances du et al 2014 rattier et al 2014 reungoat et al 2011 putra et al 2009 studied the adsorption of a broad spectrum of antibiotic amoxicillin onto ac and bentonite they found both physisorption and chemisorption with the highest removal capacity at the point of zero charge for ac bentonite significantly reduced amoxicillin according to adsorption isotherm data based on langmuir and freundlich equations the removal efficiency of mps can be also affected by the surface functional groups of the adsorbent which has been shown for mb sorbed to saw dust cashew nut shell raw and modified mango senthil kumar et al 2011a 2014 previous studies have also shown the impact of the physicochemical properties of mps on the removal efficiency for example the perfluorocarbon chain length and functional group of perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have a great influence on their removal rate using granular ac gac and anion exchange resins mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 however comprehensive studies relating the physicochemical properties of a broad range of mps to the removal efficiency achieved using various sorbents are lacking the aim of the present study was to evaluate the removal of mps from wastewater using organic and inorganic sorbents gac xylit lignite sand and polonite in a long term 12 week column experiment a set of 83 mps were selected including pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic categories pfass stimulants personal care products and parabens together representing a wide range of physicochemical properties the removal efficiency by the sorbents was correlated with the physicochemical properties of the mps to our knowledge this is

anova without replication was used to compare the overall removal efficiency of the mps obtained with the different sorbents the significance level was set to α 0 05 for statistical analysis concentrations below the mlod were set to half the mlod for the corresponding compound the physicochemical characteristics of the mps predictor variables x and their removal efficiencies response variable y were analysed by partial least squares pls using the simca 14 0 software package umetrics umeå sweden pls transforms x variables table s5 in the si into unrelated scores and then attempts to find a linear relationship with the least residuals between the x and the y scores the fitted intercept regression lines for r2y should not exceed 0 4 and q2 should not exceed 0 05 if the values are higher this implies an over fitted model or that the correlations might be due to chance rybacka and andersson 2016 r2x should not be below 0 3 as then the model does not explain enough of the variance in the data and this would result in an underfitted model in general for the different plots two principal components pcs were used pc1 explaining on average 29 of the variance within the

mps have been reported in ossfs using sand filters blum et al 2016 gros et al 2017 on the other hand good removal capabilities of mps when employing gac and gac p have been reported previously altmann

contribution of polonite to removal of the mps however the polonite medium received treated water after the efficient gac filter furthermore no statistically significant differences were found between xylit and lignite whereas sand showed significantly lower removal efficiencies than all other sorbents p 0 05 the target pfass except perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa are negatively charged at environmentally relevant ph ranges and hence pfass showed different sorption behaviour and removal efficiency than other mps gonzalez barreiro et al 2006 therefore this compound class was evaluated separately fig 1b gac and gac p showed the highest average removal efficiencies for pfass with a mean of 94 and 96 respectively which was comparable to the average efficiencies for the remaining mps 97 and 99 respectively when excluding pfass n 41 there was no significant difference between gac and gac p two way anova p 0 21 again showing that no post sorption occurred using polonite for the other sorbents lower mean removal efficiencies were observed for pfass lignite 41 xylit 37 sand 28 than for the other mps lignite 76 xylit 86 sand 54 lower adsorption of pfass can be expected because of their high polarity which results in high water solubility in particular for the shorter chain pfass mccleaf et al 2017 changes in removal efficiencies over time were assessed fig 2 but determination of breakthrough curves and adsorption isotherms was outside the scope of the present study however time trends can provide important information in evaluation of the potential longevity of sorbents the removal efficiencies increased slightly during the first week for gac gac p and sand and during first three weeks for lignite and xylit potentially due to adsorption of organic matter before the start of the experiment hence it appears that an equilibrium time is required until the sorbents is performing at their maximum capacity this assumption is in line with previous suggestions in studies focussing on soil retention of mps murillo torres et al 2012 and gac adsorption of atrazine knappe et al 1999 in batch and column experiments after the equilibration time all sorbents tested in the present study showed a decreasing trend in removal efficiency gac and gac p showed similar behaviour with a slow decrease in the average removal efficiency during 12 weeks from 99 and 98 in week 2 95 and 96 in week 12 indicating higher potential longevity in comparison with the other sorbents after equilibration 4 weeks 80 removal efficiency lignite and xylit both showed decreased efficiency until week 12 with a minor reduction for xylit to 78 and a steeper decrease for lignin to 60 sand also showed a clear decrease in the removal efficiency from 47 in week 2 35 in week 12 the removal efficiency of mps was expected to decrease after a certain time due to partial saturation of the sorbents hernandez leal et al 2011 however the behaviour of the 67 individual mps detected was not consistent for example comparing the removal efficiency of selected mps n 9 fig s2 in the si the efficiencies were always close to 100 in the gac and gac p columns but for the other sorbents the individual mps showed differing removal behaviour the pore size surface area and surface functional group of the sorbents are very important when to determine the adsorption capacity of various mps not surprisingly gac reached the highest removal efficiency in our study which can be explained by its large specific surface area of 950 m2 g 1 and average pore size of 2 2 nm table 1 this indicates that meso and macropores serve as passages for the sorbate to reach micropores where most of the sorption occurs priya and radha 2017 kose 2010 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed on the studied sorbents to investigate the occurrence of surface functional groups the organic sorbents are expected to have more surface functional groups than the inorganic ones for instance a high peak appeared in the spectra curves near 1508 cm 1 for xylit and 1624 cm 1 for lignite due to c c aromatic stretch which confirmed the presence of benzene peaks at similar positions were observed for ac in a previous study putra et al 2009 however the peak was missing in the ftir spectra curves for the inorganic sorbents sand and polonite results not shown meanwhile the missing of a benzene band or very weak peaks were found near this position for other mineral based filter materials gustafsson et al 2008 which confirms that inorganic sorbents are less efficient on the removal of benzene compounds and other related mps effects of biofilm formation cannot be excluded in our study after four weeks operation of the columns the removal of a number of deet carbamazepine and oxazepam and pfos respectively improved using xylit lignite and sand between week four and eight molecules of these chemicals are not readily biodegradable so their reduction is most probably due to adsorption by the biofilm 3 2 clustering of micropollutants according to their physicochemical properties and removal in evaluating the removal of individual mps by different sorbents it is important to select mps that have a wide range of physicochemical properties in this study the wide variety of mps included were characterised by their molecular weight mw acid dissociation constant pka log k ow water solubility s w distribution coefficient between octanol and water at ph 5 5 and at ph 7 4 log d ph 5 5 and log d ph 7 4 respectively solvent accessible surface area s apolar surface area sa polar surface area sp the ratio between apolar and polar surface area sa sp and number of aromatic bonds ab fig 3 table s5 in the si these variables were selected based on their potential to affect the sorption behaviour of mps e g s w or log k ow and based on the literature ab s sa sp and sa sp svahn and bjorklund 2015 the score scatter plots of the pls are shown for gac in fig 3 and for lignite xylit gac p and sand in figs s3 s10 in the si it should be noted that in cases where the removal efficiencies for the selected mps were very similar e g gac and gac p the main factor affecting the pls analysis and possible object clustering was the combination of the selected physicochemical properties while the removal efficiencies contributed to the grouping to a smaller extent pfass formed a group of their own demonstrating that their physicochemical properties are clearly different from those of the other mps analysed within the pfas class the individual pfass lined up according to their perfluorocarbon chain length fig 3a i e in order of hydrophobicity it has been shown that chain length and functional group i e carboxylate and sulfonate head group for the perfluoroalkyl carboxyates pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas are the main factors influencing the removal efficiencies of pfass when using gac and anion resins mccleaf et al 2017 however in this study there was no clear trend for different removal efficiencies depending on the functional group using gac due to the low number of treated bed volumes i e 62 fosa did not group with the other pfass probably because it has a neutral sulfonamide head group pfass were clustered separately in relation to the other mps for all sorbents highlighting the different characteristics of these compounds pharmaceuticals and stimulants were grouped together for gac fig 3 see figs s3 s6 in the si for the other sorbents however some pharmaceuticals and stimulants were not clustered with the others even when they had similar removal efficiencies close to 100 in most cases this can be explained by the fact that they have unique physicochemical properties e g in the case of metformin low mw 129 da no ab salicylic acid low mw 138 da and low pka 2 9 nicotine high s w 1 000 000 mg l 1 simvastatin high s 646 å2 and amitriptyline high sa sp ratio 174 the three parabens analysed were located very close to each other in the score scatter plots showing a high correlation for other categories of mps i e pesticides artificial sweeteners and personal care products the number of substances was too low to draw any conclusions pharmaceuticals include very heterogeneous types of compounds and their potential grouping in subcategories including stimulants was also evaluated for gac fig 3b and other sorbents figs s7 s10 in the si as can be observed in fig 3 the compounds belonging to the same therapeutic classes clearly grouped together e g antidepressants antiepileptics antihypertensives beta blockers or nsaids the explanation lies in the fact that pharmaceuticals with a similar mode of action often with the same chemical functional groups have more similar physicochemical properties and might behave similarly with the different sorbents 3 3 relationship between removal efficiency and physicochemical properties of mps pearson correlation analysis was used to search for correlations between the removal efficiency of mps n 54 and their physicochemical properties including mw pka log k ow sw log d ph 5 5 and log d ph 7 4 s sa sp ratio sa sp and ab table 2 and table s5 in the si when examining the influence of the variables on the removal efficiency of the mps it is important to consider that some of them may be intercorrelated table s7 in the si this is the case for mw and s since both parameters describe the molecular size r 0 73 in addition log d ph5 5 and ph7 4 were highly correlated with each other r 0 90 and also with log k ow r 0 76 for ph5 5 and r 0 75 for ph7 4 therefore in future studies only a few variables need to be selected in order to evaluate and predict the potential correlation between removal efficiency and physicochemical properties of mps table 2 summarises the correlation between the removal efficiency of mps and their physicochemical properties pfass were evaluated separately from the other mps since their physicochemical properties and behaviour were very different fig 3a five variables mw log k ow log d ph5 5 log d ph7 4 and s were strongly positively correlated with the removal efficiency of pfass using xylit lignite and sand p 0 01 for all fig 4 the high correlation of the removal efficiency of pfass with mw p 0 001 and s p 0 001 using xylit lignite and sand can be explained by the fact that the removal efficiency increased with increasing perfluorocarbon chain length as shown in fig 5 for pfcas and pfsas these results are in agreement with previous findings obtained for gac and anion exchange resins eschauzier et al 2012 du et al 2014 appleman et al 2013 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 the physicochemical properties of pfass relating to the polarity of the molecule log k ow log d ph5 5 and log d ph7 4 were also strongly positively correlated with the removal efficiencies using lignite xylit and sand p 0 05 based on these results it seems that in the case of pfass these variables are also related to their perfluorocarbon chain length hence pfass with longer perfluorocarbon chain length are more hydrophobic and therefore the removal efficiency showed a stronger correlation with log k ow log d ph5 and log d ph7 4 several studies have found that pfsas are more efficiently removed than the corresponding pfcas comparing the same perfluorocarbon chain length when using gac and other anion exchange resins e g purolite appleman et al 2013 du et al 2014 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 this difference can be attributed to the greater electrostatic effect of the sulfonic functional group compared with the carboxylic group zaggia et al 2016 however in the present study no significant differences between pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluorocarbon chain length were found for lignite xylit and sand p 0 05 which may be due to the use of different sorbents or the influence of the wastewater fosa with a sulfonamide group showed higher removal efficiency in agreement with the aforementioned studies the other variables i e pka s w s sa sp ratio sa sp did not show any correlation in the studies performed with gac and gac p it was not possible to draw conclusions since the variations in removal efficiency values were in a very small range close to 100 which created artificially strong negative correlations as can be observed in fig 6 for the other mps excluding pfass the characteristics mw log k ow or log d ph5 5 did not show any significant effect on the removal efficiency p 0 05 which is in contrast to the results obtained for pfass table 2 similarly no correlation with these variables has been found in previous works evaluating adsorption of mps to anthracite and gac rattier et al 2012 2014 suggesting that hydrophobicity alone is not the dominant attribute of mps governing the sorption it is worth mentioning that a correlation between log d in combination with the halogen content and the removal efficiency of mps in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor was found in another study hai et al 2011 however in that study only eight halogenated compounds were considered the charge of the compounds was also considered we used the measured values of ph for each sample of wastewater to determine the log d for individual compound to consider the charge of each compound see table s6 in the si however results showed that the charge had only a minor effect on the sorption behaviour and other physiochemical properties seem to have higher correlation than the ph adjusted log kow log d in the present work the variables sa and sp as well as sa sp ratio were correlated with the removal efficiency higher sa sp ratio favoured better removal efficiency the other mps excluding pfass using lignit and xylit this is in agreement with results obtained by svahn and bjorklund 2015 who showed that sa sp ratio positively affected retention of selected pharmaceuticals in sediments and sewage sludge therefore sa sp ratio is a parameter to consider when selecting adsorbents for removal of mps since it can significantly affect the performance of the different approaches however more studies are necessary in order to determine the extent to which sa sp contributes to enhancing the removal efficiency with a given treatment other weaker correlations were found namely pk a with xylit and sand log s and log d ph 7 4 with lignite and log sp 10 with sand figs s11 and s12 in the si more experiments are needed to evaluate such correlations 4 conclusions this study evaluated five different sorbents that could act as a sustainable alternative or complement to current sand based treatments and examined how the physicochemical properties of different families of mps affected the sorption process treatment with gac and gac p showed the best removal efficiencies of mps throughout the 12 weeks of the study and were significantly higher than those obtained with xylit median 82 and lignite median 72 removal rates obtained with sand which is the treatment most commonly applied in infiltration bed systems used in ossfs were low median 40 the present study correlated for the first time different physicochemical properties of a large number of mps with the removal efficiencies obtained with different sorbents for pfass properties related to the hydrophobicity such as mw s log k ow log d ph5 5 and log d ph7 4 which are related to perfluoroalkyl chain length were positively correlated to the removal efficiency it is noteworthy that for the other mps analysed different properties were positively correlated to the removal efficiency i e s sa sp indicating that other factors can influence the sorption processes of individual compounds sa sp ratio showed the highest positive correlation with the removal efficiency for the other mps excluding pfass indicating that hydrophobic adsorption is an important feature in sorption mechanisms the pls score scatter plots comparing physicochemical properties and calculated removal efficiency showed a clear grouping of the different classes of mps i e pharmaceuticals pfass and parabens as well as clustering according to different therapeutic families of pharmaceuticals in cases where the removal efficiencies showed low variability e g for gac and gac p the clustering reflected variations in physicochemical properties rather than variations in removal efficiencies the findings on compound clustering can help in future selection of representative mps from the different groups of interests to examine for example sorption kinetics thermodynamics and isotherms for selective sorbents one of the main conclusions of this study is that the removal mechanism is specific for each compound or family of compounds and is strongly affected by different physicochemical properties therefore depending on the objective of the treatment different approaches should be adopted for instance sa sp ratio should be taken into account in studies dealing with a large set of mps since it can affect the performance of the different approaches based on our results the use of gac as a filter medium seems to be promising alternative to improve the removal of a large set of mps in filter bed systems in ossfs however more studies are needed to evaluate the removal of mps in field trials in order to reduce emissions of mps to the environment and to investigate practical and economic issues arising from using promising sorbents for their removal acknowledgements this study was supported by the swedish research council formas through the project redmic 216

19624,given the increasing vulnerability of communities to the negative impacts of untreated wastewater resource recovery rr systems provide a paradigm shift away from a traditional approach of waste separation and treatment towards a productive recovery of water energy and nutrients the aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr systems to inform technology implementation strategies the study presents a theory informed community influenced system dynamics sd model to provide decision makers with an adaptable tool that simulates system level responses to the strategies that are developed for the coastal town of placencia belize the modeling framework is informed by literature based theories such as the theory of diffusion of innovations tdi and the theory of planned behavior tpb various methods including surveys interviews participatory observations and a water constituents mass balance analysis are used to validate relationships and numerically populate the model the sd model was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that will improve the adoption and sustainability of rr systems site demonstrations marketing strategy made a significant impact on the stock of adopted rr systems the stock of sustained rr systems is driven by the sustainability rate i e economic and environmental viability which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options technical strategy these strategies however only contributed to incremental improvements in the system s sustainability performance this study shows that changing community behaviors i e reporting the correct number of users and reclaiming resources represented by structural change in the sd model is the more significant way to influence the sustainable management of the community s wastewater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords technology adoption community informed modeling mixed method sustainability measure structural change system dynamics 1 introduction wastewater based resource recovery rr systems provide a paradigm shift from the traditional take make waste style of resource management to another perspective that capitalizes on wastewater s ability to generate energy reuse water and recycle nutrients the adoption and sustainability of these systems is important because they provide alternatives to traditional wastewater treatment that is energy and resource intensive css 2016 daigger 2009 oh et al 2010 and reduce the pressures to natural resources that are exacerbated by global climate change and population growth marsalek 2011 thoren et al 2012 however adoption of these systems has not been prevalent in vulnerable coastal areas even though they may mitigate the effects of insufficient wastewater treatment and unrestricted infrastructure development that often plagues these locations daigger 2009 guest et al 2009 walker et al 2012 wells et al 2016 coastal communities are dependent upon the health of their marine ecosystems because of the close proximity for recreation tourism cultural heritage food and environmental protection from storm surges corcoran et al 2010 the health of coastal ecosystems can be indicated by anthropogenic eutrophication and hypoxic zones and linked to land based wastewater practices and population densities peierls et al 1991 vitousek et al 1997 wells et al 2016 however adopting a new technology such as an rr system without properly considering the factors that influence their sustained use and performance can result in the failure or abandonment of such technologies regression to other unsuitable systems or practices and skepticism among local individuals regarding rr systems muga and mihelcic 2008 schweitzer and mihelcic 2012 as such it is important not only to consider the adoption of rr systems but also the factors influencing their sustainability previous studies muga and mihelcic 2008 roomratanapun 2001 tjandraatmadja et al 2013 have investigated the influences that independent factors have on the acceptance and sustainability of wastewater treatment systems roomratanapun 2001 conducted interviews to investigate the effect of a holistic suite of factors i e income knowledge of water quality environmental impact willingness to pay and education on the acceptance of a centralized wastewater treatment project in bangkok and found that willingness to pay was the most important factor to reflect the community s likelihood to adopt the new system furthermore muga and mihelcic 2008 used a multi criteria assessment framework with social economic and environmental indicators to evaluate the sustainability of mechanical lagoon and land based wastewater treatment technologies over their operational life the study emphasized the importance of using geographically specific technology and demographic information to assess the sustainability of a particular system for a distinct location similarly tjandraatmadja et al 2013 used a multi criteria analysis mca as a decision support method for adopting and sustaining innovative treatment options considering life cycle environmental impacts life cycle costs and assigned values for social factors e g acceptance of sewage treatment plant by households interference of sewage treatment plant with household activities while previous studies muga and mihelcic 2008 roomratanapun 2001 tjandraatmadja et al 2013 have considered a wide range of factors impacting the adoption and sustainability of wastewater systems there has been no holistic system level investigation of these factors and dynamics as they influence implementation and sustained use of rr systems a systems based approach was taken in melbourne australia by fagan et al 2010 to assess the sustainability and cost effectiveness of various scenarios e g policy implementation variations in design implementation of innovations and management approaches to aid decision makers in finding solutions to complex urban water issues the study developed simultaneous equations of system level interdependencies among economic environmental energy related and technological factors within an urban water system and found that policies for greenhouse gas ghg reduction would be best focused on the operation phase of water systems while energy reducing technologies are best implemented at the suburban scale rather than the household level fagan et al 2010 additionally fiksel 2006 also promoted a system based perspective that conceptually considers the short term dynamics and long term impacts associated with adopting technologies fueled by renewable resources the study highlights some of the complexities of sustainable development and asserts that system based strategies are the only sufficient means to address such challenges fiksel 2006 nevertheless none of these researchers fagan et al 2010 fiksel 2006 considered community input within their approaches to system adoption and sustainability community perceptions will inevitably influence the adoption and sustained use of technologies usaid 2014 system adopters and operation and maintenance personnel are oftentimes the ones most capable of explaining localized issues influencing the adoption of the rr systems and operational issues impacting the effectiveness of wastewater treatment as such a community informed system level investigation is necessary when investigating the adoption and sustainability of rr technologies overall the aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr technologies in order to provide an adaptable tool for decision makers that simulates system level responses to technology implementation strategies the critical component that is missing from previous studies qualitative perspectives from community members is uniquely incorporated using the system dynamics sd approach the sd approach is used to map the complex network of simultaneous interactions and feedbacks among factors to simulate the system level behavior i e adoption and sustainability performance over time the implementation of this tool in the coastal village of placencia belize reflects its utility to adapt to different locations to investigate various strategies to promote rr systems adoption and sustained use 2 study site the placencia peninsula is located on the southeastern coast of belize at the peninsula s southern most point is placencia village with a population of approximately 1500 individuals sib 2013 the area s primary form of wastewater treatment exists as two or three chambered concrete septic tanks halcrow 2012 wells et al 2016 fig 1 depicts a schematic of the most common type of rr system that some individuals have installed the system includes a semi anaerobic biodigester and drainfield the design threshold for the biodigester tank is 10 users if the number of users is less than or equal to the threshold a 1750 l tank is installed otherwise a 3000 l tank is used the biodigester is designed to reduce biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids tss while the effluent water is used for subsurface fertigation in these systems the nutrient rich water is discharged into a drainfield that is lined with plants whose root systems are responsible for fixing the nutrients to enhance growth and reduce the impact to local water bodies additionally the sludge from the rr systems can also be purged from the tank dried and applied as fertilizer however it is uncommon to see these resource recovery practices being performed by rr system adopters in placencia generally the status of the traditional decentralized systems is such that few undergo routine maintenance which results in un or minimally treated wastewater likely rich in nutrients being discharged into local ecosystems beginning in 2012 the government of belize in conjunction with the inter american development bank idb and the united nations environment program unep partnered together to finance a centralized wastewater system crew 2012 to date the public hearings design proposals and feasibility studies have been conducted but the system has not yet been implemented additionally little explanation has been given to the community about the status of the proposed centralized system as such skepticism exists concerning the likelihood of its implementation affordability and equitable access to all community members 3 model development 3 1 model framework to construct the sd model three theories were chosen as foundational pieces upon which the model s framework was built the theory of diffusion of innovations tdi the theory of planned behavior tpb and the theory of mass conservation tmc fig 2 shows the four phases knowledge persuasion decision confirmation within rogers tdi which influenced the sequential structure of the sd model rogers 2003 the sequential structure reflects individuals transitions from an initial knowledge about the rr system through the confirmation phase where adopters demonstrate behaviors to sustain the wastewater technology rogers 2003 some common factors i e word of mouth and basic dynamics for each phase were formulated after sterman s classic sd model of the tdi decision phase sterman 2000 next the structure includes modified components of tpb such as a subjective norm i e those who are aware of rr systems attitudes about the innovation and one s perceived behavioral control i e stakeholder power as they influence behavioral intentions to adopt the wastewater technology madden et al 1992 specifically the concept of perceived behavioral control represents a stakeholder s assurance of possessing the necessary resources i e decision making power and or information to achieve a desired outcome i e adopting the technology madden et al 1992 sterman 2000 overall this study leverages some of the components of tpb to enable the modeler to simplify and reflect the socio political complexities in placencia that affect the behavioral intentions of an individual as they transition from being aware of rr systems to becoming persuaded to perform the adopting behavior see site background for details finally the water constituents mass balance model was developed using the tmc more details in supplementary materials to account for the impact that adopters behaviors or evolving rr system designs have on its technical performance i e effluent water quality rooting the model in a theoretically informed foundation is beneficial because the structure can be further adapted to reflect the adoption and sustainability dynamics of other technologies in various geographic locations 3 2 model formulation fig 2 depicts a simplified version of the entire sd model for the phases involved in technology adoption and sustainability along with the theories that influence each phase s structure table 1 reflects a few of the model factors definitions equations and units used to formulate the model ajzen 1991 ajzen and madden 1986 davis et al 1989 ergas and aponte morales 2014 forrester and senge 1996 ikhazuangbe and oni 2015 metcalf 2001 philip et al 1993 pires et al 2006 rittmann and mccarty 2001 rogers 2002 struck and borst 2008 wathieu et al 2002 woo 2015 further details including the entire list of factors and equations in the model can be found in the supplementary materials 3 3 model evaluation the model s adoption behavior is gauged by the stock of those who have decided to adopt rr systems the sustainability performance measure is defined in a unique way for this study as the portion of rr systems that are sustained over the full time horizon of the model simulation the sustained rr systems are those that meet effluent water quality standards i e environmental viability in an affordable way i e economic viability with consideration of the system adopters education level equation 1 shows the sustainability performance measure as the percentage of adopted rr systems providing sustained service over the entire run time of the model 1 s u s t a i n a b i l i t y p e r f o r m a n c e m e a s u r e t 1 t s u s t a i n e d r r s y s t e m s a d o p t e d r r s y s t e m s t 100 where t is the simulation time step and t is the total period of the model s simulation next the model validation process includes three steps a structure test structure oriented behavior test and behavior test sterman 2000 first a structure test is completed prior to the model s simulation by systematically inspecting each causal relationship the variables and associated units and assuring their consistent clear and concise definitions are in line with available knowledge experience from the field and relevant literature forrester and senge 1996 sterman 2000 when the model s structure is determined to be reliable the simultaneous multi variant equations are run with vensim software to simulate the overall behavior of the system next are two structure oriented behavior tests extreme conditions testing and sensitivity analysis extreme conditions testing provides confidence in the structure of the model to reflect appropriate behavior under extreme conditions forrester and senge 1996 sterman 2000 for example when the advertising frequency and advertising effectiveness were reduced to minimum values i e 1 and 0 01 respectively the awareness rate which controls the transfer of individuals from unaware to aware of rr systems was drastically reduced furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of input parameters from each phase of the adoption process on the overall system behavior a normal distribution ranging from 30 of the baseline value is simulated 200 times over a 60 year projection the most sensitive variables with the largest degree of impact to the system s performance measures are used to develop strategies to increase the stock of rr systems adopted and sustained over time metcalf 2001 lastly the behavior test is conducted to provide statistical confidence that when the model is populated with site specific information its structure produces output data similar to the empirical values sterman 2000 empirical data i e the number of rr systems adopted in placencia belize was provided by the rr system installer ecofriendly solutions for the years 2005 2015 the root mean squared error rmse is calculated between the model simulation and empirical datasets for this model if the rmse is 0 8 the simulation output can be considered behaviorally consistent with the empirical data sterman 2000 3 4 strategy simulation following the model s performance evaluation there is confidence that the proposed structure adequately represents the factors and dynamics that influence the adoption and sustainability of rr systems in placencia belize effective strategies are designed to increase the adoption and sustainability of rr technologies by changing the sensitive variables within the model s structure the significance of each strategy s impact on the adoption and sustainability performance measures is then determined by conducting z tests a one sample z test compares the averages of the model s baseline values alongside the model s output after simulation with the strategies the null hypothesis prior to each z test is that the average for baseline and strategy implementation is the same however if the p value associated with the z test is 0 05 then the difference between baseline and strategy implementation is significant 4 data collection methods wastewater technologies regardless of system scale or geographic location cannot be completely disassociated from the end users who benefit from their successful operation consequently a mixed method approach is employed in this study to collect site specific qualitative and quantitative data to populate the variables and represent the relationships and feedbacks 4 1 measured data the government of belize s department of environment doe regulates six parameters for decentralized wastewater effluents ph fats oils greases biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss fecal coliforms and enterococci doe 2009 grab samples were taken from effluent points of the rr systems and analyzed using standard analytical methods for bod and tss to characterize the wastewater s strength to impact the environment 4 2 simulated data the study developed a technology specific mass balance model to reflect the rr system s processes for treating fecal inert and bacterial solids and the liquid substrate concentrations see supplementary materials the equations were defined and populated with relevant site data and literature based kinetic parameters for domestic wastewater to calculate the system s efficiency ergas and aponte morales 2014 ikhazuangbe and oni 2015 rittmann and mccarty 2001 struck and borst 2008 woo 2015 the effluent concentrations were calculated using the mass balance model and verified with the measured water quality data 4 3 social data 4 3 1 surveys the survey questions were developed by an interdisciplinary group of anthropologists and environmental engineers the purpose of these surveys was to elicit information from community members about the value they give to environmental economic and health factors as they make decisions about adopting wastewater technologies furthermore the surveys were also used to reveal information about community level perceptions of the power they believe they should have in making decisions about wastewater based rr systems when the questionnaire was finalized and prior to surveying in the field the research group applied for institutional review board irb certification irb cr2 pro00012766 soon thereafter the approved questionnaire was uploaded onto a smart phone using a free electronic platform called kobo anokwa 2011 cairns 2014 a total of 157 surveys were conducted using convenience sampling with an approximate 53 response rate sib 2013 4 3 2 semi structured interviews leveraging a community partnership with the system manufacturer and installer eco friendly solutions ltd the researcher was able to act as a third party auditor to conduct a 10 question semi structured interview with 15 system adopters in placencia to collect information about system performance resources or training materials provided after installation and influential factors that impacted the adopter s choice for a rr system rather than a traditional septic tank in addition to the system adopters 76 semi structured interviews were conducted with non system adopters on the peninsula over the 2013 2015 field seasons on similar themes within the survey the response rate was approximately 31 and the sample was not biased because both adopters and non adopters were interviewed sib 2013 all interview responses were coded translated into average values ranges or common topics among respondents and used to inform the structure and dynamics of the model 4 3 3 participatory observations the participatory observations are used as a means of triangulating theory and practice in order to appropriately situate and validate the field data with information from the literature observations were recorded on a daily and weekly basis in a field notebook methods summaries best practices and general observations i e functionality of rr systems frequency costs of repairs frequency cost of o m events were recorded after each interview site visit and water quality sampling event 5 results and discussion 5 1 determining sensitive variables fig 3 shows the degree of change in the adoption and sustainability performance measures fig 3a and b respectively resulting from the normal distribution of 30 change to variables in each phase metcalf 2001 sterman 2000 the parameter within the knowledge phase of the system model was advertising frequency for the persuasion phase it was stakeholder power for the decision phase it was site demonstration and for the confirmation phase it was education level the last variable spanned both the decision and confirmation phases tank options in fig 3 the x axis represents the percent of change made to the baseline value of a variable and the y axis shows the degree of changes in the adoption performance measure and sustainability measure steep slopes indicate sensitive parameters for the adoption and sustainability performance measures site demonstrations is the most influential parameter however for the sustainability performance measure tank options ranks as the second most sensitive variable followed by advertising frequency stakeholder power and finally educational level table 2 provides details about the strategies developed to target these sensitive variables 5 2 evaluating behavioral performance fig 4 depicts the simulation output dashed line superimposed atop the empirical data solid line that represents an rmse 0 78 the simulated data is well aligned with the empirical data during the first four years but then slightly overshoots a few time periods thereafter due to the influence of the growing stock of persuaded individuals 5 3 testing strategies 5 3 1 marketing strategies the first marketing strategy focuses on advertising frequency the strategy initiates a marketing goal to increase the frequency of online posts from 25 to 50 per year the goal for this strategy is to influence the knowledge stage of the adoption process by increasing the awareness rate fig 2 the model s structure reflects the progressive adoption process where each rate is dependent upon the stock of the previous phase so when strategy 1 influences the awareness rate the subsequent stocks move in the same direction fig 5 shows the way strategy 1 impacts the adoption performance measure by increasing the adopted systems from 133 to approximately 143 over the model s 60 year time horizon strategy 1 also increases rr systems sustainability from 17 to 23 of the time the p values for each performance measure after comparing the baseline values to the strategy implementation scenario indicate no significant differences for this strategy the p value of the adoption measure is 0 074 and the sustainability measure is 0 19 these results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis depicted in fig 3 which shows advertising frequency as only slightly influential to the adoption and sustainability performance measures the next marketing approach is strategy 2 which encourages a doubling of the site demonstration efforts from 2 to 4 events per year during interviews the system installers explained that there were both formal and informal site demonstrations the formal events were held in public buildings with support and permission from community leaders orchestrated with a focus on the performance and cost of the rr systems and although open to the public were targeted towards businesses and hotel owners more than individual households on the other hand informal site demonstrations often occurred during system installations when neighbors would gather and inquire about the benefits and differences between the new unfamiliar wastewater based rr system and the traditional septic tanks overall the importance of increasing site demonstrations reflected a statistically significant impact on both the adoption and sustainability performance measure with a p value of 0 00 and 2 01e 5 respectively the stock of adopted systems more than doubled as did the systems sustainability performance measure these behaviors are consistent with the degrees of change reflected in the sensitivity graphs of fig 3a and b 5 3 2 social strategies the first social strategy strategy 3 focuses on increasing the stakeholders power for the case of this model stakeholder power is the level of confidence community members have in controlling the wastewater infrastructure installed in their area see table 1 the purpose of strategy 3 is to increase the amount of information provided to the public from national and international entities regarding the proposed centralized wastewater system on the peninsula without adequate information many residents feel uncertain about investing in a decentralized rr system because if constructed the centralized system would require everyone to be connected this strategy s aim is to increase the percentage of residents that feel capable of contributing to decision making about their wastewater infrastructure by promoting a clear transmission of information about the proposed system s progress or delay when stakeholders have a robust understanding of the planning and development of their community s wastewater treatment a flexible choice of viable wastewater alternatives and the ability to contribute their local expertise to decision making the value of stakeholder power increases pires et al 2006 wathieu et al 2002 the p value associated with the strategy s impact on the adoption performance measure is 0 35 reflecting no significant impact on system installations the minimal impact is due to the influence that stakeholder power has on behavioral intentions bi this element bi is the product of three parameters stakeholder attitudes stakeholder power and the stock of individuals who are aware of rr systems the range of values for stakeholder attitudes and stakeholder power is much less than the stock i e aware of rr systems as a result the strategy influences a minor change to the persuasion rate and thus a minor change to the subsequent phases including the sustainability performance measure p value 0 49 such results are also in line with minimal sensitivity depicted in fig 3a and b the next social strategy strategy 4 influences the confirmation stage by increasing the adopter s competence about wastewater management on average rr systems require routine o m to ensure adequate treatment that meets water quality standards i e environmental viability and maintains the functional life of the system i e economic viability for the purpose of this model surveys and interviews reflected a range of values for a system adopter s annual income that was budgeted for o m spending field data also revealed that only a fraction of the allocated funds were actually being used and the households with higher educational levels tended to spend more on o m as such it is assumed based upon anecdotal field evidence that an individual s educational level reflects the portion of their budgeted funds being used to manage their rr system the aim of this strategy is to implement public awareness campaigns that increase the average level of wastewater competence from a 6th grade threshold i e 6 grades completed 12 possible grades half portion of budgeted o m funds being spent to an 8th grade level i e 8 grades completed 12 possible grades two thirds of the budgeted o m funds being spent by increasing the education level there is no significant impact to the adoption performance measure p value 0 50 or the system s sustainability p value 0 47 5 3 3 technical strategy the final strategy addresses resource limitations design flexibility and treatment efficiency interviews with system installers revealed that there are only two tank sizes available in belize to construct the rr system 1750 l or 3000 l this hinders the system s adaptability to be reconfigured to serve various locations and population densities furthermore when asked about the number of users for the rr system installers explained that the systems are often sized based upon an adopter s self reported number of users oftentimes a minimum value is reported to justify the installation of a smaller less expensive system when coupling these undersized systems with a rigid set of treatment configurations the treatment performance is compromised because the systems fill quickly reducing the amount of time the wastewater i e hydraulic retention time undergoes biological treatment strategy 5 aims to double the options of tank configurations from 2 to 4 including 1750 3000 4750 6000 l systems the system capacities and sizes are changed to the following ranges of daily users 6 individuals for a 1750 l tank 7 and 9 individuals for a 3000 l tank 10 and 12 individuals for a 4750 l tank and 13 and 16 individuals for a 6000 l tank the effects of strategy 5 are linked to the decision phase of the model through an rr system s payback period the payback period is the quotient of the system s cost i e numerator usd and an individual s yearly budget to spend on the wastewater system i e denominator usd year the structure of the model relates the volume of a tank to its cost as more options for larger tanks become available the cost of an rr system also increases since the amount of funds an adopter budgets for an rr systems is held constant the payback period would increase leading to a decrease in the adoption performance measure consequently fig 5 shows this strategy does not significantly impact the adoption performance measure p value 0 44 on the other hand strategy 5 positively influences the sustainability performance measure by increasing the hydraulic retention time a longer hydraulic retention time improves the rr system s wastewater treatment performance i e increased environmental viability and reduces the amount of emergency evacuations of rr systems when there are less unexpected expenses spent on the rr systems the economic viability increases as such the sustainability of the system s services significantly p 0 012 increases from 17 to 34 of the modeling time lastly strategy 5 is consistent with the sensitivity graphs in fig 3b showing it as the second most influential to sustainability performance of the rr systems 5 4 managerial implications incremental versus paradigm shifting change while the strategies of the baseline model span across marketing social and technological approaches the results only represent incremental improvements to placencia s rr system adoption and sustainability with the model s current structure the maximum improvement to the system s sustainability is that 49 of the time the installed systems will provide adequate services however community based perspectives revealed that improper user behaviors during the pre installation i e user discrepancy and operation of the system i e not routinely recovering resources stifle significant improvement as such system installers and managers should target these areas as leverage points to shift the community s wastewater management paradigm ishii and boyer 2016 reached a similar finding by pointing out the importance of appropriate behavior change and sustained system function as a means of increasing a community s support of urine diverting toilets since a paradigm shift requires behavior change fig 6 depicts these changes within the model s structure specifically the level of sustainability is improved when resource recovery system training occurs and the behavior of routinely recovering resources is promoted the first approach uses specialized training to address behaviors that hinder of rr systems technical performance the aim of resource recovery system training is to adapt technical instructions about the key principles of system design and operation to an individual s current education level interviews and participatory observations from the field indicate there is a lack of awareness of the cause and effect relationship between reporting an inaccurate number of system users or inconsistently performing o m practices and the future costs incurred due to an rr system failure as such this approach would train community members in the explicit links between the short term benefits of saving money i e reducing capital cost of the system by reporting the minimal number of users or withholding the total amount of funds budgeted for o m services and the negative consequences i e price of emergency evacuations or financial penalties enforced from water quality regulations to the systems provisions of wastewater treatment overall the specialized training would bridge the gap between current behavior i e high user discrepancy and low o m expenditures and an ideal wastewater management paradigm i e user discrepancy goes to zero and yearly o m expenditures are aligned with o m costs based on system s design where community members are motivated by a desire to avoid future economic and environmental costs of failed wastewater systems however fig 7 shows that when this approach is simulated the larger tanks increase the capital cost and payback period which reduces the adoption performance measure on the other hand the sustainability performance measure improves because the design scale of the rr systems increases the system s capacity and its wastewater treatment performance the training also improves the o m expenditures which reduces the sludge accumulation rate resulting in better economic and environmental viability and a higher sustainability performance measure i e from 17 to 20 next the approach of recovering resources allows either system adopters or installers managers to maximize the financial gains and technical benefits from routine sludge harvesting this action would contribute to a reduction in the payback period and o m cost by design as well as the sludge accumulation rate interviews and participatory observations confirmed that system adopters in placencia although were aware of their system s resource recovery capabilities rarely practiced the resource recovery behaviors themselves see section 2 instead adopters have either taken an out of sight out of mind approach where they have neglected routine o m or have preferred to pay the installer manager to sporadically perform the resource recovery task consequently this behavioral insight reveals an opportunity for adopters to drive down their payback period by harvesting and selling the sludge to placencia s nearby banana plantations for a modest profit on the other hand due to the economies of scale system installers managers may be more inclined to offer their sludge management services on a regular basis so that the harvested volume and thus their profit is greater when being sold to local agricultural users lastly systematic sludge harvesting reduces the o m cost to adopters i e the price is based upon the volume of sludge being managed and improves the rr systems technical performance i e increased hydraulic retention time when simulating this behavior change the adoption performance measure increases from about 133 to 143 rr systems at the end of the simulation period due to the economic savings that decrease the payback period the approach also reduces the sludge accumulation rate and improves the wastewater treatment capabilities these benefits positively influence the economic and environmental viability and increase the sustainability performance from 17 to 25 over the total simulation period however when the behavior change approaches are simulated together synergies within the model s structure result in a significant effect for example while the resource recovery system training decreased the adoption performance measure i e increased tank sizes greater capital costs and longer payback period the behavior change of recovering resources compensated for that negative effect as the amount of savings from recovered resources increases the payback period decreases and the financial hindrance to adopt this new technology becomes less burdensome furthermore the paradigm shift increases the total working volume of the rr systems through improvements to the system design a higher o m rate and lower sludge accumulation rate the combined effect of these changes drastically improves the technology s sustainability performance measure from 17 to 75 p 0 00 overall the synergies of the combined approaches resulted in fewer instances when no systems were sustained and improved system performance such that the technology could fully recover after instances of failure knowing this it is important to discuss the powerful impact that adopters behaviors have on sustaining the rr systems performance over time unless adopters understand and value the economic and environmental benefits of recovering resources as an integral part of wastewater management the omission of routine o m and other seemingly benign behaviors i e high user discrepancy will continue to cause frequent rr system failures instead if installers managers are interested in contributing to a transformational paradigm shift from viewing wastewater as a problem to be avoided into a resource to be productively used they must transition their focus from the incremental improvements of strategic efforts to the long term benefits of behavior change approaches 6 conclusion this study presents a theory inspired community informed sd model of the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr systems in placencia belize literature based theories were adapted to define the model s framework the structural relationships and quantification of parameters were derived from surveys interviews participatory observations water quality analysis and a process based mass balance model the qualitative perspectives that came from the community informed approach in this research provided site specific nuances that were used to inform the structure of the sd model for instance the social science field methods revealed a discrepancy between the actual and reported number of users of the wastewater systems which impacted both the size of the rr system that was installed as well as its environmental performance with this insight a strategy was developed to increase the tank options that could adapt to variations in system users while also improving the rr system s effluent performance furthermore the sd model s behavior was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies for improving the adoption and sustainability of rr systems in particular site demonstrations a marketing strategy and tank options a technical strategy had significant impacts to the system s sustainability whereas only the site demonstrations influenced the adoption performance measure significantly the system s sustainability however were drastically improved only when a paradigm shift targeting users behaviors was introduced by changing the structure of the sd model the paradigm shift emphasized training community members in the importance of accurate rr system design and o m efforts to improve their value for recovered resources desire to avoid future economic and environmental impacts of failed systems and long term wastewater management capabilities in summary this study focuses on a community in belize but the model s framework is adaptable due to its theory informed foundation and flexible data collection methods for instance the approach may be applied to other geographical locations by making basic adjustments to the model s structure and updating the parameters with site specific data however there are limitations with the amount of data due to the resource constraints e g time funds equipment for collecting various types of data using the mixed methods approach for instance the water quality data section 4 1 were not measured at each point of the treatment processes over time additionally the time series data for rr system installations used for evaluating the model s behavior was very limited i e only 10 years nevertheless this study can guide future research such as implementing the strategies in the field to compare their efficacy at improving rr system adoption and sustainability to the model s simulated output overall this study provides a foundation that can be adjusted for future research and fieldwork to consider strategies and behavior changes

19624,given the increasing vulnerability of communities to the negative impacts of untreated wastewater resource recovery rr systems provide a paradigm shift away from a traditional approach of waste separation and treatment towards a productive recovery of water energy and nutrients the aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr systems to inform technology implementation strategies the study presents a theory informed community influenced system dynamics sd model to provide decision makers with an adaptable tool that simulates system level responses to the strategies that are developed for the coastal town of placencia belize the modeling framework is informed by literature based theories such as the theory of diffusion of innovations tdi and the theory of planned behavior tpb various methods including surveys interviews participatory observations and a water constituents mass balance analysis are used to validate relationships and numerically populate the model the sd model was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that will improve the adoption and sustainability of rr systems site demonstrations marketing strategy made a significant impact on the stock of adopted rr systems the stock of sustained rr systems is driven by the sustainability rate i e economic and environmental viability which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options technical strategy these strategies however only contributed to incremental improvements in the system s sustainability performance this study shows that changing community behaviors i e reporting the correct number of users and reclaiming resources represented by structural change in the sd model is the more significant way to influence the sustainable management of the community s wastewater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords technology adoption community informed modeling mixed method sustainability measure structural change system dynamics 1 introduction wastewater based resource recovery rr systems provide a paradigm shift from the traditional take make waste style of resource management to another perspective that capitalizes on wastewater s ability to generate energy reuse water and recycle nutrients the adoption and sustainability of these systems is important because they provide alternatives to traditional wastewater treatment that is energy and resource intensive css 2016 daigger 2009 oh et al 2010 and reduce the pressures to natural resources that are exacerbated by global climate change and population growth marsalek 2011 thoren et al 2012 however adoption of these systems has not been prevalent in vulnerable coastal areas even though they may mitigate the effects of insufficient wastewater treatment and unrestricted infrastructure development that often plagues these locations daigger 2009 guest et al 2009 walker et al 2012 wells et al 2016 coastal communities are dependent upon the health of their marine ecosystems because of the close proximity for recreation tourism cultural heritage food and environmental protection from storm surges corcoran et al 2010 the health of coastal ecosystems can be indicated by anthropogenic eutrophication and hypoxic zones and linked to land based wastewater practices and population densities peierls et al 1991 vitousek et al 1997 wells et al 2016 however adopting a new technology such as an rr system without properly considering the factors that influence their sustained use and performance can result in the failure or abandonment of such technologies regression to other unsuitable systems or practices and skepticism among local individuals regarding rr systems muga and mihelcic 2008 schweitzer and mihelcic 2012 as such it is important not only to consider the adoption of rr systems but also the factors influencing their sustainability previous studies muga and mihelcic 2008 roomratanapun 2001 tjandraatmadja et al 2013 have investigated the influences that independent factors have on the acceptance and sustainability of wastewater treatment systems roomratanapun 2001 conducted interviews to investigate the effect of a holistic suite of factors i e income knowledge of water quality environmental impact willingness to pay and education on the acceptance of a centralized wastewater treatment project in bangkok and found that willingness to pay was the most important factor to reflect the community s likelihood to adopt the new system furthermore muga and mihelcic 2008 used a multi criteria assessment framework with social economic and environmental indicators to evaluate the sustainability of mechanical lagoon and land based wastewater treatment technologies over their operational life the study emphasized the importance of using geographically specific technology and demographic information to assess the sustainability of a particular system for a distinct location similarly tjandraatmadja et al 2013 used a multi criteria analysis mca as a decision support method for adopting and sustaining innovative treatment options considering life cycle environmental impacts life cycle costs and assigned values for social factors e g acceptance of sewage treatment plant by households interference of sewage treatment plant with household activities while previous studies muga and mihelcic 2008 roomratanapun 2001 tjandraatmadja et al 2013 have considered a wide range of factors impacting the adoption and sustainability of wastewater systems there has been no holistic system level investigation of these factors and dynamics as they influence implementation and sustained use of rr systems a systems based approach was taken in melbourne australia by fagan et al 2010 to assess the sustainability and cost effectiveness of various scenarios e g policy implementation variations in design implementation of innovations and management approaches to aid decision makers in finding solutions to complex urban water issues the study developed simultaneous equations of system level interdependencies among economic environmental energy related and technological factors within an urban water system and found that policies for greenhouse gas ghg reduction would be best focused on the operation phase of water systems while energy reducing technologies are best implemented at the suburban scale rather than the household level fagan et al 2010 additionally fiksel 2006 also promoted a system based perspective that conceptually considers the short term dynamics and long term impacts associated with adopting technologies fueled by renewable resources the study highlights some of the complexities of sustainable development and asserts that system based strategies are the only sufficient means to address such challenges fiksel 2006 nevertheless none of these researchers fagan et al 2010 fiksel 2006 considered community input within their approaches to system adoption and sustainability community perceptions will inevitably influence the adoption and sustained use of technologies usaid 2014 system adopters and operation and maintenance personnel are oftentimes the ones most capable of explaining localized issues influencing the adoption of the rr systems and operational issues impacting the effectiveness of wastewater treatment as such a community informed system level investigation is necessary when investigating the adoption and sustainability of rr technologies overall the aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr technologies in order to provide an adaptable tool for decision makers that simulates system level responses to technology implementation strategies the critical component that is missing from previous studies qualitative perspectives from community members is uniquely incorporated using the system dynamics sd approach the sd approach is used to map the complex network of simultaneous interactions and feedbacks among factors to simulate the system level behavior i e adoption and sustainability performance over time the implementation of this tool in the coastal village of placencia belize reflects its utility to adapt to different locations to investigate various strategies to promote rr systems adoption and sustained use 2 study site the placencia peninsula is located on the southeastern coast of belize at the peninsula s southern most point is placencia village with a population of approximately 1500 individuals sib 2013 the area s primary form of wastewater treatment exists as two or three chambered concrete septic tanks halcrow 2012 wells et al 2016 fig 1 depicts a schematic of the most common type of rr system that some individuals have installed the system includes a semi anaerobic biodigester and drainfield the design threshold for the biodigester tank is 10 users if the number of users is less than or equal to the threshold a 1750 l tank is installed otherwise a 3000 l tank is used the biodigester is designed to reduce biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids tss while the effluent water is used for subsurface fertigation in these systems the nutrient rich water is discharged into a drainfield that is lined with plants whose root systems are responsible for fixing the nutrients to enhance growth and reduce the impact to local water bodies additionally the sludge from the rr systems can also be purged from the tank dried and applied as fertilizer however it is uncommon to see these resource recovery practices being performed by rr system adopters in placencia generally the status of the traditional decentralized systems is such that few undergo routine maintenance which results in un or minimally treated wastewater likely rich in nutrients being discharged into local ecosystems beginning in 2012 the government of belize in conjunction with the inter american development bank idb and the united nations environment program unep partnered together to finance a centralized wastewater system crew 2012 to date the public hearings design proposals and feasibility studies have been conducted but the system has not yet been implemented additionally little explanation has been given to the community about the status of the proposed centralized system as such skepticism exists concerning the likelihood of its implementation affordability and equitable access to all community members 3 model development 3 1 model framework to construct the sd model three theories were chosen as foundational pieces upon which the model s framework was built the theory of diffusion of innovations tdi the theory of planned behavior tpb and the theory of mass conservation tmc fig 2 shows the four phases knowledge persuasion decision confirmation within rogers tdi which influenced the sequential structure of the sd model rogers 2003 the sequential structure reflects individuals transitions from an initial knowledge about the rr system through the confirmation phase where adopters demonstrate behaviors to sustain the wastewater technology rogers 2003 some common factors i e word of mouth and basic dynamics for each phase were formulated after sterman s classic sd model of the tdi decision phase sterman 2000 next the structure includes modified components of tpb such as a subjective norm i e those who are aware of rr systems attitudes about the innovation and one s perceived behavioral control i e stakeholder power as they influence behavioral intentions to adopt the wastewater technology madden et al 1992 specifically the concept of perceived behavioral control represents a stakeholder s assurance of possessing the necessary resources i e decision making power and or information to achieve a desired outcome i e adopting the technology madden et al 1992 sterman 2000 overall this study leverages some of the components of tpb to enable the modeler to simplify and reflect the socio political complexities in placencia that affect the behavioral intentions of an individual as they transition from being aware of rr systems to becoming persuaded to perform the adopting behavior see site background for details finally the water constituents mass balance model was developed using the tmc more details in supplementary materials to account for the impact that adopters behaviors or evolving rr system designs have on its technical performance i e effluent water quality rooting the model in a theoretically informed foundation is beneficial because the structure can be further adapted to reflect the adoption and sustainability dynamics of other technologies in various geographic locations 3 2 model formulation fig 2 depicts a simplified version of the entire sd model for the phases involved in technology adoption and sustainability along with the theories that influence each phase s structure table 1 reflects a few of the model factors definitions equations and units used to formulate the model ajzen 1991 ajzen and madden 1986 davis et al 1989 ergas and aponte morales 2014 forrester and senge 1996 ikhazuangbe and oni 2015 metcalf 2001 philip et al 1993 pires et al 2006 rittmann and mccarty 2001 rogers 2002 struck and borst 2008 wathieu et al 2002 woo 2015 further details including the entire list of factors and equations in the model can be found in the supplementary materials 3 3 model evaluation the model s adoption behavior is gauged by the stock of those who have decided to adopt rr systems the sustainability performance measure is defined in a unique way for this study as the portion of rr systems that are sustained over the full time horizon of the model simulation the sustained rr systems are those that meet effluent water quality standards i e environmental viability in an affordable way i e economic viability with consideration of the system adopters education level equation 1 shows the sustainability performance measure as the percentage of adopted rr systems providing sustained service over the entire run time of the model 1 s u s t a i n a b i l i t y p e r f o r m a n c e m e a s u r e t 1 t s u s t a i n e d r r s y s t e m s a d o p t e d r r s y s t e m s t 100 where t is the simulation time step and t is the total period of the model s simulation next the model validation process includes three steps a structure test structure oriented behavior test and behavior test sterman 2000 first a structure test is completed prior to the model s simulation by systematically inspecting each causal relationship the variables and associated units and assuring their consistent clear and concise definitions are in line with available knowledge experience from the field and relevant literature forrester and senge 1996 sterman 2000 when the model s structure is determined to be reliable the simultaneous multi variant equations are run with vensim software to simulate the overall behavior of the system next are two structure oriented behavior tests extreme conditions testing and sensitivity analysis extreme conditions testing provides confidence in the structure of the model to reflect appropriate behavior under extreme conditions forrester and senge 1996 sterman 2000 for example when the advertising frequency and advertising effectiveness were reduced to minimum values i e 1 and 0 01 respectively the awareness rate which controls the transfer of individuals from unaware to aware of rr systems was drastically reduced furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of input parameters from each phase of the adoption process on the overall system behavior a normal distribution ranging from 30 of the baseline value is simulated 200 times over a 60 year projection the most sensitive variables with the largest degree of impact to the system s performance measures are used to develop strategies to increase the stock of rr systems adopted and sustained over time metcalf 2001 lastly the behavior test is conducted to provide statistical confidence that when the model is populated with site specific information its structure produces output data similar to the empirical values sterman 2000 empirical data i e the number of rr systems adopted in placencia belize was provided by the rr system installer ecofriendly solutions for the years 2005 2015 the root mean squared error rmse is calculated between the model simulation and empirical datasets for this model if the rmse is 0 8 the simulation output can be considered behaviorally consistent with the empirical data sterman 2000 3 4 strategy simulation following the model s performance evaluation there is confidence that the proposed structure adequately represents the factors and dynamics that influence the adoption and sustainability of rr systems in placencia belize effective strategies are designed to increase the adoption and sustainability of rr technologies by changing the sensitive variables within the model s structure the significance of each strategy s impact on the adoption and sustainability performance measures is then determined by conducting z tests a one sample z test compares the averages of the model s baseline values alongside the model s output after simulation with the strategies the null hypothesis prior to each z test is that the average for baseline and strategy implementation is the same however if the p value associated with the z test is 0 05 then the difference between baseline and strategy implementation is significant 4 data collection methods wastewater technologies regardless of system scale or geographic location cannot be completely disassociated from the end users who benefit from their successful operation consequently a mixed method approach is employed in this study to collect site specific qualitative and quantitative data to populate the variables and represent the relationships and feedbacks 4 1 measured data the government of belize s department of environment doe regulates six parameters for decentralized wastewater effluents ph fats oils greases biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss fecal coliforms and enterococci doe 2009 grab samples were taken from effluent points of the rr systems and analyzed using standard analytical methods for bod and tss to characterize the wastewater s strength to impact the environment 4 2 simulated data the study developed a technology specific mass balance model to reflect the rr system s processes for treating fecal inert and bacterial solids and the liquid substrate concentrations see supplementary materials the equations were defined and populated with relevant site data and literature based kinetic parameters for domestic wastewater to calculate the system s efficiency ergas and aponte morales 2014 ikhazuangbe and oni 2015 rittmann and mccarty 2001 struck and borst 2008 woo 2015 the effluent concentrations were calculated using the mass balance model and verified with the measured water quality data 4 3 social data 4 3 1 surveys the survey questions were developed by an interdisciplinary group of anthropologists and environmental engineers the purpose of these surveys was to elicit information from community members about the value they give to environmental economic and health factors as they make decisions about adopting wastewater technologies furthermore the surveys were also used to reveal information about community level perceptions of the power they believe they should have in making decisions about wastewater based rr systems when the questionnaire was finalized and prior to surveying in the field the research group applied for institutional review board irb certification irb cr2 pro00012766 soon thereafter the approved questionnaire was uploaded onto a smart phone using a free electronic platform called kobo anokwa 2011 cairns 2014 a total of 157 surveys were conducted using convenience sampling with an approximate 53 response rate sib 2013 4 3 2 semi structured interviews leveraging a community partnership with the system manufacturer and installer eco friendly solutions ltd the researcher was able to act as a third party auditor to conduct a 10 question semi structured interview with 15 system adopters in placencia to collect information about system performance resources or training materials provided after installation and influential factors that impacted the adopter s choice for a rr system rather than a traditional septic tank in addition to the system adopters 76 semi structured interviews were conducted with non system adopters on the peninsula over the 2013 2015 field seasons on similar themes within the survey the response rate was approximately 31 and the sample was not biased because both adopters and non adopters were interviewed sib 2013 all interview responses were coded translated into average values ranges or common topics among respondents and used to inform the structure and dynamics of the model 4 3 3 participatory observations the participatory observations are used as a means of triangulating theory and practice in order to appropriately situate and validate the field data with information from the literature observations were recorded on a daily and weekly basis in a field notebook methods summaries best practices and general observations i e functionality of rr systems frequency costs of repairs frequency cost of o m events were recorded after each interview site visit and water quality sampling event 5 results and discussion 5 1 determining sensitive variables fig 3 shows the degree of change in the adoption and sustainability performance measures fig 3a and b respectively resulting from the normal distribution of 30 change to variables in each phase metcalf 2001 sterman 2000 the parameter within the knowledge phase of the system model was advertising frequency for the persuasion phase it was stakeholder power for the decision phase it was site demonstration and for the confirmation phase it was education level the last variable spanned both the decision and confirmation phases tank options in fig 3 the x axis represents the percent of change made to the baseline value of a variable and the y axis shows the degree of changes in the adoption performance measure and sustainability measure steep slopes indicate sensitive parameters for the adoption and sustainability performance measures site demonstrations is the most influential parameter however for the sustainability performance measure tank options ranks as the second most sensitive variable followed by advertising frequency stakeholder power and finally educational level table 2 provides details about the strategies developed to target these sensitive variables 5 2 evaluating behavioral performance fig 4 depicts the simulation output dashed line superimposed atop the empirical data solid line that represents an rmse 0 78 the simulated data is well aligned with the empirical data during the first four years but then slightly overshoots a few time periods thereafter due to the influence of the growing stock of persuaded individuals 5 3 testing strategies 5 3 1 marketing strategies the first marketing strategy focuses on advertising frequency the strategy initiates a marketing goal to increase the frequency of online posts from 25 to 50 per year the goal for this strategy is to influence the knowledge stage of the adoption process by increasing the awareness rate fig 2 the model s structure reflects the progressive adoption process where each rate is dependent upon the stock of the previous phase so when strategy 1 influences the awareness rate the subsequent stocks move in the same direction fig 5 shows the way strategy 1 impacts the adoption performance measure by increasing the adopted systems from 133 to approximately 143 over the model s 60 year time horizon strategy 1 also increases rr systems sustainability from 17 to 23 of the time the p values for each performance measure after comparing the baseline values to the strategy implementation scenario indicate no significant differences for this strategy the p value of the adoption measure is 0 074 and the sustainability measure is 0 19 these results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis depicted in fig 3 which shows advertising frequency as only slightly influential to the adoption and sustainability performance measures the next marketing approach is strategy 2 which encourages a doubling of the site demonstration efforts from 2 to 4 events per year during interviews the system installers explained that there were both formal and informal site demonstrations the formal events were held in public buildings with support and permission from community leaders orchestrated with a focus on the performance and cost of the rr systems and although open to the public were targeted towards businesses and hotel owners more than individual households on the other hand informal site demonstrations often occurred during system installations when neighbors would gather and inquire about the benefits and differences between the new unfamiliar wastewater based rr system and the traditional septic tanks overall the importance of increasing site demonstrations reflected a statistically significant impact on both the adoption and sustainability performance measure with a p value of 0 00 and 2 01e 5 respectively the stock of adopted systems more than doubled as did the systems sustainability performance measure these behaviors are consistent with the degrees of change reflected in the sensitivity graphs of fig 3a and b 5 3 2 social strategies the first social strategy strategy 3 focuses on increasing the stakeholders power for the case of this model stakeholder power is the level of confidence community members have in controlling the wastewater infrastructure installed in their area see table 1 the purpose of strategy 3 is to increase the amount of information provided to the public from national and international entities regarding the proposed centralized wastewater system on the peninsula without adequate information many residents feel uncertain about investing in a decentralized rr system because if constructed the centralized system would require everyone to be connected this strategy s aim is to increase the percentage of residents that feel capable of contributing to decision making about their wastewater infrastructure by promoting a clear transmission of information about the proposed system s progress or delay when stakeholders have a robust understanding of the planning and development of their community s wastewater treatment a flexible choice of viable wastewater alternatives and the ability to contribute their local expertise to decision making the value of stakeholder power increases pires et al 2006 wathieu et al 2002 the p value associated with the strategy s impact on the adoption performance measure is 0 35 reflecting no significant impact on system installations the minimal impact is due to the influence that stakeholder power has on behavioral intentions bi this element bi is the product of three parameters stakeholder attitudes stakeholder power and the stock of individuals who are aware of rr systems the range of values for stakeholder attitudes and stakeholder power is much less than the stock i e aware of rr systems as a result the strategy influences a minor change to the persuasion rate and thus a minor change to the subsequent phases including the sustainability performance measure p value 0 49 such results are also in line with minimal sensitivity depicted in fig 3a and b the next social strategy strategy 4 influences the confirmation stage by increasing the adopter s competence about wastewater management on average rr systems require routine o m to ensure adequate treatment that meets water quality standards i e environmental viability and maintains the functional life of the system i e economic viability for the purpose of this model surveys and interviews reflected a range of values for a system adopter s annual income that was budgeted for o m spending field data also revealed that only a fraction of the allocated funds were actually being used and the households with higher educational levels tended to spend more on o m as such it is assumed based upon anecdotal field evidence that an individual s educational level reflects the portion of their budgeted funds being used to manage their rr system the aim of this strategy is to implement public awareness campaigns that increase the average level of wastewater competence from a 6th grade threshold i e 6 grades completed 12 possible grades half portion of budgeted o m funds being spent to an 8th grade level i e 8 grades completed 12 possible grades two thirds of the budgeted o m funds being spent by increasing the education level there is no significant impact to the adoption performance measure p value 0 50 or the system s sustainability p value 0 47 5 3 3 technical strategy the final strategy addresses resource limitations design flexibility and treatment efficiency interviews with system installers revealed that there are only two tank sizes available in belize to construct the rr system 1750 l or 3000 l this hinders the system s adaptability to be reconfigured to serve various locations and population densities furthermore when asked about the number of users for the rr system installers explained that the systems are often sized based upon an adopter s self reported number of users oftentimes a minimum value is reported to justify the installation of a smaller less expensive system when coupling these undersized systems with a rigid set of treatment configurations the treatment performance is compromised because the systems fill quickly reducing the amount of time the wastewater i e hydraulic retention time undergoes biological treatment strategy 5 aims to double the options of tank configurations from 2 to 4 including 1750 3000 4750 6000 l systems the system capacities and sizes are changed to the following ranges of daily users 6 individuals for a 1750 l tank 7 and 9 individuals for a 3000 l tank 10 and 12 individuals for a 4750 l tank and 13 and 16 individuals for a 6000 l tank the effects of strategy 5 are linked to the decision phase of the model through an rr system s payback period the payback period is the quotient of the system s cost i e numerator usd and an individual s yearly budget to spend on the wastewater system i e denominator usd year the structure of the model relates the volume of a tank to its cost as more options for larger tanks become available the cost of an rr system also increases since the amount of funds an adopter budgets for an rr systems is held constant the payback period would increase leading to a decrease in the adoption performance measure consequently fig 5 shows this strategy does not significantly impact the adoption performance measure p value 0 44 on the other hand strategy 5 positively influences the sustainability performance measure by increasing the hydraulic retention time a longer hydraulic retention time improves the rr system s wastewater treatment performance i e increased environmental viability and reduces the amount of emergency evacuations of rr systems when there are less unexpected expenses spent on the rr systems the economic viability increases as such the sustainability of the system s services significantly p 0 012 increases from 17 to 34 of the modeling time lastly strategy 5 is consistent with the sensitivity graphs in fig 3b showing it as the second most influential to sustainability performance of the rr systems 5 4 managerial implications incremental versus paradigm shifting change while the strategies of the baseline model span across marketing social and technological approaches the results only represent incremental improvements to placencia s rr system adoption and sustainability with the model s current structure the maximum improvement to the system s sustainability is that 49 of the time the installed systems will provide adequate services however community based perspectives revealed that improper user behaviors during the pre installation i e user discrepancy and operation of the system i e not routinely recovering resources stifle significant improvement as such system installers and managers should target these areas as leverage points to shift the community s wastewater management paradigm ishii and boyer 2016 reached a similar finding by pointing out the importance of appropriate behavior change and sustained system function as a means of increasing a community s support of urine diverting toilets since a paradigm shift requires behavior change fig 6 depicts these changes within the model s structure specifically the level of sustainability is improved when resource recovery system training occurs and the behavior of routinely recovering resources is promoted the first approach uses specialized training to address behaviors that hinder of rr systems technical performance the aim of resource recovery system training is to adapt technical instructions about the key principles of system design and operation to an individual s current education level interviews and participatory observations from the field indicate there is a lack of awareness of the cause and effect relationship between reporting an inaccurate number of system users or inconsistently performing o m practices and the future costs incurred due to an rr system failure as such this approach would train community members in the explicit links between the short term benefits of saving money i e reducing capital cost of the system by reporting the minimal number of users or withholding the total amount of funds budgeted for o m services and the negative consequences i e price of emergency evacuations or financial penalties enforced from water quality regulations to the systems provisions of wastewater treatment overall the specialized training would bridge the gap between current behavior i e high user discrepancy and low o m expenditures and an ideal wastewater management paradigm i e user discrepancy goes to zero and yearly o m expenditures are aligned with o m costs based on system s design where community members are motivated by a desire to avoid future economic and environmental costs of failed wastewater systems however fig 7 shows that when this approach is simulated the larger tanks increase the capital cost and payback period which reduces the adoption performance measure on the other hand the sustainability performance measure improves because the design scale of the rr systems increases the system s capacity and its wastewater treatment performance the training also improves the o m expenditures which reduces the sludge accumulation rate resulting in better economic and environmental viability and a higher sustainability performance measure i e from 17 to 20 next the approach of recovering resources allows either system adopters or installers managers to maximize the financial gains and technical benefits from routine sludge harvesting this action would contribute to a reduction in the payback period and o m cost by design as well as the sludge accumulation rate interviews and participatory observations confirmed that system adopters in placencia although were aware of their system s resource recovery capabilities rarely practiced the resource recovery behaviors themselves see section 2 instead adopters have either taken an out of sight out of mind approach where they have neglected routine o m or have preferred to pay the installer manager to sporadically perform the resource recovery task consequently this behavioral insight reveals an opportunity for adopters to drive down their payback period by harvesting and selling the sludge to placencia s nearby banana plantations for a modest profit on the other hand due to the economies of scale system installers managers may be more inclined to offer their sludge management services on a regular basis so that the harvested volume and thus their profit is greater when being sold to local agricultural users lastly systematic sludge harvesting reduces the o m cost to adopters i e the price is based upon the volume of sludge being managed and improves the rr systems technical performance i e increased hydraulic retention time when simulating this behavior change the adoption performance measure increases from about 133 to 143 rr systems at the end of the simulation period due to the economic savings that decrease the payback period the approach also reduces the sludge accumulation rate and improves the wastewater treatment capabilities these benefits positively influence the economic and environmental viability and increase the sustainability performance from 17 to 25 over the total simulation period however when the behavior change approaches are simulated together synergies within the model s structure result in a significant effect for example while the resource recovery system training decreased the adoption performance measure i e increased tank sizes greater capital costs and longer payback period the behavior change of recovering resources compensated for that negative effect as the amount of savings from recovered resources increases the payback period decreases and the financial hindrance to adopt this new technology becomes less burdensome furthermore the paradigm shift increases the total working volume of the rr systems through improvements to the system design a higher o m rate and lower sludge accumulation rate the combined effect of these changes drastically improves the technology s sustainability performance measure from 17 to 75 p 0 00 overall the synergies of the combined approaches resulted in fewer instances when no systems were sustained and improved system performance such that the technology could fully recover after instances of failure knowing this it is important to discuss the powerful impact that adopters behaviors have on sustaining the rr systems performance over time unless adopters understand and value the economic and environmental benefits of recovering resources as an integral part of wastewater management the omission of routine o m and other seemingly benign behaviors i e high user discrepancy will continue to cause frequent rr system failures instead if installers managers are interested in contributing to a transformational paradigm shift from viewing wastewater as a problem to be avoided into a resource to be productively used they must transition their focus from the incremental improvements of strategic efforts to the long term benefits of behavior change approaches 6 conclusion this study presents a theory inspired community informed sd model of the adoption and sustainability of wastewater based rr systems in placencia belize literature based theories were adapted to define the model s framework the structural relationships and quantification of parameters were derived from surveys interviews participatory observations water quality analysis and a process based mass balance model the qualitative perspectives that came from the community informed approach in this research provided site specific nuances that were used to inform the structure of the sd model for instance the social science field methods revealed a discrepancy between the actual and reported number of users of the wastewater systems which impacted both the size of the rr system that was installed as well as its environmental performance with this insight a strategy was developed to increase the tank options that could adapt to variations in system users while also improving the rr system s effluent performance furthermore the sd model s behavior was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies for improving the adoption and sustainability of rr systems in particular site demonstrations a marketing strategy and tank options a technical strategy had significant impacts to the system s sustainability whereas only the site demonstrations influenced the adoption performance measure significantly the system s sustainability however were drastically improved only when a paradigm shift targeting users behaviors was introduced by changing the structure of the sd model the paradigm shift emphasized training community members in the importance of accurate rr system design and o m efforts to improve their value for recovered resources desire to avoid future economic and environmental impacts of failed systems and long term wastewater management capabilities in summary this study focuses on a community in belize but the model s framework is adaptable due to its theory informed foundation and flexible data collection methods for instance the approach may be applied to other geographical locations by making basic adjustments to the model s structure and updating the parameters with site specific data however there are limitations with the amount of data due to the resource constraints e g time funds equipment for collecting various types of data using the mixed methods approach for instance the water quality data section 4 1 were not measured at each point of the treatment processes over time additionally the time series data for rr system installations used for evaluating the model s behavior was very limited i e only 10 years nevertheless this study can guide future research such as implementing the strategies in the field to compare their efficacy at improving rr system adoption and sustainability to the model s simulated output overall this study provides a foundation that can be adjusted for future research and fieldwork to consider strategies and behavior changes
