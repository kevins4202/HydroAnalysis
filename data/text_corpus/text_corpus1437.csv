7185,underground pumped storage hydropower upsh using abandoned mines is an alternative system to manage electricity production in flat regions water from an underground reservoir is pumped to a surface reservoir to store electricity in the form of potential energy later water is discharged through turbines into the underground reservoir to produce electricity when demand increases during this operation the water hydrochemistry continuously evolves it varies in order to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere in the surface reservoir and with the surrounding porous medium and groundwater in the underground reservoir the hydrochemical variations may lead to reactions in the reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium causing potentially negative consequences for the environment and the system efficiency especially when pyrite is present in the surrounding porous medium in this case pyrite oxidation leads to a decrease in ph and the precipitation of goethite or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir the decrease in ph is mitigated when calcite is present in the porous medium however other concerns may arise such as slight increases in ph the precipitation of ferrihydrite and calcite in the surface reservoir and the oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of calcite in the surrounding porous medium understanding the ph variations and the precipitation dissolution of minerals is of paramount importance in terms of the environmental impacts and system efficiency for this reason this work investigates the main hydrochemical changes and their associated consequences when abandoned deep mines are used for upsh by means of numerical modelling the main objective is to highlight the importance of considering hydrochemical aspects when designing future upsh plants keywords energy storage system reactive transport modelling deep mine pyrite calcite 1 introduction the main concern related to renewable energies such as solar or wind energies is that the electricity production is highly variable and cannot be adapted to the demand okazaki et al 2015 athari and ardehali 2016 giordano et al 2016 hu et al 2016 mileva et al 2016 this fact reduces their efficiency and limits their applicability energy storage systems esss are a solution to manage the variable electricity production of renewable sources and to increase their use gebretsadik et al 2016 such systems allow the storage of excess electricity generated during periods of low energy demand and the production of electricity when the demand increases delfanti et al 2015 mason 2015 pumped storage hydropower psh is the most used ess epri 2010 it allows the storage and production of a large amount of electricity steffen 2012 psh plants consist of two water reservoirs located at different elevations the excess electricity is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir thus storing electricity in the form of potential energy when the energy demand increases water is discharged from the upper to the lower reservoir through turbines to produce electricity hadjipaschalis et al 2009 although psh is widely used zhang et al 2016 such systems are constrained by topographic aspects because the reservoirs must be located at different elevations limiting the locations where plants can be constructed mueller et al 2015 in addition psh is controversial regarding its impacts on the landscape land use environment vegetation and wildlife and society relocations wong 1996 kucukali 2014 consequently new types of esss have been evoked as potential alternatives during the last years one of them is the underground pumped storage hydropower upsh uddin and asce 2003 where the lower reservoir is underground while the upper one is located at the surface barnes and levine 2011 upsh has been considered and some projects have been planned in different parts of the world however there are no bibliographical evidence of constructed upsh plants for instance a project was started in the 1980s in the netherlands but the plant was eventually not installed for different reasons such as unsuitable characteristics of the underground area spriet 2014 similarly wong 1996 proposed the installation of upsh plants in singapore using abandoned quarries as surface reservoirs and excavating the underground reservoirs more recently severson 2011 suggested potential sites to establish a taconite mine in minnesota usa and to use the excavated cavity after the mining activities as the underground reservoir for a upsh plant upsh has also been investigated in germany alvarado et al 2016 zillmann and perau 2015 luick et al 2012 belgium spriet 2014 spain menéndez et al 2017 and south africa khan and davidson 2016 winde et al 2017 the most important benefit of upsh in comparison with psh is that upsh is not limited by the topography and could even be used in flat regions consequently more possibilities exist to establish upsh plants meyer 2013 impacts associated with landscape land use and society relocations are lower than those of psh because at least one of the reservoirs is located underground environmental impacts are different than those produced by psh and must be evaluated carefully in addition re used abandoned mines would provide added value to local communities after the cessation of mining activities the main concern regarding the use of abandoned mines is that mine walls are generally not waterproofed thus upsh plants interact with the surrounding porous medium exchanging water to date this interaction has only been studied from a flow point of view some studies have been focused on the impacts related to water exchange 1 on the piezometric head field pujades et al 2016 poulain et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 and 2 on the efficiency of the plant pujades et al 2017a however there are no studies to date that have assessed the hydrochemical modifications induced by upsh and its associated impacts on the environment and the efficiency induced hydrochemical modifications have not been reported to date given that this is an emergent ees in fact as previously mentioned there are no bibliographical evidence of operational upsh plants however the chemical particularities of mine waters and their behaviour have been recognised as important challenges for the application of upsh eera 2016 in addition similarities between upsh and managed aquifer recharge in which occurred hydrochemical changes are well known johnson et al 1999 barker et al 2016 antoniou et al 2017 suggest that analogous changes may take place in upsh systems obviously the hydrochemical changes would be different since water is also pumped in upsh and it reaches the surrounding porous medium through an underground cavity for these reasons it is meaningful to study the specific hydrochemical aspects associated to upsh under natural conditions water in the underground reservoir and groundwater in the surrounding porous medium are in chemical equilibrium with the porous materials once the activity of the upsh plants starts water from the underground reservoir is pumped discharged and stored in the surface reservoir during this operation water is aerated and therefore its chemical composition evolves to a new chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere this equilibrium is directly related to a variation in the dissolved o2 and co2 concentrations when this water is subsequently discharged from the surface to the underground reservoir it evolves again towards another chemical equilibrium with the surrounding porous medium this continuous evolution of the water chemistry may lead to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals and their associated impacts such as variations in ph for example the oxidation of sulfides which are common in coal mined environments younger et al 2002 would result in groundwater with a very low ph bigham and nordstrom 2000 as a result the upsh activity would possibly affect the surrounding groundwater quality if part of the pumped water must be discharged in surface water bodies because groundwater inflows fill the underground cavity pujades et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 the quality of these surface water bodies could also be affected these environmental issues are of paramount importance because future upsh plants should respect the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec to ensure a good state of water bodies and especially groundwater bodies hydrochemical changes are also relevant in terms of efficiency low ph values may accelerate the corrosion of equipment pipes pumps turbines concrete structures kapil and bhattacharyya 2016 sharma et al 2011 whilst minerals precipitation may alter their mechanical efficiency sterpejkowicz wersocki 2014 thus hydrochemical changes may lead to a decrease of efficiency and durability of the facilities moreover periodical maintenance and cleaning tasks may be required for all these reasons it is crucial to anticipate hydrochemical changes induced by upsh and their consequences on the environment and the efficiency of the system this issue is investigated in this work through numerical reactive transport models the main reactive transport processes associated with the groundwater upsh water interactions are simulated considering three synthetic cases the main objectives of this work are 1 to prove that upsh activities can induced relevant hydrochemical changes 2 to show that these changes may entail negative consequences for the environment and the efficiency of the system and 3 to highlight the importance of considering them in the design of future upsh plants to ensure their feasibility 2 materials and methods 2 1 problem statement the problem is sketched schematically in fig 1 an underground reservoir 50 m by 50 m on 10 m of height located in an unconfined aquifer is considered the top and bottom of the underground reservoir are at a depth of 95 and 105 m respectively the surrounding porous medium is 200 m thick and the external boundaries are located 500 m away from the underground reservoir in natural conditions groundwater flows from the western to the eastern boundary the head is considered to be at depths of 92 5 and 97 5 m on the west and east boundaries respectively under natural conditions the water table is located just at the top of the underground reservoir 95 m depth which is therefore totally saturated 2 1 1 chemistry of the porous medium abandoned coal mines are potential underground cavities to be used as underground reservoirs for constructing upsh plants sulfide minerals whose oxidation may entail important consequences for water chemistry are common in coal deposits and pyrite is usually the most common sulfide mineral in coal mined environments akcil and koldas 2006 thus hypothesis 1 h1 considers that the geological medium contains 1 pyrite the percentage of pyrite is not too much relevant since it is not totally consumed during the simulation time coal mine deposits surrounded by carbonates or containing lenses or intercalated layers of carbonates have been worldwide reported sharma et al 2013 campaner et al 2014 xu et al 2018 and carbonates counterbalance the negative effects produced by pyrite oxidation when carbonates i e limestone are present as intercalated layers or lenses the global percentage is rapidly higher than for pyrite as pyrite minerals are usually scattered within the coal beds for these reasons hypothesis 2 h2 considers that the geological medium contains 1 pyrite and 10 calcite the percentage of calcite carbonates ensure that the neutralization acidic potential of the surrounding porous medium allows counterbalancing totally the effects of pyrite oxidation because the neutralization potential ratio is higher than 4 price et al 1997 hypotheses 1 and 2 represent the two boundary scenarios in which the neutralization capacity is null h1 or total h2 results of intermediate scenarios in which the carbonate pyrite ratio is lower than that considered in h2 would be comprehended by those obtained for hypotheses h1 and h2 finally the presence of only calcite 10 is considered in hypothesis 3 h3 for two reasons on the one hand underground limestone mines koch 1987 hustrulid et al 2001 are also considered to be used as underground reservoirs for upsh on the other hand the expected behaviour is very different to that occurring when pyrite is present note that these percentages refer to the initial concentrations and the conditions will evolve depending on the reactions it is assumed that the rest of the porous medium is made up of silicates whose reaction rates are very slow white and brantley 1995 and can be neglected silicate dissolution and ion exchange may be possible johnson et al 1999 which has been proved in works developed in the field of aquifer managed recharge and should be considered in some situations however the rate of silicate dissolution particularly phyllosilicates is orders of magnitude slower than calcite and pyrite palandri and yousif 2004 and therefore they are expected to play a subordinate role in the water chemistry anyway the objective of this work is to establish the main trends and highlight the importance of considering the hydrochemistry in the design of future upsh plants for this reason only minerals pyrite and calcite whose behavior is well known are selected obviously the composition of the geological medium in real cases is much more complex and preliminary studies performed before constructing upsh plants must consider all the existing minerals and all the processes 2 1 2 pumping and discharging frequencies the actual pumping and discharging frequency cannot be forecasted this depends on numerous factors such as the day season meteorology electrical smart grid optimization scenarios or economic issues therefore at this stage representative results are obtained assuming day night cycles of 12 h i e water is pumped for 12 h and discharged during the next 12 h the underground reservoir is considered almost empty and almost full after each pumping discharging phase thus given the dimensions of the underground reservoir pumping discharging rates are chosen to be 43 000 m3 d note that the underground reservoir is not totally emptied at the end of each cycle a residual water depth of 1 4 m is intentionally left in the reservoir to keep nodes from which water is pumped and injected in a fully saturated zone appendix a shows the results of a sensitivity analysis in which the pumping discharging rate is reduced by half 2 2 basic concepts the most relevant reactions that occur in the modelled hypotheses and their consequences are summarized in this section water aeration occurs each time that water is discharged and stored in the surface reservoir this process induces co2 and o2 exchanges between the water and the atmosphere thus r1 c o 2 aq c o 2 g r2 o 2 aq o 2 g the presence of pyrite is assumed in the h1 and h2 hypotheses when the o2 concentration in the water increases as a consequence of r2 pyrite is oxidized and ferrihydrite may precipitate as follows r3 fe s 2 15 4 o 2 aq 7 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 s 2 so 4 2 4 h ferrihydrite fe oh 3 precipitation induced by reaction r3 occurs if the water ph is higher than 6 other minerals precipitate at low ph ranges goethite feooh 3 h may precipitate between ph 4 and ph 6 whilst schwertmannite f e 8 o 8 oh 4 5 s o 4 1 75 may precipitate at ph values lower than 4 sánchez españa et al 2011 goethite and schwertmannite precipitate as follows r4 f e 3 2 h 2 o feooh 3 h r5 8 f e 3 12 5 h 2 o 1 75 so 4 2 f e 8 o 8 oh 4 5 s o 4 1 75 20 5 h the common characteristic of these three reactions is that they reduce the ph these reactions are characteristic of acid mine drainage processes banks et al 1997 robb 1994 pyrite oxidation in the numerical model is calculated using the kinetic law described by williamson and rimstidt 1994 and considering a specific surface area of 1000 m 1 calcite in the surrounding porous medium is considered for the h2 and h3 hypotheses in this case the following reaction occurs r6 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 aq r6 does not occur in a unidirectional way and if the pco2 is modified calcite may precipitate or be dissolved for example surface aeration of the pumped water induces a reduction of pco2 and as a result calcite precipitates the kinetics of calcite are implemented in the model using the kinetic law defined by plummer et al 1978 and considering a specific surface area of 45 3 m 1 thermodynamic data for aqueous speciation and mineral and gas solubility are taken from the wateq database as implemented in the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the solubility constant of schwertmannite is taken from sánchez españa et al 2011 under the h1 hypothesis the aeration of the water pumped into the surface reservoir would increase the po2 when this water is discharged into the underground reservoir it oxidizes pyrite and reduces the ph in addition when the water is stored in the surface reservoir ferrihydrite goethite or schwertmannite precipitate in h2 pyrite oxidation would induce the dissolution of calcite which acts as a buffer preventing a decrease in ph on the other hand under the h2 and h3 hypotheses the decrease in pco2 in the surface reservoir could produce calcite precipitation note that upsh plants may act as co2 sources because pco2 increases each time that water is discharged into the underground reservoir therefore co2 emission is quantified under the h2 and h3 hypotheses the influence of the specific surface area is assessed in a sensitivity analysis whose results are shown in the appendix a 2 3 numerical model the problem was simulated using the code phast parkhurst et al 1995 parkhurst and kipp 2002 this code solves multicomponent reactive solute transport in three dimensional saturated groundwater flow parkhurst et al 2010 geochemical reactions are solved by the code phreeqc parkhurst 1995 parkhurst and appelo 1999 flow and transport are computed with a modified version of hst3d kipp 1987 1997 it is possible to identify a line of symmetry crossing the domain from the west to the east boundary located just in the centre of the considered problem figs 1 and 2 a therefore the problem can be simplified by taking advantage of this symmetry and only a half of the domain is modelled fig 2a this simplification does not affect the results and allows reducing the computation times the modelled domain is divided into 15 600 elements refined in and around the underground reservoir fig 2b the size of the elements ranges from 2 to 100 m the flow and transport parameters are the same for the three hypotheses for the porous medium the hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficient s are chosen as 0 01 m d and 0 05 respectively the longitudinal αl and transversal αt dispersivities are assumed to be 10 and 1 m respectively the underground reservoir i e cavity is modelled by adopting a high value of k 106 m d s of 1 and a dispersivity of 104 m in the three directions this value of dispersivity means that mixing of the discharged water in the underground reservoir is rapid and homogeneous this assumption is acceptable because a large volume of water is discharged within a short period of time facilitating the mixing note that the influence of the dispersivity used to simulate the underground reservoir has been previously evaluated and is considered negligible pujades et al 2017b 2 3 1 flow boundary conditions bcs dirichlet boundary conditions bcs are adopted at the western and eastern boundaries an initial hydraulic gradient of 0 005 is modelled by prescribing the piezometric head at a depth of 92 5 and 97 5 m on the western and eastern boundaries respectively pumping and discharging rates of 21 500 m3 d are simulated by prescribing neumann bcs in nodes located at the base of the underground reservoir this rate allows for the dewatering and filling of 8 6 m of the cavity in half a day the prescribed flow rates are half those mentioned above because only half of the problem is modelled recharge through the upper and lower boundaries of the model is not considered and a no flow condition is assumed 2 3 2 hydrochemical conditions and transport boundary conditions the initial hydrochemical conditions and transport boundary conditions are chosen according to the hypotheses considered h1 h2 or h3 groundwater that 1 is initially present in the whole modelled domain i e in the underground reservoir and in the surrounding porous medium 2 enters through the west boundary during all the simulated time and 3 initially flows out through the east domain is in equilibrium with pyrite in h1 with pyrite and calcite in h2 and with calcite in h3 in addition it is prescribed that groundwater under natural conditions has a co2 partial pressure pco2 of 10 2 atm in h2 and h3 this value is chosen according to the literature faimon et al 2012 sanz et al 2011 note that co2 is not considered under hypothesis h1 because it is not relevant for the expected reactions 2 3 3 simulation strategy the most challenging aspect of the numerical model is to simulate the evolving hydrochemistry of the discharged water during successive pumping discharging cycles the hydrochemistry of discharged water results in its aeration in the surface reservoir but also depends on the chemical composition of the previously pumped water which cannot be predicted in advance to address this issue and to model the problem in a suitable manner successive iterations progressively increasing the final simulated time are performed the characteristics of the discharged water obtained from the previous iteration results are re introduced at each iteration the simulations are performed using the following steps 1 a first iteration of 0 5 days is performed the results of this iteration provide the hydrochemistry of water pumped to the surface reservoir from 0 to 0 5 days 2 with the results of the first iteration the second iteration from 0 to 1 5 days can be carried out the input files of the model regarding the hydrochemistry of the discharged water from 0 5 to 1 day are actualized using the characteristics of the previously pumped water from 0 to 0 5 day and considering two different scenarios sce1 and sce2 in sce1 it is assumed that water in the surface reservoir reaches chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric o2 and co2 thus the partial pressures of o2 po2 and pco2 of the stored water in the surface reservoir reach 10 0 7 and 10 3 5 bar respectively before being discharged in the underground reservoir in sce2 it is considered that stored water in the surface reservoir does not reach complete chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric o2 and co2 it is assumed that the po2 and pco2 of the stored water in the surface reservoir are 10 1 and 10 2 29 bar respectively before being discharged these two partial pressure values correspond to half of the o2 and co2 concentrations if chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere is fully achieved these two scenarios are helpful to evaluate the role of the pumping discharging frequency on the hydrochemical changes in addition it is assumed that the precipitation of calcite ferrihydrite goethite and or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir occurs at equilibrium this second iteration from 0 to 1 5 day provides the hydrochemistry of the pumped water from 1 to 1 5 day 3 the same process as in the previous step is followed thus using the results of the previous iteration the model is simulated from 0 to 2 5 days now the hydrochemistry of the pumped water from 1 to 1 5 days is used to define the discharged water from 1 5 to 2 days in this case sce1 and sce2 are also considered 4 subsequently the fourth iteration from 0 to 3 5 days is performed using the characteristics of the pumped water from 2 to 2 5 day and so on note that each iteration is started at time 0 which increases the computation time obviously attempts are made to restart each simulation at the end of the previous one however this was not possible due to limitations of the used code in total 30 days were simulated because this methodology requires a long computation time more than two weeks are needed to simulate 30 days and the computation time increases exponentially with the simulated time nevertheless 30 days are enough to reach the main objectives of evaluating the main hydrochemical reactions and their consequences in upsh plants a simple python script van rossum and drake 2011 was built to automate the process and facilitate the tasks the code reads the results of each iteration updates the input files and initiates the subsequent iteration 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph evolution 3 1 1 hypothesis 1 only pyrite fig 3 a shows the calculated ph evolution in the surface and underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium at 5 and 15 m from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction fig 3a displays the numerical results for sce1 i e a chemical equilibrium with atmospheric o2 is reached in the surface reservoir on the left and for sce2 i e a chemical equilibrium with atmospheric o2 is not totally reached in the surface reservoir on the right in the case of sce1 the ph values in the reservoirs decrease abruptly during the first cycles then the decrease in ph becomes more moderate this behaviour is consistent with the expected reactions since the increment of po2 in the surface reservoir promotes pyrite oxidation when the water is again discharged into the underground reservoir the ph values are around 3 in the underground and surface reservoirs at the end of the 30 day simulation time the ph values in the surrounding porous medium at 5 m from the underground reservoir also decrease as a consequence of groundwater exchanges and pyrite oxidation the decreasing trend in the ph values is similarly to that seen for the ph in the underground reservoir the decrease depends on the distance from the cavity and there is a delay for larger distances the ph decrease is less abrupt and lower at 15 m at the end of the simulation time the ph values are 3 2 and 4 4 at 5 and 15 m respectively o2 is totally consumed by pyrite oxidation each time that water is discharged this means that water aeration implies a continuous injection of o2 consequently the ph is expected to decrease until pyrite is totally consumed in the case of sce2 the ph evolution is similar to that for sce1 but the ph values are slightly higher the ph values at the end of the simulation are 3 in the underground reservoir 3 2 in the surface reservoir 3 3 at 5 m and 4 6 at 15 m from the underground reservoir the computed ph distribution in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b1 of appendix b 3 1 2 hypothesis 2 fig 3b shows the calculated ph evolution in the surface and underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium 5 and 15 m away from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h2 in the case of sce1 the ph values do not decrease like they do in h1 because calcite acts as a buffer in fact the ph increases instantaneously in the surface reservoir because the co2 exsolves the instantaneous increase is not observed in the figure because prior to the first pumping the surface reservoir is assumed empty however ph increases since the groundwater ph before the first pumping is 7 3 the ph in the underground reservoir also increases during the early cycles because this reservoir is filled with water from the surface one after 2 days however the ph oscillates for each simulated cycle and the ph decreases during discharging and increases during pumping periods discharged water has higher o2 concentrations that are rapidly consumed by pyrite oxidation thus promoting a decrease in the ph in the underground reservoir when water is pumped groundwater with higher ph values from the porous medium enters the underground reservoir and increases the ph the ph values in the surrounding porous medium also increase during the simulation the increase rate decay with time at 5 m and at the end of the simulation the ph is quasi stable the ph behaviour is similar for sce2 fig 3b on the right in this case the initial increase in ph and oscillations in the underground reservoir are less intense because less co2 and o2 are exchanged with the atmosphere for both scenarios the ph increase at 15 m from the underground reservoir is not appreciable in the figure the distribution of the ph values in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b2 of appendix b 3 1 3 hypothesis 3 fig 3c shows the ph evolution in the surface and the underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium at 5 and 15 m from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h3 in the case of sce1 the ph values do not decrease since this hypothesis does not consider the presence of pyrite in this case ph increases instantaneously in the surface reservoir and then remains constant as in hypothesis h2 an instantaneous increase is not observed in the figure because prior to the first pumping the surface reservoir is assumed empty however it occurs since the groundwater ph before the first pumping is 7 3 the ph value also increases in the underground reservoir because it is filled with water from the surface reservoir the increase is less extreme in the underground reservoir since the discharged water is mixed with the groundwater of the surrounding porous medium the ph also increases in the surrounding porous medium but it depends on the distance from the underground reservoir the increase in ph is less as the distance increases and at a distance of 15 m from the underground reservoir the observed ph variation is negligible over the simulated time the system behaves in a similar way when sce2 is considered fig 3c on the right but the maximum ph values are lower if less co2 is exchanged with the atmosphere in the surface reservoir ph variations are smaller oscillations in the ph value are observed in the underground reservoir each time that water is pumped groundwater from the surrounding porous medium enters the underground reservoir given that the ph in the surrounding porous medium is slightly lower groundwater inflows cause a decrease in the ph inside the underground reservoir similarly each time that the underground reservoir is filled water with a low pco2 and high ph enters the porous medium and mixes with the groundwater which increases the ph values around the underground reservoir the ph distribution in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b3 of appendix b 3 2 precipitation dissolution and oxidation of minerals 3 2 1 hypothesis 1 fig 4 a shows the mass of goethite and schwertmannite precipitated in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h1 ferrihydrite does not precipitate because the ph is lower than 6 and goethite only precipitates during the first cycles in which ph values range from 4 to 6 during the subsequent cycles the ph is lower than 4 and only schwertmannite precipitates the results for sce1 and sce2 are slightly different on the one hand the amount of precipitated goethite is lower in sce1 because it only precipitates during two cycles whilst goethite precipitates during the three first cycles in sce2 on the other hand more schwertmannite precipitates in sce1 because more pyrite is dissolved in the surrounding medium and therefore more minerals are available to precipitate minerals neither precipitate in the porous medium nor in the underground reservoir fig 5 a shows the evolution of pyrite in the porous medium 5 m from the underground reservoir for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h1 the percentage of pyrite in the porous medium decreases for both scenarios because of its oxidation however the oxidation rate is higher in sce1 because more o2 is added to the system in the surface reservoir 3 2 2 hypothesis 2 fig 4b shows the precipitated mass of calcite and ferrihydrite in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h2 in this case ferrihydrite precipitates instead of goethite and of schwertmannite because the ph is higher than 6 the precipitation rate of calcite is much higher during the early cycles than in the later ones however the precipitation rate of ferrihydrite is apparently constant except during the initial cycles the mass of precipitated calcite is higher than the mass of ferrihydrite at the end of the simulations and the scenarios sce1 and sce2 differ in the total precipitated mass of both minerals but not in the global trends fig 5b displays the evolution of calcite and pyrite concentrations at a distance of 5 m from the underground reservoir for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h2 calcite and pyrite are continuously dissolved or oxidized in the surrounding porous medium as a result their percentages in the surrounding porous medium decrease the dissolved and oxidized masses are higher for sce1 especially for calcite the dissolution and oxidation decrease significantly when the atmosphere water equilibrium is not considered sce2 in this case the po2 in the discharged water is lower and less pyrite and calcite are oxidized and dissolved respectively note that the maximum precipitation rates of calcite are observed during early cycles at the beginning all pumped water is equilibrated with the calcite of the porous medium and has a pco2 of 10 2 as a result a large decrease in the co2 in the surface reservoir occurs and the associated precipitations are high in contrast after some cycles the pco2 and therefore the mass of precipitated calcite in the surface reservoir are lower because the discharged water low pco2 fills the underground reservoir and only the water exchanges with the surrounding medium introduce new co2 in the pumped water 3 2 3 hypothesis 3 fig 4c displays the mass of precipitated calcite in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h3 the precipitation rate of calcite is higher during the early cycles than during the later ones the decrease in the precipitation rate occurs during the first 5 days and after it is apparently constant obviously if the exchange of co2 with the atmosphere is lower sce2 calcite precipitation decreases when the discharged water is exchanged with the surrounding porous medium and mixed with groundwater its pco2 increases and the ph decreases which promotes calcite dissolution this fact is corroborated by the results the ph values in the surrounding porous medium are always lower than those in the surface and underground reservoirs fig 3c while the mass of calcite decreases in the surrounding porous medium fig 5c fig 5c displays the evolution of the calcite percentage in the surrounding porous medium 5 m away from the underground reservoir calcite is dissolved during all simulation times the dissolution rate is higher at the beginning and after 4 5 days it decreases and becomes nearly constant because less co2 is exchanged with the atmosphere for sce2 the dissolved calcite is also lower note that as in the previous hypothesis the maximum precipitation and dissolution rates are observed during early times on the one hand the variation of the pco2 in the surface reservoir is higher at the beginning than at the later simulated times on the other hand the contrast between the discharged water and groundwater is high during early cycles promoting the dissolution of calcite and its associated precipitation in the surface reservoir 3 3 assessment of environmental impacts and efficiency one of the objectives of the numerical modelling may be to inform about the environmental impacts identified in specific sites unfortunately as mentioned above there are no bibliographical evidence of constructed upsh plants it is an emergent technology and therefore environmental impacts have not been reported to date in this case numerical modelling is used for predicting the potential environmental impacts of upsh highlight their importance and raise awareness about the necessity of considering them for designing future upsh plants in addition it allows deducing if upsh related activities may induce difficulties in the compliance of the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec this directive specifies that the states must prevent the deterioration of groundwater and surface water bodies the environmental objectives may be lowered if the water bodies are affected by human activities with an important socio economic component as it could be for upsh plants even so in these situations the states must guarantee the highest ecological and chemical status possible for surface water bodies and the least possible changes for groundwater bodies the results show that upsh activity may alter the chemical properties of groundwater and surface water when water is discharged into surface water bodies especially if pyrite is present in the geological formations for this reason hydrochemical impacts must be assessed prior the construction of upsh plants to ensure that the water framework directive would still be respected in the future more specifically in h1 pyrite oxidation leads to low ph values and the ph increases in h2 and h3 in h2 calcite dissolution mitigates the ph decrease induced by pyrite oxidation and only a slightly increase in ph is observed when the pco2 decreases in the surface reservoir to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere this is the same process that explains the ph increase observed for h3 the main difference between h2 and h3 is that after an early increase in ph it decreases gradually for h2 while remaining constant for h3 ph variations occur also in both reservoirs which is of paramount importance in environmental terms because the excess stored water in the surface reservoir may have to be discharged into surface water bodies thus also modifying their ph values the porosity in the surrounding porous medium increases as a result of the dissolution of calcite and the oxidation of pyrite the porosity increases 2 2 10 5 and 1 10 5 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h1 1 4 10 4 and 4 2 10 5 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h2 and 3 7 10 5 and 3 9 10 6 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h3 respectively the porosity increases more for h2 because pyrite is oxidized and calcite is dissolved at the same time although the increase in porosity is not relevant during the simulated period it should be considered for large activity periods the groundwater exchanges and thus the potential environmental impacts increase with higher porosities pujades et al 2016 in addition if a pollutant was accidentally discharged into the surface reservoir it would reach faster the subsurface environment fig 6 displays the co2 emissions from the surface reservoir to the atmosphere and table 1 summarizes the released co2 g kwh for both scenarios sce1 and sce2 under hypotheses h2 and h3 emissions are computed considering the total co2 released during the total simulated period and the volume of released co2 once the emission rates are stabilized after some days of activity 10 days the results show that upsh plants may act as a co2 source when carbonates are present in the surrounding porous medium however the emissions are much lower than those produced by other energy sources such as coal or gas schlömer et al 2017 the results are also relevant in terms of efficiency low ph values in the reservoirs may lead to the corrosion of upsh facilities and the precipitation of minerals may induce clogging events e g in pipes as a result maintenance and cleaning tasks and the adequate selection of materials are needed to avoid corrosion and clogging to extend the useful life and to maximize the efficiency of the facilities pumps turbines pipes the dissolution and oxidation of minerals in the surrounding porous medium are also relevant in terms of energy production because the efficiency of pumps and turbines depends on groundwater exchanges pujades et al 2017a generally their efficiency increases with greater water exchanges the results show that the increase in porosity and thus in groundwater exchanges is low over short periods however this increase should be investigated because the useful life of future upsh plants is expected to be longer when equilibrium between the atmosphere and water from the surface reservoir in not completely reached the behaviour of the system is similar however the ph variations and the masses of dissolved oxidized and precipitated minerals are lower therefore the comparison between sce1 and sce2 for the three hypotheses reveals that impacts on the environment and system efficiency are smaller as the aeration during the discharge and storage of water in the surface reservoir is less important 4 conclusions and prospects induced hydrochemical reactions result from the surface exposure of the pumped water in upsh contexts when water is discharged and stored in the surface reservoir the concentrations of o2 and co2 evolve to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere thus o2 tends to increase and co2 to decrease in addition to the reactions occurring in the surface reservoir when water is discharged into the underground reservoir it interacts with the groundwater and the surrounding porous medium this interaction also leads to chemical reactions the impacts are especially relevant if pyrite is present in the porous medium the increase in the po2 induces pyrite oxidation this reaction releases h decreasing the ph which is relevant in terms of environmental impacts and efficiency of upsh plants lower ph values may lead to the corrosion of the facilities pipes pumps and turbines in addition ferrihydrite goethite or schwertmannite may precipitate in the surface reservoir requiring maintenance and cleaning tasks ph does not decrease when calcite is present in the porous medium in contrast the ph slightly increases however other aspects must be regarded such as the precipitation of calcite and ferrihydrite in the surface reservoir in addition a small amount of co2 is released to the atmosphere the results also show that upsh may induce the dissolution oxidation of minerals in the porous medium this fact may be relevant in terms of efficiency and environmental impacts the dissolution and or oxidation of minerals promote the increase of the transmissivity and or the porosity consequently water exchanges between the surrounding porous medium and the underground reservoir would increase a comparison of the numerical results obtained for sce1 and sce2 reveals that the hydrochemical changes induced by upsh and their associated consequences decrease 1 when water is stored in the surface reservoir over a shorter period and 2 when aeration occurred when pumped water is discharged and stored into the surface reservoir is lower thus the pumping discharging frequency and the method to discharge and to store the pumped water in the surface reservoir determine the reactions and their associated impacts it was not possible to lengthen the simulation periods because of the long computation times required although an attempt was made to modify the simulation strategy and start each iteration at the end of the previous one it was ultimately not possible however the simulated period is sufficient to identify the main trends of the system the reactions that occur and their consequences it is possible to affirm that after a long active period of a upsh plant all the pyrite near the underground reservoir would be oxidized however the ph would continue decreasing in the surrounding porous medium because the discharged water with high concentrations of o2 would reach downstream areas in which pyrite would still be present the only difference would be noted in the amounts of precipitated ferrihydrite goethite and schwertmannite the products of the oxidized pyrite far from the underground reservoir could not be mobilized by the pumping similar predictions could be done for contexts in which calcite is present this work highlights the importance of considering hydrochemical aspects for the construction of future upsh plants in fact preliminary studies focused on determining the hydrochemical changes and their consequences should be mandatory the results of these preliminary studies combined with the environmental policies will allow taking decisions concerning the construction of upsh plants using abandoned mines in other words these preliminary studies should be considered for selection of the potential abandoned mines to be used as underground reservoirs preliminary studies must consist in a detailed hydraulic and hydrochemical characterization of the geological medium by means of field tests pumping and tracer tests mineralogical analyses and laboratory tests in addition the main characteristics of the plant volume of the underground reservoir flowrates pumping discharging frequencies etc must be considered and the aeration process in the surface reservoir must be investigated to precisely quantify the gas exchanges all these informations should be integrated into reactive transport models for predicting the consequences of reactive transport processes induced by upsh monitoring will be also needed during the operational phase of upsh plants to verify that hydrochemistry evolves as expected in this context hydrologists may play a specific role during the selection design and operational phases hydro geo logists should 1 contribute in the characterization of the porous medium 2 built the numerical models and analyse the results 3 design the monitoring strategies and monitor the system evolution during the operational phase and 4 establish guidelines for the selection of potential sites for constructing upsh plants the main difficulty faced with numerical models is ascertaining the characteristics of the discharged water during each cycle this problem can be addressed by using the same modelling methodology proposed in this work it consists of successive runs for which the maximum simulation time is progressively increased after each pumping phase the calculation is stopped and the results are used to define the hydrochemical features of the subsequently discharged water this work considers three simplified hypotheses with respect the chemical composition of the porous medium obviously hydrochemical changes induced by real upsh plants will be different and will vary for each specific site because they depend on the chemical composition of the medium surrounding the underground reservoir however this work aims to highlight that the hydrochemical changes may be relevant and proofs that they may seriously impact the environment and the efficiency of the upsh plants in fact if they are not properly considered they could put at risk the whole feasibility of future upsh plants acknowledgements e pujades and a jurado gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

public service of wallonia department of energy and sustainable building through the smartwater project appendix a this appendix shows the results of a sensitivity analysis in which the specific surface area ssa of the pyrite and the volume of pumped discharged water are modified note that the effects of modifying the volume of the pumped discharged water are analogous to those induced by the modification of the size of the underground reservoir results of sce3 and sce4 are compared with those obtained for sce1 the ssa of pyrite is reduced one order of magnitude at sce3 while the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced in half at sce4 figs a2 1 and a2 2 display results for hypotheses h1 and h2 respectively note that hypotheses h3 is not considered because significant results were not observed when the ssa of calcite was reduced in fact computed results considering kinetics of calcite were very similar to those obtained considering chemical equilibrium of calcite because its reaction rate is fast in comparison with our time scale concerning the volume of pumped discharged water the expected behavior is similar to that obtained for hypothesis h2 the main conclusions of this sensitivity analysis are that 1 trends are the same 2 the behavior is slightly modified and 3 the impacts of modifying the ssa and the volume of pumped discharged water are similar for both considered hypotheses main changes are described below hypothesis h1 ph in the reservoirs fig a2 1a and b increases when the ssa of pyrite is reduced because less pyrite is dissolved in the surrounding porous medium and less protons are released larger mineral precipitations per kg of water of goethite and schwertmannite are observed in sce4 fig a2 1c discharged water is more time in contact with the rock because the underground reservoir is not totally emptied and filled in sce4 which may explain that more dissolved minerals are available to precipitate in the surface reservoir obviously schwertmannite precipitation decreases for sce3 since less pyrite is dissolved little differences are observed concerning the ph at the surrounding porous medium 5 m from the underground reservoir fig a2 1d the most remarkable aspect is that ph increases when the ssa and the pumped discharged volume of water are reduced finally the evolution of the concentration of pyrite at the surrounding medium is displayed at 5 m fig a2 1e and 1 m fig a2 1f from the underground reservoir apparently more pyrite is dissolved at 5 m when the ssa is dissolved however this occurs because much less pyrite is dissolved in sce3 near the underground reservoir 1 m and more oxygen is available at 5 m in sce4 the dissolved pyrite is similar to that dissolved in sce1 at 1 m whilst is much lower at 5 m because less discharged water reach this location globally the volume of dissolved pyrite decrease for scenarios sce3 and 4 hypothesis h2 in general terms the ph in the reservoirs fig a2 2 a and b increases when the ssa and the volume of pumped discharged water are decreased the only exception is observed in the underground reservoir for sce4 in this case during early times the ph is lower than that computed for sce1 after ph is equal for both scenarios mineral precipitations in the surface reservoir fig a2 1c increase when the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced while they decrease if the ssa is diminished because the dissolution of minerals in the surrounding porous medium is lowered concerning the ph evolution in the surrounding porous medium fig a2 1d the ph increases when the ssa is reduced because less pyrite is dissolved in addition the ph decreases when the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced because the water exchanges between the underground reservoir and the surrounding porous medium are lowered consequently the impact of the surrounding groundwater is smaller finally as in the previous hypothesis the mass of dissolved minerals decreases in sce4 because the water exchanges are lowered moreover it is also observed that the mass of dissolved minerals at 5 m increases when the ssa is reduced this effect is produced because more reactants dissolved oxygen can reach this location since they are not previously consumed when the ssa is reduced this fact is corroborated by the computed dissolutions at 1 m from the underground reservoir at this location much less minerals are dissolved for sce3 in global terms the volume of dissolved minerals decrease for scenarios sce3 and sce4 appendix b see figs b1 b2 b3 
7185,underground pumped storage hydropower upsh using abandoned mines is an alternative system to manage electricity production in flat regions water from an underground reservoir is pumped to a surface reservoir to store electricity in the form of potential energy later water is discharged through turbines into the underground reservoir to produce electricity when demand increases during this operation the water hydrochemistry continuously evolves it varies in order to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere in the surface reservoir and with the surrounding porous medium and groundwater in the underground reservoir the hydrochemical variations may lead to reactions in the reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium causing potentially negative consequences for the environment and the system efficiency especially when pyrite is present in the surrounding porous medium in this case pyrite oxidation leads to a decrease in ph and the precipitation of goethite or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir the decrease in ph is mitigated when calcite is present in the porous medium however other concerns may arise such as slight increases in ph the precipitation of ferrihydrite and calcite in the surface reservoir and the oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of calcite in the surrounding porous medium understanding the ph variations and the precipitation dissolution of minerals is of paramount importance in terms of the environmental impacts and system efficiency for this reason this work investigates the main hydrochemical changes and their associated consequences when abandoned deep mines are used for upsh by means of numerical modelling the main objective is to highlight the importance of considering hydrochemical aspects when designing future upsh plants keywords energy storage system reactive transport modelling deep mine pyrite calcite 1 introduction the main concern related to renewable energies such as solar or wind energies is that the electricity production is highly variable and cannot be adapted to the demand okazaki et al 2015 athari and ardehali 2016 giordano et al 2016 hu et al 2016 mileva et al 2016 this fact reduces their efficiency and limits their applicability energy storage systems esss are a solution to manage the variable electricity production of renewable sources and to increase their use gebretsadik et al 2016 such systems allow the storage of excess electricity generated during periods of low energy demand and the production of electricity when the demand increases delfanti et al 2015 mason 2015 pumped storage hydropower psh is the most used ess epri 2010 it allows the storage and production of a large amount of electricity steffen 2012 psh plants consist of two water reservoirs located at different elevations the excess electricity is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir thus storing electricity in the form of potential energy when the energy demand increases water is discharged from the upper to the lower reservoir through turbines to produce electricity hadjipaschalis et al 2009 although psh is widely used zhang et al 2016 such systems are constrained by topographic aspects because the reservoirs must be located at different elevations limiting the locations where plants can be constructed mueller et al 2015 in addition psh is controversial regarding its impacts on the landscape land use environment vegetation and wildlife and society relocations wong 1996 kucukali 2014 consequently new types of esss have been evoked as potential alternatives during the last years one of them is the underground pumped storage hydropower upsh uddin and asce 2003 where the lower reservoir is underground while the upper one is located at the surface barnes and levine 2011 upsh has been considered and some projects have been planned in different parts of the world however there are no bibliographical evidence of constructed upsh plants for instance a project was started in the 1980s in the netherlands but the plant was eventually not installed for different reasons such as unsuitable characteristics of the underground area spriet 2014 similarly wong 1996 proposed the installation of upsh plants in singapore using abandoned quarries as surface reservoirs and excavating the underground reservoirs more recently severson 2011 suggested potential sites to establish a taconite mine in minnesota usa and to use the excavated cavity after the mining activities as the underground reservoir for a upsh plant upsh has also been investigated in germany alvarado et al 2016 zillmann and perau 2015 luick et al 2012 belgium spriet 2014 spain menéndez et al 2017 and south africa khan and davidson 2016 winde et al 2017 the most important benefit of upsh in comparison with psh is that upsh is not limited by the topography and could even be used in flat regions consequently more possibilities exist to establish upsh plants meyer 2013 impacts associated with landscape land use and society relocations are lower than those of psh because at least one of the reservoirs is located underground environmental impacts are different than those produced by psh and must be evaluated carefully in addition re used abandoned mines would provide added value to local communities after the cessation of mining activities the main concern regarding the use of abandoned mines is that mine walls are generally not waterproofed thus upsh plants interact with the surrounding porous medium exchanging water to date this interaction has only been studied from a flow point of view some studies have been focused on the impacts related to water exchange 1 on the piezometric head field pujades et al 2016 poulain et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 and 2 on the efficiency of the plant pujades et al 2017a however there are no studies to date that have assessed the hydrochemical modifications induced by upsh and its associated impacts on the environment and the efficiency induced hydrochemical modifications have not been reported to date given that this is an emergent ees in fact as previously mentioned there are no bibliographical evidence of operational upsh plants however the chemical particularities of mine waters and their behaviour have been recognised as important challenges for the application of upsh eera 2016 in addition similarities between upsh and managed aquifer recharge in which occurred hydrochemical changes are well known johnson et al 1999 barker et al 2016 antoniou et al 2017 suggest that analogous changes may take place in upsh systems obviously the hydrochemical changes would be different since water is also pumped in upsh and it reaches the surrounding porous medium through an underground cavity for these reasons it is meaningful to study the specific hydrochemical aspects associated to upsh under natural conditions water in the underground reservoir and groundwater in the surrounding porous medium are in chemical equilibrium with the porous materials once the activity of the upsh plants starts water from the underground reservoir is pumped discharged and stored in the surface reservoir during this operation water is aerated and therefore its chemical composition evolves to a new chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere this equilibrium is directly related to a variation in the dissolved o2 and co2 concentrations when this water is subsequently discharged from the surface to the underground reservoir it evolves again towards another chemical equilibrium with the surrounding porous medium this continuous evolution of the water chemistry may lead to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals and their associated impacts such as variations in ph for example the oxidation of sulfides which are common in coal mined environments younger et al 2002 would result in groundwater with a very low ph bigham and nordstrom 2000 as a result the upsh activity would possibly affect the surrounding groundwater quality if part of the pumped water must be discharged in surface water bodies because groundwater inflows fill the underground cavity pujades et al 2016 bodeux et al 2017 the quality of these surface water bodies could also be affected these environmental issues are of paramount importance because future upsh plants should respect the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec to ensure a good state of water bodies and especially groundwater bodies hydrochemical changes are also relevant in terms of efficiency low ph values may accelerate the corrosion of equipment pipes pumps turbines concrete structures kapil and bhattacharyya 2016 sharma et al 2011 whilst minerals precipitation may alter their mechanical efficiency sterpejkowicz wersocki 2014 thus hydrochemical changes may lead to a decrease of efficiency and durability of the facilities moreover periodical maintenance and cleaning tasks may be required for all these reasons it is crucial to anticipate hydrochemical changes induced by upsh and their consequences on the environment and the efficiency of the system this issue is investigated in this work through numerical reactive transport models the main reactive transport processes associated with the groundwater upsh water interactions are simulated considering three synthetic cases the main objectives of this work are 1 to prove that upsh activities can induced relevant hydrochemical changes 2 to show that these changes may entail negative consequences for the environment and the efficiency of the system and 3 to highlight the importance of considering them in the design of future upsh plants to ensure their feasibility 2 materials and methods 2 1 problem statement the problem is sketched schematically in fig 1 an underground reservoir 50 m by 50 m on 10 m of height located in an unconfined aquifer is considered the top and bottom of the underground reservoir are at a depth of 95 and 105 m respectively the surrounding porous medium is 200 m thick and the external boundaries are located 500 m away from the underground reservoir in natural conditions groundwater flows from the western to the eastern boundary the head is considered to be at depths of 92 5 and 97 5 m on the west and east boundaries respectively under natural conditions the water table is located just at the top of the underground reservoir 95 m depth which is therefore totally saturated 2 1 1 chemistry of the porous medium abandoned coal mines are potential underground cavities to be used as underground reservoirs for constructing upsh plants sulfide minerals whose oxidation may entail important consequences for water chemistry are common in coal deposits and pyrite is usually the most common sulfide mineral in coal mined environments akcil and koldas 2006 thus hypothesis 1 h1 considers that the geological medium contains 1 pyrite the percentage of pyrite is not too much relevant since it is not totally consumed during the simulation time coal mine deposits surrounded by carbonates or containing lenses or intercalated layers of carbonates have been worldwide reported sharma et al 2013 campaner et al 2014 xu et al 2018 and carbonates counterbalance the negative effects produced by pyrite oxidation when carbonates i e limestone are present as intercalated layers or lenses the global percentage is rapidly higher than for pyrite as pyrite minerals are usually scattered within the coal beds for these reasons hypothesis 2 h2 considers that the geological medium contains 1 pyrite and 10 calcite the percentage of calcite carbonates ensure that the neutralization acidic potential of the surrounding porous medium allows counterbalancing totally the effects of pyrite oxidation because the neutralization potential ratio is higher than 4 price et al 1997 hypotheses 1 and 2 represent the two boundary scenarios in which the neutralization capacity is null h1 or total h2 results of intermediate scenarios in which the carbonate pyrite ratio is lower than that considered in h2 would be comprehended by those obtained for hypotheses h1 and h2 finally the presence of only calcite 10 is considered in hypothesis 3 h3 for two reasons on the one hand underground limestone mines koch 1987 hustrulid et al 2001 are also considered to be used as underground reservoirs for upsh on the other hand the expected behaviour is very different to that occurring when pyrite is present note that these percentages refer to the initial concentrations and the conditions will evolve depending on the reactions it is assumed that the rest of the porous medium is made up of silicates whose reaction rates are very slow white and brantley 1995 and can be neglected silicate dissolution and ion exchange may be possible johnson et al 1999 which has been proved in works developed in the field of aquifer managed recharge and should be considered in some situations however the rate of silicate dissolution particularly phyllosilicates is orders of magnitude slower than calcite and pyrite palandri and yousif 2004 and therefore they are expected to play a subordinate role in the water chemistry anyway the objective of this work is to establish the main trends and highlight the importance of considering the hydrochemistry in the design of future upsh plants for this reason only minerals pyrite and calcite whose behavior is well known are selected obviously the composition of the geological medium in real cases is much more complex and preliminary studies performed before constructing upsh plants must consider all the existing minerals and all the processes 2 1 2 pumping and discharging frequencies the actual pumping and discharging frequency cannot be forecasted this depends on numerous factors such as the day season meteorology electrical smart grid optimization scenarios or economic issues therefore at this stage representative results are obtained assuming day night cycles of 12 h i e water is pumped for 12 h and discharged during the next 12 h the underground reservoir is considered almost empty and almost full after each pumping discharging phase thus given the dimensions of the underground reservoir pumping discharging rates are chosen to be 43 000 m3 d note that the underground reservoir is not totally emptied at the end of each cycle a residual water depth of 1 4 m is intentionally left in the reservoir to keep nodes from which water is pumped and injected in a fully saturated zone appendix a shows the results of a sensitivity analysis in which the pumping discharging rate is reduced by half 2 2 basic concepts the most relevant reactions that occur in the modelled hypotheses and their consequences are summarized in this section water aeration occurs each time that water is discharged and stored in the surface reservoir this process induces co2 and o2 exchanges between the water and the atmosphere thus r1 c o 2 aq c o 2 g r2 o 2 aq o 2 g the presence of pyrite is assumed in the h1 and h2 hypotheses when the o2 concentration in the water increases as a consequence of r2 pyrite is oxidized and ferrihydrite may precipitate as follows r3 fe s 2 15 4 o 2 aq 7 2 h 2 o fe oh 3 s 2 so 4 2 4 h ferrihydrite fe oh 3 precipitation induced by reaction r3 occurs if the water ph is higher than 6 other minerals precipitate at low ph ranges goethite feooh 3 h may precipitate between ph 4 and ph 6 whilst schwertmannite f e 8 o 8 oh 4 5 s o 4 1 75 may precipitate at ph values lower than 4 sánchez españa et al 2011 goethite and schwertmannite precipitate as follows r4 f e 3 2 h 2 o feooh 3 h r5 8 f e 3 12 5 h 2 o 1 75 so 4 2 f e 8 o 8 oh 4 5 s o 4 1 75 20 5 h the common characteristic of these three reactions is that they reduce the ph these reactions are characteristic of acid mine drainage processes banks et al 1997 robb 1994 pyrite oxidation in the numerical model is calculated using the kinetic law described by williamson and rimstidt 1994 and considering a specific surface area of 1000 m 1 calcite in the surrounding porous medium is considered for the h2 and h3 hypotheses in this case the following reaction occurs r6 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 aq r6 does not occur in a unidirectional way and if the pco2 is modified calcite may precipitate or be dissolved for example surface aeration of the pumped water induces a reduction of pco2 and as a result calcite precipitates the kinetics of calcite are implemented in the model using the kinetic law defined by plummer et al 1978 and considering a specific surface area of 45 3 m 1 thermodynamic data for aqueous speciation and mineral and gas solubility are taken from the wateq database as implemented in the phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the solubility constant of schwertmannite is taken from sánchez españa et al 2011 under the h1 hypothesis the aeration of the water pumped into the surface reservoir would increase the po2 when this water is discharged into the underground reservoir it oxidizes pyrite and reduces the ph in addition when the water is stored in the surface reservoir ferrihydrite goethite or schwertmannite precipitate in h2 pyrite oxidation would induce the dissolution of calcite which acts as a buffer preventing a decrease in ph on the other hand under the h2 and h3 hypotheses the decrease in pco2 in the surface reservoir could produce calcite precipitation note that upsh plants may act as co2 sources because pco2 increases each time that water is discharged into the underground reservoir therefore co2 emission is quantified under the h2 and h3 hypotheses the influence of the specific surface area is assessed in a sensitivity analysis whose results are shown in the appendix a 2 3 numerical model the problem was simulated using the code phast parkhurst et al 1995 parkhurst and kipp 2002 this code solves multicomponent reactive solute transport in three dimensional saturated groundwater flow parkhurst et al 2010 geochemical reactions are solved by the code phreeqc parkhurst 1995 parkhurst and appelo 1999 flow and transport are computed with a modified version of hst3d kipp 1987 1997 it is possible to identify a line of symmetry crossing the domain from the west to the east boundary located just in the centre of the considered problem figs 1 and 2 a therefore the problem can be simplified by taking advantage of this symmetry and only a half of the domain is modelled fig 2a this simplification does not affect the results and allows reducing the computation times the modelled domain is divided into 15 600 elements refined in and around the underground reservoir fig 2b the size of the elements ranges from 2 to 100 m the flow and transport parameters are the same for the three hypotheses for the porous medium the hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficient s are chosen as 0 01 m d and 0 05 respectively the longitudinal αl and transversal αt dispersivities are assumed to be 10 and 1 m respectively the underground reservoir i e cavity is modelled by adopting a high value of k 106 m d s of 1 and a dispersivity of 104 m in the three directions this value of dispersivity means that mixing of the discharged water in the underground reservoir is rapid and homogeneous this assumption is acceptable because a large volume of water is discharged within a short period of time facilitating the mixing note that the influence of the dispersivity used to simulate the underground reservoir has been previously evaluated and is considered negligible pujades et al 2017b 2 3 1 flow boundary conditions bcs dirichlet boundary conditions bcs are adopted at the western and eastern boundaries an initial hydraulic gradient of 0 005 is modelled by prescribing the piezometric head at a depth of 92 5 and 97 5 m on the western and eastern boundaries respectively pumping and discharging rates of 21 500 m3 d are simulated by prescribing neumann bcs in nodes located at the base of the underground reservoir this rate allows for the dewatering and filling of 8 6 m of the cavity in half a day the prescribed flow rates are half those mentioned above because only half of the problem is modelled recharge through the upper and lower boundaries of the model is not considered and a no flow condition is assumed 2 3 2 hydrochemical conditions and transport boundary conditions the initial hydrochemical conditions and transport boundary conditions are chosen according to the hypotheses considered h1 h2 or h3 groundwater that 1 is initially present in the whole modelled domain i e in the underground reservoir and in the surrounding porous medium 2 enters through the west boundary during all the simulated time and 3 initially flows out through the east domain is in equilibrium with pyrite in h1 with pyrite and calcite in h2 and with calcite in h3 in addition it is prescribed that groundwater under natural conditions has a co2 partial pressure pco2 of 10 2 atm in h2 and h3 this value is chosen according to the literature faimon et al 2012 sanz et al 2011 note that co2 is not considered under hypothesis h1 because it is not relevant for the expected reactions 2 3 3 simulation strategy the most challenging aspect of the numerical model is to simulate the evolving hydrochemistry of the discharged water during successive pumping discharging cycles the hydrochemistry of discharged water results in its aeration in the surface reservoir but also depends on the chemical composition of the previously pumped water which cannot be predicted in advance to address this issue and to model the problem in a suitable manner successive iterations progressively increasing the final simulated time are performed the characteristics of the discharged water obtained from the previous iteration results are re introduced at each iteration the simulations are performed using the following steps 1 a first iteration of 0 5 days is performed the results of this iteration provide the hydrochemistry of water pumped to the surface reservoir from 0 to 0 5 days 2 with the results of the first iteration the second iteration from 0 to 1 5 days can be carried out the input files of the model regarding the hydrochemistry of the discharged water from 0 5 to 1 day are actualized using the characteristics of the previously pumped water from 0 to 0 5 day and considering two different scenarios sce1 and sce2 in sce1 it is assumed that water in the surface reservoir reaches chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric o2 and co2 thus the partial pressures of o2 po2 and pco2 of the stored water in the surface reservoir reach 10 0 7 and 10 3 5 bar respectively before being discharged in the underground reservoir in sce2 it is considered that stored water in the surface reservoir does not reach complete chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric o2 and co2 it is assumed that the po2 and pco2 of the stored water in the surface reservoir are 10 1 and 10 2 29 bar respectively before being discharged these two partial pressure values correspond to half of the o2 and co2 concentrations if chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere is fully achieved these two scenarios are helpful to evaluate the role of the pumping discharging frequency on the hydrochemical changes in addition it is assumed that the precipitation of calcite ferrihydrite goethite and or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir occurs at equilibrium this second iteration from 0 to 1 5 day provides the hydrochemistry of the pumped water from 1 to 1 5 day 3 the same process as in the previous step is followed thus using the results of the previous iteration the model is simulated from 0 to 2 5 days now the hydrochemistry of the pumped water from 1 to 1 5 days is used to define the discharged water from 1 5 to 2 days in this case sce1 and sce2 are also considered 4 subsequently the fourth iteration from 0 to 3 5 days is performed using the characteristics of the pumped water from 2 to 2 5 day and so on note that each iteration is started at time 0 which increases the computation time obviously attempts are made to restart each simulation at the end of the previous one however this was not possible due to limitations of the used code in total 30 days were simulated because this methodology requires a long computation time more than two weeks are needed to simulate 30 days and the computation time increases exponentially with the simulated time nevertheless 30 days are enough to reach the main objectives of evaluating the main hydrochemical reactions and their consequences in upsh plants a simple python script van rossum and drake 2011 was built to automate the process and facilitate the tasks the code reads the results of each iteration updates the input files and initiates the subsequent iteration 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph evolution 3 1 1 hypothesis 1 only pyrite fig 3 a shows the calculated ph evolution in the surface and underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium at 5 and 15 m from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction fig 3a displays the numerical results for sce1 i e a chemical equilibrium with atmospheric o2 is reached in the surface reservoir on the left and for sce2 i e a chemical equilibrium with atmospheric o2 is not totally reached in the surface reservoir on the right in the case of sce1 the ph values in the reservoirs decrease abruptly during the first cycles then the decrease in ph becomes more moderate this behaviour is consistent with the expected reactions since the increment of po2 in the surface reservoir promotes pyrite oxidation when the water is again discharged into the underground reservoir the ph values are around 3 in the underground and surface reservoirs at the end of the 30 day simulation time the ph values in the surrounding porous medium at 5 m from the underground reservoir also decrease as a consequence of groundwater exchanges and pyrite oxidation the decreasing trend in the ph values is similarly to that seen for the ph in the underground reservoir the decrease depends on the distance from the cavity and there is a delay for larger distances the ph decrease is less abrupt and lower at 15 m at the end of the simulation time the ph values are 3 2 and 4 4 at 5 and 15 m respectively o2 is totally consumed by pyrite oxidation each time that water is discharged this means that water aeration implies a continuous injection of o2 consequently the ph is expected to decrease until pyrite is totally consumed in the case of sce2 the ph evolution is similar to that for sce1 but the ph values are slightly higher the ph values at the end of the simulation are 3 in the underground reservoir 3 2 in the surface reservoir 3 3 at 5 m and 4 6 at 15 m from the underground reservoir the computed ph distribution in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b1 of appendix b 3 1 2 hypothesis 2 fig 3b shows the calculated ph evolution in the surface and underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium 5 and 15 m away from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h2 in the case of sce1 the ph values do not decrease like they do in h1 because calcite acts as a buffer in fact the ph increases instantaneously in the surface reservoir because the co2 exsolves the instantaneous increase is not observed in the figure because prior to the first pumping the surface reservoir is assumed empty however ph increases since the groundwater ph before the first pumping is 7 3 the ph in the underground reservoir also increases during the early cycles because this reservoir is filled with water from the surface one after 2 days however the ph oscillates for each simulated cycle and the ph decreases during discharging and increases during pumping periods discharged water has higher o2 concentrations that are rapidly consumed by pyrite oxidation thus promoting a decrease in the ph in the underground reservoir when water is pumped groundwater with higher ph values from the porous medium enters the underground reservoir and increases the ph the ph values in the surrounding porous medium also increase during the simulation the increase rate decay with time at 5 m and at the end of the simulation the ph is quasi stable the ph behaviour is similar for sce2 fig 3b on the right in this case the initial increase in ph and oscillations in the underground reservoir are less intense because less co2 and o2 are exchanged with the atmosphere for both scenarios the ph increase at 15 m from the underground reservoir is not appreciable in the figure the distribution of the ph values in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b2 of appendix b 3 1 3 hypothesis 3 fig 3c shows the ph evolution in the surface and the underground reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium at 5 and 15 m from the underground reservoir in the downgradient direction for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h3 in the case of sce1 the ph values do not decrease since this hypothesis does not consider the presence of pyrite in this case ph increases instantaneously in the surface reservoir and then remains constant as in hypothesis h2 an instantaneous increase is not observed in the figure because prior to the first pumping the surface reservoir is assumed empty however it occurs since the groundwater ph before the first pumping is 7 3 the ph value also increases in the underground reservoir because it is filled with water from the surface reservoir the increase is less extreme in the underground reservoir since the discharged water is mixed with the groundwater of the surrounding porous medium the ph also increases in the surrounding porous medium but it depends on the distance from the underground reservoir the increase in ph is less as the distance increases and at a distance of 15 m from the underground reservoir the observed ph variation is negligible over the simulated time the system behaves in a similar way when sce2 is considered fig 3c on the right but the maximum ph values are lower if less co2 is exchanged with the atmosphere in the surface reservoir ph variations are smaller oscillations in the ph value are observed in the underground reservoir each time that water is pumped groundwater from the surrounding porous medium enters the underground reservoir given that the ph in the surrounding porous medium is slightly lower groundwater inflows cause a decrease in the ph inside the underground reservoir similarly each time that the underground reservoir is filled water with a low pco2 and high ph enters the porous medium and mixes with the groundwater which increases the ph values around the underground reservoir the ph distribution in the surrounding porous medium after 5 15 and 30 days is shown in fig b3 of appendix b 3 2 precipitation dissolution and oxidation of minerals 3 2 1 hypothesis 1 fig 4 a shows the mass of goethite and schwertmannite precipitated in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h1 ferrihydrite does not precipitate because the ph is lower than 6 and goethite only precipitates during the first cycles in which ph values range from 4 to 6 during the subsequent cycles the ph is lower than 4 and only schwertmannite precipitates the results for sce1 and sce2 are slightly different on the one hand the amount of precipitated goethite is lower in sce1 because it only precipitates during two cycles whilst goethite precipitates during the three first cycles in sce2 on the other hand more schwertmannite precipitates in sce1 because more pyrite is dissolved in the surrounding medium and therefore more minerals are available to precipitate minerals neither precipitate in the porous medium nor in the underground reservoir fig 5 a shows the evolution of pyrite in the porous medium 5 m from the underground reservoir for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h1 the percentage of pyrite in the porous medium decreases for both scenarios because of its oxidation however the oxidation rate is higher in sce1 because more o2 is added to the system in the surface reservoir 3 2 2 hypothesis 2 fig 4b shows the precipitated mass of calcite and ferrihydrite in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h2 in this case ferrihydrite precipitates instead of goethite and of schwertmannite because the ph is higher than 6 the precipitation rate of calcite is much higher during the early cycles than in the later ones however the precipitation rate of ferrihydrite is apparently constant except during the initial cycles the mass of precipitated calcite is higher than the mass of ferrihydrite at the end of the simulations and the scenarios sce1 and sce2 differ in the total precipitated mass of both minerals but not in the global trends fig 5b displays the evolution of calcite and pyrite concentrations at a distance of 5 m from the underground reservoir for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h2 calcite and pyrite are continuously dissolved or oxidized in the surrounding porous medium as a result their percentages in the surrounding porous medium decrease the dissolved and oxidized masses are higher for sce1 especially for calcite the dissolution and oxidation decrease significantly when the atmosphere water equilibrium is not considered sce2 in this case the po2 in the discharged water is lower and less pyrite and calcite are oxidized and dissolved respectively note that the maximum precipitation rates of calcite are observed during early cycles at the beginning all pumped water is equilibrated with the calcite of the porous medium and has a pco2 of 10 2 as a result a large decrease in the co2 in the surface reservoir occurs and the associated precipitations are high in contrast after some cycles the pco2 and therefore the mass of precipitated calcite in the surface reservoir are lower because the discharged water low pco2 fills the underground reservoir and only the water exchanges with the surrounding medium introduce new co2 in the pumped water 3 2 3 hypothesis 3 fig 4c displays the mass of precipitated calcite in the surface reservoir for sce1 on the left and sce2 on the right under hypothesis h3 the precipitation rate of calcite is higher during the early cycles than during the later ones the decrease in the precipitation rate occurs during the first 5 days and after it is apparently constant obviously if the exchange of co2 with the atmosphere is lower sce2 calcite precipitation decreases when the discharged water is exchanged with the surrounding porous medium and mixed with groundwater its pco2 increases and the ph decreases which promotes calcite dissolution this fact is corroborated by the results the ph values in the surrounding porous medium are always lower than those in the surface and underground reservoirs fig 3c while the mass of calcite decreases in the surrounding porous medium fig 5c fig 5c displays the evolution of the calcite percentage in the surrounding porous medium 5 m away from the underground reservoir calcite is dissolved during all simulation times the dissolution rate is higher at the beginning and after 4 5 days it decreases and becomes nearly constant because less co2 is exchanged with the atmosphere for sce2 the dissolved calcite is also lower note that as in the previous hypothesis the maximum precipitation and dissolution rates are observed during early times on the one hand the variation of the pco2 in the surface reservoir is higher at the beginning than at the later simulated times on the other hand the contrast between the discharged water and groundwater is high during early cycles promoting the dissolution of calcite and its associated precipitation in the surface reservoir 3 3 assessment of environmental impacts and efficiency one of the objectives of the numerical modelling may be to inform about the environmental impacts identified in specific sites unfortunately as mentioned above there are no bibliographical evidence of constructed upsh plants it is an emergent technology and therefore environmental impacts have not been reported to date in this case numerical modelling is used for predicting the potential environmental impacts of upsh highlight their importance and raise awareness about the necessity of considering them for designing future upsh plants in addition it allows deducing if upsh related activities may induce difficulties in the compliance of the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec this directive specifies that the states must prevent the deterioration of groundwater and surface water bodies the environmental objectives may be lowered if the water bodies are affected by human activities with an important socio economic component as it could be for upsh plants even so in these situations the states must guarantee the highest ecological and chemical status possible for surface water bodies and the least possible changes for groundwater bodies the results show that upsh activity may alter the chemical properties of groundwater and surface water when water is discharged into surface water bodies especially if pyrite is present in the geological formations for this reason hydrochemical impacts must be assessed prior the construction of upsh plants to ensure that the water framework directive would still be respected in the future more specifically in h1 pyrite oxidation leads to low ph values and the ph increases in h2 and h3 in h2 calcite dissolution mitigates the ph decrease induced by pyrite oxidation and only a slightly increase in ph is observed when the pco2 decreases in the surface reservoir to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere this is the same process that explains the ph increase observed for h3 the main difference between h2 and h3 is that after an early increase in ph it decreases gradually for h2 while remaining constant for h3 ph variations occur also in both reservoirs which is of paramount importance in environmental terms because the excess stored water in the surface reservoir may have to be discharged into surface water bodies thus also modifying their ph values the porosity in the surrounding porous medium increases as a result of the dissolution of calcite and the oxidation of pyrite the porosity increases 2 2 10 5 and 1 10 5 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h1 1 4 10 4 and 4 2 10 5 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h2 and 3 7 10 5 and 3 9 10 6 for sce1 and sce2 under hypothesis h3 respectively the porosity increases more for h2 because pyrite is oxidized and calcite is dissolved at the same time although the increase in porosity is not relevant during the simulated period it should be considered for large activity periods the groundwater exchanges and thus the potential environmental impacts increase with higher porosities pujades et al 2016 in addition if a pollutant was accidentally discharged into the surface reservoir it would reach faster the subsurface environment fig 6 displays the co2 emissions from the surface reservoir to the atmosphere and table 1 summarizes the released co2 g kwh for both scenarios sce1 and sce2 under hypotheses h2 and h3 emissions are computed considering the total co2 released during the total simulated period and the volume of released co2 once the emission rates are stabilized after some days of activity 10 days the results show that upsh plants may act as a co2 source when carbonates are present in the surrounding porous medium however the emissions are much lower than those produced by other energy sources such as coal or gas schlömer et al 2017 the results are also relevant in terms of efficiency low ph values in the reservoirs may lead to the corrosion of upsh facilities and the precipitation of minerals may induce clogging events e g in pipes as a result maintenance and cleaning tasks and the adequate selection of materials are needed to avoid corrosion and clogging to extend the useful life and to maximize the efficiency of the facilities pumps turbines pipes the dissolution and oxidation of minerals in the surrounding porous medium are also relevant in terms of energy production because the efficiency of pumps and turbines depends on groundwater exchanges pujades et al 2017a generally their efficiency increases with greater water exchanges the results show that the increase in porosity and thus in groundwater exchanges is low over short periods however this increase should be investigated because the useful life of future upsh plants is expected to be longer when equilibrium between the atmosphere and water from the surface reservoir in not completely reached the behaviour of the system is similar however the ph variations and the masses of dissolved oxidized and precipitated minerals are lower therefore the comparison between sce1 and sce2 for the three hypotheses reveals that impacts on the environment and system efficiency are smaller as the aeration during the discharge and storage of water in the surface reservoir is less important 4 conclusions and prospects induced hydrochemical reactions result from the surface exposure of the pumped water in upsh contexts when water is discharged and stored in the surface reservoir the concentrations of o2 and co2 evolve to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere thus o2 tends to increase and co2 to decrease in addition to the reactions occurring in the surface reservoir when water is discharged into the underground reservoir it interacts with the groundwater and the surrounding porous medium this interaction also leads to chemical reactions the impacts are especially relevant if pyrite is present in the porous medium the increase in the po2 induces pyrite oxidation this reaction releases h decreasing the ph which is relevant in terms of environmental impacts and efficiency of upsh plants lower ph values may lead to the corrosion of the facilities pipes pumps and turbines in addition ferrihydrite goethite or schwertmannite may precipitate in the surface reservoir requiring maintenance and cleaning tasks ph does not decrease when calcite is present in the porous medium in contrast the ph slightly increases however other aspects must be regarded such as the precipitation of calcite and ferrihydrite in the surface reservoir in addition a small amount of co2 is released to the atmosphere the results also show that upsh may induce the dissolution oxidation of minerals in the porous medium this fact may be relevant in terms of efficiency and environmental impacts the dissolution and or oxidation of minerals promote the increase of the transmissivity and or the porosity consequently water exchanges between the surrounding porous medium and the underground reservoir would increase a comparison of the numerical results obtained for sce1 and sce2 reveals that the hydrochemical changes induced by upsh and their associated consequences decrease 1 when water is stored in the surface reservoir over a shorter period and 2 when aeration occurred when pumped water is discharged and stored into the surface reservoir is lower thus the pumping discharging frequency and the method to discharge and to store the pumped water in the surface reservoir determine the reactions and their associated impacts it was not possible to lengthen the simulation periods because of the long computation times required although an attempt was made to modify the simulation strategy and start each iteration at the end of the previous one it was ultimately not possible however the simulated period is sufficient to identify the main trends of the system the reactions that occur and their consequences it is possible to affirm that after a long active period of a upsh plant all the pyrite near the underground reservoir would be oxidized however the ph would continue decreasing in the surrounding porous medium because the discharged water with high concentrations of o2 would reach downstream areas in which pyrite would still be present the only difference would be noted in the amounts of precipitated ferrihydrite goethite and schwertmannite the products of the oxidized pyrite far from the underground reservoir could not be mobilized by the pumping similar predictions could be done for contexts in which calcite is present this work highlights the importance of considering hydrochemical aspects for the construction of future upsh plants in fact preliminary studies focused on determining the hydrochemical changes and their consequences should be mandatory the results of these preliminary studies combined with the environmental policies will allow taking decisions concerning the construction of upsh plants using abandoned mines in other words these preliminary studies should be considered for selection of the potential abandoned mines to be used as underground reservoirs preliminary studies must consist in a detailed hydraulic and hydrochemical characterization of the geological medium by means of field tests pumping and tracer tests mineralogical analyses and laboratory tests in addition the main characteristics of the plant volume of the underground reservoir flowrates pumping discharging frequencies etc must be considered and the aeration process in the surface reservoir must be investigated to precisely quantify the gas exchanges all these informations should be integrated into reactive transport models for predicting the consequences of reactive transport processes induced by upsh monitoring will be also needed during the operational phase of upsh plants to verify that hydrochemistry evolves as expected in this context hydrologists may play a specific role during the selection design and operational phases hydro geo logists should 1 contribute in the characterization of the porous medium 2 built the numerical models and analyse the results 3 design the monitoring strategies and monitor the system evolution during the operational phase and 4 establish guidelines for the selection of potential sites for constructing upsh plants the main difficulty faced with numerical models is ascertaining the characteristics of the discharged water during each cycle this problem can be addressed by using the same modelling methodology proposed in this work it consists of successive runs for which the maximum simulation time is progressively increased after each pumping phase the calculation is stopped and the results are used to define the hydrochemical features of the subsequently discharged water this work considers three simplified hypotheses with respect the chemical composition of the porous medium obviously hydrochemical changes induced by real upsh plants will be different and will vary for each specific site because they depend on the chemical composition of the medium surrounding the underground reservoir however this work aims to highlight that the hydrochemical changes may be relevant and proofs that they may seriously impact the environment and the efficiency of the upsh plants in fact if they are not properly considered they could put at risk the whole feasibility of future upsh plants acknowledgements e pujades and a jurado gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

public service of wallonia department of energy and sustainable building through the smartwater project appendix a this appendix shows the results of a sensitivity analysis in which the specific surface area ssa of the pyrite and the volume of pumped discharged water are modified note that the effects of modifying the volume of the pumped discharged water are analogous to those induced by the modification of the size of the underground reservoir results of sce3 and sce4 are compared with those obtained for sce1 the ssa of pyrite is reduced one order of magnitude at sce3 while the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced in half at sce4 figs a2 1 and a2 2 display results for hypotheses h1 and h2 respectively note that hypotheses h3 is not considered because significant results were not observed when the ssa of calcite was reduced in fact computed results considering kinetics of calcite were very similar to those obtained considering chemical equilibrium of calcite because its reaction rate is fast in comparison with our time scale concerning the volume of pumped discharged water the expected behavior is similar to that obtained for hypothesis h2 the main conclusions of this sensitivity analysis are that 1 trends are the same 2 the behavior is slightly modified and 3 the impacts of modifying the ssa and the volume of pumped discharged water are similar for both considered hypotheses main changes are described below hypothesis h1 ph in the reservoirs fig a2 1a and b increases when the ssa of pyrite is reduced because less pyrite is dissolved in the surrounding porous medium and less protons are released larger mineral precipitations per kg of water of goethite and schwertmannite are observed in sce4 fig a2 1c discharged water is more time in contact with the rock because the underground reservoir is not totally emptied and filled in sce4 which may explain that more dissolved minerals are available to precipitate in the surface reservoir obviously schwertmannite precipitation decreases for sce3 since less pyrite is dissolved little differences are observed concerning the ph at the surrounding porous medium 5 m from the underground reservoir fig a2 1d the most remarkable aspect is that ph increases when the ssa and the pumped discharged volume of water are reduced finally the evolution of the concentration of pyrite at the surrounding medium is displayed at 5 m fig a2 1e and 1 m fig a2 1f from the underground reservoir apparently more pyrite is dissolved at 5 m when the ssa is dissolved however this occurs because much less pyrite is dissolved in sce3 near the underground reservoir 1 m and more oxygen is available at 5 m in sce4 the dissolved pyrite is similar to that dissolved in sce1 at 1 m whilst is much lower at 5 m because less discharged water reach this location globally the volume of dissolved pyrite decrease for scenarios sce3 and 4 hypothesis h2 in general terms the ph in the reservoirs fig a2 2 a and b increases when the ssa and the volume of pumped discharged water are decreased the only exception is observed in the underground reservoir for sce4 in this case during early times the ph is lower than that computed for sce1 after ph is equal for both scenarios mineral precipitations in the surface reservoir fig a2 1c increase when the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced while they decrease if the ssa is diminished because the dissolution of minerals in the surrounding porous medium is lowered concerning the ph evolution in the surrounding porous medium fig a2 1d the ph increases when the ssa is reduced because less pyrite is dissolved in addition the ph decreases when the volume of pumped discharged water is reduced because the water exchanges between the underground reservoir and the surrounding porous medium are lowered consequently the impact of the surrounding groundwater is smaller finally as in the previous hypothesis the mass of dissolved minerals decreases in sce4 because the water exchanges are lowered moreover it is also observed that the mass of dissolved minerals at 5 m increases when the ssa is reduced this effect is produced because more reactants dissolved oxygen can reach this location since they are not previously consumed when the ssa is reduced this fact is corroborated by the computed dissolutions at 1 m from the underground reservoir at this location much less minerals are dissolved for sce3 in global terms the volume of dissolved minerals decrease for scenarios sce3 and sce4 appendix b see figs b1 b2 b3 
7186,simulation of variably saturated soil water flow requires the use of pressure head or soil moisture or a switching between the two as the primary variable for solving richards equation under unfavorable conditions such as heterogeneity rapidly changing atmospheric boundary or sudden infiltration into dry soils the traditional non switching method suffers from numerical difficulties solving this problem with a primary variable switching method is less preferred due to the mathematical complexity while the picard method is more popular for solving the non switching models due to its simplicity and stability two different forms of richards equation are combined into one numerical scheme for switching under specific hydraulic conditions the method is successfully implemented in a one dimensional model solved by a picard iteration scheme a threshold saturation based on the soil moisture retention relation is used for switching between either form of the richards equation the method developed here is applicable for simulating variably saturated subsurface flow in heterogeneous soils compared with traditional methods the proposed model conserves mass well and is numerically more stable and efficient keywords richards equation generalized switching scheme iteration method unsaturated saturated flow unfavorable conditions heterogeneous soils 1 introduction the richards equation re richards 1931 is considered the only basis for accurate and physically based solutions for modeling the sub surface flow farthing and ogden 2017 however the significant non linearity of moisture retention curves has led to major efforts to improve the generality and efficiency of algorithms for solving re either analytically white and broadbridge 1988 or numerically forsyth et al 1995 ross 2003 zha et al 2017 in spite of the limitations of analytical methods crevoisier et al 2009 numerical schemes for solving different forms of re still suffer from problems of robustness and accuracy krabbenhøft 2007 ross 2003 zha et al 2017 2013a b particularly for infiltration into dry soils with a sharp wetting front rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary conditions as well as heterogeneous soils the primitive form of the one dimensional re also called the mixed form re is derived from the mass balance equation 1 θ t q z and darcy s law 2 q k h z k where θ l3l 3 is the volumetric soil moisture content t t is the time z l is the spatial location positive downward and q lt 1 is the vertical darcian flux h l is the pressure head k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity generally eqs 1 and 2 contribute to the mixed form re in which the pressure head h serves as the driving force variable and soil moisture θ as the accumulation variable krabbenhøft 2007 to be solved numerically either θ or h is preferentially taken as the primary variable when the darcian flux eq 2 is substituted with q d θ z k where d l2t 1 is the hydraulic diffusivity the conventional θ form re results 3 θ t z d θ z k z alternatively by replacing the storage term in eq 1 with θ t c h t where c l 1 is the soil capacity c θ h the h form re follows 4 c h t z k h z k z the θ form re is inherently mass conservative and less non linear warrick 1991 in the inter nodal averaged hydraulic diffusivity d especially for dry soil conditions thus reducing the numerical difficulties furthermore in terms of experimental measurement available devices for monitoring soil moisture are directly applicable for model calibration and parameter estimation robinson et al 2008 however models based on θ form re cannot properly account for the inter nodal flux terms when there are saturated nodes or in heterogeneous soils crevoisier et al 2009 kirkland et al 1992 zha et al 2013b although improved approximation of flows in heterogeneous soils have been achieved matthews et al 2004 schiesser 1991 zha et al 2013b the θ form methods cannot deal with saturated soils or mixed unsaturated saturated situations in contrast the h form methods are more general for variably saturated flow simulation especially in heterogeneous soils however they usually lead to serious mass balance errors celia et al 1990 with celia s mass balance scheme some popular codes software packages based on the h form re have been developed šimůnek et al 2009 van dam et al 2008 nevertheless such mass balance errors are largely determined by the iteration closure criteria furthermore in the h form model the nonlinearity of both the soil water capacity c h and the hydraulic conductivity k h as well as the non monotonicity of c h contribute jointly to instabilities when simulating infiltration into dry soil zha et al 2017 to reduce the nonlinearity of the head in the unsaturated zone while preserving model generality a so called primary variable switching technique has been proposed by taking either h or θ as the primary variable depending on the saturation of the numerical nodes diersch and perrochet 1999 forsyth et al 1995 under a newton s iteration framework the primary variable switching technique takes the derivative of the discretized equation set with respect to h for saturated nodes or with respect to θ for unsaturated nodes brunner and simmons 2012 diersch and perrochet 1999 forsyth et al 1995 krabbenhøft 2007 wu and forsyth 2001 the resultant jacobian matrix is used to solve the equation set with increments of primary variables δh or δθ as unknowns after solving the increments the primary variables and their corresponding secondary variables are updated and the simulation proceeds however such an algorithm inevitably causes non smooth transitions between alternative primary variables which potentially produce unrealistic solutions krabbenhøft 2007 zha et al 2017 although improvements were made to minimize such deficiencies hassane maina and ackerer 2017 kees and miller 2002 krabbenhøft 2007 the schemes tend to be problem specific additionally the proposed switching method has been restricted to newton s iteration methods although more robust and with higher order convergence than the picard method paniconi and putti 1994 newton s method increases algebraic complexity and computational costs for assembling the derivative terms in the jacobian matrix krabbenhøft 2007 paniconi and putti 1994 several popular numerical codes of re such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 and swap van dam et al 2008 are designed for picard method based on the above a generalized method that reduces the nonlinearity of the head in the unsaturated zone while keeping model generality is developed in this paper we directly start from the h form re eq 4 for saturated regions while the θ form re eq 3 for unsaturated regions the numerical discretization of a computational element bounded by two nodes is handled by combining the h and θ form res at the equation level the resulting numerical model uses head and moisture as unknown variables for saturated and unsaturated nodes respectively from an implementation perspective the proposed method is more general since it can be used in both picard and newton iteration schemes moreover to alleviate the non smooth transition between alternative primary variables krabbenhøft 2007 a threshold effective saturation of secrit is employed to regulate the primary variable switching within the picard iteration scheme the paper is arranged as follows the generalized numerical scheme for switching between the two governing res is given in section 2 examples of its use in numerical experiments is presented in section 3 where a remarkable increase in model robustness is achieved using the proposed method results and discussion are in section 4 and conclusions are reached in section 5 2 numerical formation 2

forms of re the effective saturation at each node se is used to determine the form of re at node i when se secrit an h form re is taken as the governing equation thus we get φ h k k and β c or else when se secrit a θ form re is used then φ θ k d k c and β 1 the switching threshold secrit is of great dependence on the soil parameters and hydraulic conditions near the dry wetting front in our work

their inter nodal flux is calculated by the darcy s law q k φ z k then the equivalent inter nodal fluxes calculated by the h and θ form res are as follows 14 q i 1 2 h k i 1 2 j 1 δ z i 1 2 h i j 1 h

when both of the re are in h form ω is 1 when in θ form ω is zero solving eq 15 with an implicit iteration solver picard or newton will inevitably introduce an extra group of unknown variables at nodes i 1 and i which have to be eliminated for example with θ and h form res at nodes i 1 and i respectively the θ i 1 j 1 and h i j 1 will remain unknown variables with iteration level k 1 while h i 1 j 1 and θ i j 1 have to be explicitly represented by their solution at previous iteration level k or vice versa compared with the newton s method the picard iteration scheme is much simpler in

use two situations with h or θ form re at nodes i 1 and i are given below 1 se i se crit and se i 1 se crit with θ form re at node i 1 while h form re at node i only θ i 1 j 1 k 1 and h i j 1 k 1 are

the developed switching method represented by eq 15 is restricted to any implicit iteration solver such as newton s scheme for further extension of the switching method into a newton s scheme as described by eqs 11 and 12 the first order derivatives of eq 15 have to be obtained which adds more complexity for coding and is not discussed here 2 3 soil heterogeneity in this work the van genuchten parametric model van genuchten 1980 is preferred as the constitutive relationship for linking two of the variables i e h and θ the hydraulic parameters are calculated by θ or h using a range of soil parameters pl l 1 2 m which consists of the saturated and residual water contents θs l3l 3 and θr l3l 3 the pore size distribution parameters n m 1 1 n and α l 1 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks lt 1 as a convention hereinafter the vector p i 1 2 is used to indicate a group of soil parameters in element i 1 2 which is bounded by vertices i 1 and i in a vertex centered grid for a heterogeneous soil column a node will inevitably be located at the soil interface when an element is bounded by such nodes the θ form re will introduce significant deviation in the inter nodal flux due to the discontinuity of water content at the interface zha et al 2013b that is the control volume of the interface node i will be divided into two sub volumes with different water contents i e θ i θ h i p i 1 2 and θ i θ h i p i 1 2 the water contents in sub volumes at two of the adjacent vertices θ i and θ i 1 contribute to establishing the water balance within element i 1 2 however such a modification is performed explicitly and needs further arrangement of unknown variables for an iterative solver to produce a generalized format for applying the h and θ form res in heterogeneous soils the inter nodal flux is corrected to 21 q i 1 2 j 1 k 1 k i 1 2 j 1 k 1 δ z i 1 2 φ i j 1 k 1 φ i 1 j 1 k 1 k i 1 2 j 1 k ε i 1 2 j 1 k where ε i 1 2 j 1 k k i 1 2 j 1 k δ z i 1 2 φ i j 1 k φ i 1 j 1

efficiency of the developed method a range of initial and boundary conditions and soil textures see table 1 are considered to assess the accuracy robustness and computational cost of the proposed numerical scheme results from the proposed switching scheme picard s are compared with the corresponding solutions from the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 taken as picard method in comparing numerical efficiency solutions by the hydrus 1d code with fine grids and time steps are taken as the truth the closure criteria for convergence in these picard solvers are unified by δθ 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and δh 0 01 cm numerical efficiency of the methods are assessed from the total number of iterations to evaluate the performance of the developed model we used errmb to indicate the global relative

into a dry sandy soil case 1 refers to miller et al s problem miller et al 1998 which involves mixed saturated unsaturated conditions a vertical homogeneous soil column is 1000 cm in length the parameters for a sandy soil are indicated by soil 1 in table 1 as common setting shared through the tests the initial pressure head is indicated by h z t 0 z 990 cm the lower constant head boundary is h z 1000 cm t 10 cm a constant flux upper boundary of q z 0 t 0 25 cm min is imposed on the soil column the total simulation lasts 60 min the solutions obtained from the hydrus 1d code with δz 0 05 cm and maximum time step size of 10 5 min are taken as the truth the sandy soil column soil 1 is discretized by a uniform grid with node spacings of δz 2 cm 1 25 cm 1 cm 0 5 cm and 0 25 cm the threshold for switching re is set by 0 6 the initial and minimum time step sizes are set by 0 1 min while the maximum time step size is 10 min 3 2 case 2 infiltration into layered soils case 2 reproduces the hills et al problem hills et al 1989 to handle heterogeneous soils with a switching re method a 100 cm soil column consists of five layers alternating between two soil types soil 2 a loamy fine sand for layer 1 3 and 5 and 3 a clay loam for layer 2 and 4 in table 1 each soil layer has an equal thickness of 20 cm the soil column is discretized by a uniform grid with δz 0 2 cm 1 cm and 5 cm the soil column is with non flux lower boundary condition of q z 100 cm t 0 and constant flux upper boundary condition of q z 0 t 2 cm d while with three different initial pressure heads indicated by h z t t 0 100 000 cm 10 000 cm and 1000 cm the total simulation time is 5 days 3 3 case 3 atmospheric upper boundary in case 3 a 1000 cm soil column is filled with top down altered soil layers similar to case 2 the only difference is the thickness of the fifth layer with soil 2 which reaches the bottom at z 1000 cm the initial pressure head is hydrostatic with h z 0 z 200 cm the soil column is bounded by a non flux lower boundary and a rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary condition see fig 2 the grid size is δz 0 5 cm the initial and minimum time step sizes are unified by 10 7 d and the maximum time step size is 10 d the total simulation time is 365 days the corresponding solutions of hydrus 1d code with grid size of δz 0 1 cm and maximum time step size of 0 001 min are taken as the truth 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical efficiency and robustness the numerical efficiency and robustness of the picard method are significantly influenced by the time step and grid sizes as well as the soil properties as presented in fig 3 the l 2 h and l 2 θ for the proposed picard s method are consistently smaller than that for the traditional picard method with coarser grid the numerical accuracy improvement by the picard s method is obvious the solution errors mainly occur at the wetting front where the richards equation is switched therefore the switching method contributes to significantly reduce the local numerical errors similar tendencies can be observed in computational cost indicated by the number of picard iteration see fig 4 and the relative mass balance errors errmb see fig 5 as shown in for an h form re method the mass balance error is controlled by the closure criteria of the picard solver more nonlinearity in the governing equation inevitably leads more occurrence of hitting the closure criteria before meeting convergence thus larger errmb and more number of picard iteration in the proposed picard s method the total number of iteration is cut down by about 30 to 15 5 with grid size of δz 0 25 2 cm which means higher grid density contributes to more cost saving such reduction of the total number of iteration is problem specific and changes by time see fig 4 although the mass balance error for a picard method hydrus 1d can be soundly limited celia et al 1990 the developed picard s method brings about further reduction by 95 99 see fig 5 in case 1 the highest nonlinearity occurs at the beginning of the simulation the traditional picard method crashes before refining the initial time step size to 10 4 min in contrast the corresponding initial time step size of the developed picard s method can be a maximal 10 1 min for an h form re the soil capacity c at a very dry soil moisture content is usually close to zero certain amount of water input will cause significant vibration of c back and forth at two sides of the maximal value cmax zha et al 2017 which expenses extra iteration for the numerical scheme to meet convergence for the proposed picard s method in our work such instability is significantly avoided by resorting to the θ form re at a very dry state the nodes with effective saturation larger than secrit are governed by the h form re 4 2 heterogeneity in soil properties simulating the soil water movement using the richards equation has to deal with highly unfavorable conditions such as heterogeneity in the soil properties and rapid variability in the boundary conditions soil heterogeneity introduces discontinuous distribution of water content as primary variable at the interface of two different soils for an h form re method such inadequacy is avoided due to the innate continuity of pressure head as primary variable in our work the θ form re is modified with a correction term indicating such discontinuity at the interface node the governing equation is thus switched only according to the effective saturation at each node in case 2 we investigated the application of the switched h and θ form re with layered soils comparison of pressure head and water content solution profiles in fig 6 validates our method the switching scheme as well as the traditional non switching h form method are in similar level of accuracy see table 2 the relative reduction of mass balance error errmb ranges from 71 to 95 where the least reduction of errmb for the picard s method appears with coarse grid and very dry initial pressure head rough comparison of results in case 1 and 2 shows less priority in mass balance error reduction due to the nonlinearity in the soil properties to visualize the performance of the developed method in such an unfavorable condition the relative reduction of l 2 h and l 2 θ are presented in fig 7 with a fine grid the accuracy improvement in water content indicated by l 2 θ is trivial however for all of the hydraulic conditions and grid sizes the proposed method achieves significant error reduction for pressure head solution indicated by l 2 h notably higher numerical accuracy does not necessarily mean a definite priority for heterogeneous soils in table 2 the computational cost of the proposed switching scheme is similar to the traditional h form method 4 3 rapidly changing upper boundary another non trivial unfavorable condition comes from the intensive alternation of the boundaries e g the rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary condition in case 3 a semi arid atmospheric condition is simulated with a layered unsaturated saturated soil column the rapidness in the changing upper boundary lies in the large amount of rainfall infiltration or irrigation after a long lasting drought which dries out most of the soil moisture as analyzed above such a common and extreme condition introduces a very small soil capacity into the h form re the proposed switching method avoids such problem with ease that is by employing a θ form re instead in fig 8 both the solutions provided by the switching picard s and non switching picard methods conformed to the reference solution obtained with high density grid and time step truth the numerical stability however differs in different aspects as presented in fig 9 a although the adaptive time stepping scheme for both of the methods with shared minimal and initial time step sizes of 10 7 d are adequate enough to produce sound solutions the traditional picard method with an h form re obtains painstaking solutions at the alternation points for rapidly changing of the upper boundary conditions the computational cost for the proposed method is 70 to the traditional method this amount of cost saving is not immobilized for problems with higher grid density as well as more occurrence for altering the upper boundary conditions the priority in the picard s method will be much more prominent comparison of mass conservation is presented in fig 9c the errmb in a picard method though already very small 0 55 has been cut down to 0 0027 which means 99 5 of reduction in the mass balance error 5 conclusions in this paper a generalized switching scheme is proposed to implicitly solve the h and θ form richards equations res to account for the specific benefits in each form of re this is particularly useful for handling unsaturated saturated soil conditions the proposed switching method differing from the traditional primary variable switching technique implemented with a newton s iteration scheme is successfully implemented in a picard iteration model denoted here as picard s the scheme proposed here is easy for coding and takes advantages of the strengths in both the h and θ form re an effective saturation is taken as threshold to regulate the equation switching process between h and θ form re at each numerical node three soil column test cases from literature were considered to assess the numerical efficiency of the proposed scheme which explored the influences of by grid and time step sizes initial and boundary conditions and soil heterogeneity conclusions are as follows 1 a generalized switching scheme has been proposed to take full advantages of the h and θ form res and was successfully implemented in a one dimensional picard iteration model two difficulties for switching to the relevant forms of re in the traditional picard iteration scheme are addressed first an implicit iteration scheme is proposed for carrying out water balance analysis in the switching element bounded by nodes with different governing equations secondly the generalized θ form re is applied in heterogeneous soils which makes it possible to take full advantage of models built with water content based re 2 the proposed scheme shows non trivial numerical advantages over the traditional picard iteration method especially when simulating infiltration into dry sandy soils as well as for flows under rapidly changing atmospheric boundary conditions test cases show great adaptability in the picard s method with sharper hydraulic gradients the proposed method significantly improves conservation of mass which is an inheritance of using θ form re 3 future work will major in applying the proposed method into a newton s iteration scheme and extending it to two and three dimensional as well as large scale field problems acknowledgments this work was funded by the chinese national natural science no 51479143 and 51609173 the authors would thank prof ian white

7186,simulation of variably saturated soil water flow requires the use of pressure head or soil moisture or a switching between the two as the primary variable for solving richards equation under unfavorable conditions such as heterogeneity rapidly changing atmospheric boundary or sudden infiltration into dry soils the traditional non switching method suffers from numerical difficulties solving this problem with a primary variable switching method is less preferred due to the mathematical complexity while the picard method is more popular for solving the non switching models due to its simplicity and stability two different forms of richards equation are combined into one numerical scheme for switching under specific hydraulic conditions the method is successfully implemented in a one dimensional model solved by a picard iteration scheme a threshold saturation based on the soil moisture retention relation is used for switching between either form of the richards equation the method developed here is applicable for simulating variably saturated subsurface flow in heterogeneous soils compared with traditional methods the proposed model conserves mass well and is numerically more stable and efficient keywords richards equation generalized switching scheme iteration method unsaturated saturated flow unfavorable conditions heterogeneous soils 1 introduction the richards equation re richards 1931 is considered the only basis for accurate and physically based solutions for modeling the sub surface flow farthing and ogden 2017 however the significant non linearity of moisture retention curves has led to major efforts to improve the generality and efficiency of algorithms for solving re either analytically white and broadbridge 1988 or numerically forsyth et al 1995 ross 2003 zha et al 2017 in spite of the limitations of analytical methods crevoisier et al 2009 numerical schemes for solving different forms of re still suffer from problems of robustness and accuracy krabbenhøft 2007 ross 2003 zha et al 2017 2013a b particularly for infiltration into dry soils with a sharp wetting front rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary conditions as well as heterogeneous soils the primitive form of the one dimensional re also called the mixed form re is derived from the mass balance equation 1 θ t q z and darcy s law 2 q k h z k where θ l3l 3 is the volumetric soil moisture content t t is the time z l is the spatial location positive downward and q lt 1 is the vertical darcian flux h l is the pressure head k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity generally eqs 1 and 2 contribute to the mixed form re in which the pressure head h serves as the driving force variable and soil moisture θ as the accumulation variable krabbenhøft 2007 to be solved numerically either θ or h is preferentially taken as the primary variable when the darcian flux eq 2 is substituted with q d θ z k where d l2t 1 is the hydraulic diffusivity the conventional θ form re results 3 θ t z d θ z k z alternatively by replacing the storage term in eq 1 with θ t c h t where c l 1 is the soil capacity c θ h the h form re follows 4 c h t z k h z k z the θ form re is inherently mass conservative and less non linear warrick 1991 in the inter nodal averaged hydraulic diffusivity d especially for dry soil conditions thus reducing the numerical difficulties furthermore in terms of experimental measurement available devices for monitoring soil moisture are directly applicable for model calibration and parameter estimation robinson et al 2008 however models based on θ form re cannot properly account for the inter nodal flux terms when there are saturated nodes or in heterogeneous soils crevoisier et al 2009 kirkland et al 1992 zha et al 2013b although improved approximation of flows in heterogeneous soils have been achieved matthews et al 2004 schiesser 1991 zha et al 2013b the θ form methods cannot deal with saturated soils or mixed unsaturated saturated situations in contrast the h form methods are more general for variably saturated flow simulation especially in heterogeneous soils however they usually lead to serious mass balance errors celia et al 1990 with celia s mass balance scheme some popular codes software packages based on the h form re have been developed šimůnek et al 2009 van dam et al 2008 nevertheless such mass balance errors are largely determined by the iteration closure criteria furthermore in the h form model the nonlinearity of both the soil water capacity c h and the hydraulic conductivity k h as well as the non monotonicity of c h contribute jointly to instabilities when simulating infiltration into dry soil zha et al 2017 to reduce the nonlinearity of the head in the unsaturated zone while preserving model generality a so called primary variable switching technique has been proposed by taking either h or θ as the primary variable depending on the saturation of the numerical nodes diersch and perrochet 1999 forsyth et al 1995 under a newton s iteration framework the primary variable switching technique takes the derivative of the discretized equation set with respect to h for saturated nodes or with respect to θ for unsaturated nodes brunner and simmons 2012 diersch and perrochet 1999 forsyth et al 1995 krabbenhøft 2007 wu and forsyth 2001 the resultant jacobian matrix is used to solve the equation set with increments of primary variables δh or δθ as unknowns after solving the increments the primary variables and their corresponding secondary variables are updated and the simulation proceeds however such an algorithm inevitably causes non smooth transitions between alternative primary variables which potentially produce unrealistic solutions krabbenhøft 2007 zha et al 2017 although improvements were made to minimize such deficiencies hassane maina and ackerer 2017 kees and miller 2002 krabbenhøft 2007 the schemes tend to be problem specific additionally the proposed switching method has been restricted to newton s iteration methods although more robust and with higher order convergence than the picard method paniconi and putti 1994 newton s method increases algebraic complexity and computational costs for assembling the derivative terms in the jacobian matrix krabbenhøft 2007 paniconi and putti 1994 several popular numerical codes of re such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 and swap van dam et al 2008 are designed for picard method based on the above a generalized method that reduces the nonlinearity of the head in the unsaturated zone while keeping model generality is developed in this paper we directly start from the h form re eq 4 for saturated regions while the θ form re eq 3 for unsaturated regions the numerical discretization of a computational element bounded by two nodes is handled by combining the h and θ form res at the equation level the resulting numerical model uses head and moisture as unknown variables for saturated and unsaturated nodes respectively from an implementation perspective the proposed method is more general since it can be used in both picard and newton iteration schemes moreover to alleviate the non smooth transition between alternative primary variables krabbenhøft 2007 a threshold effective saturation of secrit is employed to regulate the primary variable switching within the picard iteration scheme the paper is arranged as follows the generalized numerical scheme for switching between the two governing res is given in section 2 examples of its use in numerical experiments is presented in section 3 where a remarkable increase in model robustness is achieved using the proposed method results and discussion are in section 4 and conclusions are reached in section 5 2 numerical formation 2

their inter nodal flux is calculated by the darcy s law q k φ z k then the equivalent inter nodal fluxes calculated by the h and θ form res are as follows 14 q i 1 2 h k i 1 2 j 1 δ z i 1 2 h i j 1 h

when both of the re are in h form ω is 1 when in θ form ω is zero solving eq 15 with an implicit iteration solver picard or newton will inevitably introduce an extra group of unknown variables at nodes i 1 and i which have to be eliminated for example with θ and h form res at nodes i 1 and i respectively the θ i 1 j 1 and h i j 1 will remain unknown variables with iteration level k 1 while h i 1 j 1 and θ i j 1 have to be explicitly represented by their solution at previous iteration level k or vice versa compared with the newton s method the picard iteration scheme is much simpler in algebraic structure and more widely used among some popular codes packages šimůnek et al 2009 van dam et al 2008 thus in this work the switching method is applied to the picard scheme for practical use two situations with h or θ form re at nodes i 1 and i are given below 1 se i se crit and se i 1 se crit with θ form re at node i 1 while h form re at node i only θ i 1 j 1 k 1 and h i j 1 k 1 are

the developed switching method represented by eq 15 is restricted to any implicit iteration solver such as newton s scheme for further extension of the switching method into a newton s scheme as described by eqs 11 and 12 the first order derivatives of eq 15 have to be obtained which adds more complexity for coding and is not discussed here 2 3 soil heterogeneity in this work the van genuchten parametric model van genuchten 1980 is preferred as the constitutive relationship for linking two of the variables i e h and θ the hydraulic parameters are calculated by θ or h using a range of soil parameters pl l 1 2 m which consists of the saturated and residual water contents θs l3l 3 and θr l3l 3 the pore size distribution parameters n m 1 1 n and α l 1 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks lt 1 as a convention hereinafter the vector p i 1 2 is used to indicate a group of soil parameters in element i 1 2 which is bounded by vertices i 1 and i in a vertex centered grid for a heterogeneous soil column a node will inevitably be located at the soil interface when an element is bounded by such nodes the θ form re will introduce significant deviation in the inter nodal flux due to the discontinuity of water content at the interface zha et al 2013b that is the control volume of the interface node i will be divided into two sub volumes with different water contents i e θ i θ h i p i 1 2 and θ i θ h i p i 1 2 the water contents in sub volumes at two of the adjacent vertices θ i and θ i 1 contribute to establishing the water balance within element i 1 2 however such a modification is performed explicitly and needs further arrangement of unknown variables for an iterative solver to produce a generalized format for applying the h and θ form res in heterogeneous soils

efficiency of the developed method a range of initial and boundary conditions and soil textures see table 1 are considered to assess the accuracy robustness and computational cost of the proposed numerical scheme results from the proposed switching scheme picard s are compared with the corresponding solutions from the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 taken as picard method in comparing numerical efficiency solutions by the hydrus 1d code with fine grids and time steps are taken as the truth the closure criteria for convergence in these picard solvers are unified by δθ 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and δh 0 01 cm numerical efficiency of the methods are assessed from the total number of iterations to evaluate the performance of the developed model we used errmb to indicate the global relative

into a dry sandy soil case 1 refers to miller et al s problem miller et al 1998 which involves mixed saturated unsaturated conditions a vertical homogeneous soil column is 1000 cm in length the parameters for a sandy soil are indicated by soil 1 in table 1 as common setting shared through the tests the initial pressure head is indicated by h z t 0 z 990 cm the lower constant head boundary is h z 1000 cm t 10 cm a constant flux upper boundary of q z 0 t 0 25 cm min is imposed on the soil column the total simulation lasts 60 min the solutions obtained from the hydrus 1d code with δz 0 05 cm and maximum time step size of 10 5 min are taken as the truth the sandy soil column soil 1 is discretized by a uniform grid with node spacings of δz 2 cm 1 25 cm 1 cm 0 5 cm and 0 25 cm the threshold for switching re is set by 0 6 the initial and minimum time step sizes are set by 0 1 min while the maximum time step size is 10 min 3 2 case 2 infiltration into layered soils case 2 reproduces the hills et al problem hills et al 1989 to handle heterogeneous soils with a switching re method a 100 cm soil column consists of five layers alternating between two soil types soil 2 a loamy fine sand for layer 1 3 and 5 and 3 a clay loam for layer 2 and 4 in table 1 each soil layer has an equal thickness of 20 cm the soil column is discretized by a uniform grid with δz 0 2 cm 1 cm and 5 cm the soil column is with non flux lower boundary condition of q z 100 cm t 0 and constant flux upper boundary condition of q z 0 t 2 cm d while with three different initial pressure heads indicated by h z t t 0 100 000 cm 10 000 cm and 1000 cm the total simulation time is 5 days 3 3 case 3 atmospheric upper boundary in case 3 a 1000 cm soil column is filled with top down altered soil layers similar to case 2 the only difference is the thickness of the fifth layer with soil 2 which reaches the bottom at z 1000 cm the initial pressure head is hydrostatic with h z 0 z 200 cm the soil column is bounded by a non flux lower boundary and a rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary condition see fig 2 the grid size is δz 0 5 cm the initial and minimum time step sizes are unified by 10 7 d and the maximum time step size is 10 d the total simulation time is 365 days the corresponding solutions of hydrus 1d code with grid size of δz 0 1 cm and maximum time step size of 0 001 min are taken as the truth 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical efficiency and robustness the numerical efficiency and robustness of the picard method are significantly influenced by the time step and grid sizes as well as the soil properties as presented in fig 3 the l 2 h and l 2 θ for the proposed picard s method are consistently smaller than that for the traditional picard method with coarser grid the numerical accuracy improvement by the picard s method is obvious the solution errors mainly occur at the wetting front where the richards equation is switched therefore the switching method contributes to significantly reduce the local numerical errors similar tendencies can be observed in computational cost indicated by the number of picard iteration see fig 4 and the relative mass balance errors errmb see fig 5 as shown in for an h form re method the mass balance error is controlled by the closure criteria of the picard solver more nonlinearity in the governing equation inevitably leads more occurrence of hitting the closure criteria before meeting convergence thus larger errmb and more number of picard iteration in the proposed picard s method the total number of iteration is cut down by about 30 to 15 5 with grid size of δz 0 25 2 cm which means higher grid density contributes to more cost saving such reduction of the total number of iteration is problem specific and changes by time see fig 4 although the mass balance error for a picard method hydrus 1d can be soundly limited celia et al 1990 the developed picard s method brings about further reduction by 95 99 see fig 5 in case 1 the highest nonlinearity occurs at the beginning of the simulation the traditional picard method crashes before refining the initial time step size to 10 4 min in contrast the corresponding initial time step size of the developed picard s method can be a maximal 10 1 min for an h form re the soil capacity c at a very dry soil moisture content is usually close to zero certain amount of water input will cause significant vibration of c back and forth at two sides of the maximal value cmax zha et al 2017 which expenses extra iteration for the numerical scheme to meet convergence for the proposed picard s method in our work such instability is significantly avoided by resorting to the θ form re at a very dry state the nodes with effective saturation larger than secrit are governed by the h form re 4 2 heterogeneity in soil properties simulating the soil water movement using the richards equation has to deal with highly unfavorable conditions such as heterogeneity in the soil properties and rapid variability in the boundary conditions soil heterogeneity introduces discontinuous distribution of water content as primary variable at the interface of two different soils for an h form re method such inadequacy is avoided due to the innate continuity of pressure head as primary variable in our work the θ form re is modified with a correction term indicating such discontinuity at the interface node the governing equation is thus switched only according to the effective saturation at each node in case 2 we investigated the application of the switched h and θ form re with layered soils comparison of pressure head and water content solution profiles in fig 6 validates our method the switching scheme as well as the traditional non switching h form method are in similar level of accuracy see table 2 the relative reduction of mass balance error errmb ranges from 71 to 95 where the least reduction of errmb for the picard s method appears with coarse grid and very dry initial pressure head rough comparison of results in case 1 and 2 shows less priority in mass balance error reduction due to the nonlinearity in the soil properties to visualize the performance of the developed method in such an unfavorable condition the relative reduction of l 2 h and l 2 θ are presented in fig 7 with a fine grid the accuracy improvement in water content indicated by l 2 θ is trivial however for all of the hydraulic conditions and grid sizes the proposed method achieves significant error reduction for pressure head solution indicated by l 2 h notably higher numerical accuracy does not necessarily mean a definite priority for heterogeneous soils in table 2 the computational cost of the proposed switching scheme is similar to the traditional h form method 4 3 rapidly changing upper boundary another non trivial unfavorable condition comes from the intensive alternation of the boundaries e g the rapidly changing atmospheric upper boundary condition in case 3 a semi arid atmospheric condition is simulated with a layered unsaturated saturated soil column the rapidness in the changing upper boundary lies in the large amount of rainfall infiltration or irrigation after a long lasting drought which dries out most of the soil moisture as analyzed above such a common and extreme condition introduces a very small soil capacity into the h form re the proposed switching method avoids such problem with ease that is by employing a θ form re instead in fig 8 both the solutions provided by the switching picard s and non switching picard methods conformed to the reference solution obtained with high density grid and time step truth the numerical stability however differs in different aspects as presented in fig 9 a although the adaptive time stepping scheme for both of the methods with shared minimal and initial time step sizes of 10 7 d are adequate enough to produce sound solutions the traditional picard method with an h form re obtains painstaking solutions at the alternation points for rapidly changing of the upper boundary conditions the computational cost for the proposed method is 70 to the traditional method this amount of cost saving is not immobilized for problems with higher grid density as well as more occurrence for altering the upper boundary conditions the priority in the picard s method will be much more prominent comparison of mass conservation is presented in fig 9c the errmb in a picard method though already very small 0 55 has been cut down to 0 0027 which means 99 5 of reduction in the mass balance error 5 conclusions in this paper a generalized switching scheme is proposed to implicitly solve the h and θ form richards equations res to account for the specific benefits in each form of re this is particularly useful for handling unsaturated saturated soil conditions the proposed switching method differing from the traditional primary variable switching technique implemented with a newton s iteration scheme is successfully implemented in a picard iteration model denoted here as picard s the scheme proposed here is easy for coding and takes advantages of the strengths in both the h and θ form re an effective saturation is taken as threshold to regulate the equation switching process between h and θ form re at each numerical node three soil column test cases from literature were considered to assess the numerical efficiency of the proposed scheme which explored the influences of by grid and time step sizes initial and boundary conditions and soil heterogeneity conclusions are as follows 1 a generalized switching scheme has been proposed to take full advantages of the h and θ form res and was successfully implemented in a one dimensional picard iteration model two difficulties for switching to the relevant forms of re in the traditional picard iteration scheme are addressed first an implicit iteration scheme is proposed for carrying out water balance analysis in the switching element bounded by nodes with different governing equations secondly the generalized θ form re is applied in heterogeneous soils which makes it possible to take full advantage of models built with water content based re 2 the proposed scheme shows non trivial numerical advantages over the traditional picard iteration method especially when simulating infiltration into dry sandy soils as well as for flows under rapidly changing atmospheric boundary conditions test cases show great adaptability in the picard s method with sharper hydraulic gradients the proposed method significantly improves conservation of mass which is an inheritance of using θ form re 3 future work will major in applying the proposed method into a newton s iteration scheme and extending it to two and three dimensional as well as large scale field problems acknowledgments this work was funded by the chinese national natural science no 51479143 and 51609173 the authors would thank prof ian white

7187,satellite based rainfall products srps are nowadays available at ever increasing accuracy and higher spatial and temporal resolution with respect to the past despite this they are scarcely used in hydrological modeling the main reasons may be related to 1 the large bias characterizing satellite precipitation estimates which is dependent on rainfall intensity and the season 2 the relatively large spatial temporal resolution with respect to the applications 3 the timeliness which is often insufficient for operational purposes and 4 a general often not justified skepticism of the hydrological community in the use of satellite products for land applications the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using srps to force a lumped hydrologic model misdc over 15 basins in the mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics specifically tmpa 3b42 rt cmorph persiann and a new soil moisture derived rainfall datasets sm2raincci obtained through the application of sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to esa cci soil moisture product are used in the analysis the performances obtained with the selected srps are compared with those obtained from a ground based rainfall product e obs in addition the performance obtained by an integration of the srps is investigated to see whether merged rainfall observations are able to improve flood simulations the results highlight that srps provide relatively low performances when used to force misdc model with respect to the case where ground observations are used worst results are obtained in smaller basins 500 km2 that however represent the main target for flood modelling in the mediterranean area relatively better performances are obtained when independent srps are integrated each other and particularly for the case where tmpa 3b42 rt is integrated with sm2raincci in accordance with previous studies this suggests that the exploitation via integration of independent sources of rainfall offers a potential way to reduce rainfall induced streamflow errors even in challenging areas like the mediterranean keywords satellite rainfall data hydrological validation merging data sm2rain mediterranean basin 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and dangerous natural hazards causing every year thousands of casualties and damages worldwide winsemius et al 2015 early warning systems ewss represent one of the solution for reducing the impact of flood risk on the society an ews uses hydrologic models and real time data of rainfall and other relevant hydro meteorological variables e g temperature evapotranspiration etc derived from ground monitoring networks to forecast flood events with a sufficient time in advance to warn people and protect goods given the high need of good quality hydro meteorological data along with the high costs for the maintenance of measuring networks the implementation of an ews is very challenging especially within data scarce regions or in developing countries the current satellite remote sensing products have the potential to support some of the needs associated with ewss for instance with daily and sub daily estimates at spatial resolutions down to a tenth of a degree satellite based rainfall products e g the integrated multi satellite retrievals imerg products of the global precipitation measurement mission gpm hou et al 2014 are a suitable data source for forcing hydrological models especially in developing countries or remote locations where conventional rain gauge data are sparse nevertheless these satellite based datasets are inherently subject to errors resulting from the nature of the precipitation measurement villarini et al 2009 sampling uncertainties nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 ciabatta et al 2016 retrieval algorithms and uncertainty in background emissivity values associated with variations in land surface properties kummerow 1998 bytheway and kummerow 2010 to cite a few these errors also change with the different climate regions storm regimes surface conditions seasons and altitudes ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 while a large amount of work has been carried out to quantify these errors comparatively little work has been done to quantify the implications of these errors on derived predictions of hydrological models because of the strong nonlinearities of hydrological models precipitation errors can be amplified or dampened in flood simulations and this response likely depends upon the interactions between the model itself and the quality of the underlying srp qi et al 2016 mei et al 2016 for these reasons srps are currently scarcely used within hydrological models and only a small number of studies have attempted to draw and summarize specific guidelines for srps when used as input for hydrological modelling indeed recent research has shown that even in poorly gauged regions hydrologic simulations using spatially explicit and data intensive srps are equal or inferior in performance to simulations that employ even just a few ground based rain gauges yilmaz et al 2005 beck et al 2017a the main reasons seem to be related to i the existence of significant bias between srps and ground observations which imposes a preliminary bias correction of srps ii the need to re calibrate the hydrologic model when using srps for better accounting the srp hydrological model interactions qi et al 2016 and iii the inherent lower accuracy of srps with respect to those derived from ground networks evidences for the first and second reasons can be found in many studies for instance harris et al 2007 used tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 real time product 3b42rt to drive a hydrologic model over a catchment in kentucky finding that a bias correction before using near real time satellite provided an improvement of flood prediction with the trade off of more false alarms in peak flow artan et al 2007 used the noaa cpc product for famine early warning system fews xie and arkin 1997 to drive a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model over four rivers in asia and africa they found that srps can be used to force a hydrologic model provided that a preliminary parameter recalibration is carried out stisen et al 2008 forced a distributed hydrologic model over the senegal river basin with different srps demonstrating that reasonable flood simulations could be achieved only after a bias correction and a specific model recalibration because of the differences in the temporal dynamic between the products duethmann et al 2013 proposed to calibrate the precipitation bias together with the model parameters by applying a constant bias to the whole range of precipitation intensities this however may not be representative of the actual bias in the precipitation inputs because of the model srp interactions to this end thiemig et al 2013 found that a quantile based bias correction for satellite precipitation was more efficient than monthly bias correction factors recently tramblay et al 2016 evaluated satellite based rainfall estimates for a test catchment located in morocco north africa and found that tmpa 3b42 v 7 estimates adequately reproduced monthly dynamics of discharge in the catchment despite their poor performance at a daily time scale in a study in the niger river casse et al 2015 analysed the potential of different srps to predict the niger river flood events in niamey they found that satellite only products suffer from considerable positive bias and show remarkable differences in the frequency distribution of the rainfall with respect to only gauge and the gauge adjusted rainfall satellite product 3b42v7 which determined poor results in flood simulations at niamey after bias correction the results significantly improved similar results were found by ciabatta et al 2016 in a study involving 4 catchments in italy who showed an increase of the performance of a simple hydrological model after bias correction of the tmpa 3b42rt rainfall estimates and the rainfall estimates derived from the inversion of the soil moisture observations derived from the advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 via sm2rain brocca et al 2014 in the latter study following the work of massari et al 2014 the authors also demonstrated that a simple integration of the srps with ground rainfall estimates enhanced flood simulations for 3 out 4 basins with respect to the situation where only ground rainfall ground data were used this provides a clue that the integration of different sources of rainfall ground and satellite can be highly beneficial for hydrological simulations moreover beck et al 2017a assessed the performance of a merged satellite only product using hydrological modeling for 1000 s of catchments and obtained reasonable performance in tropical catchments however whether the integration between only srps with non ground measurements can positively impact flood simulations has been to our knowledge never tested in the mediterranean area in this study near real

continuo brocca et al 2011 over 15 basins in the mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics the objective of this study is twofold 1 to test whether or not the integration of different near real time srps derived from different sources can lead to enhanced rainfall estimates that can maximize the utility of existing srps for hydrologic applications in ground data poor regions 2 to provide a robust analysis of the hydrological performance of the most used near real time srps in the mediterranean area in particular conversely to previous studies intended to evaluate the quality of the state of the art rainfall products both satellite and re analysis estimates see e g beck et al 2017a the aim of this work is to test the suitability of near real time satellite rainfall for possible near real time hydrological application the paper is organized as follows section 2 and 3 describe the study area and the dataset employed for the analysis respectively the methodology is described in section 4 in section 5 the results obtained over the study area for all the rainfall dataset are collected and thoroughly commented conclusions are listed in section 6 2 study area the study area comprises 15 catchments draining into the mediterranean sea fig 1 the mediterranean region is characterized by complex topography ranging from the alpine mountains the italian and balkan peninsulas northern spain and southern france containing about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 m to the great european plain most of which lies below 152 m in elevation due to the topographic complexity the climate is generally characterized by hot dry summers and humid cool winters with an intricate spatial temporal variability a clear contrast exists between the more rainy northern part of the study region southern europe and the drier southern area north africa iberian peninsula and between the western sides rainsides of the iberian italian and balkan peninsulas and their eastern sides rainshadows the mean annual precipitation averaged over the study area is p 593 203 mm year 1 but it has a strong spatial variability ranging from 20 mm year 1 north africa to 1500 mm year 1 alps a significant seasonal variability exists with the early winter and late autumn months november and december being the wettest with precipitation amounts larger than 60 mm month 1 hatzianastassiou et al 2016 table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the study catchments with area ranging from 100 km2 for rafina basin in greece to about 5000 km2 for the tiber river in italy mean basin elevation from 86 5 m a s l lowland basin to 1362 m a s l mountainous basin and topographic complexity index i e the normalized standard deviation of elevation within a dem grid cell derived from the gtopo30 global digital elevation model wagner et al 2013 varying from 4 8 algas at batea small topographic complexity to 32 3 brenta at berzizza high topographic complexity note that the topographic complexity of the mediterranean region ranges from zeros to 40 and a threshold value of 10 can be assumed to exactly discern between alpine mountainous or lowland areas therefore the selected catchments together form a representative sample of the different climatic and physiographic conditions of the mediterranean 3 datasets 3 1 ground based observations ground based observations include rainfall temperature and discharge data as ground based reference product for precipitation and mean temperature we used the european high resolution gridded data sets e obs haylock et al 2008 developed as part of the eu fp6 ensembles project the rainfall and temperature provided by e obs are available at daily time step for the period 1950 up to now given the relatively high density of the raingauges and thermometers used by this product it can be considered a reasonable reference for comparing the performance of each srp within the hydrological simulations discharge data interpolated at hourly time step are available for all the study catchments as described in table 1 only 4 out of 15 catchments have a limited observation period 4 years whereas for about half of the basins the length of discharge observations is greater than 8 years 3 2 satellite rainfall observation products four different rainfall datasets derived from satellite observations are used table 2 among the state of the art satellite precipitation products which exploit infrared ir and or passive microwave pmw observations to retrieve precipitation we used the near real time version of tmpa 3b42rt cmorph persiann satellite products tmpa 3b42rt provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http disc sci gsfc nasa gov is available from 1997 onward with 3 h temporal resolution and a spatial sampling of 0 25 for the 50 north south latitude band the retrieval algorithm takes advantages of multiple microwave sensors i e the trmm microwave imager tmi the precipitation radar pr the special sensor microwave imager ssm i the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e and the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b the tmpa 3b42rt estimates are obtained through a three step process 1 pmw estimates are calibrated with sensor specific versions of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof kummerow et al 1996 and combined 2 ir rainfall estimates are created using the pmw estimates for calibration and 3 pmw and ir estimates are then combined cmorph is available at different spatial and temporal resolutions here we used the raw version provided by the cpc ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov with a spatial sampling of 0 25 every 3 h the product is available from march 2000 onward on the 60 60 latitude and is obtained by using the same microwave sensors used for tmpa 3b42rt however unlike tmpa 3b42rt here the infrared data are used to propagate the rainfall estimates within the times between two successive microwave satellite overpasses persiann is provided by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs http chrsdata eng uci edu at the university of california irvine uci with a spatial sampling of 0 25 and a 3 hourly temporal resolution persiann product uses the artificial neural network technique to estimate rainfall rate from geostationary infrared data with rainfall is estimated by training the infrared data to the collocated microwave estimates when available hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 in addition to these classical srps we used the sm2raincci rainfall product ciabatta et al 2018 obtained by applying the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to the esa cci satellite soil moisture products in particular within the esa cci initiative http www esa soilmoisture cci org three different sm datasets are provided 1 the active obtained by merging only active sensors observations 2 the passive obtained by merging only passive sensors observations and 3 combined obtained by merging the active and passive datasets liu et al 2011 the datasets are available from 1978 until 2015 at 0 25 of spatial resolution on a daily basis detailed information regarding the esa cci sm products can be found in liu et al 2011 2012 wagner et al 2012 and in dorigo et al 2017 to obtain the sm2raincci rainfall product only the active and the passive esa cci satellite soil moisture products have been combined by a scheme developed by kim et al 2015 the product is characterized by the same temporal and spatial sampling of the esa cci products i e 0 25 degrees and on a daily basis major details about the sm2raincci rainfall performances can be found in ciabatta et al 2018 for sake of simplicity hereinafter the tmpa 3b42rt cmorph persiann and sm2raincci satellite based datasets are referred to as tmpa cmor pers and sm2rcci respectively in accordance with previous studies brocca et al 2014 tmpa cmor pers are classified as top down rainfall products distinguished by the bottom up sm2raincci 4 method in this paragraph the experimental design of the work is illustrated whereas the algorithms and the models applied for the purpose of hydrological validation of srps are described in details on 4 1 4 4 paragraphs at first in order to assess the quality of srps an intercomparison of rainfall datasets is carried out by using the daily rainfall e obs data as reference as several studies have shown that local adjustments of srps as well as specific rainfall runoff model calibration are necessary steps to produce reliable hydrological simulation harris et al 2007 immerzeel and droogers 2008 mccabe et al 2008 pan et al 2008 a bias correction approach is applied to srps prior to use them to force a specific calibrated hydrological model then the suitability of srps for flood modelling is investigated by running the misdc model for each of the considered forcing datasets section 3 as the shorter observation period has a sufficient duration 4 year see table 1 for each catchment discharge data are split exactly in two parts the first half period is used for calibration and the second one for validation first misdc is calibrated and validated for each catchment by using as input the mean areal e obs rainfall and temperature data having all the analyzed catchments a sub daily concentration time to guarantee meaningful hydrological simulations all runs have been carried out at three hourly time step i e the maximum temporal resolution of the srps for that for each day the total e obs rainfall amount is split over eight 3 hourly temporal intervals with constant rainfall rate after that the single bias corrected srps and the integrated ones see section 4 2 are used to drive misdc model in these runs the model parameter values are recalibrated separately for each srps six integrated products are considered in this study that can be divided in two main groups the first group includes integration between only classical top down srps i e tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers the second group considers integration between top down and bottom up srps i e tmpa sm2rcci cmor sm2rcci pers sm2rcci in particular having the sm2rcci rainfall product a daily temporal resolution it is here used only within the integration procedure and not used to simulate discharge time series moreover to allow the integration between the 3 hourly top down products and the daily sm2rcci product for each day the total sm2rcci rainfall amount is re distributed over eight 3 hourly temporal intervals according to the temporal pattern of the partner product 4 1 bias correction of satellite rainfall time series the quantile mapping qm approach is applied to bias correct the cumulative density function cdf of tmpa cmor pers and sm2rcci ciabatta et al 2016 according to e obs the choice of using qm approach is based on the results of thiemig et al 2013 who demonstrated that a more sophisticated qm bias correction method is able to provide better hydrological performance than simpler bias correction methods largely applied in hydrologic and climate impact studies this method match besides the mean and variance all the statistical moments of srps as the skewness and the tails of the cdf to the observed data camici et al 2014 for the srps for the calibration validation period cal val the method can be written as 1 srp qm k cal v a l f ob s k cal 1 f sr p k ca v a l srp k cal v a l where f ob s k cal 1 is the inverse cdf or quantile function of the observations for the day k f sr p k cal is the cdf of the raw srps both in the calibration period as concerns the quantile function f ob s k cal 1 different parametric or non parametric transformations can be adopted gudmundsson et al 2012 in this study a two order polynomial function is applied in which the parameters estimated in the calibration period are then adopted also to bias correct the srps in the validation period given the high presence of zero values in the precipitation signal the application of the qm method can lead to negative rainfall values wang and chen 2014 to overcome this issue qm is applied at daily time step i e by considering accumulated raw srps and e obs rainfall values at daily time step the daily bias corrected values are then re distributed to the eight 3 hourly temporal intervals according to their original temporal pattern although this expedient allows to limit significantly the problem of zeros rainfall values it does not guarantee missing residual negative values in the bias corrected srps thus these values were simply assumed equal to zero which results in a non perfect bias correction 4 2 integration of srps the integration of the single rainfall datasets is implemented by using the following scheme 2 sr p 1 t s r p 2 t s r p 1 t k sr p 2 t s r p 1 t where srp1 t srp2 t is the integrated rainfall product srp1 and srp2 are two single satellite based rainfall products selected among the bias corrected tmpa pers cmor and sm2rcci rainfall k is the gain parameter ranging between 0 05 and 0 95 in order to assure that an integrated product is always obtained from eq 2 in particular when k 0 05 almost only the srp1 is used for k 0 95 almost only srp2 in order to build the best integrated srp for flood simulation k is calibrated by maximizing the modified nash sutcliffe efficiency nse adapted for high flow conditions anse index hoffmann et al 2004 between observed and simulated discharge in the calibration period the same k value is then applied in the validation period to integrate the srps mentioned above 4 3 continuous hydrological model misdc misdc brocca et al 2011 is a one layer semi distributed model that entails two main components 1 a soil water balance model to simulate the soil moisture temporal pattern and 2 a semi distributed event based rainfall runoff model for flood simulation misdc couples a routing module with a single layer soil water balance model the soil water balance module computes the evapotranspiration the percolation the infiltration and the rainfall excess through the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method rates the discharge is estimated by routing the surface runoff the saturation excess and the subsurface runoff to the outlet section the model uses 8 parameters i e the maximum soil water capacity the pore size distribution index the saturated hydraulic conductivity the fraction of percolated water that generates baseflow the lag area relationship coefficient a correction parameter for the evapotranspiration the initial abstraction coefficient of the scs cn method and the coefficient of the relationship relating sm to the initial condition of the scs cn method the model is written in matlab language and is freely available at http hydrology irpi cnr it download area midsc code for model calibration a standard gradient based automatic optimization method the fmincon function in matlab bober 2013 was used misdc model has been successfully applied for flood simulation in many basins in italy brocca et al 2011 2013a massari et al 2015 masseroni et al 2017 and europe brocca et al 2013b and used within climate change impact studies camici et al 2014 4 4 performance metrics the assessment of the different sprs was made by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient r the bias and the root mean square error rmse between the daily e obs and the single integrated satellite rainfall data averaged over the area of each basin the suitability of the gauged based versus single integrated satellite based rainfall products for flood modelling is evaluated by computing anse index between the observed and simulated discharge both in the calibration and validation periods simulations providing anse values greater than 0 5 were reasonably assumed good in terms of reproducing observed high flow discharge time series additionally the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 which was found to be more robust than nse was considered here for assessing model performance for a wider range of flow conditions massari et al 2018 5 results section 5 1 describes the results about the assessment of the different sprs then the suitability of srps for hydrological modeling is investigated at first misdc is driven by e obs section 5 2 to simulate benchmark discharge time series that are compared with the ones obtained by the different srps section 5 3 and the integrated products section 5 4 5 1 rainfall assessment results about rainfall scores for the calibration validation periods are illustrated in fig 2 boxplot with thin thick lines refer to calibration validation periods respectively it can be noted that the performances of the single and integrated products are very similar with each other both in calibration and validation period all the considered products show daily correlation values on average equal to 0 6 both in calibration and validation periods and among the integrated products the tmpa sm2rcci and cmor sm2rcci show a slightly better agreement with observed data mean r 0 62 relatively larger differences are obtained in terms of rmse and bias for the single products with sm2rcci having the highest rmse and bias nevertheless in terms of rmse the first group of integrated products i e tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers perform worse than the second group i e the one containing sm2rcci with general lower values for both groups of the integrated products with respect to the parent products conversely the first group of integrated products outperforms the second one with respect to the bias likely due to the high bias of sm2rcci note that as mentioned in section 4 2 the bias correction procedure adopted during the calibration period is affected by the necessity to set negative rainfall values equal to zero thus the bias differences shown in fig 2 should not surprise r rmse and bias of the products do not show remarkable changes as a function of the basin area while some changes can be observed in terms of topographic complexity and mean basin elevation fig s1 as expected basins over flat areas perform better than mountainous basins 5 2 discharge simulation with e obs rainfall data we test the reliability of misdc by using e obs ground based rainfall fig 1 illustrates the related performances in terms of anse obtained for all the study catchments over the calibration period while table 3 reports the anse values both for calibration validation periods overall misdc model provides relatively good performances with anse values greater than 0 5 exceptions are represented by the rafina basin probably due to the low e obs raingauge density in the investigated period and by kolpa metlika and brenta mountainous catchments for which the snowmelt process not simulated by misdc may play an important role in the flood formation based on that we can reasonably state that the geomorphological characteristics of the basins have a negligible effect on the model performance while raingauge density and model structure errors might play an important role the results above are confirmed also in the validation period as summarized in table 3 indeed anse index shows only slight reductions for all the study catchments except for rafina algas and tiber basins where the performances significantly worsen this is likely due to the sensitivity of anse index in reproducing high flood events that could differ in magnitude between calibration and validation period in general the mean anse value in the validation period decreases on average of about 18 over the study area these outcomes demonstrating the suitability of e obs rainfall dataset for discharge simulation hence it will be hereinafter assumed as a baseline to compare the simulations that use srps 5 3 discharge simulation with single srps the performances in terms of anse and kge of the different rainfall products in reproducing the observed discharge data over the entire study area are illustrated in fig 3 a and b both in the calibration and validation periods anse values of each basin are detailed in table 3 from table 3 it can be noted that with respect to e obs satellite rainfall data perform worst both in calibration and validation periods mean anse value are equal to 0 33 0 15 0 18 for tmpa cmor pers respectively in the calibration period and to 0 18 0 07 0 04 respectively in the validation period among all the products tmpa works better both in calibration and validation periods even though as already highlighted for some basins unreliable simulation characterized by anse values lower than zero are obtained similar considerations can be drawn from the analysis of kge values fig 3b here e obs performs satisfactorily both in calibration mean kge 0 57 and validation 0 46 whereas srps significantly worse this is mainly due to the difficult in using srps for smaller basins e g kge values equal to 1 14 0 38 2 62 0 44 are obtained through tmpa in calibration for rafina voltoya algas and gapeau respectively whereas the performances increase for larger basins e g tmpa provides kge equal to 0 58 in calibration for tiber basin the relatively low performance in terms of kge can be partly explained by the choice of the cost function i e anse within the calibration step which favors a better reproduction of high flows but does not guarantee the same optimality in terms of medium flow and bias in general these outcomes prove that for using srps in hydrological modelling bias correction and model recalibration are not always sufficient to achieve satisfactory performances mainly in smaller basins which represent the main target for flood modelling in the mediterranean area 5 4 discharge simulation with integrated srps the parent srps are integrated according to group 1 tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers and group 2 tmpa sm2rcci cmor sm2rcci pers sm2rcci and results are summarized for the entire study area in fig 3c and table 4 in terms of anse values and in fig 3d in terms of kge index the optimal k values used within the integration process are listed in table s1 for each basin although on average e obs dataset remain the best performing rainfall products the added value of the integrated products against single srps is noticeable for the group 1 as can be noted also looking at table s1 the performances of integrated products are closely linked to the ones of the parent rainfall datasets lower performances are found for cmor pers whereas the integrated products that consider tmpa show greater anse indexes in particular the best results are obtained by considering the integration between tmpa and cmor with mean anse values equal to 0 38 and 0 22 in calibration and validation respectively the performances significantly increase by considering the group 2 i e the integration with sm2rcci to which is generally associated a greater weight in the integration process table s1 indeed anse values are greater than zeros for all the study catchments and above all for tmpa sm2rcci they become closer to the ones obtained with the e obs rainfall data with mean anse values of 0 49 and 0 33 in calibration and validation periods respectively the performances drop when kge index is analyzed for all the integrated products except for the tmpa sm2rcci product this outcome is quite expected being the hydrological model calibrated to reproduce high flood events a more in depth analysis is carried out in order to investigate the advantages of using integrated srps also in relation with the topographic basin characteristics the scatterplots on the first column of fig 4 show the added value of satellite rainfall integration with respect to the use of single rainfall products for all the study catchments small benefits are gained from the integration of cmor with tmpa fig 4a due to the lower cmor performances the anse values obtained by considering tmpa alone are very similar to the ones obtained by considering the integrated product and anse values are aligned along the bisector line both for the calibration and validation period conversely the added value of sm2rcci is noticeable for almost all the basins anse values are spread above the bisector line both for tmpa sm2rcci fig 4c and cmor sm2rcci fig 4e these outcomes are very important as similarly to the study of beck et al 2017b emphasize the importance of merging different precipitation datasets and in particular they demonstrate the potential of the integration between top down and bottom up satellite precipitation products in particular it can be noted that tmpa works better than tmpa sm2rcci only for the smaller basins in the study area rafina and gapeau characterized by similar topographic complexity and mean basin elevation table 1 whereas the added value of the tmpa sm2rcci product is particular evident for algas brenta kolpa at metlika voltuno and lim basins by analysing these results in terms of the basins characteristics as listed in table 1 we did not observe any influence of either the basin area nor the topographic complexity or the mean elevation of the basin for instance the small and mountainous voltoya basin 2 in table 1 or the large lowland tiber river basin 15 in table 1 are opposite cases where it is proved that integrated satellite rainfall data can be useful tools for flood modelling similar conclusions can be drawn by inspecting the scatterplot of fig 4e for 9 out of 15 basins anse values obtained by considering the integrated product are doubled with respect to the ones obtained by considering cmor alone while no connections between basin characteristics and performances can be found these findings highlight that the basin characteristics exert a small influence on the hydrological performance and that the connection between the rainfall quality and the performance in hydrological modelling is not straightforward due the potential interactions between the model and the specific srp as also demonstrated by qi et al 2015 for instance products characterized by a low bias such as those of group 1 i e those obtained by integrating between the classical srps see fig 2 provide worse simulation results with respect to the ones of group 2 those integrated products using sm2rcci this raises the interesting issue whether bias and correlations and rmse are useful scores to indicate potentially good or worse hydrological performance and whether the basin characteristics can condition the choice of the specific rainfall source to use this topic that is beyond the scope of the paper will be further investigated in the future an additional analysis has been carried out to display the relative performance of the integrated srps with respect to e obs in flood simulation fig 4b d and f especially through tmpa sm2rcci product fig 4d in calibration validation period for 7 6 out 15 of the investigated basins anse indexes are equal or even higher than the ones obtained through e obs rainfall data this suggests that integrated srps can be potentially used in place of ground observed rainfall data for flood modelling over poorly gauged areas e g rafina and for lowland large basins i e volturno lim and tiber basins in the mediterranean area to clearly support this statement fig 5 shows observed and simulated discharge time series obtained by forcing misdc model through tmpa tmpa sm2rcci and e obs rainfall data for four basins representative of the topographic characteristics of the study area algas at batea brenta at berzizza kolpa at metlika and tiber at monte molino river basins for sake of visualization for each basin only short time windows on the validation period are displayed here we can see that tmpa product alone does not provide reasonable reproduction of the observed discharges for algas and kolpa but when the latter is integrated with sm2rcci we can obtain even better simulations than those obtained with e obs e g see tiber basin these results support those showed by ciabatta et al 2016 for four basins over italy i e better hydrological performances were obtained by forcing misdc model with integrated rainfall products instead of ground data 6 conclusions in this study real time satellite rainfall products are used for the hydrological modeling over 15 basins located in the mediterranean area with different physiographic conditions through misdc model the simulated discharge values are compared with the ones obtained by forcing the model with e obs gauge based rainfall data the main outcomes are 1 e obs is a robust rainfall dataset for hydrological modeling providing good anse values for almost all the analyzed basins both in calibration and in validation periods 2 the bias correction and the recalibration of the hydrological model applied to the state of the art satellite rainfall products are not always sufficient to obtain satisfactory hydrological simulations only the tmpa product for some basins shows reasonable performances whereas the worst hydrological simulations are obtained by using pers product 3 the integration between different satellite rainfall products although very simple provides better hydrological simulations in particular the highest anse values are obtained by the integration between the top down and the bottom up approaches even if the same is not observed at a rainfall level as the limitations of the two methods are compensated in the integrated product 4 for some basins the performances obtained by integrated rainfall products are even better than the ones obtained by using ground observed data this could be of paramount importance especially in developing countries or remote locations where conventional rain gauge data are sparse 5 the connection among the rainfall performances the basins characteristics and the hydrological model performance is not straightforward and makes difficult the identification of the best satellite rainfall product to use for flood modelling in this respect we encourage more studies trying to address this problematic 6 these results help to clarify some important aspects related to the use of satellite rainfall products for flood modeling in challenging areas as the mediterranean basins and remark the need of independent rainfall sources that coupled with existing ones may reduce their associated uncertainty in future studies a part of the research will be devoted to the exploration of more optimal integration schemes able to dynamically weighting the two parent products as a function of their relative error moreover on future work the analysis will be extended to a larger number of basins in order to analyse whether the hydrological performances of satellite rainfall are dependent on any of the basin

7187,satellite based rainfall products srps are nowadays available at ever increasing accuracy and higher spatial and temporal resolution with respect to the past despite this they are scarcely used in hydrological modeling the main reasons may be related to 1 the large bias characterizing satellite precipitation estimates which is dependent on rainfall intensity and the season 2 the relatively large spatial temporal resolution with respect to the applications 3 the timeliness which is often insufficient for operational purposes and 4 a general often not justified skepticism of the hydrological community in the use of satellite products for land applications the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using srps to force a lumped hydrologic model misdc over 15 basins in the mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics specifically tmpa 3b42 rt cmorph persiann and a new soil moisture derived rainfall datasets sm2raincci obtained through the application of sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to esa cci soil moisture product are used in the analysis the performances obtained with the selected srps are compared with those obtained from a ground based rainfall product e obs in addition the performance obtained by an integration of the srps is investigated to see whether merged rainfall observations are able to improve flood simulations the results highlight that srps provide relatively low performances when used to force misdc model with respect to the case where ground observations are used worst results are obtained in smaller basins 500 km2 that however represent the main target for flood modelling in the mediterranean area relatively better performances are obtained when independent srps are integrated each other and particularly for the case where tmpa 3b42 rt is integrated with sm2raincci in accordance with previous studies this suggests that the exploitation via integration of independent sources of rainfall offers a potential way to reduce rainfall induced streamflow errors even in challenging areas like the mediterranean keywords satellite rainfall data hydrological validation merging data sm2rain mediterranean basin 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and dangerous natural hazards causing every year thousands of casualties and damages worldwide winsemius et al 2015 early warning systems ewss represent one of the solution for reducing the impact of flood risk on the society an ews uses hydrologic models and real time data of rainfall and other relevant hydro meteorological variables e g temperature evapotranspiration etc derived from ground monitoring networks to forecast flood events with a sufficient time in advance to warn people and protect goods given the high need of good quality hydro meteorological data along with the high costs for the maintenance of measuring networks the implementation of an ews is very challenging especially within data scarce regions or in developing countries the current satellite remote sensing products have the potential to support some of the needs associated with ewss for instance with daily and sub daily estimates at spatial resolutions down to a tenth of a degree satellite based rainfall products e g the integrated multi satellite retrievals imerg products of the global precipitation measurement mission gpm hou et al 2014 are a suitable data source for forcing hydrological models especially in developing countries or remote locations where conventional rain gauge data are sparse nevertheless these satellite based datasets are inherently subject to errors resulting from the nature of the precipitation measurement villarini et al 2009 sampling uncertainties nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 ciabatta et al 2016 retrieval algorithms and uncertainty in background emissivity values associated with variations in land surface properties kummerow 1998 bytheway and kummerow 2010 to cite a few these errors also change with the different climate regions storm regimes surface conditions seasons and altitudes ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 while a large amount of work has been carried out to quantify these errors comparatively little work has been done to quantify the implications of these errors on derived predictions of hydrological models because of the strong nonlinearities of hydrological models precipitation errors can be amplified or dampened in flood simulations and this response likely depends upon the interactions between the model itself and the quality of the underlying srp qi et al 2016 mei et al 2016 for these reasons srps are currently scarcely used within hydrological models and only a small number of studies have attempted to draw and summarize specific guidelines for srps when used as input for hydrological modelling indeed recent research has shown that even in poorly gauged regions hydrologic simulations using spatially explicit and data intensive srps are equal or inferior in performance to simulations that employ even just a few ground based rain gauges yilmaz et al 2005 beck et al 2017a the main reasons seem to be related to i the existence of significant bias between srps and ground observations which imposes a preliminary bias correction of srps ii the need to re calibrate the hydrologic model when using srps for better accounting the srp hydrological model interactions qi et al 2016 and iii the inherent lower accuracy of srps with respect to those derived from ground networks evidences for the first and second reasons can be found in many studies for instance harris et al 2007 used tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 real time product 3b42rt to drive a hydrologic model over a catchment in kentucky finding that a bias correction before using near real time satellite provided an improvement of flood prediction with the trade off of more false alarms in peak flow artan et al 2007 used the noaa cpc product for famine early warning system fews xie and arkin 1997 to drive a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model over four rivers in asia and africa they found that srps can be used to force a hydrologic model provided that a preliminary parameter recalibration is carried out stisen et al 2008 forced a distributed hydrologic model over the senegal river basin with different srps demonstrating that reasonable flood simulations could be achieved only after a bias correction and a specific model recalibration because of the differences in the temporal dynamic between the products duethmann et al 2013 proposed to calibrate the precipitation bias together with the model parameters by applying a constant bias to the whole range of precipitation intensities this however may not be representative of the actual bias in the precipitation inputs because of the model srp interactions to this end thiemig et al 2013 found that a quantile based bias correction for satellite precipitation was more efficient than monthly bias correction factors recently tramblay et al 2016 evaluated satellite based rainfall estimates for a test catchment located in morocco north africa and found that tmpa 3b42 v 7 estimates adequately reproduced monthly dynamics of discharge in the catchment despite their poor performance at a daily time scale in a study in the niger river casse et al 2015 analysed the potential of different srps to predict the niger river flood events in niamey they found that satellite only products suffer from considerable positive bias and show remarkable differences in the frequency distribution of the rainfall with respect to only gauge and the gauge adjusted rainfall satellite product 3b42v7 which determined poor results in flood simulations at niamey after bias correction the results significantly improved similar results were found by ciabatta et al 2016 in a study involving 4 catchments in italy who showed an increase of the performance of a simple hydrological model after bias correction of the tmpa 3b42rt rainfall estimates and the rainfall estimates derived from the inversion of the soil moisture observations derived from the advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 via sm2rain brocca et al 2014 in the latter study following the work of massari et al 2014 the authors also demonstrated that a simple integration of the srps with ground rainfall estimates enhanced flood simulations for 3 out 4 basins with respect to the situation where only ground rainfall ground data were used this provides a clue that the integration of different sources of rainfall ground and satellite can be highly beneficial for hydrological simulations moreover beck et al 2017a assessed the performance of a merged satellite only product using hydrological modeling for 1000 s of catchments and obtained reasonable performance in tropical catchments however whether the integration between only srps with non ground measurements can positively impact flood simulations has been to our knowledge never tested in the mediterranean area in this study near real

cci sm products sm2raincci ciabatta et al 2018 and 5 paired combinations of the above mentioned products were used to drive a lumped hydrologic model misdc modello idrologico semi distribuito in continuo brocca et al 2011 over 15 basins in the mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics the objective of this study is twofold 1 to test whether or not the integration of different near real time srps derived from different sources can lead to enhanced rainfall estimates that can maximize the utility of existing srps for hydrologic applications in ground data poor regions 2 to provide a robust analysis of the hydrological performance of the most used near real time srps in the mediterranean area in particular conversely to previous studies intended to evaluate the quality of the state of the art rainfall products both satellite and re analysis estimates see e g beck et al 2017a the aim of this work is to test the suitability of near real time satellite rainfall for possible near real time hydrological application the paper is organized as follows section 2 and 3 describe the study area and the dataset employed for the analysis respectively the methodology is described in section 4 in section 5 the results obtained over the study area for all the rainfall dataset are collected and thoroughly commented conclusions are listed in section 6 2 study area the study area comprises 15 catchments draining into the mediterranean sea fig 1 the mediterranean region is characterized by complex topography ranging from the alpine mountains the italian and balkan peninsulas northern spain and southern france containing about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 m to the great european plain most of which lies below 152 m in elevation due to the topographic complexity the climate is generally characterized by hot dry summers and humid cool winters with an intricate spatial temporal variability a clear contrast exists between the more rainy northern part of the study region southern europe and the drier southern area north africa iberian peninsula and between the western sides rainsides of the iberian italian and balkan peninsulas and their eastern sides rainshadows the mean annual precipitation averaged over the study area is p 593 203 mm year 1 but it has a strong spatial variability ranging from 20 mm year 1 north africa to 1500 mm year 1 alps a significant seasonal variability exists with the early winter and late autumn months november and december being the wettest with precipitation amounts larger than 60 mm month 1 hatzianastassiou et al 2016 table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the study catchments with area ranging from 100 km2 for rafina basin in greece to about 5000 km2 for the tiber river in italy mean basin elevation from 86 5 m a s l lowland basin to 1362 m a s l mountainous basin and topographic complexity index i e the normalized standard deviation of elevation within a dem grid cell derived from the gtopo30 global digital elevation model wagner et al 2013 varying from 4 8 algas at batea small topographic complexity to 32 3 brenta at berzizza high topographic complexity note that the topographic complexity of the mediterranean region ranges from zeros to 40 and a threshold value of 10 can be assumed to exactly discern between alpine mountainous or lowland areas therefore the selected catchments together form a representative sample of the different climatic and physiographic conditions of the mediterranean 3 datasets 3 1 ground based observations ground based observations include rainfall temperature and discharge data as ground based reference product for precipitation and mean temperature we used the european high resolution gridded data sets e obs haylock et al 2008 developed as part of the eu fp6 ensembles project the rainfall and temperature provided by e obs are available at daily time step for the period 1950 up to now given the relatively high density of the raingauges and thermometers used by this product it can be considered a reasonable reference for comparing the performance of each srp within the hydrological simulations discharge data interpolated at hourly time step are available for all the study catchments as described in table 1 only 4 out of 15 catchments have a limited observation period 4 years whereas for about half of the basins the length of discharge observations is greater than 8 years 3 2 satellite rainfall observation products four different rainfall datasets derived from satellite observations are used table 2 among the state of the art satellite precipitation products which exploit infrared ir and or passive microwave pmw observations to retrieve precipitation we used the near real time version of tmpa 3b42rt cmorph persiann satellite products tmpa 3b42rt provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http disc sci gsfc nasa gov is available from 1997 onward with 3 h temporal resolution and a spatial sampling of 0 25 for the 50 north south latitude band the retrieval algorithm takes advantages of multiple microwave sensors i e the trmm microwave imager tmi the precipitation radar pr the special sensor microwave imager ssm i the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e and the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b the tmpa 3b42rt estimates are obtained through a three step process 1 pmw estimates are calibrated with sensor specific versions of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof kummerow et al 1996 and combined 2 ir rainfall estimates are created using the pmw estimates for calibration and 3 pmw and ir estimates are then combined cmorph is available at different spatial and temporal resolutions here we used the raw version provided by the cpc ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov with a spatial sampling of 0 25 every 3 h the product is available from march 2000 onward on the 60 60 latitude and is obtained by using the same microwave sensors used for tmpa 3b42rt however unlike tmpa 3b42rt here the infrared data are used to propagate the rainfall estimates within the times between two successive microwave satellite overpasses persiann is provided by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs http chrsdata eng uci edu at the university of california irvine uci with a spatial sampling of 0 25 and a 3 hourly temporal resolution persiann product uses the artificial neural network technique to estimate rainfall rate from geostationary infrared data with rainfall is estimated by training the infrared data to the collocated microwave estimates when available hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 in addition to these classical srps we used the sm2raincci rainfall product ciabatta et al 2018 obtained by applying the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to the esa cci satellite soil moisture products in particular within the esa cci initiative http www esa soilmoisture cci org three different sm datasets are provided 1 the active obtained by merging only active sensors observations 2 the passive obtained by merging only passive sensors observations and 3 combined obtained by merging the active and passive datasets liu et al 2011 the datasets are available from 1978 until 2015 at 0 25 of spatial resolution on a daily basis detailed information regarding the esa cci sm products can be found in liu et al 2011 2012 wagner et al 2012 and in dorigo et al 2017 to obtain the sm2raincci rainfall product only the active and the passive esa cci satellite soil moisture products have been combined by a scheme developed by kim et al 2015 the product is characterized by the same temporal and spatial sampling of the esa cci products i e 0 25 degrees and on a daily basis major details about the sm2raincci rainfall performances can be found in ciabatta et al 2018 for sake of simplicity hereinafter the tmpa 3b42rt cmorph persiann and sm2raincci satellite based datasets are referred to as tmpa cmor pers and sm2rcci respectively in accordance with previous studies brocca et al 2014 tmpa cmor pers are classified as top down rainfall products distinguished by the bottom up sm2raincci 4 method in this paragraph the experimental design of the work is illustrated whereas the algorithms and the models applied for the purpose of hydrological validation of srps are described in details on 4 1 4 4 paragraphs at first in order to assess the quality of srps an intercomparison of rainfall datasets is carried out by using the daily rainfall e obs data as reference as several studies have shown that local adjustments of srps as well as specific rainfall runoff model calibration are necessary steps to produce reliable hydrological simulation harris et al 2007 immerzeel and droogers 2008 mccabe et al 2008 pan et al 2008 a bias correction approach is applied to srps prior to use them to force a specific calibrated hydrological model then the suitability of srps for flood modelling is investigated by running the misdc model for each of the considered forcing datasets section 3 as the shorter observation period has a sufficient duration 4 year see table 1 for each catchment discharge data are split exactly in two parts the first half period is used for calibration and the second one for validation first misdc is calibrated and validated for each catchment by using as input the mean areal e obs rainfall and temperature data having all the analyzed catchments a sub daily concentration time to guarantee meaningful hydrological simulations all runs have been carried out at three hourly time step i e the maximum temporal resolution of the srps for that for each day the total e obs rainfall amount is split over eight 3 hourly temporal intervals with constant rainfall rate after that the single bias corrected srps and the integrated ones see section 4 2 are used to drive misdc model in these runs the model parameter values are recalibrated separately for each srps six integrated products are considered in this study that can be divided in two main groups the first group includes integration between only classical top down srps i e tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers the second group considers integration between top down and bottom up srps i e tmpa sm2rcci cmor sm2rcci pers sm2rcci in particular having the sm2rcci rainfall product a daily temporal resolution it is here used only within the integration procedure and not used to simulate discharge time series moreover to allow the integration between the 3 hourly top down products and the daily sm2rcci product for each day the total sm2rcci rainfall amount is re distributed over eight 3 hourly temporal intervals according to the temporal pattern of the partner product 4 1 bias correction of satellite rainfall time series the quantile mapping qm approach is applied to bias correct the cumulative density function cdf of tmpa cmor pers and sm2rcci ciabatta et al 2016 according to e obs the choice of using qm approach is based on the results of thiemig et al 2013 who demonstrated that a more sophisticated qm bias correction method is able to provide better hydrological performance than simpler bias correction methods largely applied in hydrologic and climate impact studies this method match besides the mean and variance all the statistical moments of srps as the skewness and the tails of the cdf to the observed data camici et al 2014 for the srps for the calibration validation period cal val the method can be written as 1 srp qm k cal v a l f ob s k cal 1 f sr p k ca v a l srp k cal v a l where f ob s k cal 1 is the inverse cdf or quantile function of the observations for the day k f sr p k cal is the cdf of the raw srps both in the calibration period as concerns the quantile function f ob s k cal 1 different parametric or non parametric transformations can be adopted gudmundsson et al 2012 in this study a two order polynomial function is applied in which the parameters estimated in the calibration period are then adopted also to bias correct the srps in the validation period given the high presence of zero values in the precipitation signal the application of the qm method can lead to negative rainfall values wang and chen 2014 to overcome this issue qm is applied at daily time step i e by considering accumulated raw srps and e obs rainfall values at daily time step the daily bias corrected values are then re distributed to the eight 3 hourly temporal intervals according to their original temporal pattern although this expedient allows to limit significantly the problem of zeros rainfall values it does not guarantee missing residual negative values in the bias corrected srps thus these values were simply assumed equal to zero which results in a non perfect bias correction 4 2 integration of srps the integration of the single rainfall datasets is implemented by using the following scheme 2 sr p 1 t s r p 2 t s r p 1 t k sr p 2 t s r p 1 t where srp1 t srp2 t is the integrated rainfall product srp1 and srp2 are two single satellite based rainfall products selected among the bias corrected tmpa pers cmor and sm2rcci rainfall k is the gain parameter ranging between 0 05 and 0 95 in order to assure that an integrated product is always obtained from eq 2 in particular when k 0 05 almost only the srp1 is used for k 0 95 almost only srp2 in order to build the best integrated srp for flood simulation k is calibrated by maximizing the modified nash sutcliffe efficiency nse adapted for high flow conditions anse index hoffmann et al 2004 between observed and simulated discharge in the calibration period the same k value is then applied in the validation period to integrate the srps mentioned above 4 3 continuous hydrological model misdc misdc brocca et al 2011 is a one layer semi distributed model that entails two main components 1 a soil water balance model to simulate the soil moisture temporal pattern and 2 a semi distributed event based rainfall runoff model for flood simulation misdc couples a routing module with a single layer soil water balance model the soil water balance module computes the evapotranspiration the percolation the infiltration and the rainfall excess through the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method rates the discharge is estimated by routing the surface runoff the saturation excess and the subsurface runoff to the outlet section the model uses 8 parameters i e the maximum soil water capacity the pore size distribution index the saturated hydraulic conductivity the fraction of percolated water that generates baseflow the lag area relationship coefficient a correction parameter for the evapotranspiration the initial abstraction coefficient of the scs cn method and the coefficient of the relationship relating sm to the initial condition of the scs cn method the model is written in matlab language and is freely available at http hydrology irpi cnr it download area midsc code for model calibration a standard gradient based automatic optimization method the fmincon function in matlab bober 2013 was used misdc model has been successfully applied for flood simulation in many basins in italy brocca et al 2011 2013a massari et al 2015 masseroni et al 2017 and europe brocca et al 2013b and used within climate change impact studies camici et al 2014 4 4 performance metrics the assessment of the different sprs was made by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient r the bias and the root mean square error rmse between the daily e obs and the single integrated satellite rainfall data averaged over the area of each basin the suitability of the gauged based versus single integrated satellite based rainfall products for flood modelling is evaluated by computing anse index between the observed and simulated discharge both in the calibration and validation periods simulations providing anse values greater than 0 5 were reasonably assumed good in terms of reproducing observed high flow discharge time series additionally the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 which was found to be more robust than nse was considered here for assessing model performance for a wider range of flow conditions massari et al 2018 5 results section 5 1 describes the results about the assessment of the different sprs then the suitability of srps for hydrological modeling is investigated at first misdc is driven by e obs section 5 2 to simulate benchmark discharge time series that are compared with the ones obtained by the different srps section 5 3 and the integrated products section 5 4 5 1 rainfall assessment results about rainfall scores for the calibration validation periods are illustrated in fig 2 boxplot with thin thick lines refer to calibration validation periods respectively it can be noted that the performances of the single and integrated products are very similar with each other both in calibration and validation period all the considered products show daily correlation values on average equal to 0 6 both in calibration and validation periods and among the integrated products the tmpa sm2rcci and cmor sm2rcci show a slightly better agreement with observed data mean r 0 62 relatively larger differences are obtained in terms of rmse and bias for the single products with sm2rcci having the highest rmse and bias nevertheless in terms of rmse the first group of integrated products i e tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers perform worse than the second group i e the one containing sm2rcci with general lower values for both groups of the integrated products with respect to the parent products conversely the first group of integrated products outperforms the second one with respect to the bias likely due to the high bias of sm2rcci note that as mentioned in section 4 2 the bias correction procedure adopted during the calibration period is affected by the necessity to set negative rainfall values equal to zero thus the bias differences shown in fig 2 should not surprise r rmse and bias of the products do not show remarkable changes as a function of the basin area while some changes can be observed in terms of topographic complexity and mean basin elevation fig s1 as expected basins over flat areas perform better than mountainous basins 5 2 discharge simulation with e obs rainfall data we test the reliability of misdc by using e obs ground based rainfall fig 1 illustrates the related performances in terms of anse obtained for all the study catchments over the calibration period while table 3 reports the anse values both for calibration validation periods overall misdc model provides relatively good performances with anse values greater than 0 5 exceptions are represented by the rafina basin probably due to the low e obs raingauge density in the investigated period and by kolpa metlika and brenta mountainous catchments for which the snowmelt process not simulated by misdc may play an important role in the flood formation based on that we can reasonably state that the geomorphological characteristics of the basins have a negligible effect on the model performance while raingauge density and model structure errors might play an important role the results above are confirmed also in the validation period as summarized in table 3 indeed anse index shows only slight reductions for all the study catchments except for rafina algas and tiber basins where the performances significantly worsen this is likely due to the sensitivity of anse index in reproducing high flood events that could differ in magnitude between calibration and validation period in general the mean anse value in the validation period decreases on average of about 18 over the study area these outcomes demonstrating the suitability of e obs rainfall dataset for discharge simulation hence it will be hereinafter assumed as a baseline to compare the simulations that use srps 5 3 discharge simulation with single srps the performances in terms of anse and kge of the different rainfall products in reproducing the observed discharge data over the entire study area are illustrated in fig 3 a and b both in the calibration and validation periods anse values of each basin are detailed in table 3 from table 3 it can be noted that with respect to e obs satellite rainfall data perform worst both in calibration and validation periods mean anse value are equal to 0 33 0 15 0 18 for tmpa cmor pers respectively in the calibration period and to 0 18 0 07 0 04 respectively in the validation period among all the products tmpa works better both in calibration and validation periods even though as already highlighted for some basins unreliable simulation characterized by anse values lower than zero are obtained similar considerations can be drawn from the analysis of kge values fig 3b here e obs performs satisfactorily both in calibration mean kge 0 57 and validation 0 46 whereas srps significantly worse this is mainly due to the difficult in using srps for smaller basins e g kge values equal to 1 14 0 38 2 62 0 44 are obtained through tmpa in calibration for rafina voltoya algas and gapeau respectively whereas the performances increase for larger basins e g tmpa provides kge equal to 0 58 in calibration for tiber basin the relatively low performance in terms of kge can be partly explained by the choice of the cost function i e anse within the calibration step which favors a better reproduction of high flows but does not guarantee the same optimality in terms of medium flow and bias in general these outcomes prove that for using srps in hydrological modelling bias correction and model recalibration are not always sufficient to achieve satisfactory performances mainly in smaller basins which represent the main target for flood modelling in the mediterranean area 5 4 discharge simulation with integrated srps the parent srps are integrated according to group 1 tmpa cmor tmpa pers cmor pers and group 2 tmpa sm2rcci cmor sm2rcci pers sm2rcci and results are summarized for the entire study area in fig 3c and table 4 in terms of anse values and in fig 3d in terms of kge index the optimal k values used within the integration process are listed in table s1 for each basin although on average e obs dataset remain the best performing rainfall products the added value of the integrated products against single srps is noticeable for the group 1 as can be noted also looking at table s1 the performances of integrated products are closely linked to the ones of the parent rainfall datasets lower performances are found for cmor pers whereas the integrated products that consider tmpa show greater anse indexes in particular the best results are obtained by considering the integration between tmpa and cmor with mean anse values equal to 0 38 and 0 22 in calibration and validation respectively the performances significantly increase by considering the group 2 i e the integration with sm2rcci to which is generally associated a greater weight in the integration process table s1 indeed anse values are greater than zeros for all the study catchments and above all for tmpa sm2rcci they become closer to the ones obtained with the e obs rainfall data with mean anse values of 0 49 and 0 33 in calibration and validation periods respectively the performances drop when kge index is analyzed for all the integrated products except for the tmpa sm2rcci product this outcome is quite expected being the hydrological model calibrated to reproduce high flood events a more in depth analysis is carried out in order to investigate the advantages of using integrated srps also in relation with the topographic basin characteristics the scatterplots on the first column of fig 4 show the added value of satellite rainfall integration with respect to the use of single rainfall products for all the study catchments small benefits are gained from the integration of cmor with tmpa fig 4a due to the lower cmor performances the anse values obtained by considering tmpa alone are very similar to the ones obtained by considering the integrated product and anse values are aligned along the bisector line both for the calibration and validation period conversely the added value of sm2rcci is noticeable for almost all the basins anse values are spread above the bisector line both for tmpa sm2rcci fig 4c and cmor sm2rcci fig 4e these outcomes are very important as similarly to the study of beck et al 2017b emphasize the importance of merging different precipitation datasets and in particular they demonstrate the potential of the integration between top down and bottom up satellite precipitation products in particular it can be noted that tmpa works better than tmpa sm2rcci only for the smaller basins in the study area rafina and gapeau characterized by similar topographic complexity and mean basin elevation table 1 whereas the added value of the tmpa sm2rcci product is particular evident for algas brenta kolpa at metlika voltuno and lim basins by analysing these results in terms of the basins characteristics as listed in table 1 we did not observe any influence of either the basin area nor the topographic complexity or the mean elevation of the basin for instance the small and mountainous voltoya basin 2 in table 1 or the large lowland tiber river basin 15 in table 1 are opposite cases where it is proved that integrated satellite rainfall data can be useful tools for flood modelling similar conclusions can be drawn by inspecting the scatterplot of fig 4e for 9 out of 15 basins anse values obtained by considering the integrated product are doubled with respect to the ones obtained by considering cmor alone while no connections between basin characteristics and performances can be found these findings highlight that the basin characteristics exert a small influence on the hydrological performance and that the connection between the rainfall quality and the performance in hydrological modelling is not straightforward due the potential interactions between the model and the specific srp as also demonstrated by qi et al 2015 for instance products characterized by a low bias such as those of group 1 i e those obtained by integrating between the classical srps see fig 2 provide worse simulation results with respect to the ones of group 2 those integrated products using sm2rcci this raises the interesting issue whether bias and correlations and rmse are useful scores to indicate potentially good or worse hydrological performance and whether the basin characteristics can condition the choice of the specific rainfall source to use this topic that is beyond the scope of the paper will be further investigated in the future an additional analysis has been carried out to display the relative performance of the integrated srps with respect to e obs in flood simulation fig 4b d and f especially through tmpa sm2rcci product fig 4d in calibration validation period for 7 6 out 15 of the investigated basins anse indexes are equal or even higher than the ones obtained through e obs rainfall data this suggests that integrated srps can be potentially used in place of ground observed rainfall data for flood modelling over poorly gauged areas e g rafina and for lowland large basins i e volturno lim and tiber basins in the mediterranean area to clearly support this statement fig 5 shows observed and simulated discharge time series obtained by forcing misdc model through tmpa tmpa sm2rcci and e obs rainfall data for four basins representative of the topographic characteristics of the study area algas at batea brenta at berzizza kolpa at metlika and tiber at monte molino river basins for sake of visualization for each basin only short time windows on the validation period are displayed here we can see that tmpa product alone does not provide reasonable reproduction of the observed discharges for algas and kolpa but when the latter is integrated with sm2rcci we can obtain even better simulations than those obtained with e obs e g see tiber basin these results support those showed by ciabatta et al 2016 for four basins over italy i e better hydrological performances were obtained by forcing misdc model with integrated rainfall products instead of ground data 6 conclusions in this study real time satellite rainfall products are used for the hydrological modeling over 15 basins located in the mediterranean area with different physiographic conditions through misdc model the simulated discharge values are compared with the ones obtained by forcing the model with e obs gauge based rainfall data the main outcomes are 1 e obs is a robust rainfall dataset for hydrological modeling providing good anse values for almost all the analyzed basins both in calibration and in validation periods 2 the bias correction and the recalibration of the hydrological model applied to the state of the art satellite rainfall products are not always sufficient to obtain satisfactory hydrological simulations only the tmpa product for some basins shows reasonable performances whereas the worst hydrological simulations are obtained by using pers product 3 the integration between different satellite rainfall products although very simple provides better hydrological simulations in particular the highest anse values are obtained by the integration between the top down and the bottom up approaches even if the same is not observed at a rainfall level as the limitations of the two methods are compensated in the integrated product 4 for some basins the performances obtained by integrated rainfall products are even better than the ones obtained by using ground observed data this could be of paramount importance especially in developing countries or remote locations where conventional rain gauge data are sparse 5 the connection among the rainfall performances the basins characteristics and the hydrological model performance is not straightforward and makes difficult the identification of the best satellite rainfall product to use for flood modelling in this respect we encourage more studies trying to address this problematic 6 these results help to clarify some important aspects related to the use of satellite rainfall products for flood modeling in challenging areas as the mediterranean basins and remark the need of independent rainfall sources that coupled with existing ones may reduce their associated uncertainty in future studies a part of the research will be devoted to the exploration of more optimal integration schemes able to dynamically weighting the two parent products as a function of their relative error moreover on future work the analysis will be extended to a larger number of basins in order to analyse whether the hydrological performances of satellite rainfall are dependent on any of the basin

7188,sub daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon doc concentration production mobility and instream processes have the potential to create a subtle sub daily rhythm of doc variation in streams we used high frequency data covering the spring summer autumn period which included discharge specific conductivity ph groundwater levels temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel doc cycles in northern catchments we focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream 0 65 km2 before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream 3 2 km2 with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel doc cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14 00 h and temporally varying amplitude with a median of 0 61 mg l 1 results supported the hypothesis that diel doc cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes specifically the viscosity effect theory viscosity driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush doc from the peat to the stream the temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel doc cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature downstream the diel doc signal was weaker with around 4 fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon the lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on doc cycles in stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between doc sources and stream reduced the study highlighted that even in climates such as the scottish highlands where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent sub daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle keywords diel cycles water quality dissolved organic carbon riparian peatland hydrological connectivity high frequency sensors 1 introduction many headwater catchments in the upper latitudes of the northern hemisphere are dominated by peatlands peatlands store around one third of the carbon in the terrestrial biosphere and hence are a major source of dissolved organic carbon doc to rivers gorham 1991 holden 2005 this has important consequences from a global carbon cycling perspective where the degradation of doc to carbon dioxide co2 is an important flux of terrestrial greenhouse gas to the atmosphere moody et al 2013 furthermore increases in riverine doc as seen in many northern rivers freeman et al 2001 worrall and burt 2004 monteith et al 2007 can lead to significant downstream impacts on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and quality of drinking water tank et al 2010 ledesma et al 2012 in comparison to event and inter annual doc variability in headwater streams inamdar and mitchell 2006 dawson et al 2008 köhler et al 2008 much less is known about sub daily cycles in doc which are often concealed by precipitation inputs and flow variability kirchner et al 2004 an enhanced understanding of baseflow dynamics in catchments can provide crucial insights into the less obvious processes that sustain ecosystems and water resources consequently better predictions of how headwaters might respond to non stationary conditions are necessary nimick et al 2011 furthermore characterising the diel dynamics of doc may have important implications for the resolution of sampling as the timing of sampling relative to any diel cycles would need to be contextualised diel cycles of various hydrological processes i e streamflow and groundwater level and the role of evapotranspiration as an important driver of such variability has long been identified troxell 1935 dunford and fletcher 1947 bond et al 2002 gribovszki et al 2010 graham et al 2013 mutzner et al 2015 however given the inherent difficulties in traditional sampling frequencies for doc typically weekly it is only more recently that diel cycles in doc have been appreciated spencer et al 2007 schwab et al 2017 the relatively recent development of in situ sensors has improved our capacity to routinely monitor such finer temporal resolutions allowing more complete and representative insights into low flow dynamics pellerin et al 2011 instream doc concentration is primarily controlled by the interplay between 1 the transportation by the flow of water in the landscape dawson et al 2008 laudon et al 2013 2 production in soils kalbitz et al 2000 moore et al 2008 and 3 in situ biological and photodegradation processes parker et al 2010 benner and kaiser 2011 nimick et al 2011 cory et al 2014 temporal variability in the hydrology of a catchment in particular the nature and connectivity of dominant flow paths which transport doc to the stream is a first order control on the cycling of doc aitkenhead et al 1999 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 the rate of decomposition and leaching of soil organic carbon soc to produce doc is also important and depends on external environmental factors such as temperature and soil moisture kalbitz et al 2000 increased temperatures can increase the rate of doc production christ and david 1996 hence temperature is the main driver of seasonal doc variability raymond and saiers 2010 dawson et al 2011 once the doc has reached the stream it can be subject to bio and photo degradation by aquatic organisms and ultraviolet uv sunlight respectively sub daily variations in the rates and dominance of these three main sets of processes have the potential to create a subtle sub daily rhythm of doc variation in streams several studies investigating diel doc cycles in a variety of geographical settings have revealed contrasting patterns in terms of the timing amplitude and causation of the cycles for example schwab et al 2017 observed patterns in doc quantity and composition in a small forested catchment in luxembourg the maxima diel concentration occurred in the afternoon and was explained by hydrological processes more specifically they hypothesised that an increase in riparian water temperature during the day resulted in a decrease in viscosity and increase in hydraulic conductivity consequently the rate of terrestrial flow from the peat increased in the afternoon whereas fasching et al 2016 attributed cycles with predominantly peaks in the evening in a headwater stream in the austrian alps to instream biological processes more specifically doc production by benthic biofilms ceased during the evening as photosynthetically active radiation decreased the exchange between instream production during photosynthesis and instream consumption during respiration has been suggested as the main control in other studies nimick et al 2011 diel doc cycles have additionally been identified downstream in larger river systems spencer et al 2007 worrall et al 2015 worrall et al 2015 in the river dee in chester 1674 km2 attributed the cycles to instream photic processes but highlighted the influence of residence time and velocity of the river on the timing and amplitude of the peaks however diel studies in peat dominated headwater catchments where doc concentrations are particularly high seem to be lacking and to our knowledge have only been considered in detail in lake settings watras et al 2015 in this study we focus on diel doc cycles in a peatland dominated 1st order stream in ne scotland before investigating the propagation of the signals further downstream in a 2nd order stream which is characterised by a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel the overall aim was to characterise the diel doc dynamics in a wet low energy northern catchment and identify infer possible drivers we utilise a wealth of high frequency data which includes discharge specific conductivity ph groundwater levels temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving temporal dynamics of diel doc cycles and their spatial patterns our discussion is focused around the three main controls on doc concentration in streams and asks whether sub daily cycles in peatlands are caused by 1 subtle changes in hydrological processes 2 soil production processes or 3 in situ biological and photic processes previous studies on diel cycles are often focused on individual catchments for limited time periods here we present data covering the spring summer autumn period and at two different sites in order to gain a more complete seasonal insight into the underlying mechanisms controlling the subtle daily rhythm that ecosystems depend on 2 study site the bruntland burn bb catchment 3 2 km2 is in the scottish highlands and is a tributary of the river dee which discharges to the north sea at aberdeen fig 1 the bb has been the subject of numerous tracer hydrological birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff

et al 2017a situated at a northerly latitude 57 04 n 3 13 w on the temperate boreal transition the low energy bb catchment has annual mean air temperatures of around 6 c with daily means ranging between 1 c in winter to 12 c in summer it has high relative humidity 80 and mean annual evapotranspiration is 400 mm which mostly occurs during a relatively short summer period between may and september wang et al 2017a precipitation occurs throughout the year with no distinct dry wet season mean annual precipitation is around 1000 mm and falls primarily during low intensity events there is only a modest snow influence as 5 of annual precipitation falls as snow elevations in the bb range from 248 to 539 m a s l soil coverage on lower slopes is dominated by peats whilst steeper slopes have podzolic soils underlain by more freely draining minerogenic soils which facilitate groundwater gw recharge fig 1b wide valley bottoms as a result of past glaciation are dominated by histosols peats and peaty gleys which are highly water retentive and near saturation throughout the year tetzlaff et al 2014 these organic soils are underlain by saturated glacial till deposits which have a high water storage capacity a steady groundwater flux to riparian areas from upslope is delivered from drifts underlying the podzols ala aho et al 2017 vegetation cover in the riparian zones is dominated by sphagnum moss grass molinia caerulea and bog myrtle myrica gale evergreen heather shrubs calluna vulgaris and erica tetralix are dispersed throughout the catchment dominating on the steeper slopes trees mostly scots pine pinus sylvestris and birch betula pendula are sparsely distributed as natural forest on steeper hillslopes fig 1a additionally there is a small plantation near the outlet of the bb but overall forestry covers 15 of the catchment soulsby et al 2017 within the bb we focused on a 0 65 km2 headwater hw1 which is nested within the larger catchment fig 1a this headwater drains an extensive raised ombrotrophic riparian peat bog and has a higher percentage of peat soils 15 compared to 9 and of peat fringing the stream channel 81 compared to bb 53 the organic rich soils remain connected to the stream channel during low flows ensuring a constant supply of doc in drainage water tunaley et al 2017 the periphery of the bog receives gw from the adjacent hillslopes lessels et al 2016 gw contributions increase downstream towards the outlet of the bb blumstock et al 2015 and gw dilution during low flows combined with less connectivity to near stream

which are referenced accordingly and the reader is referred to these original papers for in depth descriptions of the methodology associated with the individual datasets hourly datasets were compiled for the main study period of march october 2015 the main period of overlap between hw1 and bb measurements winter data was excluded from the analysis after visual inspection revealed that the high frequency of rainfall events mask diel cycles and their dominant drivers the hw1 dataset includes hourly averaged doc data which was converted from in situ 15 min sonde exo2 multi sonde xylem inc ny

480 nm 40 nm necessary corrections were performed to account for temperature turbidity and inner filter effects based on the method described by downing et al 2012 subsequently the data was converted

samples collected at the outlet of both sites available for one week in july 2015 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer camspec 330b the absorbance was normalised by doc concentration which gave an indication of the degree of aromaticity of the organic matter data for both sites i e hw1 and bb included air temperature solar radiation gw levels and evapotranspiration et an automatic weather

wells measured the depth to water table blumstock et al 2016 this incorporated sites in the peat peaty gleys and podzols but after inspection of both the 2015 and 2014 data only those sites which showed diel cycles and did not have large data gaps over the main study period were included in the analysis plant transpiration data was included between july to october 2015 wang et al 2017a for

inputs from the ibutton sensors and the aws in the catchment by subtracting transpiration from et evaporation e estimates were also available 3 2 data processing data processing was carried out in r programming language r core team 2015 investigating diel signals is challenging in a climate such as the scottish highlands when sustained periods of no rainfall are rare fig 2 in order to isolate dry periods days with precipitation were removed from the dataset as were days subsequent to days when total precipitation 1 mm fig 2 after applying this criterion there were 36 days in hw1 and 28 days in the bb which remained for analysis of doc diel dynamics in order to minimise the influence of the frequent rainfall events which can result in long recessions and obscure sub daily variations normalized daily variation was determined for each dataset this was done by subtracting the moving median of a 24 h period from the measured values similar to the method by mutzner et al 2015 and graham et al 2013 fig 3 illustrates an example of this process for the hw1 doc data the same process was applied to all doc specific conductivity ph discharge water temperature air temperature and gw level data for the transpiration and solar radiation data it was not deemed necessary to de trend the data as this returned to zero every night for each dataset the median and inter quartile range iq of the time of maxima minima and amplitude over a 24 h period were calculated amplitude was defined as half the difference between the maxima and minima for further analysis we used spearman s rank correlation analysis and simple univariate analysis to initially identify potentially significant relationships between the amplitudes of diel cycles before applying multiple linear regression mlr we used amplitude rather than peak values in order to explore controls on sub daily timescales rather than seasonal timescales amplitudes of air temperature solar radiation gw levels and discharge were all explored as potential explanatory variables of the variance in amplitudes of doc specific conductivity ph and water temperature measured at the outlets as potential explanatory variables of the variance in discharge amplitude at the outlet air temperature solar radiation and gw level amplitudes were used day length the peak air temperature of each day and antecedent condition measures average discharge 7 days prior q7 average temperature 7 days prior t7 and sum of precipitation 7 days prior p7 were also examined as possible controls day length was calculated using the approach by worrall et al 2015 h 12 1 tan l tan 0 409 cos 0 0172 n where l latitude radians n day of the year with 21st december 1 non significant variables were excluded from the mlr models using manual stepwise backward regression the sharipo wilk test was used to identify any data that did not correspond to a normal distribution and data was subsequently log transformed if this was the case interaction between variables was tested in the models but no interaction terms were included as they did not significantly contribute to the explained variance following mlr we used the r package relaimpo to determine the relative importance of each predictor in explaining the variance of the final regression model gromping 2007 this method is based on proportional marginal variance decomposition and disintegrates the r2 into the percentage of variance explained by each significant variable 4 results 4 1 diel cycles in a peat dominated headwater catchment hw1 diel cycles in the variables measured at the outlet of hw1 were examined for the 36 precipitation free days of high frequency data the median values over these days for doc specific conductivity ph specific discharge and water temperature

peak time of 14 00 h iq range 12 00 16 00 h and minimum time of 5 00 h fig 4 a the amplitude of the oscillations varied between 0 13 mg l 1 and 1 75 mg l 1 with a median of 0 61 mg l 1 8 of the median concentration amplitudes in march and april varied within a range of 0 13 0 5 mg l 1 and increased as the summer progressed to a maximum of 1 75 mg l 1 on 17 june before decreasing to 0 8 mg l 1 in september diel cycles were also observed for specific conductivity with a minima in the afternoon median 15 00 h iq range 14 00 16 00 h and maxima between early evening and early morning fig 4b the median amplitude of the oscillations was very small 1 01 µs cm 1 2 of the median concentration iq range 0 7 1 3 µs cm 1 and the temporal variation in the amplitudes was similar to doc for ph consistent diel cycles were detected over the study period with a median peak time of 17 00 h iq range 16 00 17 00 h decreasing to a minimum time in the early morning median of 5 00 h iq range 3 00 07 00 h fig 4c the amplitude varied between 0 02 and 0 13 ph units and increased steadily between march and june before levelling off with a peak amplitude on 12 august diel discharge cycles were less discernible however there was an apparent maxima in the afternoon median 15 00 h iq range 12 00 17 00 h and minima in the morning median 7 00 h iq range 6 00 9 00 h fig 4d the median amplitude of the oscillations was 0 58 l s 1 km 2 equivalent to 10 of the median flow and the amplitude decreased as the season progressed finally there were distinct cycles in water temperature with maxima in the afternoon median 16 00 h iq range 16 00 18 00 h and minima in the early morning median 7 00 h iq range 6 00 07 00 h similar to ph the amplitude increased steadily throughout march and april peaking on 22 april before levelling off for the rest of the study period the amplitude of the oscillations varied between 0 78 c and 5 21 c with a median of 3 30 c fig 4e in addition other high frequency sub daily data of variables potentially controlling the cycles of doc specific conductivity ph discharge and water temperature measured at the hw1 outlet were captured solar radiation increased throughout the morning to a peak time of 12 00 iq range 11 00 13 00 h fig s1a the median peak in solar radiation was 565 52 w m 2 with the highest measured on 8 may 788 w m 2 whilst the lowest was on 17 april 275 78 w m 2 fig 5 shows a timeseries of the longest consecutive dry summer period during the study 9 june to 12 june air temperature lagged behind solar radiation fig 5b with a median peak time of 15 00 h iq range 13 00 16 00 h over the study period fig s1b the median amplitude of the cycle was double that of water temperature 6 93 c the median daily peak air temperature over the study period was 15 01 c scots pine and heather transpiration began around 6 00 7 00 h and had a median peak time of 13 00 h iq range 13 00 15 00 h iq range 12 00 13 00 h respectively s1c d scots pine had higher transpiration rates with median peaks over the dry days of 0 20 cm h 1 compared to the more damped heather cycle of 0 16 cm h 1 there were significant relationships p 0 001 between the peak in scots pine transpiration and peak air temperature r2 0 44 and solar radiation r2 0 27 relationships were weaker for heather transpiration with r2 of 0 3 and 0 11 for peak air temperature and solar radiation respectively it was apparent from the representative period in fig 5 that the water uptake from vegetation was not in phase with a corresponding decrease in discharge at the hw1 outlet however diel cycles in the peat groundwater level p4 s1e showed a peak in the morning median 7 00 h iq range 7 00 10 00 h before decreasing to a minimum in the evening median 19 00 h iq range 17 00 20 00 h less pronounced cycles in the peaty gley site pg4 s1f were also observed with maximum values slightly later median 9 00 h iq range 8 00 11 00 h the median amplitude of the oscillations was higher in the peat site median 0 37 cm range 0 04 0 94 cm compared to the peaty gley site median 0 20 cm range 0 04 0 46 cm guided by the results of correlation and simple univariate analysis mlr was performed to gain an understanding of the controls on the amplitudes of the diel cycles measured in the stream at the outlet of hw1 for all response variables a considerable proportion of the total variance in amplitude was explained by the explanatory variables included table 1 after non significant variables were excluded the final models for the amplitudes of doc specific conductivity ph discharge and water temperature are given in table 1 t7 explained the majority of the variance in the model 77 for doc whilst for specific conductivity the amplitude of gw level diel cycles in the peat explained the most variance 57 for ph the relative importance of the regressors in the mlr model was t7 50 daylength 19 solar radiation amplitude 17 and air temperature 13 the amplitude of discharge was explained most by air temperature amplitude 42 closely followed by t7 30 and q7 28 unsurprisingly air temperature and solar radiation were the two significant variables explaining the variance in water temperature amplitude r2 0 82 4 2 diel cycles downstream bb downstream at the outlet of the bb the median doc concentration over the dry days 28 days was substantially lower than hw1 3 5 mg l 1 compared to 8 0 mg l 1 for the same period march august 2015 the median suva 254 values from july 2015 were also lower 4 0 l mg 1 m 1 range 3 7 4 6 l mg 1 m 1 the diel cycles in doc were less distinctive with lower amplitudes varying between 0 06 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 and averaging 5 of the median concentration fig 6 a a further difference compared to hw1 was the timing with a minima in the afternoon median time of 17 00 h iq range 16 00 18 00 and maxima in the early hours of the morning median time of 7 00 h furthermore while the amplitude was increasing to its maximum in june for hw1 it had already peaked on 23 may in bb highlighting potentially different processes controlling the amplitudes of the cycles median baseflow discharge values were very similar in bb 5 11 l s 1 km 2 and hw1 5 47 l s 1 km 2 however the timing of the diel cycle median peak was 3 h earlier than hw1 at 12 00 h 10 00 13 00 h and the minima was in the evening around 21 00 h fig 6d the timings and shape of the cycle were similar to the gw cycles fig 5 the amplitudes of the oscillations were slightly lower than hw1 with a median of 0 25 l s 1 km 2 5 of the median flow and there was no obvious trend over the season data for specific conductivity ph and water temperature was based on the 69 dry days in 2014 as unfortunately these variables were not monitored in 2015 the median values for these days for specific conductivity ph and water temperature were 57 24 µs cm 1 7 17 and 11 42 c respectively in comparison to 2015 2014 had a slightly lower median peak air temperature 13 58 c compared to 15 01 c higher median baseflow 9 4 l s 1 km 2 compared to 5 0 l s 1 km 2 and lower solar radiation 478 85 w m 2 compared to 565 52 w m 2 similar to hw1 specific conductivity cycles were observed with a minima in the afternoon median time of 15 00 h iq range 14 00 17 00 h and maxima in the early morning with analogous low median amplitudes 0 69 µs cm 1 fig 6b bb ph showed diel peaks with the same amplitudes to hw1 0 07 but the timing of the peaks in bb was around 3 h earlier in the afternoon 14 00 iq range 13 00 16 00 fig 6c median water temperature was higher in bb despite lower air temperatures in 2014 compared to 2015 however the median and range of amplitudes of the diel cycles median 1 91 c iq range 1 26 2 78 c was lower than hw1 the timing of the maxima and minima were very similar to hw1 around 17 00 and 07 00 respectively fig 6e following the same procedure as in hw1 mlr was undertaken to investigate controls on the amplitude of doc in the bb table 2 results showed that solar radiation peak was the only significant variable and the overall variance explained by the model r2 0 51 was less than hw1 r2 0 67 for the specific conductivity amplitude the only significant variables were the amplitudes of gw level in the peat and peaty gley however the overall relationship was weak r2 0 28 compared to hw1 r2 0 68 similar to hw1 temperature was important in the ph mlr model r2 0 64 however for bb it was peak temperature rather than antecedent temperature which explained the majority of variance in them model 84 again as expected air temperature 51 and solar radiation 36 explained the majority of the variance in model r2 0 82 for water temperature finally for discharge the amplitude of air temperature 60 and gw level in the peaty gleys 40 were the only significant variables in mlr and the overall variance explained by the model r2 0 32 was less than hw1 r2 0 71 5 discussion 5 1 controls on diel cycles in a riparian peatland dominated catchment 5 1 1 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by hydrological processes the common interpretations for diel discharge and groundwater cycles are 1 an et induced signal bond et al 2002 gribovszki et al 2010 2 freeze thaw cycles lundquist and cayan 2002 3 viscosity control on discharge constantz and thomas 1996 schwab et al 2016 the hypothesis that the cycles measured in hw1 were caused by freeze thaw cycles which dominate snow influenced often alpine catchments lundquist and cayan 2002 mutzner et al 2015 can be rejected due to sampling occurring outwith snowfall and freezing conditions an et induced signal is typically characterised by an early morning maximum and afternoon minimum as plants uptake water during the day gribovszki et al 2010 this cycle was similar to the one captured from the gw well located in the riparian peat p4 and corresponded with the timings of the transpiration cycle for scots pine and heather diel cycles driven by transpiration would only be present where the gw level is shallow enough for root water uptake gribovszki et al 2010 over the study period the median depth to gw in the peat was 12 4 cm below the surface and root depths for heather and scots pine are estimated to be around 10 cm and 30 cm respectively therefore root uptake was possible wang et al 2017a b aubert and breuer 2016 suggested that transpiration in the riparian zone was responsible for the temporal variability in diel nitrate cycles and as summer progressed with vegetation water uptake increasing the diel cycle strengthened in our study an overall increase in gw level diel amplitude as the season advanced was evident stream discharge measured at the catchment outlet did not appear to exhibit et induced diel cycles a lack of relationship between the sapflow and discharge signal could be due to the rate at which water used by vegetation is transmitted to the stream is too slow to produce a diel signal bond et al 2002 alternatively the signal could be caused by other processes which are dominating and interfering with the diel et signal to cause a flow maxima in the afternoon another suggested process that has previously been presented for a forested catchment are temperature driven changes in water viscosity which consequently increases hydraulic conductivity schwab et al 2016 schwab et al 2016 calculated that diel fluctuation in air temperature of around 10 c leads to a 5 c fluctuation in water temperature in the soils of the riparian zone this consequently decreased viscosity by around 15 and increased hydraulic conductivity in the same range large air temperature fluctuations were observed with an overall median of 13 86 c and maximum 21 94 c during spring when the discharge cycles had the highest amplitude considering the timing of the flow cycles and that air temperature explained the majority of the variance in the diel flow amplitude we tentatively support the hypothesis by schwab et al 2016 that the increase in hydraulic conductivity in the afternoon leads to an increase in flow rate through the riparian area the strong diel cycles in air temperature were reflected in stream water temperature damped by around half and therefore it is possible that similar effects occurred due to soil water temperature testing this hypothesis was limited here due to the lack of soil water temperature data in contrast to schwab et al 2016 where the viscosity induced flow cycle was masked by the et induced cycle during the growing seasons the dominant afternoon peak throughout the monitoring period did not support a similar switch here this could be the result of the lower amplitude of et cycles in the more northern less forested catchment compared to schwab et al 2016 which reported mean et during the growing season of 3 2 mm d 1 compared to 2 mm d 1 for heather et and scots pine transpiration at our site wang et al 2017a there was however a general decrease in the amplitude of the flow cycles which could be due to an increase in the counteracting effect of the et induced cycle one concern regarding diel discharge is that the cycles are caused by temperature sensitivity of the probes resulting in erroneous water level measurements cuevas et al 2010 however the diver used to measure discharge in hw1 was compensated for temperature effects furthermore laboratory tests by schwab et al 2016 found fluctuations caused by temperature sensitivity to be four times smaller than observed fluctuations in the stream thus we recognise the fluctuations in the stream to be physical variations the question arises as to how the sub daily hydrological processes potentially drive the diel doc cycles and temporal variability of these cycles in hw1 we suggest two possibilities and discuss evidence for each our first hypothesis is that the cycles were caused by the et controls on gw level which in turn reduced gw contribution to the stream during the day this is based on knowledge of low gw doc concentrations 2 mg l 1 tunaley et al 2016 so a reduction in gw input would result in less dilution of doc evidence that suggested the et induced gw diel cycle caused sub daily variations in gw contribution to the stream was from the strong relationship between specific conductivity amplitude and gw level amplitude furthermore there were similarities in the timing of the minima between the two parameters specific conductivity has been used previously as a tool for distinguishing the contribution of different subsurface water sources carey and quinton 2005 evidence against this hypothesis was that the sub daily specific conductivity fluctuations were very small with a median of 2 µs cm 1 compared to the overall variation in specific conductivity in hw1 between march and october of between 36 61 and 80 56 µs cm 1 hence if the conductivity cycle did reflect a reduction in gw dilution this would be very small and unlikely to cause the relatively large amplitudes of the doc cycle our second hypothesis supported by the findings of schwab et al 2017 is that hw1 diel doc cycles were caused by viscosity driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon which also flushed doc from the peat to the stream the importance of the peatland riparian zone as a source of doc during low flows has been previously highlighted both in hw1 tunaley et al 2017 and studies in other northern catchments ledesma et al 2015 the higher diel amplitudes found here in comparison to fluctuations of around 0 2 mg l 1 reported by schwab et al 2017 highlight the role of peatlands in regulating high doc concentrations on a diel scales in addition to event and seasonal scales dawson et al 2011 olefeldt et al 2013 singh et al 2015 the timing of the observed cycles supports this hypothesis however there was no relationship between the amplitude of the discharge and doc diel cycles this could suggest that although it drives the diel cycle it does not regulate the amplitude of the cycles therefore implying other processes are involved in determining the strength of the doc cycles 5 1 2 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by soil production processes there is little evidence that sub daily variations in doc production within the riparian peat can alone account for the observed hw1 diel dynamics temperature has been shown to be a major factor in the rate of production of doc in soil solutions christ and david 1996 kalbitz et al 2000 birkel et al 2014 and temperature displayed strong diel cycles many longer term studies have attributed temperature as the primary explanation for seasonal variability in doc concentration in stream with more doc rich pore water available to flush in summer compared to winter raymond and saiers 2010 dawson et al 2011 furthermore the role of temperature has been highlighted in shorter term event studies for example raymond and saiers 2010 suggested that events with warmer antecedent temperatures resulted in larger doc peaks due to the rates of processes producing doc for subsequent flushing at short time scales being temperature sensitive however there have been no known studies which test the hypothesis that diel doc cycles are caused by short term temperature induced changes in doc production within the soil in this study the amplitude of air temperature did not have a significant relationship with the amplitude of the doc cycle suggesting that sub daily temperature controlled doc production was not the primary driver at the diel scale however antecedent temperature t7 explained the most variance in the temporal variability of the amplitude of the de trended diel doc cycle this suggests temperature controls the amplitude of the diel doc variation i e the variation through the season but does not drive the cycle itself the importance of antecedent temperature conditions in hw1 has previously been highlighted for event peaks tunaley et al 2017 found a strong correlation between antecedent temperature and peak doc ρ 0 9 p 0 001 on the diel scale higher antecedent temperatures could increase the availability of doc in pore water consequently more doc can be flushed during viscosity driven diel cycles thereby increasing the amplitude more research is required into understanding the short term temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and unravelling the complex range of both abiotic and biotic conditions that effect doc production as an initial experiment in situ soil temperature and sub daily doc measurements of pore water could provide further information experiments could also be applied in more forested catchments to investigate the potential of diel cycles from doc produced due to the decomposition and leaching of leaf litter 5 1 3 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by instream biological or photic processes we found limited evidence to suggest that sub daily doc variations in hw1 can be explained by instream processes once in the stream doc is exposed to different rates of degradation by microbial activity and uv sunlight benner and kaiser 2011 cory et al 2014 which ultimately drives the production of carbon dioxide marx et al 2017 the central thesis of studies which have argued that diel doc cycles are caused by biological processes is that during the day autotrophic organisms release autochthonous doc whilst at night respiration exceeds the rate of photosynthesis and there is increased heterotrophic microbial consumption of doc kaplan and bott 1982 parker et al 2010 fasching et al 2016 nimick et al 2011 the occurrence of biological processes in hw1 was supported by the timings of the diel ph cycles measured at the outlet as photosynthesis occurs during the day co2 decreases and in turn stream water acidity decreases resulting in a peak in ph in the afternoon spencer et al 2007 nimick et al 2011 the temporal variation in ph amplitude also supported this it steadily increased between march and june 2015 as photosynthesis increased due to warming temperatures and increasing solar radiation similar to that reported by nimick et al 2005 other studies found average diel doc variations around 0 22 mg l 1 in summer and maxima around 19 30 fasching et al 2016 similarly parker et al 2010 reported maxima around 17 00 both studies attributed the diel cycles to biological production during the day before photosynthetically active radiation decreased and heterotrophic consumption became dominant parker et al 2010 fasching et al 2016 the timing of doc maxima in hw1 was earlier 14 00 and the amplitudes of the diel cycles notably higher 0 61 mg l 1 than previous studies which have attributed the cycles to instream biological processes furthermore previous metabolism studies in northern catchments have provided opposing evidence of this cause of diel doc cycles in that they showed streams are consistently heterotrophic dawson et al 2004 worrall et al 2015 dick et al 2016 dick et al 2016 demonstrated that in hw1 and the bb net respiration consistently exceeded photosynthesis throughout the year hence both sites were sinks of organic matter schwab et al 2017 rejected the instream biological hypothesis based on diel doc absorbance data suva 254 indicating increased terrestrial doc input during the afternoon although we did not have diel measurements over prolonged dry periods median suva 254 values from july 2015 were typical of more recalcitrant humic aromatic doc release from peat soils allochthonous as opposed to low aromaticity doc produced from instream algal exudation autochthonous so degradradation would be difficult to detect inamdar et al 2011 saraceno et al 2009 this evidence leads us to conclude that instream biological processes are unlikely to be controlling the diel cycles in hw1 to further support this studies into the diel changes in doc composition within hw1 would be beneficial as well as an assessment of residence times in the channel network the additional instream process that may cause diel doc cycles is photodegradation whereby uv light breaks down doc into lower molecular weight organic compounds or causes complete oxidation to co2 porcal et al 2015 watras et al 2015 previous studies highlight the selectiveness of photic processes in that aromatic molecules such as humic substances are more susceptible to photodegradation compared to more aliphatic molecules benner and kaiser 2011 hutchins et al 2017 suva 254 values suggest that if instream processes are occurring then it is more likely photodegradation than biological processes providing residence times were long enough to provide sufficient exposure however the timing of the diel doc cycles with the maxima in the afternoon just after the solar radiation maxima and lack of relationship with amplitude of solar radiation do not support the hypothesis that photo degradation is the primary driver in hw1 5 2 upscaling of diel doc cycles additional measurements downstream of hw1 in bb allowed insight into the spatial variation in diel doc cycles at larger spatial scales although the streams were geographically close three fundamental differences in the diel doc cycles were identified the timing of cycle amplitude of the cycle and the variables plausibly explaining temporal variability in amplitude with regards to the timing a minima in the late afternoon as measured in bb was more consistent with studies where doc diel cycles have been attributed to photic processes watras et al 2015 for example worrall et al 2015 described the dominance of an early morning maxima due to the lack of photic removal during the hours of darkness the temporal variability of the amplitude of the cycle was only significantly correlated with solar radiation peak which supports this photic control on the cycles in bb furthermore the highest amplitudes occurred in may when solar radiation was highest and clear sky days are most common consistent with photodegradation studies in the arctic cory et al 2014 this increasing dominance of photodegradation downstream supports findings by hutchins et al 2017 which showed a decline in specific absorbance at larger scales and suggested this is due to doc becoming more exposed to light and humic doc being selectively photomineralised although ph specific conductivity and water temperature between the bb and hw1 outlet were not directly comparable due to the differences in years monitored the overall variations between median values were supported by differences in catchment characteristics for example the higher gw contribution in bb blumstock et al 2015 likely caused the higher median specific conductivity during low flows and the less acidic ph was likely due to the lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel overall diel cycles of these variables were similar between the sites indicating that the same processes controlling these cycles upstream were also driving downstream cycles discharge cycles in the bb resembled more the groundwater level dynamics in the peaty gley and this was one of the main factors explaining the variance in amplitude if evapotranspiration reduced groundwater inflow the earlier flow peak could be explained by the shorter linear connections between the wetlands and river channel in the bb in comparison to the more extensive channel pool network on the peatland another potential explanation previously highlighted for the differences between the doc timings at sites could be the travel time for the diel signal from hw1 to transfer downstream wondzell et al 2007 a preliminary calculation based on the average velocity during low flows and the distance between the monitoring points indicated a mean travel time of around 3 h which suggests this was unlikely to explain the average 19 h lag between the maxima at the two sites even though dispersion in the channel network will mean a long tail of travel times we therefore suggest that the disparity in the timings of the cycles is due to differences in the dominant processes driving the diel doc cycle this raises the question of why would the viscosity combined with soil temperature control diel cycles in hw1 whereas downstream photic degradation becomes dominant a possible explanation is that as we upscale and the percentage of riparian peatland decreases the connectivity between the doc rich surface sources in the landscape and the aquatic environment decreases tunaley et al 2017 fig 7 this reduction in connectivity combined with increased dilution of doc from gw precludes the more terrestrial hw1 diel signal and instead we see the domination of instream processes the much weaker signal around 4 fold lower amplitudes is likely the result of the mixing of counteracting upstream interactions 6 conclusion high frequency data from a nested wet low energy northern catchment revealed diel variability in a multitude of parameters including the focus of this paper doc capturing variation over a full spring summer autumn transition and two different sites allowed us to assess the spatio temporal drivers of doc and evaluate how the main controls of stream doc concentration production mobility and instream processes may interact to produce not only inter annual and seasonal variation but also sub daily variability results support the hypothesis that the relatively high amplitude diel doc cycles measured in a peatland dominated headwater were driven by increased hydrological inflow in the afternoon transporting doc rich pore water to the stream the amplitude of the cycles was controlled by the antecedent temperature upscaling to a larger catchment with a lower proportion of riparian peat appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes with in stream aquatic processes becoming more dominant as connectivity between doc sources and the stream reduced although these conclusions regarding the cause of the sub daily doc cycles are preliminary due to the complex interactions that can occur and the shortage of data to test these hypotheses the potential for future investigations into specific hypotheses has been highlighted the study has shown that even in climates such as the scottish highlands where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent sub daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur whilst the overall impact of doc fluxes from catchments may be relatively small unravelling the intricacy of these cycles is fundamental to fully

7188,sub daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon doc concentration production mobility and instream processes have the potential to create a subtle sub daily rhythm of doc variation in streams we used high frequency data covering the spring summer autumn period which included discharge specific conductivity ph groundwater levels temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel doc cycles in northern catchments we focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream 0 65 km2 before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream 3 2 km2 with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel doc cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14 00 h and temporally varying amplitude with a median of 0 61 mg l 1 results supported the hypothesis that diel doc cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes specifically the viscosity effect theory viscosity driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush doc from the peat to the stream the temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel doc cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature downstream the diel doc signal was weaker with around 4 fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon the lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on doc cycles in stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between doc sources and stream reduced the study highlighted that even in climates such as the scottish highlands where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent sub daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle keywords diel cycles water quality dissolved organic carbon riparian peatland hydrological connectivity high frequency sensors 1 introduction many headwater catchments in the upper latitudes of the northern hemisphere are dominated by peatlands peatlands store around one third of the carbon in the terrestrial biosphere and hence are a major source of dissolved organic carbon doc to rivers gorham 1991 holden 2005 this has important consequences from a global carbon cycling perspective where the degradation of doc to carbon dioxide co2 is an important flux of terrestrial greenhouse gas to the atmosphere moody et al 2013 furthermore increases in riverine doc as seen in many northern rivers freeman et al 2001 worrall and burt 2004 monteith et al 2007 can lead to significant downstream impacts on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and quality of drinking water tank et al 2010 ledesma et al 2012 in comparison to event and inter annual doc variability in headwater streams inamdar and mitchell 2006 dawson et al 2008 köhler et al 2008 much less is known about sub daily cycles in doc which are often concealed by precipitation inputs and flow variability kirchner et al 2004 an enhanced understanding of baseflow dynamics in catchments can provide crucial insights into the less obvious processes that sustain ecosystems and water resources consequently better predictions of how headwaters might respond to non stationary conditions are necessary nimick et al 2011 furthermore characterising the diel dynamics of doc may have important implications for the resolution of sampling as the timing of sampling relative to any diel cycles would need to be contextualised diel cycles of various hydrological processes i e streamflow and groundwater level and the role of evapotranspiration as an important driver of such variability has long been identified troxell 1935 dunford and fletcher 1947 bond et al 2002 gribovszki et al 2010 graham et al 2013 mutzner et al 2015 however given the inherent difficulties in traditional sampling frequencies for doc typically weekly it is only more recently that diel cycles in doc have been appreciated spencer et al 2007 schwab et al 2017 the relatively recent development of in situ sensors has improved our capacity to routinely monitor such finer temporal resolutions allowing more complete and representative insights into low flow dynamics pellerin et al 2011 instream doc concentration is primarily controlled by the interplay between 1 the transportation by the flow of water in the landscape dawson et al 2008 laudon et al 2013 2 production in soils kalbitz et al 2000 moore et al 2008 and 3 in situ biological and photodegradation processes parker et al 2010 benner and kaiser 2011 nimick et al 2011 cory et al 2014 temporal variability in the hydrology of a catchment in particular the nature and connectivity of dominant flow paths which transport doc to the stream is a first order control on the cycling of doc aitkenhead et al 1999 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 the rate of decomposition and leaching of soil organic carbon soc to produce doc is also important and depends on external environmental factors such as temperature and soil moisture kalbitz et al 2000 increased temperatures can increase the rate of doc production christ and david 1996 hence temperature is the main driver of seasonal doc variability raymond and saiers 2010 dawson et al 2011 once the doc has reached the stream it can be subject to bio and photo degradation by aquatic organisms and ultraviolet uv sunlight respectively sub daily variations in the rates and dominance of these three main sets of processes have the potential to create a subtle sub daily rhythm of doc variation in streams several studies investigating diel doc cycles in a variety of geographical settings have revealed contrasting patterns in terms of the timing amplitude and causation of the cycles for example schwab et al 2017 observed patterns in doc quantity and composition in a small forested catchment in luxembourg the maxima diel concentration occurred in the afternoon and was explained by hydrological processes more specifically they hypothesised that an increase in riparian water temperature during the day resulted in a decrease in viscosity and increase in hydraulic conductivity consequently the rate of terrestrial flow from the peat increased in the afternoon whereas fasching et al 2016 attributed cycles with predominantly peaks in the evening in a headwater stream in the austrian alps to instream biological processes more specifically doc production by benthic biofilms ceased during the evening as photosynthetically active radiation decreased the exchange between instream production during photosynthesis and instream consumption during respiration has been suggested as the main control in other studies nimick et al 2011 diel doc cycles have additionally been identified downstream in larger river systems spencer et al 2007 worrall et al 2015 worrall et al 2015 in the river dee in chester 1674 km2 attributed the cycles to instream photic processes but highlighted the influence of residence time and velocity of the river on the timing and amplitude of the peaks however diel studies in peat dominated headwater catchments where doc concentrations are particularly high seem to be lacking and to our knowledge have only been considered in detail in lake settings watras et al 2015 in this study we focus on diel doc cycles in a peatland dominated 1st order stream in ne scotland before investigating the propagation of the signals further downstream in a 2nd order stream which is characterised by a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel the overall aim was to characterise the diel doc dynamics in a wet low energy northern catchment and identify infer possible drivers we utilise a wealth of high frequency data which includes discharge specific conductivity ph groundwater levels temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving temporal dynamics of diel doc cycles and their spatial patterns our discussion is focused around the three main controls on doc concentration in streams and asks whether sub daily cycles in peatlands are caused by 1 subtle changes in hydrological processes 2 soil production processes or 3 in situ biological and photic processes previous studies on diel cycles are often focused on individual catchments for limited time periods here we present data covering the spring summer autumn period and at two different sites in order to gain a more complete seasonal insight into the underlying mechanisms controlling the subtle daily rhythm that ecosystems depend on 2 study site the bruntland burn bb catchment 3 2 km2 is in the scottish highlands and is a tributary of the river dee which discharges to the north sea at aberdeen fig 1 the bb has been the subject of numerous tracer hydrological birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 lessels et al 2016 biogeochemical birkel et al 2014 dick et al 2015 tunaley et al 2016 geophysical soulsby et al 2016 and ecohydrological studies tetzlaff et al 2007 soulsby et al 2017 wang et al 2017a situated at a northerly latitude 57 04 n 3 13 w on the temperate boreal transition the low energy bb catchment has annual mean air temperatures of around 6 c with daily means ranging between 1 c in winter to 12 c in summer it has high relative humidity 80 and mean annual evapotranspiration is 400 mm which mostly occurs during a relatively short summer period between may and september wang et al 2017a precipitation occurs throughout the year with no distinct dry wet season mean annual precipitation is around 1000 mm and falls primarily during low intensity events there is only a modest snow influence as 5 of annual precipitation falls as snow elevations in the bb range from 248 to 539 m a s l soil coverage on lower slopes is dominated by peats whilst steeper slopes have podzolic soils underlain by more freely draining minerogenic soils which facilitate groundwater gw recharge fig 1b wide valley bottoms as a result of past glaciation are dominated by histosols peats and peaty gleys which are highly water retentive and near saturation throughout the year tetzlaff et al 2014 these organic soils are underlain by saturated glacial till deposits which have a high water storage capacity a steady groundwater flux to riparian areas from upslope is delivered from drifts underlying the podzols ala aho et al 2017 vegetation cover in the riparian zones is dominated by sphagnum moss grass molinia caerulea and bog myrtle myrica gale evergreen heather shrubs calluna vulgaris and erica tetralix are dispersed throughout the catchment dominating on the steeper slopes trees mostly scots pine pinus sylvestris and birch betula pendula are sparsely distributed as natural forest on steeper hillslopes fig 1a additionally there is a small plantation near the outlet of the bb but overall forestry covers 15 of the catchment soulsby et al 2017 within the bb we focused on a 0 65 km2 headwater hw1 which is nested within the larger catchment fig 1a this headwater drains an extensive raised ombrotrophic riparian peat bog and has a higher percentage of peat soils 15 compared to 9 and of peat fringing the stream channel 81 compared to bb 53 the organic rich soils remain connected to the stream channel during low flows ensuring a constant supply of doc in drainage water tunaley et al 2017 the periphery of the bog receives gw from the adjacent hillslopes lessels et al 2016 gw contributions increase downstream towards the outlet of the bb blumstock et al 2015 and gw dilution during low flows combined with less connectivity to near stream peatland results in lower mean doc concentrations during base flow tunaley et al 2017 3 data and methods 3 1 data collection the study utilises measurements from previous investigations in hw1 and bb which are referenced accordingly and the reader is referred to these original papers for in depth descriptions of the methodology associated with the individual datasets hourly datasets were compiled for the main study period of march october 2015 the main period of overlap between hw1 and bb measurements winter data was excluded from the analysis after visual inspection revealed that the high frequency of rainfall events mask diel cycles and their dominant drivers the hw1 dataset includes hourly averaged doc data which was converted from in situ 15 min sonde exo2 multi sonde xylem inc ny usa measurements of the fluorescent component of doc fdom based at the outlet tunaley et al 2017 the probe measured the fraction of doc that absorbs light in the uv range of 365 nm 5nm and emits at 480 nm 40 nm necessary corrections were performed to account for temperature turbidity and inner filter effects based on the method described by downing et al 2012 subsequently the data was converted to doc using the strong relationship between in situ fdom and lab analysed doc r2 0 95 tunaley et al 2017 specific conductivity µs cm 1 ph and water temperature c were also measured by the sonde and included in the dataset downstream of hw1 at the outlet of the bb hourly doc measurements obtained from a trios optical sensor trios mess und datentechnik gmbh germany which measures the same fraction of doc as the probe in hw1 were also incorporated tunaley et al 2017 however the data available there was slightly shorter than the full study period march august 2015 specific conductivity µs cm 1 ph and water temperature c data were available but only for march october 2014 when the exo2 multi sonde was deployed at the bb outlet tunaley et al 2016 therefore 2014 data was included in the bb analysis for these parameters specific discharge was calculated using stage height measurements recorded in rated sections at the outlet of both sites uv absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 of grab water samples collected at the outlet of both sites available for one week in july 2015 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer camspec 330b the absorbance was normalised by doc concentration which gave an indication of the degree of aromaticity of the organic matter data for both sites i e hw1 and bb included air temperature solar radiation gw levels and evapotranspiration et an automatic weather station aws environmental limited north shields uk situated in an open area fig 1a was used for continuous measurements of air temperature along with a 0 2 mm tipping bucket gauge used to estimate precipitation solar radiation was measured at an aws around 1 km away from the catchment gw level data from odyssey capacitance loggers dataflow systems ltd christchuch new zealand placed in shallow wells measured the depth to water table blumstock et al 2016 this incorporated sites in the peat peaty gleys and podzols but after inspection of both the 2015 and 2014 data only those sites which showed diel cycles and did not have large data gaps over the main study period were included in the analysis plant transpiration data was included between july to october 2015 wang et al 2017a for this thermal dissipation sap flow probes tdp probes dynamax inc huston usa were installed on 10 scots pine trees and connected to cr1000 data loggers campbell scientific usa fig 1 transpiration was then estimated using sap flux density per unit sapwood area multiplied by the sapwood area index granier et al 1996 for heather shrubs ibutton sensors ds1923 model maxim integrated usa measured temperature and relative humidity rh above the canopy wang et al 2017b fig 1 a model based on the theory of maximum entropy production mep was applied to estimate total et and transpiration using inputs from the ibutton sensors and the aws in the catchment by subtracting transpiration from et evaporation e estimates were also available 3 2 data processing data processing was carried out in r programming language r core team 2015 investigating diel signals is challenging in a climate such as the scottish highlands when sustained periods of no rainfall are rare fig 2 in order to isolate dry periods days with precipitation were removed from the dataset as were days subsequent to days when total precipitation 1 mm fig 2 after applying this criterion there were 36 days in hw1 and 28 days in the bb which remained for analysis of doc diel dynamics in order to minimise the influence of the frequent rainfall events which can result in long recessions and obscure sub daily variations normalized daily variation was determined for each dataset this was done by subtracting the moving median of a 24 h period from the measured values similar to the method by mutzner et al 2015 and graham et al 2013 fig 3 illustrates an example of this process for the hw1 doc data the same process was applied to all doc specific conductivity ph discharge water temperature air temperature and gw level data for the transpiration and solar radiation data it was not deemed necessary to de trend the data as this returned to zero every night for each dataset the median and inter quartile range iq of the time of maxima minima and amplitude over a 24 h period were calculated amplitude was defined as half the difference between the maxima and minima for further analysis we used spearman s rank correlation analysis and simple univariate analysis to initially identify potentially significant relationships between the amplitudes of diel cycles before applying multiple linear regression mlr we used amplitude rather than peak values in order to explore controls on sub daily timescales rather than seasonal timescales amplitudes of air temperature solar radiation gw levels and discharge were all explored as potential explanatory variables of the variance in amplitudes of doc specific conductivity ph and water temperature measured at the outlets as potential explanatory variables of the variance in discharge amplitude at the outlet air temperature solar radiation and gw level amplitudes were used day length the peak air temperature of each day and antecedent condition measures average discharge 7 days prior q7 average temperature 7 days prior t7 and sum of precipitation 7 days prior p7 were also examined as possible controls day length was calculated using the approach by worrall et al 2015 h 12 1 tan l tan 0 409 cos 0 0172 n where l latitude radians n day of the year with 21st december 1 non significant variables were excluded from the mlr models using manual stepwise backward regression the sharipo wilk test was used to identify any data that did not correspond to a normal distribution and data was subsequently log transformed if this was the case interaction between variables was tested in the models but no interaction terms were included as they did not significantly contribute to the explained variance following mlr we used the r package relaimpo to determine the relative importance of each predictor in explaining the variance of the final regression model gromping 2007 this method is based on proportional marginal variance decomposition and disintegrates the r2 into the percentage of variance explained by each significant variable 4 results 4 1 diel cycles in a peat dominated headwater catchment hw1 diel cycles in the variables measured at the outlet of hw1 were examined for the 36 precipitation free days of high frequency data the median values over these days for doc specific conductivity ph specific discharge and water temperature were 8 5 mg l 1 49 2 µs cm 1 6 6 5 47 l s 1 km 2 and 10 3 c respectively median suva 254 measured during july 2015 was 4 5 l mg 1 m 1 range 3 9 4 9 l mg 1 m 1 doc cycles were observed with a median peak time of 14 00 h iq range 12 00 16 00 h and minimum time of 5 00 h fig 4 a the amplitude of the oscillations varied between 0 13 mg l 1 and 1 75 mg l 1 with a median of 0 61 mg l 1 8 of the median concentration amplitudes in march and april varied within a range of 0 13 0 5 mg l 1 and increased as the summer progressed to a maximum of 1 75 mg l 1 on 17 june before decreasing to 0 8 mg l 1 in september diel cycles were also observed for specific conductivity with a minima in the afternoon median 15 00 h iq range 14 00 16 00 h and maxima between early evening and early morning fig 4b the median amplitude of the oscillations was very small 1 01 µs cm 1 2 of the median concentration iq range 0 7 1 3 µs cm 1 and the temporal variation in the amplitudes was similar to doc for ph consistent diel cycles were detected over the study period with a median peak time of 17 00 h iq range 16 00 17 00 h decreasing to a minimum time in the early morning median of 5 00 h iq range 3 00 07 00 h fig 4c the amplitude varied between 0 02 and 0 13 ph units and increased steadily between march and june before levelling off with a peak amplitude on 12 august diel discharge cycles were less discernible however there was an apparent maxima in the afternoon median 15 00 h iq range 12 00 17 00 h and minima in the morning median 7 00 h iq range 6 00 9 00 h fig 4d the median amplitude of the oscillations was 0 58 l s 1 km 2 equivalent to 10 of the median flow and the amplitude decreased as the season progressed finally there were distinct cycles in water temperature with maxima in the afternoon median 16 00 h iq range 16 00 18 00 h and minima in the early morning median 7 00 h iq range 6 00 07 00 h similar to ph the amplitude increased steadily throughout march and april peaking on 22 april before levelling off for the rest of the study period the amplitude of the oscillations varied between 0 78 c and 5 21 c with a median of 3 30 c fig 4e in addition other high frequency sub daily data of variables potentially controlling the cycles of doc specific conductivity ph discharge and water temperature measured at the hw1 outlet were captured solar radiation increased throughout the morning to a peak time of 12 00 iq range 11 00 13 00 h fig s1a the median peak in solar radiation was 565 52 w m 2 with the highest measured on 8 may 788 w m 2 whilst the lowest was on 17 april 275 78 w m 2 fig 5 shows a timeseries of the longest consecutive dry summer period during the study 9 june to 12 june air temperature lagged behind solar radiation fig 5b with a median peak time of 15 00 h iq range 13 00 16 00 h over the study period fig s1b the median amplitude of the cycle was double that of water temperature 6 93 c the median daily peak air temperature over the study period was 15 01 c scots pine and heather transpiration began around 6 00 7 00 h and had a median peak time of 13 00 h iq range 13 00 15 00 h iq range 12 00 13 00 h respectively s1c d scots pine had higher transpiration rates with median peaks over the dry days of 0 20 cm h 1 compared to the more damped heather cycle of 0 16 cm h 1 there were significant relationships p 0 001 between the peak in scots pine transpiration and peak air temperature r2 0 44 and solar radiation r2 0 27 relationships were weaker for heather transpiration with r2 of 0 3 and 0 11 for peak air temperature and solar radiation respectively it was apparent from the representative period in fig 5 that the water uptake from vegetation was not in phase with a corresponding decrease in discharge at the hw1 outlet however diel cycles in the peat groundwater level p4 s1e showed a peak in the morning median 7 00 h iq range 7 00 10 00 h before decreasing to a minimum in the evening median 19 00 h iq range 17 00 20 00 h less pronounced cycles in the peaty gley site pg4 s1f were also observed with maximum values slightly later median 9 00 h iq range 8 00 11 00 h the median amplitude of the oscillations was higher in the peat site median 0 37 cm range 0 04 0 94 cm compared to the peaty gley site median 0 20 cm range 0 04 0 46 cm guided by the results of correlation and simple univariate analysis mlr was performed to gain an understanding of the controls on the amplitudes of the diel cycles measured in the stream at the outlet of hw1 for all response variables a considerable proportion of the total variance in amplitude was explained by the explanatory variables included table 1 after non significant variables were excluded the final models for the amplitudes of doc specific conductivity ph discharge and water temperature are given in table 1 t7 explained the majority of the variance in the model 77 for doc whilst for specific conductivity the amplitude of gw level diel cycles in the peat explained the most variance 57 for ph the relative importance of the regressors in the mlr model was t7 50 daylength 19 solar radiation amplitude 17 and air temperature 13 the amplitude of discharge was explained most by air temperature amplitude 42 closely followed by t7 30 and q7 28 unsurprisingly air temperature and solar radiation were the two significant variables explaining the variance in water temperature amplitude r2 0 82 4 2 diel cycles downstream bb downstream at the outlet of the bb the median doc concentration over the dry days 28 days was substantially lower than hw1 3 5 mg l 1 compared to 8 0 mg l 1 for the same period march august 2015 the median suva 254 values from july 2015 were also lower 4 0 l mg 1 m 1 range 3 7 4 6 l mg 1 m 1 the diel cycles in doc were less distinctive with lower amplitudes varying between 0 06 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 and averaging 5 of the median concentration fig 6 a a further difference compared to hw1 was the timing with a minima in the afternoon median time of 17 00 h iq range 16 00 18 00 and maxima in the early hours of the morning median time of 7 00 h furthermore while the amplitude was increasing to its maximum in june for hw1 it had already peaked on 23 may in bb highlighting potentially different processes controlling the amplitudes of the cycles median baseflow discharge values were very similar in bb 5 11 l s 1 km 2 and hw1 5 47 l s 1 km 2 however the timing of the diel cycle median peak was 3 h earlier than hw1 at 12 00 h 10 00 13 00 h and the minima was in the evening around 21 00 h fig 6d the timings and shape of the cycle were similar to the gw cycles fig 5 the amplitudes of the oscillations were slightly lower than hw1 with a median of 0 25 l s 1 km 2 5 of the median flow and there was no obvious trend over the season data for specific conductivity ph and water temperature was based on the 69 dry days in 2014 as unfortunately these variables were not monitored in 2015 the median values for these days for specific conductivity ph and water temperature were 57 24 µs cm 1 7 17 and 11 42 c respectively in comparison to 2015 2014 had a slightly lower median peak air temperature 13 58 c compared to 15 01 c higher median baseflow 9 4 l s 1 km 2 compared to 5 0 l s 1 km 2 and lower solar radiation 478 85 w m 2 compared to 565 52 w m 2 similar to hw1 specific conductivity cycles were observed with a minima in the afternoon median time of 15 00 h iq range 14 00 17 00 h and maxima in the early morning with analogous low median amplitudes 0 69 µs cm 1 fig 6b bb ph showed diel peaks with the same amplitudes to hw1 0 07 but the timing of the peaks in bb was around 3 h earlier in the afternoon 14 00 iq range 13 00 16 00 fig 6c median water temperature was higher in bb despite lower air temperatures in 2014 compared to 2015 however the median and range of amplitudes of the diel cycles median 1 91 c iq range 1 26 2 78 c was lower than hw1 the timing of the maxima and minima were very similar to hw1 around 17 00 and 07 00 respectively fig 6e following the same procedure as in hw1 mlr was undertaken to investigate controls on the amplitude of doc in the bb table 2 results showed that solar radiation peak was the only significant variable and the overall variance explained by the model r2 0 51 was less than hw1 r2 0 67 for the specific conductivity amplitude the only significant variables were the amplitudes of gw level in the peat and peaty gley however the overall relationship was weak r2 0 28 compared to hw1 r2 0 68 similar to hw1 temperature was important in the ph mlr model r2 0 64 however for bb it was peak temperature rather than antecedent temperature which explained the majority of variance in them model 84 again as expected air temperature 51 and solar radiation 36 explained the majority of the variance in model r2 0 82 for water temperature finally for discharge the amplitude of air temperature 60 and gw level in the peaty gleys 40 were the only significant variables in mlr and the overall variance explained by the model r2 0 32 was less than hw1 r2 0 71 5 discussion 5 1 controls on diel cycles in a riparian peatland dominated catchment 5 1 1 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by hydrological processes the common interpretations for diel discharge and groundwater cycles are 1 an et induced signal bond et al 2002 gribovszki et al 2010 2 freeze thaw cycles lundquist and cayan 2002 3 viscosity control on discharge constantz and thomas 1996 schwab et al 2016 the hypothesis that the cycles measured in hw1 were caused by freeze thaw cycles which dominate snow influenced often alpine catchments lundquist and cayan 2002 mutzner et al 2015 can be rejected due to sampling occurring outwith snowfall and freezing conditions an et induced signal is typically characterised by an early morning maximum and afternoon minimum as plants uptake water during the day gribovszki et al 2010 this cycle was similar to the one captured from the gw well located in the riparian peat p4 and corresponded with the timings of the transpiration cycle for scots pine and heather diel cycles driven by transpiration would only be present where the gw level is shallow enough for root water uptake gribovszki et al 2010 over the study period the median depth to gw in the peat was 12 4 cm below the surface and root depths for heather and scots pine are estimated to be around 10 cm and 30 cm respectively therefore root uptake was possible wang et al 2017a b aubert and breuer 2016 suggested that transpiration in the riparian zone was responsible for the temporal variability in diel nitrate cycles and as summer progressed with vegetation water uptake increasing the diel cycle strengthened in our study an overall increase in gw level diel amplitude as the season advanced was evident stream discharge measured at the catchment outlet did not appear to exhibit et induced diel cycles a lack of relationship between the sapflow and discharge signal could be due to the rate at which water used by vegetation is transmitted to the stream is too slow to produce a diel signal bond et al 2002 alternatively the signal could be caused by other processes which are dominating and interfering with the diel et signal to cause a flow maxima in the afternoon another suggested process that has previously been presented for a forested catchment are temperature driven changes in water viscosity which consequently increases hydraulic conductivity schwab et al 2016 schwab et al 2016 calculated that diel fluctuation in air temperature of around 10 c leads to a 5 c fluctuation in water temperature in the soils of the riparian zone this consequently decreased viscosity by around 15 and increased hydraulic conductivity in the same range large air temperature fluctuations were observed with an overall median of 13 86 c and maximum 21 94 c during spring when the discharge cycles had the highest amplitude considering the timing of the flow cycles and that air temperature explained the majority of the variance in the diel flow amplitude we tentatively support the hypothesis by schwab et al 2016 that the increase in hydraulic conductivity in the afternoon leads to an increase in flow rate through the riparian area the strong diel cycles in air temperature were reflected in stream water temperature damped by around half and therefore it is possible that similar effects occurred due to soil water temperature testing this hypothesis was limited here due to the lack of soil water temperature data in contrast to schwab et al 2016 where the viscosity induced flow cycle was masked by the et induced cycle during the growing seasons the dominant afternoon peak throughout the monitoring period did not support a similar switch here this could be the result of the lower amplitude of et cycles in the more northern less forested catchment compared to schwab et al 2016 which reported mean et during the growing season of 3 2 mm d 1 compared to 2 mm d 1 for heather et and scots pine transpiration at our site wang et al 2017a there was however a general decrease in the amplitude of the flow cycles which could be due to an increase in the counteracting effect of the et induced cycle one concern regarding diel discharge is that the cycles are caused by temperature sensitivity of the probes resulting in erroneous water level measurements cuevas et al 2010 however the diver used to measure discharge in hw1 was compensated for temperature effects furthermore laboratory tests by schwab et al 2016 found fluctuations caused by temperature sensitivity to be four times smaller than observed fluctuations in the stream thus we recognise the fluctuations in the stream to be physical variations the question arises as to how the sub daily hydrological processes potentially drive the diel doc cycles and temporal variability of these cycles in hw1 we suggest two possibilities and discuss evidence for each our first hypothesis is that the cycles were caused by the et controls on gw level which in turn reduced gw contribution to the stream during the day this is based on knowledge of low gw doc concentrations 2 mg l 1 tunaley et al 2016 so a reduction in gw input would result in less dilution of doc evidence that suggested the et induced gw diel cycle caused sub daily variations in gw contribution to the stream was from the strong relationship between specific conductivity amplitude and gw level amplitude furthermore there were similarities in the timing of the minima between the two parameters specific conductivity has been used previously as a tool for distinguishing the contribution of different subsurface water sources carey and quinton 2005 evidence against this hypothesis was that the sub daily specific conductivity fluctuations were very small with a median of 2 µs cm 1 compared to the overall variation in specific conductivity in hw1 between march and october of between 36 61 and 80 56 µs cm 1 hence if the conductivity cycle did reflect a reduction in gw dilution this would be very small and unlikely to cause the relatively large amplitudes of the doc cycle our second hypothesis supported by the findings of schwab et al 2017 is that hw1 diel doc cycles were caused by viscosity driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon which also flushed doc from the peat to the stream the importance of the peatland riparian zone as a source of doc during low flows has been previously highlighted both in hw1 tunaley et al 2017 and studies in other northern catchments ledesma et al 2015 the higher diel amplitudes found here in comparison to fluctuations of around 0 2 mg l 1 reported by schwab et al 2017 highlight the role of peatlands in regulating high doc concentrations on a diel scales in addition to event and seasonal scales dawson et al 2011 olefeldt et al 2013 singh et al 2015 the timing of the observed cycles supports this hypothesis however there was no relationship between the amplitude of the discharge and doc diel cycles this could suggest that although it drives the diel cycle it does not regulate the amplitude of the cycles therefore implying other processes are involved in determining the strength of the doc cycles 5 1 2 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by soil production processes there is little evidence that sub daily variations in doc production within the riparian peat can alone account for the observed hw1 diel dynamics temperature has been shown to be a major factor in the rate of production of doc in soil solutions christ and david 1996 kalbitz et al 2000 birkel et al 2014 and temperature displayed strong diel cycles many longer term studies have attributed temperature as the primary explanation for seasonal variability in doc concentration in stream with more doc rich pore water available to flush in summer compared to winter raymond and saiers 2010 dawson et al 2011 furthermore the role of temperature has been highlighted in shorter term event studies for example raymond and saiers 2010 suggested that events with warmer antecedent temperatures resulted in larger doc peaks due to the rates of processes producing doc for subsequent flushing at short time scales being temperature sensitive however there have been no known studies which test the hypothesis that diel doc cycles are caused by short term temperature induced changes in doc production within the soil in this study the amplitude of air temperature did not have a significant relationship with the amplitude of the doc cycle suggesting that sub daily temperature controlled doc production was not the primary driver at the diel scale however antecedent temperature t7 explained the most variance in the temporal variability of the amplitude of the de trended diel doc cycle this suggests temperature controls the amplitude of the diel doc variation i e the variation through the season but does not drive the cycle itself the importance of antecedent temperature conditions in hw1 has previously been highlighted for event peaks tunaley et al 2017 found a strong correlation between antecedent temperature and peak doc ρ 0 9 p 0 001 on the diel scale higher antecedent temperatures could increase the availability of doc in pore water consequently more doc can be flushed during viscosity driven diel cycles thereby increasing the amplitude more research is required into understanding the short term temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and unravelling the complex range of both abiotic and biotic conditions that effect doc production as an initial experiment in situ soil temperature and sub daily doc measurements of pore water could provide further information experiments could also be applied in more forested catchments to investigate the potential of diel cycles from doc produced due to the decomposition and leaching of leaf litter 5 1 3 are diel doc cycles and their temporal variation caused by instream biological or photic processes we found limited evidence to suggest that sub daily doc variations in hw1 can be explained by instream processes once in the stream doc is exposed to different rates of degradation by microbial activity and uv sunlight benner and kaiser 2011 cory et al 2014 which ultimately drives the production of carbon dioxide marx et al 2017 the central thesis of studies which have argued that diel doc cycles are caused by biological processes is that during the day autotrophic organisms release autochthonous doc whilst at night respiration exceeds the rate of photosynthesis and there is increased heterotrophic microbial consumption of doc kaplan and bott 1982 parker et al 2010 fasching et al 2016 nimick et al 2011 the occurrence of biological processes in hw1 was supported by the timings of the diel ph cycles measured at the outlet as photosynthesis occurs during the day co2 decreases and in turn stream water acidity decreases resulting in a peak in ph in the afternoon spencer et al 2007 nimick et al 2011 the temporal variation in ph amplitude also supported this it steadily increased between march and june 2015 as photosynthesis increased due to warming temperatures and increasing solar radiation similar to that reported by nimick et al 2005 other studies found average diel doc variations around 0 22 mg l 1 in summer and maxima around 19 30 fasching et al 2016 similarly parker et al 2010 reported maxima around 17 00 both studies attributed the diel cycles to biological production during the day before photosynthetically active radiation decreased and heterotrophic consumption became dominant parker et al 2010 fasching et al 2016 the timing of doc maxima in hw1 was earlier 14 00 and the amplitudes of the diel cycles notably higher 0 61 mg l 1 than previous studies which have attributed the cycles to instream biological processes furthermore previous metabolism studies in northern catchments have provided opposing evidence of this cause of diel doc cycles in that they showed streams are consistently heterotrophic dawson et al 2004 worrall et al 2015 dick et al 2016 dick et al 2016 demonstrated that in hw1 and the bb net respiration consistently exceeded photosynthesis throughout the year hence both sites were sinks of organic matter schwab et al 2017 rejected the instream biological hypothesis based on diel doc absorbance data suva 254 indicating increased terrestrial doc input during the afternoon although we did not have diel measurements over prolonged dry periods median suva 254 values from july 2015 were typical of more recalcitrant humic aromatic doc release from peat soils allochthonous as opposed to low aromaticity doc produced from instream algal exudation autochthonous so degradradation would be difficult to detect inamdar et al 2011 saraceno et al 2009 this evidence leads us to conclude that instream biological processes are unlikely to be controlling the diel cycles in hw1 to further support this studies into the diel changes in doc composition within hw1 would be beneficial as well as an assessment of residence times in the channel network the additional instream process that may cause diel doc cycles is photodegradation whereby uv light breaks down doc into lower molecular weight organic compounds or causes complete oxidation to co2 porcal et al 2015 watras et al 2015 previous studies highlight the selectiveness of photic processes in that aromatic molecules such as humic substances are more susceptible to photodegradation compared to more aliphatic molecules benner and kaiser 2011 hutchins et al 2017 suva 254 values suggest that if instream processes are occurring then it is more likely photodegradation than biological processes providing residence times were long enough to provide sufficient exposure however the timing of the diel doc cycles with the maxima in the afternoon just after the solar radiation maxima and lack of relationship with amplitude of solar radiation do not support the hypothesis that photo degradation is the primary driver in hw1 5 2 upscaling of diel doc cycles additional measurements downstream of hw1 in bb allowed insight into the spatial variation in diel doc cycles at larger spatial scales although the streams were geographically close three fundamental differences in the diel doc cycles were identified the timing of cycle amplitude of the cycle and the variables plausibly explaining temporal variability in amplitude with regards to the timing a minima in the late afternoon as measured in bb was more consistent with studies where doc diel cycles have been attributed to photic processes watras et al 2015 for example worrall et al 2015 described the dominance of an early morning maxima due to the lack of photic removal during the hours of darkness the temporal variability of the amplitude of the cycle was only significantly correlated with solar radiation peak which supports this photic control on the cycles in bb furthermore the highest amplitudes occurred in may when solar radiation was highest and clear sky days are most common consistent with photodegradation studies in the arctic cory et al 2014 this increasing dominance of photodegradation downstream supports findings by hutchins et al 2017 which showed a decline in specific absorbance at larger scales and suggested this is due to doc becoming more exposed to light and humic doc being selectively photomineralised although ph specific conductivity and water temperature between the bb and hw1 outlet were not directly comparable due to the differences in years monitored the overall variations between median values were supported by differences in catchment characteristics for example the higher gw contribution in bb blumstock et al 2015 likely caused the higher median specific conductivity during low flows and the less acidic ph was likely due to the lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel overall diel cycles of these variables were similar between the sites indicating that the same processes controlling these cycles upstream were also driving downstream cycles discharge cycles in the bb resembled more the groundwater level dynamics in the peaty gley and this was one of the main factors explaining the variance in amplitude if evapotranspiration reduced groundwater inflow the earlier flow peak could be explained by the shorter linear connections between the wetlands and river channel in the bb in comparison to the more extensive channel pool network on the peatland another potential explanation previously highlighted for the differences between the doc timings at sites could be the travel time for the diel signal from hw1 to transfer downstream wondzell et al 2007 a preliminary calculation based on the average velocity during low flows and the distance between the monitoring points indicated a mean travel time of around 3 h which suggests this was unlikely to explain the average 19 h lag between the maxima at the two sites even though dispersion in the channel network will mean a long tail of travel times we therefore suggest that the disparity in the timings of the cycles is due to differences in the dominant processes driving the diel doc cycle this raises the question of why would the viscosity combined with soil temperature control diel cycles in hw1 whereas downstream photic degradation becomes dominant a possible explanation is that as we upscale and the percentage of riparian peatland decreases the connectivity between the doc rich surface sources in the landscape and the aquatic environment decreases tunaley et al 2017 fig 7 this reduction in connectivity combined with increased dilution of doc from gw precludes the more terrestrial hw1 diel signal and instead we see the domination of instream processes the much weaker signal around 4 fold lower amplitudes is likely the result of the mixing of counteracting upstream interactions 6 conclusion high frequency data from a nested wet low energy northern catchment revealed diel variability in a multitude of parameters including the focus of this paper doc capturing variation over a full spring summer autumn transition and two different sites allowed us to assess the spatio temporal drivers of doc and evaluate how the main controls of stream doc concentration production mobility and instream processes may interact to produce not only inter annual and seasonal variation but also sub daily variability results support the hypothesis that the relatively high amplitude diel doc cycles measured in a peatland dominated headwater were driven by increased hydrological inflow in the afternoon transporting doc rich pore water to the stream the amplitude of the cycles was controlled by the antecedent temperature upscaling to a larger catchment with a lower proportion of riparian peat appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes with in stream aquatic processes becoming more dominant as connectivity between doc sources and the stream reduced although these conclusions regarding the cause of the sub daily doc cycles are preliminary due to the complex interactions that can occur and the shortage of data to test these hypotheses the potential for future investigations into specific hypotheses has been highlighted the study has shown that even in climates such as the scottish highlands where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent sub daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur whilst the overall impact of doc fluxes from catchments may be relatively small unravelling the intricacy of these cycles is fundamental to fully

7189,floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards worldwide and are occurring increasingly frequent in recent decades flood risk assessment is an important tool for flood prevention and involves significant practical applications in flood risk management and flood disaster reduction in the study an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating urban flood inundation model improved entropy weight method and k means cluster algorithm to evaluate urban flood risk the proposed approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thus provides a more reasonable and objective result a region in haikou china is adopted to test the applicability of the proposed approach seven evaluation indices are selected by coupling the natural hazard index system and hydrological models the index weights are calculated by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process ahp method subsequently the k means cluster algorithm is used to develop the flood risk map in the study area the results indicate that high risk zones cover 13 7 of total area which generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations the assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events the traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis methods are used for comparison with the improved entropy cluster algorithm so as to validate the proposed approach for risk management the result demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result the study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information

cluster algorithm improved entropy weight 1 introduction floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring hazards worldwide lian et al 2013 hallegatte et al 2013 lian et al 2017 with climate changes and the rapid development of urbanization the flood risk will increase in the future wilby et al 2008 woodruff et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 based on the statistics released by the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters most cities in china such as beijing and shanghai suffered serious urban flooding in recent years and urban floods are an important obstacle to urban development in china as an important tool for flood prevention flood risk assessment exhibits significant practical applications in flood risk management and can lead to improvements in public awareness of flood risk flood risk assessment performs a comprehensive evaluation of natural and social attributes of floods with the aim of improving the accuracy of grasping the spatial distribution of flood risk traditionally three primary types of approaches are used for flood risk assessment yin et al 2015 and include the historical disaster mathematical statistics method hdms nott 2006 adikari et al 2010 multi criteria analysis mca lai et al 2016 guo et al 2014 and scenario simulation analysis ssa willems 2013 zhu et al 2016 although these methods are acceptable for analyzing flood risk they include a few disadvantages for example hdms requires high amounts of data and does not accurately reflect the spatial variability of flood risk additionally mca generally does not consider inundation characteristics e g inundation depth and velocity and ssa does not consider the impact of a hazard bearing body and hazard inducing environment on the flood risk in the study we coupled an evaluation index system of mca with hydrological models of ssa to develop a multi index system for flood risk assessment furthermore the determination of a suitable classification standard of different risk levels is a significant step in these applications but common methods to classify flood risks are currently absent ji et al 2013 the cluster algorithm is a data mining technology that is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thereby provides a more objective and reasonable result it is been already applied in landslide hazard assessment gorsevski et al 2003 water pollution risk evaluation li et al 2016 and aquifer vulnerability assessment javadi et al 2017 therefore the cluster algorithm is applied to flood risk assessment to overcome the difficulty in determining the risk classification threshold in traditional flood risk analysis different indices exhibit different contributions to the evaluation objective and thus the weight of each index should be determined prior to the cluster analysis common methods to determine index weights include analytic hierarchy process ahp and entropy method em both ahp and em exhibit limitations for example ahp exhibits high subjectivity since it is significantly affected by expert experience and knowledge zhao et al 2017 the em does not consider differences among indices and it relies excessively on the objective data that cannot reflect the practical experience of experts ma et al 2012 therefore an improved entropy weight method with the advantages of both ahp and em is used to solve the above problems within the study an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method to evaluate urban flood risk in order to verify the proposed approach the traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method that is commonly used in flood risk assessment lee et al 2014 radmehr and araghinejad 2015 najafabadi et al 2016 are also used in the risk assessment for comparison the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods section 3 describes the flood risk assessment based on improved entropy cluster algorithm approach in section 4 other methods are compared with the proposed approach and this is followed by a discussion on advantages and deficiencies of the proposed approach additionally appropriate measures are proposed and considered in the analysis to mitigate the risk based on the spatial distribution of flood risk the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area haidian island is located in the northern part of haikou in hainan province china and is adjacent to the qiongzhou strait fig 1 it is vulnerable to the joint impact of rainfall and tide level due to its special geographical location and flat terrain the drainage system of the study area is mainly composed of pipe networks and urban rivers when heavy rainfall occurs the flood first generally flows into pipe networks and subsequently flows into the qiongzhou strait through urban rivers heavy rainfall and high storm tides caused by typhoons often result in severe flood damage to haidian island for example typhoon rammasun with a maximum wind speed of 60 m s attacked haikou from july 17 to july 19 2014 and resulted in heavy daily rainfall 509 2 mm and high storm tide 3 83 m on july 18 this caused deaths of eight people and losses that were worth nearly nine billion yuan 1 43 billion dollar 2 2 data the data of the proposed method includes three parts the first part corresponds to the basic data of the urban flood inundation model that includes digital elevation model dem river data drainage data and rainfall data the second part includes the observations of historical storm events that are used to calibrate the urban flood inundation model the third part involves the flood risk assessment index including the dem slope sl distance to the river dr length of drainage conduits ldc building area ba maximum inundation depth md and maximum inundation velocity mve the above data are described in detail as follows digital elevation model dem m dem reflects the topographical condition of the study area that was used as the basic data for the urban flood inundation model and was one of flood risk indices it was accessed from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx river data and drainage data this corresponds to the basic data of the urban flood inundation model river data includes river cross sections and the distance between cross sections drainage data includes the locations of junctions and conduits junction depth and conduit size they were provided by haikou municipal water authority rainfall data this refers to hourly rainfall data and is the input data of the urban flood inundation model it was obtained from the china meteorological administration meteorological data center http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode a 0012 0001 html observations of

to the river dr m this index refers to the distance between each grid and the river wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 areas near the river may be prone to flooding due to dyke overtopping or breaching and areas far away from rivers are safe this step was completed by using euclidean distance in the gis length of drainage conduits ldc m this index reflects the drainage condition of the study area this was obtained from drainage data by the gis building area ba m2 this index is the building area of each grid in the study area it was extracted from the satellite remote sensing image through the environment for visualizing images envi software the satellite remote sensing image was provided by haikou municipal water authority maximum inundation depth md m and maximum inundation velocity mve m s md and mve reflect the degree of the flood hazard they were obtained from the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm 2 3 overall framework of the study approach the overall framework of the study approach is shown in fig 2 the approach used for the study involves two main components an approach of integrating k means cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method was used to develop the flood risk map in order to verify the proposed approach as applied to flood risk the traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared to the improved entropy cluster algorithm historical flood disaster data and deviation degree dj between risk levels were also used to estimate the effects of the proposed approach 2 4 flood risk assessment based on improved entropy cluster algorithm the cluster algorithm is a data mining technology that can group the data into different clusters sharma 1996 it can provide a more reasonable approach to flood risk analysis considering that it creates risk maps based on the attributes of input data but it does not require the determination of the classification standard for different risk levels the traditional cluster algorithm does not consider the different degrees of importance of each index however the different indices exhibit different contributions to the evaluation objective and thus the weight of each index should be determined in the study we propose an approach that integrates the cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight methods to evaluate the flood risk detailed steps of the proposed approach are described as follows fig 3 2 4 1 step 1 selection of the indices the selection of evaluation indices should be representative and comprehensive at least with respect to reducing the complexity wang et al 2011 after considering the actual conditions of flood risk in the study area and reviewing the recommendations in many literatures zou et al 2013 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the primary flood risk assessment index system is established in the study by following the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal the selected flood risk assessment indices include dem sl dr ldc ba md and mve they are described in detail in section 2 2 2 4 2 step 2 quantification of the indices the seven indices are transformed into grid layers by using the raster calculation in gis with the scale of the raster set to 25 m 25 m since the resolution of the dem and pcswmm model is 25 m and the study area is divided into 21 188 grids the md and mve are obtained from urban flood inundation model that is established by pcswmm the pcswmm that combines swmm 5 and gis can provide a complete package for 1d and 2d analysis for storm water modeling in urban and rural areas tillinghast et al 2012 ahiablame and shakya 2016 akhter and hewa 2016 the continuity and momentum equations used in pcswmm are expressed as follows 1 a t q l 0 2 q t q 2 a l g a h l g a s f g a h l 0 where a denotes the cross section area m2 l denotes the distance along the conduit m q denotes the flow rate m3 s t denotes time s sf denotes the friction slope g denotes the gravity acceleration m s2 h denotes the pressure head m and hl denotes the local energy loss of per unit length conduit m the horton model is used to calculate infiltration the equation of the horton model is described as follows rossman and huber 2016 3 f p f f 0 f e k d t s where fp denotes the infiltration capacity into soil mm s f denotes the minimum or equilibrium value of fp at ts mm s f0 denotes the maximum or initial value of fp at ts 0 mm s ts denotes the time from beginning of storm s and kd denotes the decay coefficient s 1 the dynamic wave method akbari and barati 2012 barati et al 2012 2013 is used to calculate the hydraulic simulation of the drainage conduit in contrast to swmm that can only simulate 1d conduit flow and river flow pcswmm can accurately simulate unsteady 2d surface flow above ground through 2d floodplain model the 1d conduit model and 2d floodplain model are integrated by the orifice connection method chi 2014 in this study we use one of the most critical observed events for defined hydraulics variables i e md and mve to investigate the flood risk distribution in the most unfavorable scenarios which can help us to grasp the upper limit of flood damages additionally it is also feasible to define hydraulic variables by using design events zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a b the results of design events can provide detailed design basis for drainage engineering therefore researchers can select the most unfavorable scenarios or design events to define hydraulic variables according to different purposes 2 4 3 step 3 calculation of the weights for the indices entropy is a measure of the information disorder degree of a specific system and could fully exploit the information contained in original data shannon 1948 entropy weight can indicate useful information provided by the index although it excessively relies on the objective data that cannot reflect the knowledge and practical experience of experts such that the results are occasionally inconsistent with reality and individual understanding the ahp method is proven to determine weights comprehensively by considering the subjective attributes of the data therefore an improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method is presented to determine the index weights the main steps of the improved entropy weight method are summarized as follows 1 the sample evaluation matrix of m objects and n indices is x x ij m n 4 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn 2 the sample matrix x is converted into the normalized matrix y as follows a normalized matrix for positive indices 5 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij b normalized matrix for negative indices 6 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij 3 the entropy ej of the jth index is defined as follows 7 e j i 1 m p ij ln p ij ln m where p ij ln p ij is set as zero if p ij is equal to zero and 8 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 4 the deviation degree dj of the jth index is calculated as follows 9 d j 1 e j the large value of dj leads to larger variation in the jth index thus it indicates the effect of the jth index is bigger 5 we calculate the subjective weight ω j by using ahp method for taking the subjective attributes of the data into consideration the detailed steps of ahp method are listed in jenifer and jha 2017 6 we calculate the final weight ω j as follows 10 ω j ω j d j j 1 n ω j d j where ω j denotes the subjective weight determined by ahp method 2 4 4 step 4 determining optimal cluster numbers in the study the k means cluster method is adopted as the most widely used clustering algorithm due to its easy implementation simplicity and efficiency in application han and kamber 2006 a difficulty in using the k means cluster algorithm is that the optimal number of clusters must be determined in advance weatherill and burton 2008 this is achieved by using the silhouette function rosseeuw 1987 nakamura et al 2008 gaitani et al 2010 that can represent the cohesive degree of cluster within samples and separated degree of each clusters it is defined as follows 11 s i min b i a i max a i min b i i 1 2 n where ai denotes the mean distance from the ith point to other points within the cluster and bi denotes the mean distance from the ith point to the points in other clusters the optimal number of clusters is generally determined when the si simultaneously exhibits the maximal mean and the minimal number of negative values 2 4 5 step 5 k means cluster analysis the k means cluster algorithm is a clustering technique that attempts to determine k nonoverlapping clusters with the goal of maximizing the between cluster variance and minimizing the within cluster variance fernandez et al 2016 alizadeh et al 2017 the main steps of k means cluster algorithm are summarized as follows zagouras et al 2013 1 randomly initialize the cluster center c 1 c 2 c k 2 calculate the euclidean distance d ji between each point q j and each of the i th cluster center as follows 12 d ji q j c i 2 1 j n and 1 i k where n denotes the number of data points k is the number of cluster centers q j denotes the j th data point and c i denotes the i th cluster center 3 move each point q j to its nearest cluster center 4 update centers of clusters from which data points have been disjointed or reassigned 5 compute the objective function j if j converges then the cluster centers do not change from the previous iteration and the algorithm yields the final cluster centers else steps 2 to 5 are repeated until the objective function j converges 13 j i 1 k j 1 n q j c i 2 1 j n and 1 i k 2 4 6 step 6 determining flood risk levels the number of flood risk level is determined based on the cluster numbers for example if the data are divided into five classes the corresponding flood risk is expressed as the highest higher medium lower and the lowest risk the flood risk level of each cluster is determined by the average values of indices of each cluster for example if the average maximum inundation depth and velocity of the cluster 1 are the highest and the elevation is the lowest subsequently the cluster 1 is defined as the highest risk level the spatial distribution of the flood risk is developed by using gis techniques 3 results 3 1 quantification of the indices based on the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal indices of dem sl dr ldc ba md and mve were selected for the flood risk assessment the seven indices were transformed into grid layers by gis wherein the scale of the raster was set to 25 m 25 m since the resolution of the dem and pcswmm model was 25 m and the study area was divided into 21 188 grids as shown in fig 4 the index values of each grid were obtained by spatial analysis in gis the sl was calculated from dem by using gis techniques the ba was extracted from the satellite remote sensing image through the envi software the md and mve were obtained from pcswmm model the parameters of the pcswmm model were calibrated by trial and error and the ranges recommended in relevant studies rossman 2010 zhang and li 2015 tobio et al 2015 inundation depths in different observation points during the heaviest recorded rainfall were used to calibrate the model which was similar to yin et al 2016 yang et al 2018a and yang et al 2018b the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 was used for measuring the goodness of fit between observations and simulations and was used to assess the accuracy of pcswmm in the study calibration data was based on actual flood damage data during the rammasun typhoon on july 2014 and was obtained through field investigation the simulated inundation depth of the model is consistent with the observed value shown in table 1 the locations of observation points are shown in fig 1 the error values between observations and simulations are lower than 0 1 m and the value of nse is 0 725 yang et al 2013 and farida et al 2012 proposed that the simulations are considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 therefore the model is feasible and can be applied to simulate given flooding scenarios 3 2 calculation of the weights for the indices based on improved entropy weight method based on section 2 4 3 the index weights were calculated by improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method first the entropy weight method was used to determine the objective weight based on the variability degree within the index table 2 subsequently the ahp method was applied to determine the relative degree of importance between indices we invited ten experts in the field of urban flooding and asked them to rank the significance of the indices md mve dem ba dr ldc and sl for flood risk subsequently the judgment matrix of indices was determined by the significance of the indices for flood risk based on expert knowledge and experience table 3 with a consistency ratio cr 0 025 0 1 thereby indicating that the judgment matrix is reasonable table 2 demonstrates the inconsistency between entropy weights and ahp weights for example dem is an important index for flood risk estimation in ahp method although its weight is relatively low in the entropy method due to the flat terrain in the study area and the small variation of the elevation therefore it is unreasonable to determine weights only by using subjective methods or objective methods in the study we adopted an improved entropy weight method of integrating the entropy weight method and ahp method the final index weights determined by improved entropy weight method are listed in table 2 3 3 optimal number of clusters the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette function the cluster number k and corresponding silhouette values are shown in fig 5 cluster analysis was sequentially performed beginning with two clusters and ending with eight clusters when the cluster number k 5 the si simultaneously exhibits the maximum mean and the minimal number of negative values therefore the optimal number of five clusters was used in the study the corresponding risk level was classified into the highest risk higher risk medium risk lower risk and the lowest risk 3 4 distribution characteristics of flood risk following the above calculation the spatial distribution map of flood risk was generated as shown in fig 6 fig 6 demonstrates that the highest flood risk areas mainly lie in the following three areas the intersection of yawei river and baisha river the intersection of the people road and haidian fifth west road and the right of diankun road see fig 1 the higher risk areas are mainly located in the people road haidian second east road and the east of haidian fifth west road the highest and higher risk areas cover 13 7 of the total area table 4 the medium risk areas are mostly located in the south of the study area and the area near haidian fifth west road the lower and lowest risk zones are concentrated in the north of haidian island that covers approximately 66 of the total area essentially the high risk zones are concentrated in the center of the study area and the flood risk in the north area is lower than that in the south area in order to evaluate the accuracy of flood risk the above flood risk was compared with the actual flood damage data during the rammasun typhoon in july 2014 that was obtained through field investigation the highest and higher risk zones of the study can better overlap the regions seriously affected by the rammasun typhoon and this proved the feasibility of the proposed approach and rationality of the assessment results further analysis of the causes of the risk distribution fig 7 shows the mean index value of five risk levels as shown in fig 7 the zones with the highest and higher risk generally exhibit higher inundation depth we consider the intersection area of yawei river and baisha river as an example wherein the disaster causing factors such as md and mve are significantly threatening see fig 4 furthermore the disaster causing environmental factors including dem dr and sl are also adverse and collectively cause the highest risk conversely the lowest risk and lower risk zones exhibit higher elevation lower inundation depth and are far from rivers see fig 7 such as the northern part of the study area furthermore we focus on the causes of disaster in the highest risk zones since the highest risk zones are significantly affected by floods and increased attention should focus on the same we uniformly selected 17 areas in the highest risk zones see fig 6 and subsequently 7 index values of each area are shown in fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8 all selected areas exhibit higher inundation depth and this is consistent with the above analysis besides md dem and dr are other main disaster causing indices there are two main reasons that lead to the highest flood risk and they are as follows 1 as shown in fig 8a these areas generally exhibit extremely low elevation when rainstorms occur floods gather in these areas due to their low elevations and result in high flood risk 2 although areas in fig 8b exhibit relatively high elevations they are close to the yawei river and baisha river floods in these areas are caused mainly by the insufficient flow capacity of urban rivers different flood risk mitigation measures should be considered in different disaster causing reason areas such as implementing storage tanks in low elevation areas and pump stations that can effectively mitigate the flood risk of areas in fig 8b 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with other methods in order to verify the proposed approach for flood risk assessment traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared to the improved entropy cluster algorithm table 5 shows the mean index values of different risk levels there are noticeable differences among the mean index values of different risk levels furthermore the greater the difference the more reasonable the classification results by using the deviation degree dj in eq 8 in the entropy method the difference degree of different risk categories can be expressed as shown in table 5 the deviation degree dj is the highest in the improved entropy clustering analysis thereby indicating that the improved entropy clustering algorithm exhibits the most reasonable classification result for further analysis of the difference among different methods fig 9 a shows the flood risk maps developed by the traditional cluster algorithm the traditional cluster algorithm does not consider the different importance of indices to the evaluation objectives therefore the single index is especially prone to division into a category for example the spatial distribution of higher risk zones in fig 9a is approximately identical to the drainage conduit distribution fig 4e it demonstrates that the evaluation results based on the traditional clustering analysis method are not accurate fig 9b presents the flood risk maps developed by topsis method common methods to determine the classification standard for different risk levels are presently absent ji et al 2013 and thus the natural breaks classification method was adopted to classify the flood risk level as shown in fig 9b the zones above low risk are approximately identical to the assessment results of the improved entropy cluster algorithm however the proportion of the higher risk and highest risk zones is extremely low approximately 2 5 for example the areas a b c d and e in fig 9b are in lower risk but they all exhibit high inundation depth during the heavy storm event see fig 4a furthermore areas a b c d and e all exhibit high concentration of building area thereby indicating that they have higher population distributions and potential flood risk the inconsistency between them indicates that the classification results of topsis method are potentially unreasonable 4 2 advantages and deficiencies of the proposed approach in the study an improved entropy cluster algorithm approach was introduced to generate flood risk maps that provide a more objective and data driven representation of the physical characteristics of system the main advantages of the proposed approach are as follows 1 the approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thus providing a more reasonable and objective result 2 when compared with the traditional cluster algorithm the approach considers different contributions of indices to the evaluation objective by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method 3 the key metrics of improved entropy weight method is that adopting entropy weight method can determine the weight based on the objective attributes of the data and adopting the ahp method can comprehensively consider the subjective features of the data however the proposed approach also has certain deficiencies the accuracy of classifying flood risk is limited by the availability of data and a more comprehensive index system should be developed in a future study in the study socio economic factors such as population density and gross domestic product density are not considered due to data constraints more reasonable results can be obtained when more indices are adopted and additional studies should be performed further once the solid information is available 4 3 flood risk mitigation the spatial distribution of flood risk demonstrates the areas that are especially susceptible to flooding and appropriate measures should be considered to mitigate the risk in the study storage tanks and pump stations were proposed and considered to mitigate the flood risk in high risk zones by referring to lian et al 2017 based on the risk map in fig 6 areas a and b fig 10 are in the highest risk zones the elevation of the two areas is extremely low and there are sufficient spaces to construct water storage tanks around a and b therefore storage tanks were considered in these areas areas c f and g in the highest risk zone are close to the qiongzhou strait and inundation occurs frequently due to insufficient flow capacity of urban rivers and storm tide jacking in order to mitigate the flood risk pump stations were proposed in these areas furthermore areas d and e are also in high risk zones due to their low elevation although it is impossible to construct storage tanks in these areas given the paucity of sufficient space therefore pump stations were also proposed in areas d and e the storage capacity of storage tanks and the design flow of pump stations are listed in table 6 as shown in fig 10 flood inundation depths after hypothetically considering the above measures are extremely low when compared with those in fig 4a and this indicates that the high flood risk can be mitigated by adopting reasonable measures the flood risk map exhibits immense practical applications in flood risk prevention in the study area 4 4 discussion of the selection of indices urban floods are influenced by numerous and complex impact factors that includes the main impact factors and secondary impact factors since the interaction of these factors has not been identified completely and different study areas exhibit different main impact factors it is difficult to objectively obtain the criteria of selecting indices through existing researches or a case study based on our study the following suggestions on the selection of indices can be considered 1 although certain indices were chosen as the most important factors for a region the results are not absolutely applicable to other regions due to highly variable regional characteristics furthermore due to the diversity of flood causes there are many types of floods and thus it is difficult to comprehensively determine the flood risk by using only a few indices ji et al 2013 therefore flood risk assessment indices should be selected based on the characteristics of the study area and the main impact factors and secondary impact factors should be selected as possible for the overall and local rationality of the flood risk evaluation 2 when determining the weights of indices the limitation of the single method should be considered entropy weight method can only reflect whether the distribution of indices is uniform and does not consider the importance of indices for urban floods for example if the indices have uniform distributions in the study area they will exhibit very low entropy weights and play few roles in flood risk assessment therefore a method of integrating subjective and objective weights e g the improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method in this study should be adopted to determine index weights 5 conclusions the study proposed a novel approach for assessing urban flood risk based on urban flood inundation model improved entropy weight method and k means cluster algorithm with the support of gis technology it was applied to flood risk zoning in haidian island first seven flood risk indices were selected to establish the index system by coupling natural hazard index system and hydrological models based on the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal the ahp and entropy weight method were used to calculate subjective and objective weights and the results demonstrated inconsistency between entropy weights and ahp weights therefore it was unreasonable to determine weights only by subjective methods or objective methods this paper presented an improved entropy weight method of integrating ahp and entropy weight method to calculate index weights subsequently an approach of integrating k means cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method was used to develop the flood risk map in the study area a difficulty in using k means cluster algorithm is that the optimal number of clusters should be determined in advance in the study the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette function the flood risk map generated by the improved entropy cluster algorithm indicates that the high risk areas cover 13 7 of the total area and generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations conversely the lowest risk and lower risk areas exhibit higher elevation lower inundation depth and a large distance from rivers the assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events in order to verify the proposed approach for flood risk assessment the traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared with the improved entropy cluster algorithm the results indicated that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result the study outcomes provide a new method for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information for urban flood risk management flood control and disaster reduction planning in the study area and beyond in the future a more comprehensive index system including socio economic factors should be developed to evaluate flood risk in other areas and low impact infrastructures e g permeable paving and green roofs should be explored to mitigate flood risk since they can provide a greener environment and also an efficient way of controlling flood risk acknowledgements the study was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51679159

7189,floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards worldwide and are occurring increasingly frequent in recent decades flood risk assessment is an important tool for flood prevention and involves significant practical applications in flood risk management and flood disaster reduction in the study an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating urban flood inundation model improved entropy weight method and k means cluster algorithm to evaluate urban flood risk the proposed approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thus provides a more reasonable and objective result a region in haikou china is adopted to test the applicability of the proposed approach seven evaluation indices are selected by coupling the natural hazard index system and hydrological models the index weights are calculated by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process ahp method subsequently the k means cluster algorithm is used to develop the flood risk map in the study area the results indicate that high risk zones cover 13 7 of total area which generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations the assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events the traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis methods are used for comparison with the improved entropy cluster algorithm so as to validate the proposed approach for risk management the result demonstrates

cluster algorithm improved entropy weight 1 introduction floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring hazards worldwide lian et al 2013 hallegatte et al 2013 lian et al 2017 with climate changes and the rapid development of urbanization the flood risk will increase in the future wilby et al 2008 woodruff et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 based on the statistics released by the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters most cities in china such as beijing and shanghai suffered serious urban flooding in recent years and urban floods are an important obstacle to urban development in china as an important tool for flood prevention flood risk assessment exhibits significant practical applications in flood risk management and can lead to improvements in public awareness of flood risk flood risk assessment performs a comprehensive evaluation of natural and social attributes of floods with the aim of improving the accuracy of grasping the spatial distribution of flood risk traditionally three primary types of approaches are used for flood risk assessment yin et al 2015 and include the historical disaster mathematical statistics method hdms nott 2006 adikari et al 2010 multi criteria analysis mca lai et al 2016 guo et al 2014 and scenario simulation analysis ssa willems 2013 zhu et al 2016 although these methods are acceptable for analyzing flood risk they include a few disadvantages for example hdms requires high amounts of data and does not accurately reflect the spatial variability of flood risk additionally mca generally does not consider inundation characteristics e g inundation depth and velocity and ssa does not consider the impact of a hazard bearing body and hazard inducing environment on the flood risk in the study we coupled an evaluation index system of mca with hydrological models of ssa to develop a multi index system for flood risk assessment furthermore the determination of a suitable classification standard of different risk levels is a significant step in these applications but common methods to classify flood risks are currently absent ji et al 2013 the cluster algorithm is a data mining technology that is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thereby provides a more objective and reasonable result it is been already applied in landslide hazard assessment gorsevski et al 2003 water pollution risk evaluation li et al 2016 and aquifer vulnerability assessment javadi et al 2017 therefore the cluster algorithm is applied to flood risk assessment to overcome the difficulty in determining the risk classification threshold in traditional flood risk analysis different indices exhibit different contributions to the evaluation objective and thus the weight of each index should be determined prior to the cluster analysis common methods to determine index weights include analytic hierarchy process ahp and entropy method em both ahp and em exhibit limitations for example ahp exhibits high subjectivity since it is significantly affected by expert experience and knowledge zhao et al 2017 the em does not consider differences among indices and it relies excessively on the objective data that cannot reflect the practical experience of experts ma et al 2012 therefore an improved entropy weight method with the advantages of both ahp and em is used to solve the above problems within the study an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method to evaluate urban flood risk in order to verify the proposed approach the traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method that is commonly used in flood risk assessment lee et al 2014 radmehr and araghinejad 2015 najafabadi et al 2016 are also used in the risk assessment for comparison the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods section 3 describes the flood risk assessment based on improved entropy cluster algorithm approach in section 4 other methods are compared with the proposed approach and this is followed by a discussion on advantages and deficiencies of the proposed approach additionally appropriate measures are proposed and considered in the analysis to mitigate the risk based on the spatial distribution of flood risk the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area haidian island is located in the northern part of haikou in hainan province china and is adjacent to the qiongzhou strait fig 1 it is vulnerable to the joint impact of rainfall and tide level due to its special geographical location and flat terrain the drainage system of the study area is mainly composed of pipe networks and urban rivers when heavy rainfall occurs the flood first generally flows into pipe networks and subsequently flows into the qiongzhou strait through urban rivers heavy rainfall and high storm tides caused by typhoons often result in severe flood damage to haidian island for example typhoon rammasun with a maximum wind speed of 60 m s attacked haikou from july 17 to july 19 2014 and resulted in heavy daily rainfall 509 2 mm and high storm tide 3 83 m on july 18 this caused deaths of eight people and losses that were worth nearly nine billion yuan 1 43 billion dollar 2 2 data the data of the proposed method includes three parts the first part corresponds to the basic data of the urban flood inundation model that includes digital elevation model dem river data drainage data and rainfall data the second part includes the observations of historical storm events that are used to calibrate the urban flood inundation model the third part involves the flood risk assessment index including the dem slope sl distance to the river dr length of drainage conduits ldc building area ba maximum inundation depth md and maximum inundation velocity mve the above data are described in detail as follows digital elevation model dem m dem reflects the topographical condition of the study area that was used as the basic data for the urban flood inundation model and was one of flood risk indices it was accessed from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx river data and drainage data this corresponds to the basic data of the urban flood inundation model river data includes river cross sections and the distance between cross sections drainage data includes the locations of junctions and conduits junction depth and conduit size they were provided by haikou municipal water authority rainfall data this refers to hourly rainfall data and is the input data of the urban flood inundation model it was obtained from the china meteorological administration meteorological data center http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode a 0012 0001 html observations of

to the river dr m this index refers to the distance between each grid and the river wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 areas near the river may be prone to flooding due to dyke overtopping or breaching and areas far away from rivers are safe this step was completed by using euclidean distance in the gis length of drainage conduits ldc m this index reflects the drainage condition of the study area this was obtained from drainage data by the gis building area ba m2 this index is the building area of each grid in the study area it was extracted from the satellite remote sensing image through the environment for visualizing images envi software the satellite remote sensing image was provided by haikou municipal water authority maximum inundation depth md m and maximum inundation velocity mve m s md and mve reflect the degree of the flood hazard they were obtained from the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm 2 3 overall framework of the study approach the overall framework of the study approach is shown in fig 2 the approach used for the study involves two main components an approach of integrating k means cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method was used to develop the flood risk map in order to verify the proposed approach as applied to flood risk the traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared to the improved entropy cluster algorithm historical flood disaster data and deviation degree dj between risk levels were also used to estimate the effects of the proposed approach 2 4 flood risk assessment based on improved entropy cluster algorithm the cluster algorithm is a data mining technology that can group the data into different clusters sharma 1996 it can provide a more reasonable approach to flood risk analysis considering that it creates risk maps based on the attributes of input data but it does not require the determination of the classification standard for different risk levels the traditional cluster algorithm does not consider the different degrees of importance of each index however the different indices exhibit different contributions to the evaluation objective and thus the weight of each index should be determined in the study we propose an approach that integrates the cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight methods to evaluate the flood risk detailed steps of the proposed approach are described as follows fig 3 2 4 1 step 1 selection of the indices the selection of evaluation indices should be representative and comprehensive at least with respect to reducing the complexity wang et al 2011 after considering the actual conditions of flood risk in the study area and reviewing the recommendations in many literatures zou et al 2013 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 the primary flood risk assessment index system is established in the study by following the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal the selected flood risk assessment indices include dem sl dr ldc ba md and mve they are described in detail in section 2 2 2 4 2 step 2 quantification of the indices the seven indices are transformed into grid layers by using the raster calculation in gis with the scale of the raster set to 25 m 25 m since the resolution of the dem and pcswmm model is 25 m and the study area is divided into 21 188 grids the md and mve are obtained from urban flood inundation model that is established by pcswmm the pcswmm that combines swmm 5 and gis can provide a complete package for 1d and 2d analysis for storm water modeling in urban and rural areas tillinghast et al 2012 ahiablame and shakya 2016 akhter and hewa 2016 the continuity and momentum equations used in pcswmm are expressed as follows 1 a t q l 0 2 q t q 2 a l g a h l g a s f g a h l 0 where a denotes the cross section area m2 l denotes the distance along the conduit m q denotes the flow rate m3 s t denotes time s sf denotes the friction slope g denotes the gravity acceleration m s2 h denotes the pressure head m and hl denotes the local energy loss of per unit length conduit m the horton model is used to calculate infiltration the equation of the horton model is described as follows rossman and huber 2016 3 f p f f 0 f e k d t s where fp denotes the infiltration capacity into soil mm s f denotes the minimum or equilibrium value of fp at ts mm s f0 denotes the maximum or initial value of fp at ts 0 mm s ts denotes the time from beginning of storm s and kd denotes the decay coefficient s 1 the dynamic wave method akbari and barati 2012 barati et al 2012 2013 is used to calculate the hydraulic simulation of the drainage conduit in contrast to swmm that can only simulate 1d conduit flow and river flow pcswmm can accurately simulate unsteady 2d surface flow above ground through 2d floodplain model the 1d conduit model and 2d floodplain model are integrated by the orifice connection method chi 2014 in this study we use one of the most critical observed events for defined hydraulics variables i e md and mve to investigate the flood risk distribution in the most unfavorable scenarios which can help us to grasp the upper limit of flood damages additionally it is also feasible to define hydraulic variables by using design events zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a b the results of design events can provide detailed design basis for drainage engineering therefore researchers can select the most unfavorable scenarios or design events to define hydraulic variables according to different purposes 2 4 3 step 3 calculation of the weights for the indices entropy is a measure of the information disorder degree of a specific system and could fully exploit the information contained in original data shannon 1948 entropy weight can indicate useful information provided by the index although it excessively relies on the objective data that cannot reflect the knowledge and practical experience of experts such that the results are occasionally inconsistent with reality and individual understanding the ahp method is proven to determine weights comprehensively by considering the subjective attributes of the data therefore an improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method is presented to determine the index weights the main steps of the improved entropy weight method are summarized as follows 1 the sample evaluation matrix of m objects and n indices is x x ij m n 4 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn 2 the sample matrix x is converted into the normalized matrix y as follows a normalized matrix for positive indices 5 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij b normalized matrix for negative indices 6 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij 3 the entropy ej of the jth index is defined as follows 7 e j i 1 m p ij ln p ij ln m where p ij ln p ij is set as zero if p ij is equal to zero and 8 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 4 the deviation degree dj of the jth index is calculated as follows 9 d j 1 e j the large value of dj leads to larger variation in the jth index thus it indicates the effect of the jth index is bigger 5 we calculate the subjective weight ω j by using ahp method for taking the subjective attributes of the data into consideration the detailed steps of ahp method are listed in jenifer and jha 2017 6 we calculate the final weight ω j as follows 10 ω j ω j d j j 1 n ω j d j where ω j denotes the subjective weight determined by ahp method 2 4 4 step 4 determining optimal cluster numbers in the study the k means cluster method is adopted as the most widely used clustering algorithm due to its easy implementation simplicity and efficiency in application han and kamber 2006 a difficulty in using the k means cluster algorithm is that the optimal number of clusters must be determined in advance weatherill and burton 2008 this is achieved by using the silhouette function rosseeuw 1987 nakamura et al 2008 gaitani et al 2010 that can represent the cohesive degree of cluster within samples and separated degree of each clusters it is defined as follows 11 s i min b i a i max a i min b i i 1 2 n where ai denotes the mean distance from the ith point to other points within the cluster and bi denotes the mean distance from the ith point to the points in other clusters the optimal number of clusters is generally determined when the si simultaneously exhibits the maximal mean and the minimal number of negative values 2 4 5 step 5 k means cluster analysis the k means cluster algorithm is a clustering technique that attempts to determine k nonoverlapping clusters with the goal of maximizing the between cluster variance and minimizing the within cluster variance fernandez et al 2016 alizadeh et al 2017 the main steps of k means cluster algorithm are summarized as follows zagouras et al 2013 1 randomly initialize the cluster center c 1 c 2 c k 2 calculate the euclidean distance d ji between each point q j and each of the i th cluster center as follows 12 d ji q j c i 2 1 j n and 1 i k where n denotes the number of data points k is the number of cluster centers q j denotes the j th data point and c i denotes the i th cluster center 3 move each point q j to its nearest cluster center 4 update centers of clusters from which data points have been disjointed or reassigned 5 compute the objective function j if j converges then the cluster centers do not change from the previous iteration and the algorithm yields the final cluster centers else steps 2 to 5 are repeated until the objective function j converges 13 j i 1 k j 1 n q j c i 2 1 j n and 1 i k 2 4 6 step 6 determining flood risk levels the number of flood risk level is determined based on the cluster numbers for example if the data are divided into five classes the corresponding flood risk is expressed as the highest higher medium lower and the lowest risk the flood risk level of each cluster is determined by the average values of indices of each cluster for example if the average maximum inundation depth and velocity of the cluster 1 are the highest and the elevation is the lowest subsequently the cluster 1 is defined as the highest risk level the spatial distribution of the flood risk is developed by using gis techniques 3 results 3 1 quantification of the indices based on the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal indices of dem sl dr ldc ba md and mve were selected for the flood risk assessment the seven indices were transformed into grid layers by gis wherein the scale of the raster was set to 25 m 25 m since the resolution of the dem and pcswmm model was 25 m and the study area was divided into 21 188 grids as shown in fig 4 the index values of each grid were obtained by spatial analysis in gis the sl was calculated from dem by using gis techniques the ba was extracted from the satellite remote sensing image through the envi software the md and mve were obtained from pcswmm model the parameters of the pcswmm model were calibrated by trial and error and the ranges recommended in relevant studies rossman 2010 zhang and li 2015 tobio et al 2015 inundation depths in different observation points during the heaviest recorded rainfall were used to calibrate the model which was similar to yin et al 2016 yang et al 2018a and yang et al 2018b the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 was used for measuring the goodness of fit between observations and simulations and was used to assess the accuracy of pcswmm in the study calibration data was based on actual flood damage data during the rammasun typhoon on july 2014 and was obtained through field investigation the simulated inundation depth of the model is consistent with the observed value shown in table 1 the locations of observation points are shown in fig 1 the error values between observations and simulations are lower than 0 1 m and the value of nse is 0 725 yang et al 2013 and farida et al 2012 proposed that the simulations are considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 therefore the model is feasible and can be applied to simulate given flooding scenarios 3 2 calculation of the weights for the indices based on improved entropy weight method based on section 2 4 3 the index weights were calculated by improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method first the entropy weight method was used to determine the objective weight based on the variability degree within the index table 2 subsequently the ahp method was applied to determine the relative degree of importance between indices we invited ten experts in the field of urban flooding and asked them to rank the significance of the indices md mve dem ba dr ldc and sl for flood risk subsequently the judgment matrix of indices was determined by the significance of the indices for flood risk based on expert knowledge and experience table 3 with a consistency ratio cr 0 025 0 1 thereby indicating that the judgment matrix is reasonable table 2 demonstrates the inconsistency between entropy weights and ahp weights for example dem is an important index for flood risk estimation in ahp method although its weight is relatively low in the entropy method due to the flat terrain in the study area and the small variation of the elevation therefore it is unreasonable to determine weights only by using subjective methods or objective methods in the study we adopted an improved entropy weight method of integrating the entropy weight method and ahp method the final index weights determined by improved entropy weight method are listed in table 2 3 3 optimal number of clusters the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette function the cluster number k and corresponding silhouette values are shown in fig 5 cluster analysis was sequentially performed beginning with two clusters and ending with eight clusters when the cluster number k 5 the si simultaneously exhibits the maximum mean and the minimal number of negative values therefore the optimal number of five clusters was used in the study the corresponding risk level was classified into the highest risk higher risk medium risk lower risk and the lowest risk 3 4 distribution characteristics of flood risk following the above calculation the spatial distribution map of flood risk was generated as shown in fig 6 fig 6 demonstrates that the highest flood risk areas mainly lie in the following three areas the intersection of yawei river and baisha river the intersection of the people road and haidian fifth west road and the right of diankun road see fig 1 the higher risk areas are mainly located in the people road haidian second east road and the east of haidian fifth west road the highest and higher risk areas cover 13 7 of the total area table 4 the medium risk areas are mostly located in the south of the study area and the area near haidian fifth west road the lower and lowest risk zones are concentrated in the north of haidian island that covers approximately 66 of the total area essentially the high risk zones are concentrated in the center of the study area and the flood risk in the north area is lower than that in the south area in order to evaluate the accuracy of flood risk the above flood risk was compared with the actual flood damage data during the rammasun typhoon in july 2014 that was obtained through field investigation the highest and higher risk zones of the study can better overlap the regions seriously affected by the rammasun typhoon and this proved the feasibility of the proposed approach and rationality of the assessment results further analysis of the causes of the risk distribution fig 7 shows the mean index value of five risk levels as shown in fig 7 the zones with the highest and higher risk generally exhibit higher inundation depth we consider the intersection area of yawei river and baisha river as an example wherein the disaster causing factors such as md and mve are significantly threatening see fig 4 furthermore the disaster causing environmental factors including dem dr and sl are also adverse and collectively cause the highest risk conversely the lowest risk and lower risk zones exhibit higher elevation lower inundation depth and are far from rivers see fig 7 such as the northern part of the study area furthermore we focus on the causes of disaster in the highest risk zones since the highest risk zones are significantly affected by floods and increased attention should focus on the same we uniformly selected 17 areas in the highest risk zones see fig 6 and subsequently 7 index values of each area are shown in fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8 all selected areas exhibit higher inundation depth and this is consistent with the above analysis besides md dem and dr are other main disaster causing indices there are two main reasons that lead to the highest flood risk and they are as follows 1 as shown in fig 8a these areas generally exhibit extremely low elevation when rainstorms occur floods gather in these areas due to their low elevations and result in high flood risk 2 although areas in fig 8b exhibit relatively high elevations they are close to the yawei river and baisha river floods in these areas are caused mainly by the insufficient flow capacity of urban rivers different flood risk mitigation measures should be considered in different disaster causing reason areas such as implementing storage tanks in low elevation areas and pump stations that can effectively mitigate the flood risk of areas in fig 8b 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with other methods in order to verify the proposed approach for flood risk assessment traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared to the improved entropy cluster algorithm table 5 shows the mean index values of different risk levels there are noticeable differences among the mean index values of different risk levels furthermore the greater the difference the more reasonable the classification results by using the deviation degree dj in eq 8 in the entropy method the difference degree of different risk categories can be expressed as shown in table 5 the deviation degree dj is the highest in the improved entropy clustering analysis thereby indicating that the improved entropy clustering algorithm exhibits the most reasonable classification result for further analysis of the difference among different methods fig 9 a shows the flood risk maps developed by the traditional cluster algorithm the traditional cluster algorithm does not consider the different importance of indices to the evaluation objectives therefore the single index is especially prone to division into a category for example the spatial distribution of higher risk zones in fig 9a is approximately identical to the drainage conduit distribution fig 4e it demonstrates that the evaluation results based on the traditional clustering analysis method are not accurate fig 9b presents the flood risk maps developed by topsis method common methods to determine the classification standard for different risk levels are presently absent ji et al 2013 and thus the natural breaks classification method was adopted to classify the flood risk level as shown in fig 9b the zones above low risk are approximately identical to the assessment results of the improved entropy cluster algorithm however the proportion of the higher risk and highest risk zones is extremely low approximately 2 5 for example the areas a b c d and e in fig 9b are in lower risk but they all exhibit high inundation depth during the heavy storm event see fig 4a furthermore areas a b c d and e all exhibit high concentration of building area thereby indicating that they have higher population distributions and potential flood risk the inconsistency between them indicates that the classification results of topsis method are potentially unreasonable 4 2 advantages and deficiencies of the proposed approach in the study an improved entropy cluster algorithm approach was introduced to generate flood risk maps that provide a more objective and data driven representation of the physical characteristics of system the main advantages of the proposed approach are as follows 1 the approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels and thus providing a more reasonable and objective result 2 when compared with the traditional cluster algorithm the approach considers different contributions of indices to the evaluation objective by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method 3 the key metrics of improved entropy weight method is that adopting entropy weight method can determine the weight based on the objective attributes of the data and adopting the ahp method can comprehensively consider the subjective features of the data however the proposed approach also has certain deficiencies the accuracy of classifying flood risk is limited by the availability of data and a more comprehensive index system should be developed in a future study in the study socio economic factors such as population density and gross domestic product density are not considered due to data constraints more reasonable results can be obtained when more indices are adopted and additional studies should be performed further once the solid information is available 4 3 flood risk mitigation the spatial distribution of flood risk demonstrates the areas that are especially susceptible to flooding and appropriate measures should be considered to mitigate the risk in the study storage tanks and pump stations were proposed and considered to mitigate the flood risk in high risk zones by referring to lian et al 2017 based on the risk map in fig 6 areas a and b fig 10 are in the highest risk zones the elevation of the two areas is extremely low and there are sufficient spaces to construct water storage tanks around a and b therefore storage tanks were considered in these areas areas c f and g in the highest risk zone are close to the qiongzhou strait and inundation occurs frequently due to insufficient flow capacity of urban rivers and storm tide jacking in order to mitigate the flood risk pump stations were proposed in these areas furthermore areas d and e are also in high risk zones due to their low elevation although it is impossible to construct storage tanks in these areas given the paucity of sufficient space therefore pump stations were also proposed in areas d and e the storage capacity of storage tanks and the design flow of pump stations are listed in table 6 as shown in fig 10 flood inundation depths after hypothetically considering the above measures are extremely low when compared with those in fig 4a and this indicates that the high flood risk can be mitigated by adopting reasonable measures the flood risk map exhibits immense practical applications in flood risk prevention in the study area 4 4 discussion of the selection of indices urban floods are influenced by numerous and complex impact factors that includes the main impact factors and secondary impact factors since the interaction of these factors has not been identified completely and different study areas exhibit different main impact factors it is difficult to objectively obtain the criteria of selecting indices through existing researches or a case study based on our study the following suggestions on the selection of indices can be considered 1 although certain indices were chosen as the most important factors for a region the results are not absolutely applicable to other regions due to highly variable regional characteristics furthermore due to the diversity of flood causes there are many types of floods and thus it is difficult to comprehensively determine the flood risk by using only a few indices ji et al 2013 therefore flood risk assessment indices should be selected based on the characteristics of the study area and the main impact factors and secondary impact factors should be selected as possible for the overall and local rationality of the flood risk evaluation 2 when determining the weights of indices the limitation of the single method should be considered entropy weight method can only reflect whether the distribution of indices is uniform and does not consider the importance of indices for urban floods for example if the indices have uniform distributions in the study area they will exhibit very low entropy weights and play few roles in flood risk assessment therefore a method of integrating subjective and objective weights e g the improved entropy weight method that integrates the ahp and entropy weight method in this study should be adopted to determine index weights 5 conclusions the study proposed a novel approach for assessing urban flood risk based on urban flood inundation model improved entropy weight method and k means cluster algorithm with the support of gis technology it was applied to flood risk zoning in haidian island first seven flood risk indices were selected to establish the index system by coupling natural hazard index system and hydrological models based on the principle of being systematic quantitative measurable operational and universal the ahp and entropy weight method were used to calculate subjective and objective weights and the results demonstrated inconsistency between entropy weights and ahp weights therefore it was unreasonable to determine weights only by subjective methods or objective methods this paper presented an improved entropy weight method of integrating ahp and entropy weight method to calculate index weights subsequently an approach of integrating k means cluster algorithm and improved entropy weight method was used to develop the flood risk map in the study area a difficulty in using k means cluster algorithm is that the optimal number of clusters should be determined in advance in the study the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette function the flood risk map generated by the improved entropy cluster algorithm indicates that the high risk areas cover 13 7 of the total area and generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations conversely the lowest risk and lower risk areas exhibit higher elevation lower inundation depth and a large distance from rivers the assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events in order to verify the proposed approach for flood risk assessment the traditional cluster algorithm and topsis method were compared with the improved entropy cluster algorithm the results indicated that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result the study outcomes provide a new method for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information for urban flood risk management flood control and disaster reduction planning in the study area and beyond in the future a more comprehensive index system including socio economic factors should be developed to evaluate flood risk in other areas and low impact infrastructures e g permeable paving and green roofs should be explored to mitigate flood risk since they can provide a greener environment and also an efficient way of controlling flood risk acknowledgements the study was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51679159
