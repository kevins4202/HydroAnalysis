21600,wave loading of offshore structures such as oil rigs and wind turbines are governing for the design of these structures since the environmental conditions may change during the lifetime it is of great interest to evaluate the loads which the structure is exposed to at its current state since direct measurements of the loads are often not feasible operators must rely on indirect methods like vibrations based load identification in the field of indirect measurements predicting the distribution of the loading is crucial in determining the magnitude this paper will focus on this task by analyzing the response from a miniature platform in a wave flume a method for mapping the load distribution caused by regular wave loads is outlined using the output only system identification from acceleration measurements of the structure it is evaluated how accurate the load distribution can be predicted in the experiment the load distribution is estimated using both indirect methods

structural health monitoring was introduced to the offshore industry in the mid 70s begg et al 1976 loland and dodds 1976 nataraja 1983 state of the art has undergone major advances currently it has become industry practice to monitor offshore structures on a continuous basis the primary reason for this monitoring is health assessment damage detection and also estimating the fatigue damage accumulation augustyn et al 2019 tygesen et al 2018a 2018b devriendt et al 2014 wang et al 2018 these are used for inspection planning and may in principle extend the operational lifetime of the structures since the structures often are monitored in terms of response it is appealing to use this data to evaluate whether the loads which the structure was designed against is valid for the actual in place conditions inverse techniques for estimating stresses displacements or loads is frequently seen in studies of hull monitoring of vessels kefal and oterkus 2016 kefal and mayang 2018 however the nature of the problem differs due to the boundary conditions indirect methods for evaluating the wave loads on fixed structures are seen on a couple of occasions in the literature for instance jensen et al 1990 1992 studied the use of arma models for identifying wave loads on a cantilever they assumed that the system could be equalised as a single degree of freedom system and compared the estimates with analytical results maes et al 2018 studied the impulsive loads from breaking waves on a monopile they used the joint input state algorithm maes et al 2016 and pressure sensors to locally derive the pressure distribution in the splash zone vigsø et al vigsø et al 2018a 2019a vigsø 2020 conducted wave flume tests where the wave load spatial distribution was estimated by merging linear wave theory with wave gauge measurements the study vigsø et al 2019a is based on the same experimental setup as this current paper but it focuses on a time domain approach using a kalman filter for real time identification an assumed spatial distribution of the wave load is stretched to follow the wetted surface of the pile defined by wave gauge measurements the current study presents a continuation while focusing on deriving the spatial distribution of the load using the acceleration measurements fallais et al 2016 and perisic et al 2014 did similar research on a monopile structure but in a numerical framework they assumed that the spatial distribution was a known quantity generally for indirect measurements knowing the spatial distribution is paramount to the success of recreating the input force this paper extends the work in indirect measurements of wave loads on offshore structures based on a physical experiment conducted in a wave flume at lasif in marseille it is shown how the structural response can be used to derive not only the phase and magnitude of the load but also estimate its spatial distribution we will analyze the response of a miniature structure with similarities to monopile structures in the north sea the geometry and dynamic behavior of the structure are causing interaction effects which makes current load models such as the morrison equation invalid the paper will start by outlining the theory of indirect measurements then followed by the results of direct measurements and in the end a comparison between the estimated and the measured load will be shown the study will focus on regular wave loading with coupling effects between the fluid and structure the direct measurements of the load are done by pressure sensors and a load cell due to a limited set of sensors the approach in mapping the pressure distribution will be based on repetitions where the pressure sensors are repositioned since the test focuses on regular waves and thus the steady state response the variations can then be averaged to obtain the full pressure field 2 theory different approaches exist in indirect load identification both in the frequency domain and in the time domain since the aim of this paper is to analyze the steady state response it is convenient to tackle this problem in the frequency domain we will hence rely on one of the first known methods which was developed for load identification for military helicopters giansante et al 1982 bartlett and flannelly 1979 flannelly et al 1977 we start out by assuming that the response from the system will be a linear relations such that 1 y ω h ω f ω here y ω is the system response h ω is the frequency response function and f ω is the load all represented in the frequency domain the response is measured by the accelerometers and the frequency response function is estimated from the modal testing that leaves the load as the only unknown in this relation which then can be estimated using inverse methods before doing so we need to establish a frequency response function from operational modal analysis oma we obtain the modal parameters mode shapes damping ratio and natural frequencies these can be used to synthesize a response function using the modal superposition 2 h ω r 1 n q r φ r φ r t j ω λ r q r φ r φ r h j ω λ r here φ r is the mode shape vector q r is a scaling constant λ r is the complex pole all for mode r superscript and h means the complex conjugate and hermitian transpose respectively the poles λ r can be written as 3 λ r ζ r ω r j ω r 1 ζ r 2 here ζ r is the damping ratio and ω r is the natural frequency both for mode r the scaling constant q r is obtained as 4 q r 1 j 2 ω d r m r where m r is the modal mass and ω d r is the damped natural frequency simply pre multiplying by the inverse response function in eq 1 has shown to yield poor estimates on the load vigsø et al 2019b dobson and rider 1990 maddox 1975 stevens 1987 this is due to high sensitivity from truncation errors and singularity issues at some frequencies now if a loading scenario constraints the estimation process it makes the process more stable if we say that the system is subjected to a single load source it is convenient to separate the load into a spatial distribution and an associate scaling function 5 y ω h ω s p g ω here s p is a time invariant spatial distribution of the load and g ω is the corresponding scaling function when making this formulation it is essential to note that the distribution is not changing in time although it can scale to zero 2 1 procedure for determining the load distribution next the procedure for predicting the load distribution is outlined the concept is adopted from vigsø et al 2018b we expect the structure to be inertia dominated i e the maximum and minimum load will appear around the wave zero crossings and thus making the assumption on a time invariant distribution more valid the procedure is based on systematic guesswork evaluating a set of likely scenarios as indicated by the flowchart below image 1 here ε is an error function between the two signals for this implementation the root mean square rms error is used in the time domain we will return to the actual distributions and results in section 5 3 experimental setup an experiment campaign was conducted in april 2018 at lasif large air sea interaction facility in marseille in the wave flume a bottom fixed monopile structure with a box girder topside is positioned the model which is flexible is characterized by having a low mass ratio and a large diameter to wavelength ratio these combined are expected to yield interaction effects which are hard to predict through analytical methods the literature on the experimental study of wave load distributions on flexible models is limited luhar and nepf 2016 did research in this area but the dynamics and scale were much different from what is presented in this study as they analyzed seabed vegetation which engages large deflections paulsen and bredmose et al 2013a 2013b studied the wave loads on bottom fixed flexible models similar to this current paper yet their main focus was the total loading rather than the distribution many sources have worked on the dynamic pressure distribution on a cylinder caused by wave diffraction for example neelamani et al 1989 or akyuldiz akyildiz 2002 but these were focusing a rigid structural system marine risers which are very flexible in nature are often studied with regards to vortex shedding e g huarte et al 2006 gonzales 2013 these structures however have a different static system as they are fixed in either both ends or suspended from the top in a full scale experiment abramowicz gerigk et al 2018 studied how indirect methods could yield the pressure loads on a quay wall generated from vessel thrusters due to the nature of the problem it is not straight forward to measure the loads directly when interaction effects occur this may be why limited experimental work has been carried out in the past methods for estimating the effect from a weak coupling on linear systems are seen in anagnostopoulos 1982 where a generalization to the morison equation is implemented by the relative movement between the fluid and the structure 3 1 the model the pile is hollow circular and made from plexiglass material the pile remains dry on the inside during the experiment and this is mainly due to sensor concern a picture from the experiment can be seen in fig 1 along with the overall dimensions of the model as seen the pile is built from a set of identical 200 mm sections which are bolted together through internal flanges this makes the sensor installation more manageable but it also serves another purpose as one section of the pile is made a little different compared to the rest as seen in fig 2 this section is perforated such that pressure sensors can be inserted an array of eight pressure sensors kulite xtl 190sm 60 mv bar are placed at 45 intervals the section has more holes than sensors available and dummies hence blind the unused holes the model can then be disassembled and the section containing the pressure sensors can be moved up and down as the wave tests are repeated once averaging this provides the full field pressure map during regular waves in order to measure the structural response the model is equipped with 16 uni axial accelerometers brüel kjær 4508 b 100 mv g eight of these are facing the incoming wave and eight are facing in the transverse direction it may be seen from fig 1 that nine sensors are positioned inside the pile of the model while the remaining seven are positioned at the corners of the topside for offshore structures sensor installation below the sea level is uncommon due to maintenance and accessibility on installation at the very base the model is attached to a six dof force transducer ati mini 58 which then can measure the global reaction forces the force transducer is based on strain gauges i e the load is derived from relative movements between the structure and the base in front of the pile a wave gauge is positioned the wave gauge will give information on the water surface and allow for segmenting the measurement from individual waves 3 2 the flume the laboratory facility at the campus of luminy in marseille hosts a 40 m long wave flume the flume is 2 6 m wide and allows for a water depth of 0 9 m the waves are generated from one end by a piston type wavemaker in the opposite end the waves are passively absorbed by a permeable beach the model is placed at approximately 30 m from the wavemaker in the center of the flume during the experiments the water temperature was 12 c while the room temperature was at 19 c 3 3 the tests the experiment is conducted as a series of repetitive sets which in the end is combined to a single conclusion the tests related to this paper can be grouped into two categories 1 regular waves and 2 random loading the random loading should not be confused with random sea state it is generated by the testing team by brush strokes to any part of the structure above water level meanwhile as the person supplying the brush strokes is standing in waders next to the model this generates also some activity in the waters the response from this exercise is used for system identification i e operational modal analysis brincker and ventura 2015 the paper vigsø et al 2018c describes in detail the modal identification process and how the modal parameters changed as the flume was filled with water the tests regarding the regular waves will be used for load identification due to a limited set of pressure sensors the model must be reconfigured in order to map the full pressure field this consequently means that the model is build to one configuration then after a series of wave tests the model is extracted from the flume rebuild and then reinserted into the flume for more tests this is then repeated until sufficient resolution is obtained for the pressure distribution between each test oma is again performed to ensure that the dynamic properties are not altered unacceptable the oma tests each had a duration of 300 s which corresponds to approximately 2400 times the first natural period for each build configuration two tests of regular waves were conducted each test was simulated for approximately 300 s during the tests pressure sensors force transducer and accelerometers were sampling at 2048 hz while the wave gauge was measuring at 1024 hz 3 4 the wave of interest the wavemaker generates a sinusoidal wave train with a frequency of 0 6 hz and a wave height of 7 cm what was obtained in the flume is shown in fig 3 the figure shows the average wave profile when waves are separated through zero down crossing only waves at a wave period of 2 of the average are stored for analysis likewise are waves with outlying amplitude omitted when looking at the average wave profile shown in fig 3 we note a small asymmetry around the mean water level yielding a wider trough and a steeper crest the wave parameters can be seen in table 1 4 direct measurements this section contains the methodology and results for direct mapping the load distribution recall that the purpose is to estimate the distribution through indirect methods and hence the outcome of this section shall be used for comparison and verification purposes 4 1 force transducer first the measurements obtained from the force transducer will be analyzed as the regular waves are passing the structure the reaction forces are measured by the loadcell the data is segmented into individual waves and averaged the result is shown in fig 4 in terms of shear force and overturning moment the data is composed from all tests combined and lowpass filtered at 50 hz the maximum load is achieved at a wave phase angle of 1 07 π i e close to the wave zero up crossing indicating that the structure is likely inertia dominated 4 2 pressure sensors the measurements obtained from the pressure sensors can be used to derive a load distribution given by the difference in pressure on the front and backside of the pile if the pressure is integrated over the entire wet surface of the pile this yields the total wave loads since the number of pressure sensors is limited this will be done stepwise the pressure sensors are placed in an array covering 360 degrees of the pile at 45 degree intervals during the regular wave tests the average pressure variation is thus obtained at a given depth the pressure from such an exercise can be seen in fig 5 where the pressure has been interpolated between the sensors the figure shows the pressure at a constant depth at four different phases of the average wave the corresponding line load at this depth is calculated by circumferential integration 11 f y z t 0 2 π p z t α r cos α d α 12 f x z t 0 2 π p z t α r sin α d α here f y z t is the resulting line load in y direction n m i e acting in the direction of the wave and f x z t is the resulting line load in the transverse direction p z t α is the absolute pressure as a function of depth time and angle r is the pile radius and α is the angular offset as defined in fig 2 the section containing the pressure sensors is now moved up or down and the test is repeated once combined the load distribution from the waves can be found fig 6 shows the pressures at different depths at a given phase angle the phase shown corresponds to the time of maximum loading in the right hand side of the figure the model is sketched and shows where six different levels are evaluated the obtained line load is shown in fig 7 again at the time of maximum loading here the load at the base of the structure has been assumed as a fraction of the nearest measurement a fraction of 0 9 is used the line load obtained from the pressure integration is compared with estimates from linear wave theory and the morison equation morison et al 1950 note that the characteristic wave has a steepness which borderlines the validity range for linear theory yet the result is shown for reference a deviation between the integrated pressure and the analytical result from the morison equation is evident as the line load from the analytical approach keeps increasing near the surface the load measured from the pressure sensors decreases this effect can be attributed to the fluid structure interaction as the structure experiences the highest vibration amplitude away from the floor the interaction effect also increases this may also be seen directly from the pressure measurements in fig 6 if we compare the pressure at z d 0 88 and z d 0 99 we see that the restoring pressure on the aft side of the pile is increased near the surface while the driving pressure is nearly unchanged this naturally generates a reduced line load this result is rarely reported for this type of structures although similar near surface pressure drop seen in cases of sloshing in flexible container walls hashemi et al 2013 the loads in the transverse direction are subjected to high scatter and do not pose any interest for the future study we hence aim our attention at the loads parallel to the wave that is the y direction the line load is consequently integrated over the wet surface of the model and a global load is derived from pressure sensors and thus making it comparable with the readings from the loadcell the result is shown in fig 8 again we note that the maximum loading occurs near the time of zero up crossing which indicates inertia dominated loading scenario it is seen that the scatter in the total load is higher compared to what is measured by the load cell but the phase amplitude and point of attack are in good correlation here the line load has been linearly extrapolated to the water surface when needed a comparison of the estimated point of attack during maximum positive and negative wave loading is summarized in table 3 in section 6 5 indirect measurements now we turn to the indirect estimates this approach involves a couple of pre steps before a result can be obtained we start by noticing that the frf matrix expressed by eq 2 is based on the structural displacements also known as receptance or dynamic flexibility and whilst the response is measured in terms of accelerations these must be converted to accommodate the basis of the frf matrix the accelerations can be converted to displacements through integration in the frequency domain 13 y t f 1 f a t ω 2 where f is the fourier transform f 1 is the inverse fourier transform a t contains the accelerations and y t holds the displacements in practice this operation requires a highpass filter to avoid drift caused by noise near dc here a threshold of 0 5 hz is applied the response during wave action is shown in fig 9 here the typical structural acceleration response is shown for three passing waves the figure shows the accelerations measured in the forward aft direction at approximately still water level as seen the structure yields vibration at a higher frequency than the waves this frequency corresponds to the first natural frequency of the structure 5 1 system identification the response from the pseudo random loading can be used for the purpose of system identification if we assume a stationary process operational modal analysis can be applied in this context brincker and ventura 2015 many different identification techniques exist for this job and any one of these can be used for this study the time domain poly reference technique is used we will not go into details with the method but a general description is outlined so that the basic principle is clear the correlation function matrix is made from the response during random loading 14 r τ e y t y t t τ these are treated as free decays of the system and the poly reference technique by volt vold et al 1982 can be applied the block hankel matrices are formed and the autoregressive coefficients can be obtained by a least square approach finally the ar coefficients are fed into a companion matrix from which an eigenvalue decomposition grants the poles and mode shapes of the system please see vigsø et al 2018c for the detailed analysis although oma in principle does not require any artificial excitation of the structure and thus being a very convenient method for modal testing one major drawback persists this drawback concerns the scaling of the mode shapes and consequently the modal mass some methods exists to overcome this issue experimentally e g khatibi et al 2010 brincker and andersen 2003 however in the present study a finite element fe model is used to aid the scaling issue the model is made from simple bernoulli beam elements and updated to reflect the behavior of the physical model the fe model suits as a surrogate model which can be used both for mass normalization and expansion of the experimentally obtained mode shapes the effect from the hydrodynamic added mass is included as a static contribution to the translational degrees of freedom so that it does not affect the torsional modes barltrop and adams 1991 the hydrodynamic added damping is assumed to be included in the estimated modal damping and is not processed further the expansion makes it possible to interpolate the response between the sensors which yields a higher resolution during the load identification the expansion is done using the principles of serep o callahan et al 1989 using five modes the frequency response function is subsequently established using the same five modes i e the modes up till 60 hz see e g fig 14 the modal parameters from the fe model and the oma is summarized in table 2 5 2 result from an equivalent point load we will now turn to the load identification process the procedure outlined in section 2 1 states that the spatial distribution s p must be guessed we will open this guesswork by using a brute force approach it is hence assumed that the wave loading can be approximated as an equivalent point load systematically starting the bottom of the pile and moving upwards we will make a guess on the position of this point load an error is evaluated from each guess and the minimum error hence corresponds to the most likely position fig 10 shows the results from this here it should be noted that the resolution of the model has been increased through the modal expansion thus allowing for interpolation between sensors the wave load magnitude and phase can now be obtained from the product between the spatial distribution and its corresponding scaling function the load is again averaged over one wave period and the result is showed in fig 11 5 3 result from distributed loads the results from the equivalent point load showed a very distinct minimum at a distance of 0 504 m from the bottom the scenarios are now expanded to evaluate a series of distributed loads four different distributions are evaluated these are sketched in fig 12 along with the equivalent point load all of the distributions are spanning the area between the seabed and mean water level distribution b is a constant load over the entire water column which yields a centroid below a distribution c is a trapezium yielding the same centroid as the point load in a distribution d is a triangle which yields a centroid above a distribution e is the result obtained from the pressure sensors this is included for reference only as the pattern is an unlikely guess the same procedure is carried out to evaluate if a more detailed load distribution can be foreseen in this given study the rms errors are shown in fig 13 as seen from the error bars it is not possible to definitive pick one distribution as a better alternative to the point load 6 discussion the estimated variation in load during an averaged wave are evaluated using three different approaches force transducer pressure integration and acceleration data the estimates have similar phase and amplitude although the scatter varies the estimated point of attack during the maximum loading is summarized in table 3 here we see that the loads are well in phase while deviations of 4 exists on the estimated point of attack for the indirect method it was assumed that the spatial distribution is time invariant this may sound like a crude assumption considering the wave runup during wave crest however since the structure is inertia dominated maximum loading at wave zero crossing it can be used as a reasonable estimate the loading obtained from the pressure sensors is based on several tests where the sensors are moved around in order to move the section containing the pressure sensors the model needs to be disassembled and rebuild into a new configuration this alteration causes deviations in the dynamics of the model which may cause uncertainty to the results it has been assumed that this effect is neglectable for the purpose of measuring the pressure field in order to quantify the deviations between each build operational modal analysis was conducted each time the model was reassembled the scatter in natural frequency and damping estimates can be seen in fig 14 for each build the clusters within each build are obtained by a sliding bandpass filter in the frequency domain system identification is performed as the filter moves the estimates are filtered and sorted according to the modal assurance criterium allemang 2003 note that only sensors attached to the topside are kept once the model was disassembled the first time 7 conclusion and future work in this paper we have studied the wave load distribution from regular wave loading on a flexible structure this study was based on the axiom that all good comes to those who average a finite amount of pressure sensors was prohibiting a detailed mapping of the pressure field around the structure during the waves this was remedied by a roving group of sensors and repetitions of the test which allowed for an averaged result the pressure was integrated to yield a line load distribution and a total load caused during one wave period the result from this was compared with the measurements from a force transducer at the base and the result showed good agreement it was found that due to the coupling between the structure and the waves traditional methods for evaluating the loads were inadequate instead a different approach using indirect methods was evaluated by using the structure accelerations an equivalent point load was estimated both the location and amplitude of the estimated load were in good agreement with the direct measurements it was evaluated whether a more detailed load distribution could be obtained from the indirect method however for this experimental setup this was not possible in the end the effect from noise modelling and truncation errors made it difficult to distinguish between the presented distributions although the indirect method gave good result in terms of the averaged variation the scatter obtained is more significant compared to the direct measurements the results from pressure sensor integration are also subjected to scattering compared to the load cell small misalignments between test repetitions could be masking local effects from the interaction so to instead piv particle image velocimetry or dic digital image correlation could have been an alternative approach this however requires a different experimental setup the model was constructed in segments which allowed for sensor installation at any point desirable but with this many sources of non linearities are likewise introduced if the model could be simplified it would reduce the amount of uncertainty in the study in addition if a fixed model could be analyzed in parallel it could be used for verification of the influence of flexibility the test presented in this study is based on a simple monopile structure with a single load input before full scale implementation more difficult cases needs to be evaluated for instance if wind loading acts simultaneously as waves pegalajar jurado et al 2018

seabed vegetation which engages large deflections paulsen and bredmose et al 2013a 2013b studied the wave loads on bottom fixed flexible models similar to this current paper yet their main focus was the total loading rather than the distribution many sources have worked on the dynamic pressure distribution on a cylinder caused by wave diffraction for example neelamani et al 1989 or akyuldiz akyildiz 2002 but these were focusing a rigid structural system marine risers which are very flexible in nature are often studied with regards to vortex shedding e g huarte et al 2006 gonzales 2013 these structures however have a different static system as they are fixed in either both ends or suspended from the top in a full scale experiment abramowicz gerigk et al 2018 studied how indirect methods could yield the pressure loads on a quay wall generated from vessel thrusters due to the nature of the problem it is not straight forward to measure the loads directly when interaction effects occur this may be why limited experimental work has been carried out in the past methods for estimating the effect from a weak coupling on linear systems are seen in anagnostopoulos 1982 where a generalization to the morison equation is implemented by the relative movement between the fluid and the structure 3 1 the model the pile is hollow circular and made from plexiglass material the pile remains dry on the inside during the experiment and this is mainly due to sensor concern a picture from the experiment can be seen in fig 1 along with the overall dimensions of the model as seen the pile is built from a set of identical 200 mm sections which are bolted together through internal flanges this makes the sensor installation more manageable but it also serves another purpose as one section of the pile is made a little different compared to the rest as seen in fig 2 this section is perforated such that pressure sensors can be inserted an array of eight pressure sensors kulite xtl 190sm 60 mv bar are placed at 45 intervals the section has more holes than sensors available and dummies hence blind the unused holes the model can then be disassembled and the section containing the pressure sensors can be moved up and down as the wave tests are repeated once averaging this provides the full field pressure map during regular waves in order to measure the structural response the model is equipped with 16 uni axial accelerometers brüel kjær 4508 b 100 mv g eight of these are facing the incoming wave and eight are facing in the transverse direction it may be seen from fig 1 that nine sensors are positioned inside the pile of the model while the remaining seven are positioned at the corners of the topside for offshore structures sensor installation below the sea level is uncommon due to maintenance and accessibility on installation at the very base the model is attached to a six dof force transducer ati mini 58 which then can measure the global reaction forces the force transducer is based on strain gauges i e the load is derived from relative movements between the structure and the base in front of the pile a wave gauge is positioned the wave gauge will give information on the water surface and allow for segmenting the measurement from individual waves 3 2 the flume the laboratory facility at the campus of luminy in marseille hosts a 40 m long wave flume the flume is 2 6 m wide and allows for a water depth of 0 9 m the waves are generated from one end by a piston type wavemaker in the opposite end the waves are passively absorbed by a permeable beach the model is placed at approximately 30 m from the wavemaker in the center of the flume during the experiments the water temperature was 12 c while the room temperature was at 19 c 3 3 the tests the experiment is conducted as a series of repetitive sets which in the end is combined to a single conclusion the tests related to this paper can be grouped into two categories 1 regular waves and 2 random loading the random loading should not be confused with random sea state it is generated by the testing team by brush strokes to any part of the structure above water level meanwhile as the person supplying the brush strokes is standing in waders next to the model this generates also some activity in the waters the response from this exercise is used for system identification i e operational modal analysis brincker and ventura 2015 the paper vigsø et al 2018c describes in detail the modal identification process and how the modal parameters changed as the flume was filled with water the tests regarding the regular waves will be used for load identification due to a limited set of pressure sensors the model must be reconfigured in order to map the full pressure field this consequently means that the model is build to one configuration then after a series of wave tests the model is extracted from the flume rebuild and then reinserted into the flume for more tests this is then repeated until sufficient resolution is obtained for the pressure distribution between each test oma is again performed to ensure that the dynamic properties are not altered unacceptable the oma tests each had a duration of 300 s which corresponds to approximately 2400 times the first natural period for each build configuration two tests of regular waves were conducted each test was simulated for approximately 300 s during the tests pressure sensors force transducer and accelerometers were sampling at 2048 hz while the wave gauge was measuring at 1024 hz 3 4 the wave of interest the wavemaker generates a sinusoidal wave train with a frequency of 0 6 hz and a wave height of 7 cm what was obtained in the flume is shown in fig 3 the figure shows the average wave profile when waves are separated through zero down crossing only waves at a wave period of 2 of the average are stored for analysis likewise are waves with outlying amplitude omitted when looking at the average wave profile shown in fig 3 we note a small asymmetry around the mean water level yielding a wider trough and a steeper crest the wave parameters can be seen in table 1 4 direct measurements this section contains the methodology and results for direct mapping the load distribution recall that the purpose is to estimate the distribution through indirect methods and hence the outcome of this section shall be used for comparison and verification purposes 4 1 force transducer first the measurements obtained from the force transducer will be analyzed as the regular waves are passing the structure the reaction forces are measured by the loadcell the data is segmented into individual waves and averaged the result is shown in fig 4 in terms of shear force and overturning moment the data is composed from all tests combined and lowpass filtered at 50 hz the maximum load is achieved at a wave phase angle of 1 07 π i e close to the wave zero up crossing indicating that the structure is likely inertia dominated 4 2 pressure sensors the measurements obtained from the pressure sensors can be used to derive a load distribution given by the difference in pressure on the front and backside of the pile if the pressure is integrated over the entire wet surface of the pile this yields the total wave loads since the number of pressure sensors is limited this will be done stepwise the pressure sensors are placed in an array covering 360 degrees of the pile at 45 degree intervals during the regular wave tests the average pressure variation is thus obtained at a given depth the pressure from such an exercise can be seen in fig 5 where the pressure has been interpolated between the sensors the figure shows the pressure at a constant depth at four different phases of the average wave the corresponding line load at this depth is calculated by circumferential integration 11 f y z t 0 2 π p z t α r cos α d α 12 f x z t 0 2 π p z t α r sin α d α here f y z t is the resulting line load in y direction n m i e acting in the direction of the wave and f x z t is the resulting line load in the transverse direction p z t α is the absolute pressure as a function of depth time and angle r is the pile radius and α is the angular offset as defined in fig 2 the section containing the pressure sensors is now moved up or down and the test is repeated once combined the load distribution from the waves can be found fig 6 shows the pressures at different depths at a given phase angle the phase shown corresponds to the time of maximum loading in the right hand side of the figure the model is sketched and shows where six different levels are evaluated the obtained line load is shown in fig 7 again at the time of maximum loading here the load at the base of the structure has been assumed as a fraction of the nearest measurement a fraction of 0 9 is used the line load obtained from the pressure integration is compared with estimates from linear wave theory and the morison equation morison et al 1950 note that the characteristic wave has a steepness which borderlines the validity range for linear theory yet the result is shown for reference a deviation between the integrated pressure and the analytical result from the morison equation is evident as the line load from the analytical approach keeps increasing near the surface the load measured from the pressure sensors decreases this effect can be attributed to the fluid structure interaction as the structure experiences the highest vibration amplitude away from the floor the interaction effect also increases this may also be seen directly from the pressure measurements in fig 6 if we compare the pressure at z d 0 88 and z d 0 99 we see that the restoring pressure on the aft side of the pile is increased near the surface while the driving pressure is nearly unchanged this naturally generates a reduced line load this result is rarely reported for this type of structures although similar near surface pressure drop seen in cases of sloshing in flexible container walls hashemi et al 2013 the loads in the transverse direction are subjected to high scatter and do not pose any interest for the future study we hence aim our attention at the loads parallel to the wave that is the y direction the line load is consequently integrated over the wet surface of the model and a global load is derived from pressure sensors and thus making it comparable with the readings from the loadcell the result is shown in fig 8 again we note that the maximum loading occurs near the time of zero up crossing which indicates inertia dominated loading scenario it is seen that the scatter in the total load is higher compared to what is measured by the load cell but the phase amplitude and point of attack are in good correlation here the line load has been linearly extrapolated to the water surface when needed a comparison of the estimated point of attack during maximum positive and negative wave loading is summarized in table 3 in section 6 5 indirect measurements now we turn to the indirect estimates this approach involves a couple of pre steps before a result can be obtained we start by noticing that the frf matrix expressed by eq 2 is based on the structural displacements also known as receptance or dynamic flexibility and whilst the response is measured in terms of accelerations these must be converted to accommodate the basis of the frf matrix the accelerations can be converted to displacements through integration in the frequency domain 13 y t f 1 f a t ω 2 where f is the fourier transform f 1 is the inverse fourier transform a t contains the accelerations and y t holds the displacements in practice this operation requires a highpass filter to avoid drift caused by noise near dc here a threshold of 0 5 hz is applied the response during wave action is shown in fig 9 here the typical structural acceleration response is shown for three passing waves the figure shows the accelerations measured in the forward aft direction at approximately still water level as seen the structure yields vibration at a higher frequency than the waves this frequency corresponds to the first natural frequency of the structure 5 1 system identification the response from the pseudo random loading can be used for the purpose of system identification if we assume a stationary process operational modal analysis can be applied in this context brincker and ventura 2015 many different identification techniques exist for this job and any one of these can be used for this study the time domain poly reference technique is used we will not go into details with the method but a general description is outlined so that the basic principle is clear the correlation function matrix is made from the response during random loading 14 r τ e y t y t t τ these are treated as free decays of the system and the poly reference technique by volt vold et al 1982 can be applied the block hankel matrices are formed and the autoregressive coefficients can be obtained by a least square approach finally the ar coefficients are fed into a companion matrix from which an eigenvalue decomposition grants the poles and mode shapes of the system please see vigsø et al 2018c for the detailed analysis although oma in principle does not require any artificial excitation of the structure and thus being a very convenient method for modal testing one major drawback persists this drawback concerns the scaling of the mode shapes and consequently the modal mass some methods exists to overcome this issue experimentally e g khatibi et al 2010 brincker and andersen 2003 however in the present study a finite element fe model is used to aid the scaling issue the model is made from simple bernoulli beam elements and updated to reflect the behavior of the physical model the fe model suits as a surrogate model which can be used both for mass normalization and expansion of the experimentally obtained mode shapes the effect from the hydrodynamic added mass is included as a static contribution to the translational degrees of freedom so that it does not affect the torsional modes barltrop and adams 1991 the hydrodynamic added damping is assumed to be included in the estimated modal damping and is not processed further the expansion makes it possible to interpolate the response between the sensors which yields a higher resolution during the load identification the expansion is done using the principles of serep o callahan et al 1989 using five modes the frequency response function is subsequently established using the same five modes i e the modes up till 60 hz see e g fig 14 the modal parameters from the fe model and the oma is summarized in table 2 5 2 result from an equivalent point load we will now turn to the load identification process the procedure outlined in section 2 1 states that the spatial distribution s p must be guessed we will open this guesswork by using a brute force approach it is hence assumed that the wave loading can be approximated as an equivalent point load systematically starting the bottom of the pile and moving upwards we will make a guess on the position of this point load an error is evaluated from each guess and the minimum error hence corresponds to the most likely position fig 10 shows the results from this here it should be noted that the resolution of the model has been increased through the modal expansion thus allowing for interpolation between sensors the wave load magnitude and phase can now be obtained from the product between the spatial distribution and its corresponding scaling function the load is again averaged over one wave period and the result is showed in fig 11 5 3 result from distributed loads the results from the equivalent point load showed a very distinct minimum at a distance of 0 504 m from the bottom the scenarios are now expanded to evaluate a series of distributed loads four different distributions are evaluated these are sketched in fig 12 along with the equivalent point load all of the distributions are spanning the area between the seabed and mean water level distribution b is a constant load over the entire water column which yields a centroid below a distribution c is a trapezium yielding the same centroid as the point load in a distribution d is a triangle which yields a centroid above a distribution e is the result obtained from the pressure sensors this is included for reference only as the pattern is an unlikely guess the same procedure is carried out to evaluate if a more detailed load distribution can be foreseen in this given study the rms errors are shown in fig 13 as seen from the error bars it is not possible to definitive pick one distribution as a better alternative to the point load 6 discussion the estimated variation in load during an averaged wave are evaluated using three different approaches force transducer pressure integration and acceleration data the estimates have similar phase and amplitude although the scatter varies the estimated point of attack during the maximum loading is summarized in table 3 here we see that the loads are well in phase while deviations of 4 exists on the estimated point of attack for the indirect method it was assumed that the spatial distribution is time invariant this may sound like a crude assumption considering the wave runup during wave crest however since the structure is inertia dominated maximum loading at wave zero crossing it can be used as a reasonable estimate the loading obtained from the pressure sensors is based on several tests where the sensors are moved around in order to move the section containing the pressure sensors the model needs to be disassembled and rebuild into a new configuration this alteration causes deviations in the dynamics of the model which may cause uncertainty to the results it has been assumed that this effect is neglectable for the purpose of measuring the pressure field in order to quantify the deviations between each build operational modal analysis was conducted each time the model was reassembled the scatter in natural frequency and damping estimates can be seen in fig 14 for each build the clusters within each build are obtained by a sliding bandpass filter in the frequency domain system identification is performed as the filter moves the estimates are filtered and sorted according to the modal assurance criterium allemang 2003 note that only sensors attached to the topside are kept once the model was disassembled the first time 7 conclusion and future work in this paper we have studied the wave load distribution from regular wave loading on a flexible structure this study was based on the axiom that all good comes to those who average a finite amount of pressure sensors was prohibiting a detailed mapping of the pressure field around the structure during the waves this was remedied by a roving group of sensors and repetitions of the test which allowed for an averaged result the pressure was integrated to yield a line load distribution and a total load caused during one wave period the result from this was compared with the measurements from a force transducer at the base and the result showed good agreement it was found that due to the coupling between the structure and the waves traditional methods for evaluating the loads were inadequate instead a different approach using indirect methods was evaluated by using the structure accelerations an equivalent point load was estimated both the location and amplitude of the estimated load were in good agreement with the direct measurements it was evaluated whether a more detailed load distribution could be obtained from the indirect method however for this experimental setup this was not possible in the end the effect from noise modelling and truncation errors made it difficult to distinguish between the presented distributions although the indirect method gave good result in terms of the averaged variation the scatter obtained is more significant compared to the direct measurements the results from pressure sensor integration are also subjected to scattering compared to the load cell small misalignments between test repetitions could be masking local effects from the interaction so to instead piv particle image velocimetry or dic digital image correlation could have been an alternative approach this however requires a different experimental setup the model was constructed in segments which allowed for sensor installation at any point desirable but with this many sources of non linearities are likewise introduced if the model could be simplified it would reduce the amount of uncertainty in the study in addition if a fixed model could be analyzed in parallel it could be used for verification of the influence of flexibility the test presented in this study is based on a simple monopile structure with a single load input before full scale implementation more difficult cases needs to be evaluated for instance if wind loading acts simultaneously as waves pegalajar jurado et al 2018

21601,this paper is devoted to stress control of cylinders during water entry based on the characteristics of bi material interfaces firstly the influence factors on dynamic stress are studied from the view of elastic mechanics and wave mechanics it is found that the dynamic stress depends on the material parameters material layout natural frequency and deformation on this basis a sandwich scheme is proposed to reduce the stress level of the cylinder entering water then a sandwich cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders during water entry are investigated by coupling of smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and finite element method fem it is found that when the material parameters are given the deformation and natural frequency of the sandwich cylinder are moderate but its stress level is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions attributing to its unique material layout accordingly the limit velocity of the sandwich cylinder colliding with water is much higher than that of other cylinders therefore the stress control scheme is expected to reduce the possibility of strength failure of cylindrical structure during water entry keywords stress control cylinder water entry bi material interfaces 1 introduction in marine engineering the cylinder is a typical structural form such as the shell of submarine and autonomous underwater vehicle auv and the supporting part of some offshore platforms therefore the researches on the interaction between cylinder and water have important engineering significances the water entry of cylinder is an important type of interaction between cylinder and water analytical studies are of great significance to reveal the mechanism of the impact on the structure during water entry the pioneers of analytical research on water entry problems include von karman and wagner who present the von karman model von karman 1929 and wagner model wagner 1932 respectively having a profound impact on the researches in this field on this basis cointe et al and korobkin make a research on the impact force on a rigid cylinder during water entry by using analytical method cointe and armand 1987 alexander 2004 nuffel et al study in detail the conditions under which wagner theory is applicable to cylindrical horizontal water entry van nuffel et al 2014 in general there are few literatures on the water entry of cylinder by analytical method since some complicated working conditions are difficult to be analyzed such as considering the attitude of cylinder and the scale of water domain moreover these literatures mainly focus on impact force and pressure acting on a rigid body during water entry but rarely involves the dynamic responses of an elastic body such as stress deformation vibration acceleration etc in contrast more literatures study the water entry problems of cylinders by using numerical method which is suitable not only for simple structures in ideal cases but also for complex structures in complex cases in the field of hydrodynamics of water entry common numerical methods include finite volume method fvm volume of fluid

entering water ma et al 2014b in these literatures the water entry of rigid model is widely investigated and the research focus includes some important physical phenomena during water entry such as water impact motion features cavity characteristics etc among them the studies on water impact have important enlightening significance to this paper since the impact pressure is the inducement of dynamic response such as stress and so on next are the literatures on water entry of elastic bodies by numerical methods at present the numerical methods used for water entry of elastic body mainly

strain stress deformation etc which are important physical quantities investigated in this paper as well among them the literatures hassoon et al 2018 and zhang et al 2020 discuss the effect of structural stiffness which is of some enlightening significances for this paper in addition the application of sph fem in water entry of composite wedge in the literature panciroli et al 2012 has some enlightening significances to this paper as well in addition to above numerical researches some important experimental studies on hydrodynamics of water entry are also worthy of attention truscott et

shams et al 2017 barjastehhamid and javaherian 2016 zong et al test the pressures and accelerations of trimaran ship section during water entry zong et al 2020 carcaterra et al make a research on the spectral responses of elastic wedge impacting water based on the combination of experiments and theories carcaterra and ciappi 2004 arai et al test the strain of a cylindrical shell during water entry arai and miyauchi 1998 these experimental studies focus on two aspects one is the physical characteristics of the cavity and the other is the force pressure strain deformation acceleration and so on among them the experimental model of the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 is similar to that of this paper so it is used in this paper to verify the reliability of the numerical algorithm at present the development of human marine activities puts higher demands on the performance of underwater equipment the cylindrical shell is one of the typical structures of underwater equipment generally the equipment is always carried smoothly into the water by a hanger however in some remote sea areas in harsh conditions the equipment may be sent into the water by airdrop this requires a high strength cylindrical shell to avoid stress failure during water entry in order to reduce the stress level of the cylindrical shell colliding with water a stress control scheme based on the characteristics of bi material interface is advised by this paper in part 2 the basic principles of stress control are analyzed from the point of view of wave mechanics and elastic mechanics in part 3 the sph fem models of a sandwich cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders are established in part 4 the numerical results and the mechanism of stress control are analyzed the same studies have not been covered by other existing literatures 2 basic principles a sandwich cylinder is taken as an example to illustrate the basic principles of stress control based on the characteristics of bi material interfaces the water entry of a sandwich cylinder is shown in fig 1 it may be abstracted into a mechanical model subjected to an impact pressure as shown in fig 2 2 1 stress propagating at interface under the action of impact pressure elastic waves are generated in the structure the incident waves will be reflected and transmitted at the bi material interface elastic waves include compressional dilatational wave p wave and shear wave s wave for simplicity the elastic waves are assumed to be perpendicular to the bi material interface as shown in fig 3 where i denotes the incident wave r denotes the reflected wave and t denotes the transmitted wave the derivation in this section refers to the literatures knott 1899 zoeppritz 1919 macelwane and sohon 1936 to some extent an ideal 2d problem is investigated here the displacement of a particle relative to its equilibrium position is given by 1 u u x t v v x t where x denotes the direction of the wave propagation t denotes the time u denotes the displacement of a particle in the p wave and v denotes the displacement of a particle in the s wave the strain displacement equations are given by 2 ε x u x ε y v y γ x y v x u y where ε denotes the normal strain and γ denotes the shear strain the constitutive equations are given by 3 σ x λ ε x ε y 2 g ε x σ y λ ε x ε y 2 g ε y τ x y g γ x y where σ denotes the normal stress τ denotes the shear stress λ denotes the first lame constant and g denotes the shear modulus the lame constant λ and shear modulus g are respectively given by 4 λ μ e 1 μ 1 2 μ and 5 g e 2 1 μ where e denotes the young modulus and μ denotes the poisson s ratio substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3 gives 6 σ x λ 2 g u x σ y λ u x τ x y g v x according to wave mechanics the particle displacement satisfies the following relationship 7 u x i 1 n ω c p u v x i 1 n ω c s v where ω denotes the angular frequency c p denotes the velocity of p wave c s denotes the velocity of s wave and n equals 1 for the incident and transmitted waves and equals 0 for the reflected wave the velocities of p wave and s wave are respectively given by 8 c p λ 2 g ρ and 9 c s g ρ where ρ denotes the density drawing on the acoustics the concept of specific acoustic impedance is introduced here 10 z p ρ c p and 11 z s ρ c s where z denotes the specific acoustic impedance it is derived from equations 4 and 5 and 8 11 that 12 z s z p c s c p 1 2 μ 2 1 μ substituting equation 7 into equation 6 gives 13 σ x i 1 n 2 π f z p u σ y i 1 n 2 π f 1 2 1 μ z p u τ x y i 1 n 2 π f z s v where f ω 2 π denotes the wave frequency the continuity condition of displacement at the bi material interface is given by 14 u i u r u t v i v r v t from the first two expressions of equation 13 it may be derived that 15 σ x 2 1 μ σ y it may be seen from equation 15 that when poisson s ratios of the two materials are equal σ x and σ y are continuous at the interface otherwise only one of σ x and σ y is continuous at the interface according to the propagation direction of the wave σ x is generally considered to be continuous therefore the continuity condition of stress at the bi material may be expressed as 16 σ x i σ x r σ x t τ x y i τ x y r τ x y t substituting the first and the third expressions of equation 13 into equation 16 gives 17 u i u r z p 2 z p 1 u t v i v r z s 2 z s 1 v t simultaneous solution of equations 14 and 17 gives 18 u t 2 z p 1 z p 1 z p 2 u i v t 2 z s 1 z s 1 z s 2 v i substituting equation 18 into equation 13 gives 19 σ x t 2 z p 2 z p 1 z p 2 σ x i σ y t 1 μ 1 1 μ 2 2 z p 2 z p 1 z p 2 σ y i τ x y t 2 z s 2 z s 1 z s 2 τ x y i equation 19 describes the regularity of stress propagation at a bi material interface it indicates that the relationship between the incident stress and transmitted stress depends on the relationships of specific acoustic impedances and poisson s ratios of the two materials generally speaking the poisson s ratio of common engineering materials varies in a small range so its influence on stress is limited if the influence of poisson s ratio is ignored the following basic conclusions may be drawn if the specific acoustic impedance of the transmitted material is greater than that of the incident material the transmitted stress is higher than the incident stress and vice versa 2 2 influence factors of stress next the influence factors of stress are further investigated the derivation in section 2 1 does not take into account the influence of boundary on stress in fact there is an interesting phenomenon in the field of mechanics that is large stresses generally appear at the boundaries of structures in the case of a 2d cylinder large stresses generally appear on the inner and outer surfaces in view of this equation 13 is modified as follows 20 σ x i 1 n 2 π f e k z p u σ y i 1 n 2 π f 1 2 1 μ e k z p u τ x y i 1 n 2 π f e k z s v where e denotes the natural constant and k is a parameter depends on the material layout if the material has an independent boundary different from the common interface with other materials k takes a positive value or else k equals a negative value detailed in section 4 2 4 in equation 20 the exponential function e k is used as a correction factor for the following reasons exponential functions have important applications in natural science for example the solar radiation decays exponentially along the water depth gamma rays decay exponentially along the thickness of the medium rayleigh waves decay exponentially along the depth of earth and so on therefore it is natural to think that the stress of a mechanical structure also decays exponentially from the surface to the interior in engineering applications von mises stress is often used to evaluate the strength failure of structures de silva 2014 for an ideal 2d model the von mises stress σ v o n is given by zhang et al 2020 21 σ v o n σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x σ y 3 τ x y 2 structural deformation δ is essentially the displacement of particles relative to their equilibrium positions assume that the deformation in x direction is ζ times that in y direction that is 22 u ζ v u 2 v 2 δ 2 it is solved from equation 22 that 23 u ζ 1 ζ 2 δ v 1 1 ζ 2 δ substituting equation 23 into equation 20 gives 24 σ x i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ ζ 1 ζ 2 σ y i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ ζ 1 ζ 2 1 2 1 μ τ x y i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 1 ζ 2 1 2 μ 2 1 μ substituting equation 24 into equation 21 gives 25 σ v o n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 1 ζ 2 1 2 1 μ 4 μ 2 6 μ 3 ζ 2 6 2 μ 2 3 μ 1 the parameter μ mainly affects the second and the third expressions of equation 24 assume that the parameter μ takes the value of 0 245 which is the mean of poisson s ratios of 30crmnsia steel s and tungsten carbide w used in this paper see table 5 the resulting relative error is no more than 7 for the second expression of equation 24 and no more than 9 for the third expression of equation 24 thus equation 25 is simplified as 26 σ v o n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 0 77 ζ 2 1 ζ 2 next determine the effect of parameter ζ on σ v o n the following function is constructed 27 η ζ 1 0 77 ζ 2 1 ζ 2 the curve of η ζ is shown in fig 4 from which it may be seen that the range of η ζ is 0 88 1 therefore the effect of ζ on von mises stress is small if the median of value range is taken as the value of η ζ i e η ζ 0 94 the resulting error may not exceed 7 then equation 26 may be simplified as 28 σ v o n 5 91 f z p δ e k according to equation 28 it may be seen that the stress mainly depends on wave frequency f material layout k specific acoustic impedance z p and deformation δ for a structure subjected to an impact pressure the wave frequency f refers to the first order natural frequency f n see section 4 2 2 2 3 sandwich scheme for stress control for many structures strength failure depends on stress and yield limit y the closer the stress approaches the yield limit the more likely strength failure occurs therefore the concept of stress level of a multilayer structure is introduced here 29 s l i σ v o n i y i 100 and 30 s l max 1 i n l s l i max 1 i n l σ v o n i y i 100 where s l i denotes the stress level of layer i s l denotes the stress level of the whole structure σ v o n i denotes the von mises stress of layer i y i denotes the yield limit of material of layer i and n l denotes the number of layers the sandwich structure is a classical form in engineering field generally speaking the core is made of ordinary material and the inner and outer layers are made of special functional material according to the purpose of this study it is assumed that the inner and outer layers are made of materials with very high yield limits so that the stress level of the whole structure is determined by the material of core at the same time the specific acoustic impedance of the inner and outer materials is obviously greater than that of the core materials which weakens the propagation of stress to the core see equation 19 in section 2 1 moreover the amplification effect of the boundary on the stress of core material is eliminated since the core has no independent boundary detailed in section 4 2 6 in a word the inner and outer layers of the sandwich have the ability to isolate and withstand large stresses thus significantly reducing the stress of the core and the stress level of the whole structure this is the basic principle of the sandwich scheme for stress control 3 numerical models 3 1 sph fem method the research objects of this paper include water and elastic cylinders which are simulated by smoothed

of an elastic body involves two kinds of substances liquid and solid and therefore belongs to a multiphase system an algorithm for fluid structure interaction fsi is needed to simulate the correlation

cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders the details of these cylinders are as follows 1 the sandwich cylinder is made up of 30crmnsia steel s core and outer and inner tungsten carbide w layers the outer diameter is 0 306m and the inner diameter is 0 266m the thicknesses of outer and inner w layers are both 0 004m for simplicity the sandwich cylinder is marked as w s w cylinder 2 each bi layer cylinder is made up of outer w layer and inner s layer the outer diameter and the thickness of outer w layer of each bi layer cylinder are the same as those of w s w cylinder the inner diameters of the two bi layer cylinders are respectively 0 266m and 0 258m for simplicity the bi layer cylinder with the same inner diameter as w s w cylinder is marked as w s1 cylinder and the other bi layer cylinder is marked as w s2 cylinder 3 each monolithic cylinder is made of s the outer diameter of each monolithic cylinder is the same as that of w s w cylinder the inner diameters of two monolithic cylinders are respectively 0 266m and 0 249m for simplicity the monolithic cylinder with the same inner diameter as w s w cylinder is marked as s1 cylinder while the other monolithic cylinder is marked as s2 cylinder in collision problem mass is an important physical parameter the mass of a cylinder is given by 47 m c π j 1 n l ρ s j r o j 2 r i j 2 where m c denotes the mass of a cylinder n l denotes the number of layers ρ s j denotes the density of layer j r o j denotes the outer radius of layer j and r i j denotes the inner radius of layer j according to equation 47 the masses of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder s1 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively 193 kg 167 kg 193 kg 139 kg and 193 kg these cylinders are divided into two groups 1 cylinders with the same wall thickness such as w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder 2 cylinders with the same mass such as w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder for these five cylinders colliding with water two types of initial conditions are given by table 1 the same initial velocity v and the same initial kinetic energy k e in general the impact performances of structures during water entry at the same initial velocity are more concerned however when the masses of the structures vary greatly e g cylinders in the first group it may be an effective supplement to study the impact performance of structures during water entry at the same initial kinetic energy the moment at which the cylinders begin to collide with water is defined as initial time as shown in fig 5 the cylinders fall vertically with an initial velocity given by table 1 the scale of water domain is 1 m 0 5 m the water domain is stationary at the initial moment the top edge of the water domain is free and the side and bottom edges of water domain are fixed next is the discretization of the continuum each elastic body is discretized into finite element model zhan et al 2016 advise that the maximum element size should be less than a quarter of the elastic wave length that is 48 max l e 1 4 min λ p λ s 1 4 min c p f n c s f n where l e denotes the element size and λ denotes the elastic wave length through modal analysis the first order natural frequencies of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder s1 cylinder and s2 cylinder are 865hz 723hz 887hz 646hz and 971hz respectively according to equations 4 5 8 and 9 and table 5 the velocities of p wave and s wave of the material w are respectively 6841 m s and 4253 m s and the velocities of p wave and s wave of the material s are respectively 5982 m s and 3197 m s according to equation 48 the elastic wave lengths in every cylinder are solved as listed in table 2 for convenience all five cylinders are discretized by uniform structural meshes and have the same element size the minimum elastic wave in table 2 is 3 295m a quarter of which is 0 8245m much larger than the scale of the cylinders it means that the element size of the cylinders always meets equation 48 in this case the analysis of mesh convergence is particularly important for the cylinders with small scales through the convergence analysis the element size of the cylinders is 0 002m the convergence analysis is detailed in section 3 2 2 at present there is no clear discussion about the relationship between particle spacing of water and element size of solid according to the literatures monaghan and kajtar 2009 and monaghan and rafiee 2013 when the particle spacing of fluid is one to three times that of solid the numerical results do not differ significantly in this paper the particle spacing of water is 0 004m which is twice the element size of cylinders the sph fem models corresponding to fig 5 are shown in fig 6 which displays only partial sph fem models since the element size and particle spacing are much smaller than the scales of the cylinders and the water domain 3 2 2 convergence of meshes and particles the convergence of meshes and particles is analyzed by taking the water entry of w s w cylinder at the initial velocity of 30 m s as an example based on the model of w s w cylinder colliding with water in section 3 2 1 named as ordinary model two new models of w s w cylinder entering water are established a fine model and a rough model uniform structural meshes and equidistant particles are used in the ordinary model fine model and rough model the numbers of elements and particles of these three models are given by table 3 it may be deduced from tables 2 and 3 that the element sizes of these three models are all less than a quarter of the elastic wave length meeting the requirements of elastic wavelength advised by zhan et al 2016 this study includes three basic elements structure fluid and fluid structure interaction accordingly the convergence of the meshes and particles is studied from three aspects the dynamic response of the structure see figs 7 10 the internal energy of the fluid see fig 11 and the contact pressure between the fluid and the structure see fig 12 in figs 7 9 stresses of different layers are investigated because they vary greatly however in fig 10 only the deformation of the whole cylinder is investigated since the deformations of different layers are consistent detailed in section 4 2 3 the peak values of these curves are given by table 4 where the subscript p denotes the peak value from figs 7 12 and table 4 it may be seen that 1 all time history curves of the ordinary model are in good agreement with those of the fine model but are quite different from those of the rough model 2 the peak values of all time history curves of the ordinary model are equal or approximately equal to those of the fine model but are quite different from those of the rough model it indicates that the numerical results of the ordinary model agree well with those of the fine model therefore the meshes and particles of the ordinary model used in this paper are convergent 3 3 material parameters according to the fundamental equations for water in section 3 1 1 the material parameters of water mainly include ρ 0 c s s s and γ based on the literature iyama et al 2004 the values of these parameters are as follows ρ 0 equals 1000 kg m3 c s equals 1650 m s s s equals 1 92 and γ equals 0 1 according to the fundamental equations for elastic body in section 3 1 2 the material parameters of an elastic body mainly include ρ λ and g among them the parameters λ and g are derived from e and μ see equations 4 and 5 respectively in addition for an elastic body the yield limit y is often used as a criterion for evaluating strength failure therefore the material parameters of an elastic body mainly include ρ e μ and y the parameters of 30crmnsia steel s and tungsten carbide w used in this paper are given by table 5 editorial board of the ai 1997 dunn and bundy 1978 paul day and ruoff 1973 for the convenience of mechanism analysis see section 4 2 the specific acoustic impedances z p of each material are given in table 5 as well literatures editorial board of the ai 1997 and dunn and bundy 1978 provide stress strain curves of materials s and w respectively as shown in figs 13 and 14 in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 only a multilinear model based on test data is presented but no smooth fitting curve is given in addition the stress strain curve of material w given in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 has a strain range of 0 10 and a stress range of 0 14000 mpa considering the ranges of strain and stress of material s only one interval of the stress strain curve of material w in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 is intercepted here that is the strain range is 0 1 and the corresponding stress range is 0 5200 mpa 3 4 validation the reliability of sph fem for solving the water entry problem of an elastic cylinder is validated by a test in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 the test specimen is an aluminium alloy cylinder shell with a diameter of 0 306m a thickness of 0 003m and a length of 0 6m for simplicity the aluminium alloy cylinder shell is named as test cylinder the material parameters are as follows ρ equals 2700 kg m3 e equals 73 50 gpa and μ equals 0 34 the test cylinder is suspended horizontally above the water with its lowest point 1m above the water surface after being released the test cylinder hits the water in free fall the strain at the bottom of the inner surface is investigated numerical study is carried out for the above experiment the outer diameter of the test cylinder is the same as that of w s w cylinder and its thickness is approximately equal to that of the outer layer of w s w cylinder therefore the number of elements of the test cylinder is the same as that of the outer layer of w s w cylinder in radial and circumferential directions the scale of water domain particle spacing and boundary conditions are all the same as those of the numerical models in section 3 2 1 the moment at which the test cylinder begins to collide with water is defined as initial time therefore the initial velocity is given by 49 v t 2 g h t where v t denotes the initial velocity of test cylinder g denotes the gravitational acceleration and h t denotes the distance between the water surface and the lowest point of test cylinder before it is released according to equation 49 it is solved that v t 4 429 m s the comparison between sph fem result and test result is given by fig 15 in addition the numerical result in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 is shown in fig 15 as well the peaks of these curves are given in table 6 where e r denotes the relative error between the numerical result and the test result from fig 15 and table 6 it may be seen that 1 the overall trends of the three strain curves are similar 2 the peak value of the sph fem curve is closer to that of the test curve than that of the numerical curve in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 3 the relative error between the peak of sph fem curve and that of test curve is 5 obviously smaller than the relative error between the peak of numerical curve and that of test curve in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 it indicates that the sph fem algorithm is reliable for the problem of elastic cylinder entering water 4 results and discussions 4 1 stress levels and distributions the time history curves of stresses of the five cylinders are shown in figs 16 20 where ini 1 denotes the first initial condition and ini 2 denotes the second initial condition for simplicity the stresses of materials s and w are named as s stress and w stress respectively from these figures it may be seen that 1 the w stress of every multi layer cylinder is greater than its s stress but for different kinds of multilayer cylinders the multiple of w stress relative to s stress varies greatly the w stress of the sandwich cylinder is about 5 times its s stress while the w stresses of the bi layer cylinders are less than 2 times their s stresses 2 according to table 5 the yield stress of material w is about 6 times that of material s greater than the multiple of w stress relative to s stress therefore the stress levels of the multi layer cylinders depends on their s stresses and the yield limit of material s see equations 29 and 30 3 the s stress of w s w cylinder is about 60 mpa far less than that of the bi layer cylinders and the monolithic cylinders under the same initial conditions 4 under the first and the second initial conditions the peak s stresses of w s1 cylinder are respectively about 210 mpa and 240 mpa less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions about 240 mpa and 320 mpa respectively 5 the peak s stress of w s2 cylinder is about 160 mpa greater than that of s2 cylinder about 130 mpa under the same conditions 6 the s stresses of the cylinders with the same mass as w s w cylinder are less than those of the cylinders with the same wall thickness as w s w cylinder under the same initial conditions according to equation 30 the stress levels of the five cylinders are shown in fig 21 considering the importance of peaks in engineering applications the peak stresses and peak stress levels of the cylinders are given by table 7 where σ p denotes the peak stress the subscripts s w o and w i denote s layer outer w layer and inner w layer respectively and s l p denotes the peak stress level from fig 21 and table 7 it may be seen that 1 the peak stress level of w s w cylinder is about 7 significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions 2 under the first and the second initial conditions the peak stress levels of w s1 cylinder are respectively about 25 and 28 less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions about 28 and 38 respectively 3 the peak stress level of w s2 cylinder is about 19 greater than that of s2 cylinder about 15 4 the stress levels of the cylinders with the same mass as w s w cylinder is less than those of the cylinders with the same wall thickness as w s w cylinder under the same initial conditions above analysis shows that under the same initial conditions the sandwich cylinder always has a much lower stress level than the bi layer cylinders and monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness or the same mass the bi layer cylinders have lower stress levels than the monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness but have higher stress levels than the monolithic cylinders with the same mass as a result the stress control function of the sandwich cylinder is always good in contrast the stress control functions of the bi layer cylinders are unstable and heavily depend on the wall thickness and mass in addition to the time history regularity the stress distribution is also usually concerned in engineering application for simplicity the moment at which the peak stress level appears is named as peak time the stress contours of the five cylinders at peak time are shown in figs 22 26 from these figures it may be seen that 1 the large stresses of w s w cylinder occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer and inner w layers while the stress of the s core is generally small 2 the large stresses of w s1 cylinder mainly occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer w layer meanwhile the stresses at the bottom sides and top of the inner surface of inner s layer are large as well 3 the large stresses of s1 cylinder occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer and inner surfaces 4 the stress distributions of w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively similar to those of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder respectively furthermore the stress control characteristics of the w s w cylinder may also be seen intuitively from the stress contours the large stresses are isolated to the inner and outer w layers with a high yield limit see table 5 thus leaving the s core in a low stress state this advantage of w s w cylinder is not possessed by other cylinders if the bi layer layout is adopted the large stresses on the inner surface of material s may not be effectively controlled if a monolithic layout is adopted the large stresses on the inner and outer surface of material s may not be effectively controlled 4 2 mechanism analysis of stress control the stress level of a structure colliding with water is positively correlated with the impact pressure and inversely correlated with the inherent strength the inherent strength is related to material parameters wave frequency stiffness and material layout detailed in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 the material parameters have been given by table 5 next the mechanism of stress control is analyzed from the aspect of impact pressure wave frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength 4 2 1 impact pressures the collision between an elastic body and water is a kind of contact problem according to contact mechanics johnson 1985 the mean contact pressure is an important factor related to the stress and deformation essentially the water impact pressure is the contact pressure of water acting on the elastic body referring to the method of contact mechanics the mean impact pressure is investigated here as shown in fig 27 it may be seen from fig 27 that 1 at the initial velocity of 30 m s the impact pressure curves of the five cylinders are basically consistent and the peak impact pressures are all about 15 mpa 2 at the initial kinetic energy of 86 75 kj the peak impact pressures of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder are respectively 18 mpa and 19 mpa obviously greater than those of other cylinders still about 15 mpa for the same cylinder the greater the impact pressure the higher the stress level thus the stress level of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder under the second initial condition are higher than their stress levels under the first initial condition this regularity seems obvious however the underlying reasons for the difference in stress levels of the cylinders under the same or similar impact pressure ini 1 are still unknown 4 2 2 wave frequencies generally speaking impact load is a kind of attenuating load with a wide frequency range therefore the first order mode of a structure is most easily excited when it is subjected to an impact load ward and lammenspaul 1998 in this case the wave frequency is equal to the first order natural frequency of the structure essentially speaking water impact pressure is also a kind of impact load taking w s w cylinder as an example the frequency domain characteristics of impact pressure is obtained by fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 28 where p f fft f t from fig 28 it may be seen that the impact pressure is characterized by attenuation over a wide frequency range therefore the first order mode of the structure is most easily excited based on the characteristics of the impact pressure the wave frequency in a cylinder during water entry is equal to the first order natural frequency through modal analysis the first order natural frequencies f n of the five cylinders are listed in table 8 4 2 3 deformations and stiffnesses time history curves of deformations of the five cylinders are shown in fig 29 it may be seen from fig 29 that 1 the peak deformation of w s w cylinder is about 0 32 mm approximately equal to that of w s2 cylinder and larger than that of s2 cylinder about 0 28 mm under the same initial conditions 2 the peak deformations of w s1 cylinder under the first and second initial conditions are about 0 48 mm and 0 6 mm respectively less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 0 7 mm and 0 9 mm respectively according to the mechanics of materials de silva 2014 stiffness is the ability of a structure to resist deformation thus the stiffness s t f of a cylinder subjected to impact pressure may be expressed as 50 s t f p p δ p according to equation 50 under the same impact pressure the smaller the deformation the greater its stiffness it has been seen from fig 27 that the impact pressures acting on the five cylinders are approximately the same under the first initial condition in this case the peak deformations of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are 0 32 mm 0 48 mm 0 7 mm 0 32 mm and 0 28 mm respectively therefore the stiffness of s2 cylinder is the largest the stiffnesses of w s w cylinder and w s2 cylinder are the same and lower than that of s2 cylinder the stiffness of w s1 cylinder is lower than that of the first three cylinders and the stiffness of s1 cylinder is the lowest in the theoretical derivation of part 2 a basic hypothesis is put forward that is the deformations of different layers of the same cylinder are consistent here w s w cylinder and w s1 cylinder at the initial velocity of 30 m s are taken as examples to illustrate the deformation consistency of different layers of a multi layer cylinder under the first initial condition the time history curves of deformations of all layers of w s w cylinder and w s1 cylinder are respectively shown in figs 30 and 31 it may be seen from figs 30 and 31 that the deformation curves of different layers of the same cylinder are coincident it indicates that the hypothesis of the deformation consistency of different layers of a multi layer cylinder is reasonable 4 2 4 influence of material layout in section 2 2 it has been found that the stress is mainly affected by the wave frequency f specific acoustic impedance z p deformation δ and material layout k except for k the other three parameters have been clarified in the previous parts according to equation 28 the parameter k is given by 51 k ln σ v o n f n z p δ 1 78 based on the results of stress natural frequency and deformation the parameter k of each layer of every cylinder is given by table 9 it may be seen from table 9 that except for the negative k value of the core of w s w cylinder the k values of all layers of the cylinders are positive indicating that there is an essential difference between the layer without independent boundary and the layer with independent boundary next taking the s stresses of the cylinders as examples the influence of material layout on stress is compared with that of deformation and natural frequency the parameters σ f n δ and e k s are nondimensionalized as follows 52 n σ σ p σ p w s w n f f n f n w s w n δ δ p δ p w s w n e x p k e k e k w s w where n denotes the dimensionless operator and the subscript w s w indicates that the physical quantity belongs to w s w cylinder the four expressions in equation 52 meet the following relationship 53 n σ n f n δ n e x p k for simplicity w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively marked as 1 2 3 4 and 5 the comparison of n σ n f n δ and n e x p k of the five cylinders is given by fig 32 it may be seen from fig 32 that the influence of n e x p k on n σ is the greatest the influence of n f on n σ is the least and the influence of n δ on n σ is between the former two it indicates that the influence of material layout on stress is greater than that of natural frequency and deformation according to the studies and discussions above the natural frequency and deformation of w s w cylinder are moderate however its s stress is significantly less than that of other cylinders attributing to its special material layout 4 2 5 stresses and inherent strengths of layers based on the discussions above the wave frequency and deformation of all layers of a multilayer cylinder are the same according to equation 28 the multiple of w stress relative to s stress is given by 54 ς w s σ v o n w σ v o n s z p w z p s e k w k s 2 26 e k w k s where the subscript w and s denote materials w and s respectively according to the mechanics of materials de silva 2014 strength is the ability of a structure to resist stress failure thus the strength of a layer of a multilayer cylinder subjected to impact pressure may be expressed as 55 s t r i p p s l i p p y i σ p i where s t r i denotes the inherent strength of layer i σ p i denotes peak stress of layer i and y i denotes the yield stress of the material of layer i substituting equations 28 and 50 into equation 55 gives 56 s t r i 0 17 s t f f n y i e k i z p i for a multilayer cylinder the multiple of the inherent strength of w layer relative to that of s layer is given by 57 γ w s s t r w s t r s y w y s σ v o n s σ v o n w y w y s z p s z p w e k s k w 2 65 e k s k w from equations 54 and 57 it may be seen that for a multilayer cylinder the relationship between the stresses of different layers and the relationship between the inherent strengths of different layers mainly depend on the material parameters and material layout the parameters ς w s and γ w s are solved by substituting k s and k w into equations 54 and 57 as listed in table 10 it may be seen from table 10 that 1 the difference between w stress and s stress of w s w cylinder is much greater than that of w s1 cylinder and w s2 cylinder 2 the difference between inherent strengths of w layer and s layer of w s w cylinder is much less than that of w s1 cylinder and w s2 cylinder 3 for w s w cylinder the inherent strength of w layer is approximately equal to that of s layer indicating that the utilization efficiency of materials of w s w cylinder is very high above analysis shows that when materials are given the material layout has a great influence on the stresses and inherent strengths of layers of a multilayer cylinder 4 2 6 inherent strengths of cylinders the inherent strength of the whole structure depends on the weakest part that is 58 s t r min 1 i n l s t r i 0 17 s t f f n min 1 i n l y i e k i z p i where s t r denotes the inherent strength of the whole structure it has been proved that for the same cylinder the inherent strength of w layer is higher than that of s layer thus equation 58 may be simplified as 59 s t r s t r s 0 17 s t f f n y s e k s z p s 3 s t f f n e k s equation 59 shows that when the materials are given the inherent strengths of the five cylinders depends on the stiffnesses natural frequencies and material layouts 1 the inherent strength is proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to natural frequency 2 the cylinder tends to have a higher strength if the s layer has no independent boundary for a further discussion the parameters s t r s t f 1 f n and e k s are nondimensionalized as follows 60 n s t r s t r s t r w s w n s t f s t f s t f w s w n 1 f f n 1 f n 1 w s w n 1 e x p k e k s e k s w s w the four expressions in equation 60 meet the following relationship 61 n s t r n s t f n 1 f n 1 e x p k the comparison of n s t r n s t f n 1 f and n 1 e x p k of the five cylinders is shown in fig 33 where the serial numbers 1 2 3 4 and 5 denote w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder respectively from fig 33 it may be seen that 1 the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is obviously greater than that of other four cylinders 2 the influence of material layout on the inherent strength of cylinders is the greatest the influence of natural frequency on the inherent strength of cylinders is the least and the influence of stiffness on the inherent strength of cylinders is between the former two among the five cylinders the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are moderate but its inherent strength is significantly higher than that of other cylinders attributing to its unique material layout the core has no independent boundary thus significantly reducing the s stress the discussions in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 fundamentally reveal the reason why the stress level of w s w cylinder is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions 4 3 relationship between stress and velocity fig 33 has shown that the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is significantly greater than that of other cylinders it means that w s w cylinder may withstand a higher water entry velocity than other cylinders the peak stress levels of the five cylinders at different initial velocities are obtained by numerical simulation based on sph fem as shown in fig 34 the s l v curve of every cylinder ends at s l 100 because s l 100 means that the structure will experience yield from fig 34 it may be seen that at the same initial velocities the stress level of w s w cylinder is significantly lower than that of other cylinders it indicates that w s w cylinder has a good stress control function at different initial velocities in contrast the stress levels of bi layer cylinders are lower than those of monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness but higher than those of monolithic cylinders with the same mass therefore the stress control function of bi layer cylinders is not stable the s l v curves may be fitted by the following function 62 s l a v 2 b v c where the parameters a b and c are fit coefficients which are given by table 11 it may be solved from s l 100 that the limit velocities of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder colliding with water are about 148 m s 75 m s 64 m s 84 m s and 100 m s respectively 4 4 other mechanical properties the previous discussions have covered stress impact pressure natural frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength in this section two other important mechanical properties will be discussed namely impact acceleration and vibration acceleration the impact acceleration refers to the acceleration of the elastic body as a whole and the vibration acceleration refers to the acceleration of a particle relative to its equilibrium position the time history curves of impact accelerations of the five cylinders are shown in fig 35 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration it may be seen from fig 35 that 1 under the same initial condition the impact acceleration curves of w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are roughly coincident and the peak impact accelerations of these three cylinders are all about 420g 2 under the first and second initial conditions the peak impact accelerations of w s1 cylinder are respectively 480g and 550g obviously less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 570g and 800g respectively next is the vibration accelerations of the cylinders in engineering applications the magnitude of vibration is usually measured by the vibration acceleration level which is given by 63 a l 20 log a v a 0 where a l denotes the vibration acceleration level a v denotes the vibration acceleration and a 0 denotes the reference acceleration in general a 0 takes the value of 1 10 6 m s2 the time history curves of vibration acceleration levels of the cylinders are shown in fig 36 it may be seen from fig 36 that 1 under the same initial conditions the peak vibration acceleration levels of w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are all approximately equal to 193 db except that the vibration acceleration level curve of w s w cylinder is attenuated more slowly 2 under the first and second initial conditions the peak vibration acceleration levels of w s1 cylinder are respectively 194 db and 196 db obviously less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 197 db and 199 db respectively the above analysis indicates that under the same initial conditions the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder are not greater than those of the bi layer cylinders and monolithic cylinders with the same equal wall thickness or the same equal mass 4 5 comprehensive comparisons the above discussions show that the mechanical properties of a cylinder are interrelated the basic logics are as follows 1 the stress level of a cylinder depends on the impact pressure and the inherent strength 2 the inherent strength depends on the material parameters material layouts stiffness and natural frequency 3 the limit velocity of a cylinder colliding with water is positively correlated with the inherent strength in addition as a supplementary study the impact accelerations and vibration acceleration levels are discussed as well the comprehensive comparisons of above mechanical properties of the five cylinders is given in table 12 where t w denotes the wall thickness m denotes the mass v l denotes the limit velocity and other symbols have been mentioned above the explanations for table 12 are as follows 1 at the initial velocity of 30 m s the five cylinders have the same load condition which may be used to judge the inherent strengths and stiffnesses of the cylinders the lower the stress level the higher the inherent strength of the cylinder the smaller the deformation the greater the stiffness of the cylinder from this perspective the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is much higher than that of other cylinders while its stiffness is moderate 2 essentially the inherent strength of a cylinder is determined by a combination of material parameters material layout stiffness and natural frequency detailed in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 the inherent frequency is proportional to the stiffness and inversely proportional to the natural frequency according to table 12 the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are not dominant however the influence factor of material layout of w s w cylinder i e e k s is significantly greater than that of other cylinders so its inherent strength is significantly greater than that of other cylinders 3 under the same inherent strength conditions the greater the impact pressure the higher the stress level of the cylinder thus the stress level of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder at the initial kinetic energy of 86 75 kj is higher than their stress levels at the initial velocity of 30 m s 4 the higher the inherent strength of a cylinder the greater the limit velocity it may withstand the limit velocity of w s w cylinder is significantly greater than that of other cylinders attributing to its highest inherent strength 5 under the same initial conditions the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder is the same as those of the bi layer cylinder and monolithic cylinder with the same mass and lower than those of the bi layer cylinder and monolithic cylinder with the same wall thickness 5 conclusions this paper studies stress control of cylinders during water entry firstly the influence factors on dynamic stress are investigated by analytical method on this basis a sandwich scheme which is expected to reduce the stress level of the cylinder is proposed next the stress levels of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are studied by sph fem method and the mechanism of stress control is analyzed from the aspects of impact pressure natural frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength in addition the limit velocities impact accelerations and vibration acceleration levels of the cylinders are investigated as well it is found that the stress levels of cylinders depend on the impact pressures and inherent strengths at the same initial velocity the impact pressures acting on the five cylinders are approximately equal and the differences of their stress levels mainly depend on the differences of their inherent strengths the inherent strength of a cylinder is related to material parameters material layout stiffness and natural frequency when the material parameters are given the influence of material layout on the inherent strength is greater than that of stiffness and natural frequency the stiffness of w s w cylinder is equal to that of w s2 cylinder less than that of s2 cylinder and greater than that of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder the natural frequency of w s w cylinder is lower than that of w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder and higher than that of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder therefore the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are not dominant however due to the unique material layout the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is significantly higher than that of other cylinders and its stress level is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions correspondingly the limit velocity of w s w cylinder colliding with water is much higher than that of other cylinders in addition the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder is not greater than those of other cylinders under the same initial conditions therefore the sandwich scheme for stress control advised by this paper can be used to improve the inherent strength of the cylinder thus reducing the stress level of the cylinder colliding with water and improving the limit velocity entering water this technology may solve the problem of stress failure of cylindrical structures during water entry credit

21601,this paper is devoted to stress control of cylinders during water entry based on the characteristics of bi material interfaces firstly the influence factors on dynamic stress are studied from the view of elastic mechanics and wave mechanics it is found that the dynamic stress depends on the material parameters material layout natural frequency and deformation on this basis a sandwich scheme is proposed to reduce the stress level of the cylinder entering water then a sandwich cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders during water entry are investigated by coupling of smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and finite element method fem it is found that when the material parameters are given the deformation and natural frequency of the sandwich cylinder are moderate but its stress level is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions attributing to its unique material layout accordingly the limit velocity of the sandwich cylinder colliding with water is much higher than that of other cylinders therefore the stress control scheme is expected to reduce the possibility of strength failure of cylindrical structure during water entry keywords stress control cylinder water entry bi material interfaces 1 introduction in marine engineering the cylinder is a typical structural form such as the shell of submarine and autonomous underwater vehicle auv and the supporting part of some offshore platforms therefore the researches on the interaction between cylinder and water have important engineering significances the water entry of cylinder is an important type of interaction between cylinder and water analytical studies are of great significance to reveal the mechanism of the impact on the structure during water entry the pioneers of analytical research on water entry problems include von karman and wagner who present the von karman model von karman 1929 and wagner model wagner 1932 respectively having a profound impact on the researches in this field on this basis cointe et al and korobkin make a research on the impact force on a rigid cylinder during water entry by using analytical method cointe and armand 1987 alexander 2004 nuffel et al study in detail the conditions under which wagner theory is applicable to cylindrical horizontal water entry van nuffel et al 2014 in general there are few literatures on the water entry of cylinder by analytical method since some complicated working conditions are difficult to be analyzed such as considering the attitude of cylinder and the scale of water domain moreover these literatures mainly focus on impact force and pressure acting on a rigid body during water entry but rarely involves the dynamic responses of an elastic body such as stress deformation vibration acceleration etc in contrast more literatures study the water entry problems of cylinders by using numerical method which is suitable not only for simple structures in ideal cases but also for complex structures in complex cases in the field of hydrodynamics of water entry common numerical methods include finite volume method fvm volume of fluid

water impact motion features cavity characteristics etc among them the studies on water impact have important enlightening significance to this paper since the impact pressure is the inducement of dynamic response such as stress and so on next are the literatures on water entry of elastic bodies by numerical methods at present the numerical methods used for water entry of elastic body mainly

strain stress deformation etc which are important physical quantities investigated in this paper as well among them the literatures hassoon et al 2018 and zhang et al 2020 discuss the effect of structural stiffness which is of some enlightening significances for this paper in addition the application of sph fem in water entry of composite wedge in the literature panciroli et al 2012 has some enlightening significances to this paper as well in addition to above numerical researches some important experimental studies on hydrodynamics of water entry are also worthy of attention truscott et

shams et al 2017 barjastehhamid and javaherian 2016 zong et al test the pressures and accelerations of trimaran ship section during water entry zong et al 2020 carcaterra et al make a research on the spectral responses of elastic wedge impacting water based on the combination of experiments and theories carcaterra and ciappi 2004 arai et al test the strain of a cylindrical shell during water entry arai and miyauchi 1998 these experimental studies focus on two aspects one is the physical characteristics of the cavity and the other is the force pressure strain deformation acceleration and so on among them the experimental model of the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 is similar to that of this paper so it is used in this paper to verify the reliability of the numerical algorithm at present the development of human marine activities puts higher demands on the performance of underwater equipment the cylindrical shell is one of the typical structures of underwater equipment generally the equipment is always carried smoothly into the water by a hanger however in some remote sea areas in harsh conditions the equipment may be sent into the water by airdrop this requires a high strength cylindrical shell to avoid stress failure during water entry in order to reduce the stress level of the cylindrical shell colliding with water a stress control scheme based on the characteristics of bi material interface is advised by this paper in part 2 the basic principles of stress control are analyzed from the point of view of wave mechanics and elastic mechanics in part 3 the sph fem models of a sandwich cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders are established in part 4 the numerical results and the mechanism of stress control are analyzed the same studies have not been covered by other existing literatures 2 basic principles a sandwich cylinder is taken as an example to illustrate the basic principles of stress control based on the characteristics of bi material interfaces the water entry of a sandwich cylinder is shown in fig 1 it may be abstracted into a mechanical model subjected to an impact pressure as shown in fig 2 2 1 stress propagating at interface under the action of impact pressure elastic waves are generated in the structure the incident waves will be reflected and transmitted at the bi material interface elastic waves include compressional dilatational wave p wave and shear wave s wave for simplicity the elastic waves are assumed to be perpendicular to the bi material interface as shown in fig 3 where i denotes the incident wave r denotes the reflected wave and t denotes the transmitted wave the derivation in this section refers to the literatures knott 1899 zoeppritz 1919 macelwane and sohon 1936 to some extent an ideal 2d problem is investigated here the displacement of a particle relative to its equilibrium position is given by 1 u u x t v v x t where x denotes the direction of the wave propagation t denotes the time u denotes the displacement of a particle in the p wave and v denotes the displacement of a particle in the s wave the strain displacement equations are given by 2 ε x u x ε y v y γ x y v x u y where ε denotes the normal strain and γ denotes the shear strain the constitutive equations are given by 3 σ x λ ε x ε y 2 g ε x σ y λ ε x ε y 2 g ε y τ x y g γ x y where σ denotes the normal stress τ denotes the shear stress λ denotes the first lame constant and g denotes the shear modulus the lame constant λ and shear modulus g are respectively given by 4 λ μ e 1 μ 1 2 μ and 5 g e 2 1 μ where e denotes the young modulus and μ denotes the poisson s ratio substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3 gives 6 σ x λ 2 g u x σ y λ u x τ x y g v x according to wave mechanics the particle displacement satisfies the following relationship 7 u x i 1 n ω c p u v x i 1 n ω c s v where ω denotes the angular frequency c p denotes the velocity of p wave c s denotes the velocity of s wave and n equals 1 for the incident and transmitted waves and equals 0 for the reflected wave the velocities of p wave and s wave are respectively given by 8 c p λ 2 g ρ and 9 c s g ρ where ρ denotes the density drawing on the acoustics the concept of specific acoustic impedance is introduced here 10 z p ρ c p and 11 z s ρ c s where z denotes the specific acoustic impedance it is derived from equations 4 and 5 and 8 11 that 12 z s z p c s c p 1 2 μ 2 1 μ substituting equation 7 into equation 6 gives 13 σ x i 1 n 2 π f z p u σ y i 1 n 2 π f 1 2 1 μ z p u τ x y i 1 n 2 π f z s v where f ω 2 π denotes the wave frequency the continuity condition of displacement at the bi material interface is given by 14 u i u r u t v i v r v t from the first two expressions of equation 13 it may be derived that 15 σ x 2 1 μ σ y it may be seen from equation 15 that when poisson s ratios of the two materials are equal σ x and σ y are continuous at the interface otherwise only one of σ x and σ y is continuous at the interface according to the propagation direction of the wave σ x is generally considered to be continuous therefore the continuity condition of stress at the bi material may be expressed as 16 σ x i σ x r σ x t τ x y i τ x y r τ x y t substituting the first and the third expressions of equation 13 into equation 16 gives 17 u i u r z p 2 z p 1 u t v i v r z s 2 z s 1 v t simultaneous solution of equations 14 and 17 gives 18 u t 2 z p 1 z p 1 z p 2 u i v t 2 z s 1 z s 1 z s 2 v i substituting equation 18 into equation 13 gives 19 σ x t 2 z p 2 z p 1 z p 2 σ x i σ y t 1 μ 1 1 μ 2 2 z p 2 z p 1 z p 2 σ y i τ x y t 2 z s 2 z s 1 z s 2 τ x y i equation 19 describes the regularity of stress propagation at a bi material interface it indicates that the relationship between the incident stress and transmitted stress depends on the relationships of specific acoustic impedances and poisson s ratios of the two materials generally speaking the poisson s ratio of common engineering materials varies in a small range so its influence on stress is limited if the influence of poisson s ratio is ignored the following basic conclusions may be drawn if the specific acoustic impedance of the transmitted material is greater than that of the incident material the transmitted stress is higher than the incident stress and vice versa 2 2 influence factors of stress next the influence factors of stress are further investigated the derivation in section 2 1 does not take into account the influence of boundary on stress in fact there is an interesting phenomenon in the field of mechanics that is large stresses generally appear at the boundaries of structures in the case of a 2d cylinder large stresses generally appear on the inner and outer surfaces in view of this equation 13 is modified as follows 20 σ x i 1 n 2 π f e k z p u σ y i 1 n 2 π f 1 2 1 μ e k z p u τ x y i 1 n 2 π f e k z s v where e denotes the natural constant and k is a parameter depends on the material layout if the material has an independent boundary different from the common interface with other materials k takes a positive value or else k equals a negative value detailed in section 4 2 4 in equation 20 the exponential function e k is used as a correction factor for the following reasons exponential functions have important applications in natural science for example the solar radiation decays exponentially along the water depth gamma rays decay exponentially along the thickness of the medium rayleigh waves decay exponentially along the depth of earth and so on therefore it is natural to think that the stress of a mechanical structure also decays exponentially from the surface to the interior in engineering applications von mises stress is often used to evaluate the strength failure of structures de silva 2014 for an ideal 2d model the von mises stress σ v o n is given by zhang et al 2020 21 σ v o n σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x σ y 3 τ x y 2 structural deformation δ is essentially the displacement of particles relative to their equilibrium positions assume that the deformation in x direction is ζ times that in y direction that is 22 u ζ v u 2 v 2 δ 2 it is solved from equation 22 that 23 u ζ 1 ζ 2 δ v 1 1 ζ 2 δ substituting equation 23 into equation 20 gives 24 σ x i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ ζ 1 ζ 2 σ y i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ ζ 1 ζ 2 1 2 1 μ τ x y i 1 n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 1 ζ 2 1 2 μ 2 1 μ substituting equation 24 into equation 21 gives 25 σ v o n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 1 ζ 2 1 2 1 μ 4 μ 2 6 μ 3 ζ 2 6 2 μ 2 3 μ 1 the parameter μ mainly affects the second and the third expressions of equation 24 assume that the parameter μ takes the value of 0 245 which is the mean of poisson s ratios of 30crmnsia steel s and tungsten carbide w used in this paper see table 5 the resulting relative error is no more than 7 for the second expression of equation 24 and no more than 9 for the third expression of equation 24 thus equation 25 is simplified as 26 σ v o n 2 π f e k z p δ 1 0 77 ζ 2 1 ζ 2 next determine the effect of parameter ζ on σ v o n the following function is constructed 27 η ζ 1 0 77 ζ 2 1 ζ 2 the curve of η ζ is shown in fig 4 from which it may be seen that the range of η ζ is 0 88 1 therefore the effect of ζ on von mises stress is small if the median of value range is taken as the value of η ζ i e η ζ 0 94 the resulting error may not exceed 7 then equation 26 may be simplified as 28 σ v o n 5 91 f z p δ e k according to equation 28 it may be seen that the stress mainly depends on wave frequency f material layout k specific acoustic impedance z p and deformation δ for a structure subjected to an impact pressure the wave frequency f refers to the first order natural frequency f n see section 4 2 2 2 3 sandwich scheme for stress control for many structures strength failure depends on stress and yield limit y the closer the stress approaches the yield limit the more likely strength failure occurs therefore the concept of stress level of a multilayer structure is introduced here 29 s l i σ v o n i y i 100 and 30 s l max 1 i n l s l i max 1 i n l σ v o n i y i 100 where s l i denotes the stress level of layer i s l denotes the stress level of the whole structure σ v o n i denotes the von mises stress of layer i y i denotes the yield limit of material of layer i and n l denotes the number of layers the sandwich structure is a classical form in engineering field generally speaking the core is made of ordinary material and the inner and outer layers are made of special functional material according to the purpose of this study it is assumed that the inner and outer layers are made of materials with very high yield limits so that the stress level of the whole structure is determined by the material of core at the same time the specific acoustic impedance of the inner and outer materials is obviously greater than that of the core materials which weakens the propagation of stress to the core see equation 19 in section 2 1 moreover the amplification effect of the boundary on the stress of core material is eliminated since the core has no independent boundary detailed in section 4 2 6 in a word the inner and outer layers of the sandwich have the ability to isolate and withstand large stresses thus significantly reducing the stress of the core and the stress level of the whole structure this is the basic principle of the sandwich scheme for stress control 3 numerical models 3 1 sph fem method the research objects of this paper include water and elastic cylinders which are simulated by smoothed

cylinder two bi layer cylinders and two monolithic cylinders the details of these cylinders are as follows 1 the sandwich cylinder is made up of 30crmnsia steel s core and outer and inner tungsten carbide w layers the outer diameter is 0 306m and the inner diameter is 0 266m the thicknesses of outer and inner w layers are both 0 004m for simplicity the sandwich cylinder is marked as w s w cylinder 2 each bi layer cylinder is made up of outer w layer and inner s layer the outer diameter and the thickness of outer w layer of each bi layer cylinder are the same as those of w s w cylinder the inner diameters of the two bi layer cylinders are respectively 0 266m and 0 258m for simplicity the bi layer cylinder with the same inner diameter as w s w cylinder is marked as w s1 cylinder and the other bi layer cylinder is marked as w s2 cylinder 3 each monolithic cylinder is made of s the outer diameter of each monolithic cylinder is the same as that of w s w cylinder the inner diameters of two monolithic cylinders are respectively 0 266m and 0 249m for simplicity the monolithic cylinder with the same inner diameter as w s w cylinder is marked as s1 cylinder while the other monolithic cylinder is marked as s2 cylinder in collision problem mass is an important physical parameter the mass of a cylinder is given by 47 m c π j 1 n l ρ s j r o j 2 r i j 2 where m c denotes the mass of a cylinder n l denotes the number of layers ρ s j denotes the density of layer j r o j denotes the outer radius of layer j and r i j denotes the inner radius of layer j according to equation 47 the masses of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder s1 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively 193 kg 167 kg 193 kg 139 kg and 193 kg these cylinders are divided into two groups 1 cylinders with the same wall thickness such as w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder 2 cylinders with the same mass such as w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder for these five cylinders colliding with water two types of initial conditions are given by table 1 the same initial velocity v and the same initial kinetic energy k e in general the impact performances of structures during water entry at the same initial velocity are more concerned however when the masses of the structures vary greatly e g cylinders in the first group it may be an effective supplement to study the impact performance of structures during water entry at the same initial kinetic energy the moment at which the cylinders begin to collide with water is defined as initial time as shown in fig 5 the cylinders fall vertically with an initial velocity given by table 1 the scale of water domain is 1 m 0 5 m the water domain is stationary at the initial moment the top edge of the water domain is free and the side and bottom edges of water domain are fixed next is the discretization of the continuum each elastic body is discretized into finite element model zhan et al 2016 advise that the maximum element size should be less than a quarter of the elastic wave length that is 48 max l e 1 4 min λ p λ s 1 4 min c p f n c s f n where l e denotes the element size and λ denotes the elastic wave length through modal analysis the first order natural frequencies of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder s1 cylinder and s2 cylinder are 865hz 723hz 887hz 646hz and 971hz respectively according to equations 4 5 8 and 9 and table 5 the velocities of p wave and s wave of the material w are respectively 6841 m s and 4253 m s and the velocities of p wave and s wave of the material s are respectively 5982 m s and 3197 m s according to equation 48 the elastic wave lengths in every cylinder are solved as listed in table 2 for convenience all five cylinders are discretized by uniform structural meshes and have the same element size the minimum elastic wave in table 2 is 3 295m a quarter of which is 0 8245m much larger than the scale of the cylinders it means that the element size of the cylinders always meets equation 48 in this case the analysis of mesh convergence is particularly important for the cylinders with small scales through the convergence analysis the element size of the cylinders is 0 002m the convergence analysis is detailed in section 3 2 2 at present there is no clear discussion about the relationship between particle spacing of water and element size of solid according to the literatures monaghan and kajtar 2009 and monaghan and rafiee 2013 when the particle spacing of fluid is one to three times that of solid the numerical results do not differ significantly in this paper the particle spacing of water is 0 004m which is twice the element size of cylinders the sph fem models corresponding to fig 5 are shown in fig 6 which displays only partial sph fem models since the element size and particle spacing are much smaller than the scales of the cylinders and the water domain 3 2 2 convergence of meshes and particles the convergence of meshes and particles is analyzed by taking the water entry of w s w cylinder at the initial velocity of 30 m s as an example based on the model of w s w cylinder colliding with water in section 3 2 1 named as ordinary model two new models of w s w cylinder entering water are established a fine model and a rough model uniform structural meshes and equidistant particles are used in the ordinary model fine model and rough model the numbers of elements and particles of these three models are given by table 3 it may be deduced from tables 2 and 3 that the element sizes of these three models are all less than a quarter of the elastic wave length meeting the requirements of elastic wavelength advised by zhan et al 2016 this study includes three basic elements structure fluid and fluid structure interaction accordingly the convergence of the meshes and particles is studied from three aspects the dynamic response of the structure see figs 7 10 the internal energy of the fluid see fig 11 and the contact pressure between the fluid and the structure see fig 12 in figs 7 9 stresses of different layers are investigated because they vary greatly however in fig 10 only the deformation of the whole cylinder is investigated since the deformations of different layers are consistent detailed in section 4 2 3 the peak values of these curves are given by table 4 where the subscript p denotes the peak value from figs 7 12 and table 4 it may be seen that 1 all time history curves of the ordinary model are in good agreement with those of the fine model but are quite different from those of the rough model 2 the peak values of all time history curves of the ordinary model are equal or approximately equal to those of the fine model but are quite different from those of the rough model it indicates that the numerical results of the ordinary model agree well with those of the fine model therefore the meshes and particles of the ordinary model used in this paper are convergent 3 3 material parameters according to the fundamental equations for water in section 3 1 1 the material parameters of water mainly include ρ 0 c s s s and γ based on the literature iyama et al 2004 the values of these parameters are as follows ρ 0 equals 1000 kg m3 c s equals 1650 m s s s equals 1 92 and γ equals 0 1 according to the fundamental equations for elastic body in section 3 1 2 the material parameters of an elastic body mainly include ρ λ and g among them the parameters λ and g are derived from e and μ see equations 4 and 5 respectively in addition for an elastic body the yield limit y is often used as a criterion for evaluating strength failure therefore the material parameters of an elastic body mainly include ρ e μ and y the parameters of 30crmnsia steel s and tungsten carbide w used in this paper are given by table 5 editorial board of the ai 1997 dunn and bundy 1978 paul day and ruoff 1973 for the convenience of mechanism analysis see section 4 2 the specific acoustic impedances z p of each material are given in table 5 as well literatures editorial board of the ai 1997 and dunn and bundy 1978 provide stress strain curves of materials s and w respectively as shown in figs 13 and 14 in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 only a multilinear model based on test data is presented but no smooth fitting curve is given in addition the stress strain curve of material w given in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 has a strain range of 0 10 and a stress range of 0 14000 mpa considering the ranges of strain and stress of material s only one interval of the stress strain curve of material w in the literature dunn and bundy 1978 is intercepted here that is the strain range is 0 1 and the corresponding stress range is 0 5200 mpa 3 4 validation the reliability of sph fem for solving the water entry problem of an elastic cylinder is validated by a test in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 the test specimen is an aluminium alloy cylinder shell with a diameter of 0 306m a thickness of 0 003m and a length of 0 6m for simplicity the aluminium alloy cylinder shell is named as test cylinder the material parameters are as follows ρ equals 2700 kg m3 e equals 73 50 gpa and μ equals 0 34 the test cylinder is suspended horizontally above the water with its lowest point 1m above the water surface after being released the test cylinder hits the water in free fall the strain at the bottom of the inner surface is investigated numerical study is carried out for the above experiment the outer diameter of the test cylinder is the same as that of w s w cylinder and its thickness is approximately equal to that of the outer layer of w s w cylinder therefore the number of elements of the test cylinder is the same as that of the outer layer of w s w cylinder in radial and circumferential directions the scale of water domain particle spacing and boundary conditions are all the same as those of the numerical models in section 3 2 1 the moment at which the test cylinder begins to collide with water is defined as initial time therefore the initial velocity is given by 49 v t 2 g h t where v t denotes the initial velocity of test cylinder g denotes the gravitational acceleration and h t denotes the distance between the water surface and the lowest point of test cylinder before it is released according to equation 49 it is solved that v t 4 429 m s the comparison between sph fem result and test result is given by fig 15 in addition the numerical result in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 is shown in fig 15 as well the peaks of these curves are given in table 6 where e r denotes the relative error between the numerical result and the test result from fig 15 and table 6 it may be seen that 1 the overall trends of the three strain curves are similar 2 the peak value of the sph fem curve is closer to that of the test curve than that of the numerical curve in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 3 the relative error between the peak of sph fem curve and that of test curve is 5 obviously smaller than the relative error between the peak of numerical curve and that of test curve in the literature arai and miyauchi 1998 it indicates that the sph fem algorithm is reliable for the problem of elastic cylinder entering water 4 results and discussions 4 1 stress levels and distributions the time history curves of stresses of the five cylinders are shown in figs 16 20 where ini 1 denotes the first initial condition and ini 2 denotes the second initial condition for simplicity the stresses of materials s and w are named as s stress and w stress respectively from these figures it may be seen that 1 the w stress of every multi layer cylinder is greater than its s stress but for different kinds of multilayer cylinders the multiple of w stress relative to s stress varies greatly the w stress of the sandwich cylinder is about 5 times its s stress while the w stresses of the bi layer cylinders are less than 2 times their s stresses 2 according to table 5 the yield stress of material w is about 6 times that of material s greater than the multiple of w stress relative to s stress therefore the stress levels of the multi layer cylinders depends on their s stresses and the yield limit of material s see equations 29 and 30 3 the s stress of w s w cylinder is about 60 mpa far less than that of the bi layer cylinders and the monolithic cylinders under the same initial conditions 4 under the first and the second initial conditions the peak s stresses of w s1 cylinder are respectively about 210 mpa and 240 mpa less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions about 240 mpa and 320 mpa respectively 5 the peak s stress of w s2 cylinder is about 160 mpa greater than that of s2 cylinder about 130 mpa under the same conditions 6 the s stresses of the cylinders with the same mass as w s w cylinder are less than those of the cylinders with the same wall thickness as w s w cylinder under the same initial conditions according to equation 30 the stress levels of the five cylinders are shown in fig 21 considering the importance of peaks in engineering applications the peak stresses and peak stress levels of the cylinders are given by table 7 where σ p denotes the peak stress the subscripts s w o and w i denote s layer outer w layer and inner w layer respectively and s l p denotes the peak stress level from fig 21 and table 7 it may be seen that 1 the peak stress level of w s w cylinder is about 7 significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions 2 under the first and the second initial conditions the peak stress levels of w s1 cylinder are respectively about 25 and 28 less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions about 28 and 38 respectively 3 the peak stress level of w s2 cylinder is about 19 greater than that of s2 cylinder about 15 4 the stress levels of the cylinders with the same mass as w s w cylinder is less than those of the cylinders with the same wall thickness as w s w cylinder under the same initial conditions above analysis shows that under the same initial conditions the sandwich cylinder always has a much lower stress level than the bi layer cylinders and monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness or the same mass the bi layer cylinders have lower stress levels than the monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness but have higher stress levels than the monolithic cylinders with the same mass as a result the stress control function of the sandwich cylinder is always good in contrast the stress control functions of the bi layer cylinders are unstable and heavily depend on the wall thickness and mass in addition to the time history regularity the stress distribution is also usually concerned in engineering application for simplicity the moment at which the peak stress level appears is named as peak time the stress contours of the five cylinders at peak time are shown in figs 22 26 from these figures it may be seen that 1 the large stresses of w s w cylinder occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer and inner w layers while the stress of the s core is generally small 2 the large stresses of w s1 cylinder mainly occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer w layer meanwhile the stresses at the bottom sides and top of the inner surface of inner s layer are large as well 3 the large stresses of s1 cylinder occur at the bottom sides and top of the outer and inner surfaces 4 the stress distributions of w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively similar to those of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder respectively furthermore the stress control characteristics of the w s w cylinder may also be seen intuitively from the stress contours the large stresses are isolated to the inner and outer w layers with a high yield limit see table 5 thus leaving the s core in a low stress state this advantage of w s w cylinder is not possessed by other cylinders if the bi layer layout is adopted the large stresses on the inner surface of material s may not be effectively controlled if a monolithic layout is adopted the large stresses on the inner and outer surface of material s may not be effectively controlled 4 2 mechanism analysis of stress control the stress level of a structure colliding with water is positively correlated with the impact pressure and inversely correlated with the inherent strength the inherent strength is related to material parameters wave frequency stiffness and material layout detailed in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 the material parameters have been given by table 5 next the mechanism of stress control is analyzed from the aspect of impact pressure wave frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength 4 2 1 impact pressures the collision between an elastic body and water is a kind of contact problem according to contact mechanics johnson 1985 the mean contact pressure is an important factor related to the stress and deformation essentially the water impact pressure is the contact pressure of water acting on the elastic body referring to the method of contact mechanics the mean impact pressure is investigated here as shown in fig 27 it may be seen from fig 27 that 1 at the initial velocity of 30 m s the impact pressure curves of the five cylinders are basically consistent and the peak impact pressures are all about 15 mpa 2 at the initial kinetic energy of 86 75 kj the peak impact pressures of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder are respectively 18 mpa and 19 mpa obviously greater than those of other cylinders still about 15 mpa for the same cylinder the greater the impact pressure the higher the stress level thus the stress level of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder under the second initial condition are higher than their stress levels under the first initial condition this regularity seems obvious however the underlying reasons for the difference in stress levels of the cylinders under the same or similar impact pressure ini 1 are still unknown 4 2 2 wave frequencies generally speaking impact load is a kind of attenuating load with a wide frequency range therefore the first order mode of a structure is most easily excited when it is subjected to an impact load ward and lammenspaul 1998 in this case the wave frequency is equal to the first order natural frequency of the structure essentially speaking water impact pressure is also a kind of impact load taking w s w cylinder as an example the frequency domain characteristics of impact pressure is obtained by fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 28 where p f fft f t from fig 28 it may be seen that the impact pressure is characterized by attenuation over a wide frequency range therefore the first order mode of the structure is most easily excited based on the characteristics of the impact pressure the wave frequency in a cylinder during water entry is equal to the first order natural frequency through modal analysis the first order natural frequencies f n of the five cylinders are listed in table 8 4 2 3 deformations and stiffnesses time history curves of deformations of the five cylinders are shown in fig 29 it may be seen from fig 29 that 1 the peak deformation of w s w cylinder is about 0 32 mm approximately equal to that of w s2 cylinder and larger than that of s2 cylinder about 0 28 mm under the same initial conditions 2 the peak deformations of w s1 cylinder under the first and second initial conditions are about 0 48 mm and 0 6 mm respectively less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 0 7 mm and 0 9 mm respectively according to the mechanics of materials de silva 2014 stiffness is the ability of a structure to resist deformation thus the stiffness s t f of a cylinder subjected to impact pressure may be expressed as 50 s t f p p δ p according to equation 50 under the same impact pressure the smaller the deformation the greater its stiffness it has been seen from fig 27 that the impact pressures acting on the five cylinders are approximately the same under the first initial condition in this case the peak deformations of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are 0 32 mm 0 48 mm 0 7 mm 0 32 mm and 0 28 mm respectively therefore the stiffness of s2 cylinder is the largest the stiffnesses of w s w cylinder and w s2 cylinder are the same and lower than that of s2 cylinder the stiffness of w s1 cylinder is lower than that of the first three cylinders and the stiffness of s1 cylinder is the lowest in the theoretical derivation of part 2 a basic hypothesis is put forward that is the deformations of different layers of the same cylinder are consistent here w s w cylinder and w s1 cylinder at the initial velocity of 30 m s are taken as examples to illustrate the deformation consistency of different layers of a multi layer cylinder under the first initial condition the time history curves of deformations of all layers of w s w cylinder and w s1 cylinder are respectively shown in figs 30 and 31 it may be seen from figs 30 and 31 that the deformation curves of different layers of the same cylinder are coincident it indicates that the hypothesis of the deformation consistency of different layers of a multi layer cylinder is reasonable 4 2 4 influence of material layout in section 2 2 it has been found that the stress is mainly affected by the wave frequency f specific acoustic impedance z p deformation δ and material layout k except for k the other three parameters have been clarified in the previous parts according to equation 28 the parameter k is given by 51 k ln σ v o n f n z p δ 1 78 based on the results of stress natural frequency and deformation the parameter k of each layer of every cylinder is given by table 9 it may be seen from table 9 that except for the negative k value of the core of w s w cylinder the k values of all layers of the cylinders are positive indicating that there is an essential difference between the layer without independent boundary and the layer with independent boundary next taking the s stresses of the cylinders as examples the influence of material layout on stress is compared with that of deformation and natural frequency the parameters σ f n δ and e k s are nondimensionalized as follows 52 n σ σ p σ p w s w n f f n f n w s w n δ δ p δ p w s w n e x p k e k e k w s w where n denotes the dimensionless operator and the subscript w s w indicates that the physical quantity belongs to w s w cylinder the four expressions in equation 52 meet the following relationship 53 n σ n f n δ n e x p k for simplicity w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are respectively marked as 1 2 3 4 and 5 the comparison of n σ n f n δ and n e x p k of the five cylinders is given by fig 32 it may be seen from fig 32 that the influence of n e x p k on n σ is the greatest the influence of n f on n σ is the least and the influence of n δ on n σ is between the former two it indicates that the influence of material layout on stress is greater than that of natural frequency and deformation according to the studies and discussions above the natural frequency and deformation of w s w cylinder are moderate however its s stress is significantly less than that of other cylinders attributing to its special material layout 4 2 5 stresses and inherent strengths of layers based on the discussions above the wave frequency and deformation of all layers of a multilayer cylinder are the same according to equation 28 the multiple of w stress relative to s stress is given by 54 ς w s σ v o n w σ v o n s z p w z p s e k w k s 2 26 e k w k s where the subscript w and s denote materials w and s respectively according to the mechanics of materials de silva 2014 strength is the ability of a structure to resist stress failure thus the strength of a layer of a multilayer cylinder subjected to impact pressure may be expressed as 55 s t r i p p s l i p p y i σ p i where s t r i denotes the inherent strength of layer i σ p i denotes peak stress of layer i and y i denotes the yield stress of the material of layer i substituting equations 28 and 50 into equation 55 gives 56 s t r i 0 17 s t f f n y i e k i z p i for a multilayer cylinder the multiple of the inherent strength of w layer relative to that of s layer is given by 57 γ w s s t r w s t r s y w y s σ v o n s σ v o n w y w y s z p s z p w e k s k w 2 65 e k s k w from equations 54 and 57 it may be seen that for a multilayer cylinder the relationship between the stresses of different layers and the relationship between the inherent strengths of different layers mainly depend on the material parameters and material layout the parameters ς w s and γ w s are solved by substituting k s and k w into equations 54 and 57 as listed in table 10 it may be seen from table 10 that 1 the difference between w stress and s stress of w s w cylinder is much greater than that of w s1 cylinder and w s2 cylinder 2 the difference between inherent strengths of w layer and s layer of w s w cylinder is much less than that of w s1 cylinder and w s2 cylinder 3 for w s w cylinder the inherent strength of w layer is approximately equal to that of s layer indicating that the utilization efficiency of materials of w s w cylinder is very high above analysis shows that when materials are given the material layout has a great influence on the stresses and inherent strengths of layers of a multilayer cylinder 4 2 6 inherent strengths of cylinders the inherent strength of the whole structure depends on the weakest part that is 58 s t r min 1 i n l s t r i 0 17 s t f f n min 1 i n l y i e k i z p i where s t r denotes the inherent strength of the whole structure it has been proved that for the same cylinder the inherent strength of w layer is higher than that of s layer thus equation 58 may be simplified as 59 s t r s t r s 0 17 s t f f n y s e k s z p s 3 s t f f n e k s equation 59 shows that when the materials are given the inherent strengths of the five cylinders depends on the stiffnesses natural frequencies and material layouts 1 the inherent strength is proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to natural frequency 2 the cylinder tends to have a higher strength if the s layer has no independent boundary for a further discussion the parameters s t r s t f 1 f n and e k s are nondimensionalized as follows 60 n s t r s t r s t r w s w n s t f s t f s t f w s w n 1 f f n 1 f n 1 w s w n 1 e x p k e k s e k s w s w the four expressions in equation 60 meet the following relationship 61 n s t r n s t f n 1 f n 1 e x p k the comparison of n s t r n s t f n 1 f and n 1 e x p k of the five cylinders is shown in fig 33 where the serial numbers 1 2 3 4 and 5 denote w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder respectively from fig 33 it may be seen that 1 the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is obviously greater than that of other four cylinders 2 the influence of material layout on the inherent strength of cylinders is the greatest the influence of natural frequency on the inherent strength of cylinders is the least and the influence of stiffness on the inherent strength of cylinders is between the former two among the five cylinders the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are moderate but its inherent strength is significantly higher than that of other cylinders attributing to its unique material layout the core has no independent boundary thus significantly reducing the s stress the discussions in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 fundamentally reveal the reason why the stress level of w s w cylinder is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions 4 3 relationship between stress and velocity fig 33 has shown that the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is significantly greater than that of other cylinders it means that w s w cylinder may withstand a higher water entry velocity than other cylinders the peak stress levels of the five cylinders at different initial velocities are obtained by numerical simulation based on sph fem as shown in fig 34 the s l v curve of every cylinder ends at s l 100 because s l 100 means that the structure will experience yield from fig 34 it may be seen that at the same initial velocities the stress level of w s w cylinder is significantly lower than that of other cylinders it indicates that w s w cylinder has a good stress control function at different initial velocities in contrast the stress levels of bi layer cylinders are lower than those of monolithic cylinders with the same wall thickness but higher than those of monolithic cylinders with the same mass therefore the stress control function of bi layer cylinders is not stable the s l v curves may be fitted by the following function 62 s l a v 2 b v c where the parameters a b and c are fit coefficients which are given by table 11 it may be solved from s l 100 that the limit velocities of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder colliding with water are about 148 m s 75 m s 64 m s 84 m s and 100 m s respectively 4 4 other mechanical properties the previous discussions have covered stress impact pressure natural frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength in this section two other important mechanical properties will be discussed namely impact acceleration and vibration acceleration the impact acceleration refers to the acceleration of the elastic body as a whole and the vibration acceleration refers to the acceleration of a particle relative to its equilibrium position the time history curves of impact accelerations of the five cylinders are shown in fig 35 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration it may be seen from fig 35 that 1 under the same initial condition the impact acceleration curves of w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are roughly coincident and the peak impact accelerations of these three cylinders are all about 420g 2 under the first and second initial conditions the peak impact accelerations of w s1 cylinder are respectively 480g and 550g obviously less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 570g and 800g respectively next is the vibration accelerations of the cylinders in engineering applications the magnitude of vibration is usually measured by the vibration acceleration level which is given by 63 a l 20 log a v a 0 where a l denotes the vibration acceleration level a v denotes the vibration acceleration and a 0 denotes the reference acceleration in general a 0 takes the value of 1 10 6 m s2 the time history curves of vibration acceleration levels of the cylinders are shown in fig 36 it may be seen from fig 36 that 1 under the same initial conditions the peak vibration acceleration levels of w s w cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are all approximately equal to 193 db except that the vibration acceleration level curve of w s w cylinder is attenuated more slowly 2 under the first and second initial conditions the peak vibration acceleration levels of w s1 cylinder are respectively 194 db and 196 db obviously less than those of s1 cylinder under the same initial conditions 197 db and 199 db respectively the above analysis indicates that under the same initial conditions the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder are not greater than those of the bi layer cylinders and monolithic cylinders with the same equal wall thickness or the same equal mass 4 5 comprehensive comparisons the above discussions show that the mechanical properties of a cylinder are interrelated the basic logics are as follows 1 the stress level of a cylinder depends on the impact pressure and the inherent strength 2 the inherent strength depends on the material parameters material layouts stiffness and natural frequency 3 the limit velocity of a cylinder colliding with water is positively correlated with the inherent strength in addition as a supplementary study the impact accelerations and vibration acceleration levels are discussed as well the comprehensive comparisons of above mechanical properties of the five cylinders is given in table 12 where t w denotes the wall thickness m denotes the mass v l denotes the limit velocity and other symbols have been mentioned above the explanations for table 12 are as follows 1 at the initial velocity of 30 m s the five cylinders have the same load condition which may be used to judge the inherent strengths and stiffnesses of the cylinders the lower the stress level the higher the inherent strength of the cylinder the smaller the deformation the greater the stiffness of the cylinder from this perspective the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is much higher than that of other cylinders while its stiffness is moderate 2 essentially the inherent strength of a cylinder is determined by a combination of material parameters material layout stiffness and natural frequency detailed in sections 4 2 5 and 4 2 6 the inherent frequency is proportional to the stiffness and inversely proportional to the natural frequency according to table 12 the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are not dominant however the influence factor of material layout of w s w cylinder i e e k s is significantly greater than that of other cylinders so its inherent strength is significantly greater than that of other cylinders 3 under the same inherent strength conditions the greater the impact pressure the higher the stress level of the cylinder thus the stress level of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder at the initial kinetic energy of 86 75 kj is higher than their stress levels at the initial velocity of 30 m s 4 the higher the inherent strength of a cylinder the greater the limit velocity it may withstand the limit velocity of w s w cylinder is significantly greater than that of other cylinders attributing to its highest inherent strength 5 under the same initial conditions the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder is the same as those of the bi layer cylinder and monolithic cylinder with the same mass and lower than those of the bi layer cylinder and monolithic cylinder with the same wall thickness 5 conclusions this paper studies stress control of cylinders during water entry firstly the influence factors on dynamic stress are investigated by analytical method on this basis a sandwich scheme which is expected to reduce the stress level of the cylinder is proposed next the stress levels of w s w cylinder w s1 cylinder s1 cylinder w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder are studied by sph fem method and the mechanism of stress control is analyzed from the aspects of impact pressure natural frequency deformation and stiffness material layout and inherent strength in addition the limit velocities impact accelerations and vibration acceleration levels of the cylinders are investigated as well it is found that the stress levels of cylinders depend on the impact pressures and inherent strengths at the same initial velocity the impact pressures acting on the five cylinders are approximately equal and the differences of their stress levels mainly depend on the differences of their inherent strengths the inherent strength of a cylinder is related to material parameters material layout stiffness and natural frequency when the material parameters are given the influence of material layout on the inherent strength is greater than that of stiffness and natural frequency the stiffness of w s w cylinder is equal to that of w s2 cylinder less than that of s2 cylinder and greater than that of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder the natural frequency of w s w cylinder is lower than that of w s2 cylinder and s2 cylinder and higher than that of w s1 cylinder and s1 cylinder therefore the stiffness and natural frequency of w s w cylinder are not dominant however due to the unique material layout the inherent strength of w s w cylinder is significantly higher than that of other cylinders and its stress level is significantly lower than that of other cylinders under the same initial conditions correspondingly the limit velocity of w s w cylinder colliding with water is much higher than that of other cylinders in addition the impact acceleration and vibration acceleration level of w s w cylinder is not greater than those of other cylinders under the same initial conditions therefore the sandwich scheme for stress control advised by this paper can be used to improve the inherent strength of the cylinder thus reducing the stress level of the cylinder colliding with water and improving the limit velocity entering water this technology may solve the problem of stress failure of cylindrical structures during water entry credit

21602,the introduction of autonomous ships is shaping the future of the global shipping industry these ships have been successfully tested by stakeholders the minimum safety requirement for autonomous ships is that their operation should be at least as safe as that of conventional manned ships hence it is necessary to use effective analysis methods to conduct a systemic hazard analysis process since the earliest design phase of an autonomous ship in this study we investigate the applicability of 29 hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships system safety requirements and evaluation criteria based on the characteristics of autonomous ships are established using a system engineering approach to this end under a review protocol relevant and extensive studies in the past nearly 50 years are analysed in detail and clustering results of hazard analysis methods regarding the types of ship and the autonomy of levels are provided the findings reveal that traditional hazard analysis methods based on a chain of directly related failure events or component failures cannot ensure adequate safeguarding for autonomous ships in contrast system theoretic process analysis stpa is found to be a highly promising hazard analysis technique that fulfils all the evaluation criteria thus possible combinations of the stpa and other hazard analysis methods may be considered in future research keywords 1 autonomous ship 2 hazard analysis method 3 applicability evaluation 4 system engineering approach 5 safety of transportation 1 introduction following decades of research and development focused on intelligent technologies there is an increasing interest in autonomous ships the topic of autonomous ships is currently of great interest within the entire maritime community this is partly because of the increasing maturity of the technologies related to the support and execution of autonomous ships and partly because of the possibility of decrease in the occurrence of navigational accidents resulting in the improvement in the safety of maritime transportation wróbel et al 2017 in addition to generating a proactive momentum industry leaders are providing strong arguments to convince sceptical experts for the demonstrations of their prototypes and test progress of autonomous ships such as rolls royce 2018 and wärtsilä 2018a 2018b in reality the introduction of autonomous ships in the maritime industry would lead to disruptive changes in maritime traffic conditions the smart systems required by autonomous ships are becoming increasingly complex and software intensive and are composed of not only hardware components but also logic control devices and an increasing number of sensors although some studies have claimed that automation or autonomy can increase the safety of ships porathe et al 2018 burmeister et al 2014 the safety of autonomous navigation has remained in focus it is noteworthy that the minimum requirement for an autonomous vessel is for it to be at least as safe as conventional manned ships zhou et al 2019 presenting an initial high level demand from the perspective of autonomous ships the potential safety and security risks are the primary concerns whose nature needs to be comprehended and which must be expressed and evaluated with the available knowledge before and at the beginning of any voyage additionally changes in the operation mode influence the risk in relation to the autonomous ship itself and its surrounding environment in general the term risk is used in numerous ways and has different definitions depending on the field and context including business economics environment finance and safety the understanding of risk frequently varies depending on the stakeholder and the implication of the risk reduction measure in risk assessment analysts need to make assumptions and simplifications collect and analyse well founded data and develop and use models to represent the phenomena studied zio 2018 system safety is the formal process of identifying and controlling risk with systems becoming increasingly complex and hazardous the occurrence of hazards is inevitable however their risk must and can be made acceptable therefore herein risk is defined as the consequence of a hazard combined with the probability of its occurrence currently numerous studies are focused on the risk related to autonomous ships attempting to formulate a possible model to assess the risk utne et al 2017 rødseth and burmeister 2015 statheros et al 2008 thieme and utne 2017 thieme et al 2018 tam and jones 2018 ozturk and cicek 2019 huang and van gelder 2020 among them ozturk and cicek 2019 focused on the improvement of navigational safety to assess individual collision risk models based on a literature review and analysed the featured parameters of these models this study provides an improved understanding of the use and integration of the parameters and the methods for the decision support system in upcoming autonomous navigation yet unlike the generalized definition of risk the studies of collision risk are mainly confined to the area of ship collision avoidance from the perspective of navigational practice officers on watch shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists to provide support for the decision making of collision avoidance thieme et al 2018 reviewed 64 risk models published since 2005 to investigate the applicability of modelling approaches for autonomous ships the analysis results indicated that most models use historical data expert judgement published data and a combination of these to build the input for the modelling and quantification of the models however autonomous ships have not yet been practically applied and their prototypes are still being tested in some authorised waters moreover hazards leading to disruptive events are extremely uncertain and therefore are difficult to describe and model quantitatively currently there are some inevitable flaws in a few proposed risk assessment models for autonomous ships such as the validity of the risk assessment model thus such risk models are inapplicable for demonstrating the safety compliance of an autonomous ship and cannot be used directly to conduct its risk assessment in the hazard mishap actuation transition process a mishap is an actual event that has occurred and resulted in death injury or loss whereas a hazard is a potential condition that may result in death injury or loss mishaps are the immediate result of actualised hazards these two are different states of the same phenomenon linked by a state transition that must occur from the time and cost saving perspective it is essential that the safety process starts at the concept definition phase and continues throughout the life cycle thus far the necessity of initial hazard analysis of autonomous ships has been affirmed wróbel et al 2018a 2018b zou 2018 perera and murray 2019 rokseth et al 2019 valdez banda et al 2019 thieme et al 2019 wrobel et al 2019 even with very limited existing research in comparison with studies providing risk assessment models currently effective hazard analysis is more suitable for an autonomous ship in the development phase of the system life cycle herein the autonomous ship is regarded as a whole whose system hazards need to be identified eliminated or controlled and documented before the first autonomous ship is released into her actual context of operation risks such as collision risk and grounding risk which are only limited to specific aspects are not discussed however the conclusion of hazard analysis may be used as the input of risk assessment in the near future in this study one or more generic and comprehensive hazard analysis methods applicable to autonomous ships are expected to be stand out after conducting the process of applicability evaluation the evaluation process reviews the papers on 29 hazard analysis methods proposed in the past nearly 50 years and assesses whether these methods can be used to capture the unique aspects of the development and operation of autonomous ships the aim is to identify potential gaps between hazard analysis methods and autonomous ships and provide broader insight and knowledge of perceived trends furthermore the safety requirements of autonomous ships derived by a system engineering approach create a basis for developing an initial safety management strategy of autonomous shipping 2 concept description of autonomous ships thus far there has been no confirmed formal definition of autonomous ships however some relevant definitions bertram 2016 munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 bureau veritas 2017 danish maritime authority 2017 jorgensen 2016 have been discussed and applied which can provide a more accurate identification of autonomous ships in this study the definition of international maritime organization imo was considered which states that a ship can operate independent of human interaction to a varying degree imo 2018 it is worth noting that the overall design structure of an autonomous ship is remarkably different from those of the current conventional ships including the bridge structure setting hull design propulsion system and energy management additionally nearly all the subsystems of autonomous ships are controlled by a remote or an autonomous mode including collision avoidance decision making and ship state monitoring an autonomous vessel may be manned with a reduced crew or unmanned with or without supervision and has the capabilities to make decisions and perform actions with or without a human in the loop therefore it can operate independently of human interaction to a varying degree from a manual to a fully autonomous operation mode there are different levels of autonomy loas additionally the number of on board crew gradually decreases with increasing loa shore control centre scc is a generally accepted terminology for the facility controlling or supervising autonomous ships rolls royce 2016 munin 2012 kongsberg 2017 which collects all the necessary resources needed to either remotely control the ships or monitor the voyages via communication links and be standby ready to take control in case of an emergency an scc is a dedicated physical area detached from the vessel to facilitate the remote control and supervision of ship functions barriers should be arranged towards unwanted events that may affect the capability and availability of the functions of remote control and supervision thus system design with failure tolerance should be considered in an scc the industry leader lloyd s register of shipping has published the taxonomy of loas lloyd s register 2016 ranging from al1 to al6 denoting a fully autonomous ship with no access required during a mission other frameworks aiming to elaborate on the loas have also been developed rødseth and nordahl 2017 danish maritime authority 2017 bureau veritas 2017 masrwg 2017 imo 2018 considering the taxonomies of loas of lloyd s register and the imo as examples when starting from the al3 and r levels respectively only a few crew members are required to authorise decisions with high complexity or high influence as illustrated in fig 1 3 methodology in this paper the framework of the literature review and the evaluation criteria based on a system engineering approach are introduced which aim to provide support for identifying the gaps related to hazard analysis techniques for autonomous ships the results are subsequently used to identify representative papers for further thorough analysis 3 1 method description and preliminaries hazard analysis is not a one time activity but an ongoing process that aims at evaluating the design and determining the possible events that may result in hazards at the system level hazard analysis is a critical step in the early system safety program effort and forms a baseline for the numerous activities that are subsequently conducted as an analysis tool a hazard analysis technique defines a unique analysis methodology e g fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta the technique refers to a specific and unique analysis methodology that is performed following a specific set of rules and provides specific results currently there are over 100 different hazard analysis methods in existence international system safety society 1999 and the number continues to gradually grow however some methods are minor variations of other methods in this study 28 of the most commonly used hazard analysis methods and one novel method are presented preliminary hazard list phl analysis preliminary hazard analysis pha subsystem hazard analysis ssha system hazard analysis sha operating and support hazard analysis o sha health hazard analysis hha requirements hazard analysis rha environmental hazard analysis eha fta eta failure mode and effects analysis fmea hazard and operability hazop analysis functional hazard analysis fuha cause consequence analysis cca common cause failure analysis ccfa software hazard analysis swha process hazard analysis pha test hazard analysis tha fault hazard analysis faha sneak circuit analysis sca markov analysis ma petri net analysis pna barrier analysis ba bent pin analysis bpa management oversight risk tree mort analysis job hazard analysis jha threat hazard analysis tha system of systems hazard analysis sosha and system theoretic process analysis stpa respectively herein a systematic and reproducible approach was applied to collect and filter the data sample the dataset preparation for the literature review was conducted according to the review protocol summarised in table 1 all the papers determined from the scopus database were searched by focusing on the title abstract and keywords the initial search was conducted in october 2019 and subsequently repeated on may 18 2020 to update the sample with the papers published in 2019 finally the search of the selected database resulted in a list of a total of 269 papers among them 150 were conference papers and 119 were articles published in journals to determine the most active intellectual networks in the analysed field science mapping tools were used subsequently to execute the data process the retrieved dataset can be used to outline a general tendency in the scientific production related to the analysed topic the results were grouped into different categories such as the year of publication and the name of the journal for the purpose of analysis as depicted in figs 2 and 3 respectively based on the analysed data sample the number of studies shows an increase starting from 2002 this upward trend is probably due to the focus of the imo on the formal safety assessment fsa in that period the guidelines for fsa for use in the imo rule making process were approved in 2002 msc circ 1023 mepc circ 392 which are used to enhance maritime safety moreover the ongoing development of autonomous shipping will ensure this positive tendency is maintained in the near future years 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 featured the top three highest number of studies published accordingly fig 2 depicts the number of publications with respect to journals and conferences furthermore fig 3 only lists some journals that published more than two articles in the past nearly 50 years the articles of these listed journals account for 44 of the total among them approximately 50 of the papers are published in 4 journals namely safety science ocean engineering naval architect and reliability engineering and system safety under the review protocol the analysis of the content based on the search fields title abstract and keywords can produce the statistics of the most frequent words used by authors herein the data process tool vosviewer waltman et al 2010 van eck and waltman 2010 was used to map the most relevant keywords both author and index keywords network based on the number of their co occurrences in the analysed documents the mapping network is illustrated in fig 4 the normalisation was conducted using an association strength full counting in the network visualisation the keywords were represented by circles the higher the weight of a keyword the larger the circle in the visualisation the distance between two keywords indicated their relatedness the closer two keywords were located to each other the stronger their relatedness analogously the colour code indicated different clusters and the colour bar changed with the published year of the keywords fig 4 depicts that the vast majority of the co occurrence keywords is related to the maritime safety fields however some increasingly well known themes can be still captured based on the changes in the colour of the label we observe that the interest of researchers were focused on risk assessment reliability and accident prevention in the past period however recently the increasingly growing topics of interest are safety engineering hazard analysis uncertainty analysis and process analysis similarly the mapping results also reveal that the stpa as a novel hazard analysis method has attracted extensive attention in recent years 3 2 selection of hazard analysis methods according to the research assumptions a document is considered as relevant for the analysis if the full name or the abbreviation of a specific hazard analysis method is present herein under the review protocol we examined specific hazard analysis methods consecutively the number distribution is depicted in fig 5 it is worth noting that the total number of papers for each method is 293 which seems incorrect but is not in this figure the publications of each method are searched separately some papers reported more than two different hazard analysis methods or their combinations thus the same paper may be presented in different categories fig 5 indicates an interesting finding that 16 hazard analysis methods are not retrieved in any published article or conference paper suggesting that these methods may be unsuitable for executing hazard analysis targeted at ships moreover there are 7 hazard analysis methods present in a few retrieved studies in the past nearly 50 years accounting for only 7 of the total these are ba faha sca cca ccfa ma and pha the possible reasons are elaborated using some methods as examples the phl analysis is similar to a brainstorming session whose primary output is a list of hazards which provides the hazard information that serves as a starting point for pha however phl analysis is only preliminary and a complete hazard description is not always obtained in contrast a more fully investigated and complete hazard description can be achieved with pha thus a large majority of the studies may prefer to adopt pha to obtain a more detailed discussion rather than phl analysis however although 7 papers with the application of pha were retrieved it is still a very basic hazard analysis method based on brainstorming which was formally instituted and promulgated by the developers of mil std 882 moreover it was originally referred to as gross hazard analysis gha because of the performance at a gross preliminary level of detail see mil s 38130 although there are no remarkable disadvantages of the pha technique it is occasionally inappropriately depended on as the only hazard analysis technique for application particularly for autonomous ships similarly sha builds upon ssha and may use other methods such as fta to assess the impact of a certain hazard at the system level the outputs from ssha can be used as the inputs of sha to complete the examination of the entire system the emphasis is on the interactions and the interfaces of all the subsystems because they operate together ericson 2015 the success of sha is highly dependent on the completion of other system safety analyses such as pha ssha and o sha furthermore sca is accomplished by examining electrical circuits and searching unintended control sequences it has been extended for the hazard analysis and evaluation of rocket propulsion spacecrafts missiles and aircrafts yao et al 2019 xu and bao 2015 additionally it is a specialised tool for identifying specific classes of hazards and cannot identify all the system hazards but only those dealing with sneak paths therefore sca should not be used to analyse a system level hazard of autonomous ships at the present stage some other methods such as swha bpa and tha also encounter a similar scenario of inapplicability therefore in this study we only select some methods that have been extensively applied in the maritime field in the past period as the main research objects and evaluate their applicability for autonomous ships the eligible methods are hazop fmea pna eta fta and stpa whose development history and theory are briefly described below the hazop analysis is an organised structured and methodical process that utilises key guide words and system diagrams to search for hazards from the identified potential deviations in the design operational intent and attempts to determine the impact of these deviations on the system it was formulated as a critical examination analysis technique by the institute of chemical industry in the united kingdom in the mid 1960s to identify the possible hazards present in the facilities that manage highly hazardous materials ericson 2015 dunjó et al 2010 since the first publication of the study conducted by lawley in 1974 lawley 1974 the effectiveness of hazop has been demonstrated in identifying environmental safety and health hazards although the hazop analysis was initially developed and used only in the chemical process industry over the years its scope of application has extended to the petroleum food and water and maritime industries because of its success in identifying not only hazards but also operational problems the current studies using hazop have shown that it is applicable to all types of systems and equipment including subsystems assemblies components software procedures environment and human error essentially the technique is not considerably different from pha and ssha except for the application of key guide words fmea is a proactive analysis and reliability tool for evaluating the effect s of the potential failure modes of subsystems assemblies components and functions and for identifying the failure modes that would adversely affect the overall system reliability ericson 2015 akyuz et al 2016 it was developed for the u s military as a formal analysis technique dod 1980 it is a disciplined bottom up method that focuses on the designs or functions of products and processes generally it follows the methodology of dividing a system into smaller functional parts such as devices and diving the devices in turn into components subsequently a piecewise failure analysis is initiated which helps to generate fault related understanding at various complexity levels of a system conceptually functional structural and hybrid approaches are three parts of the fmea process petri nets pns have been available as modelling tools of systems in events since the late 1960s petri 1962 they can be used to model and analyse discrete event dynamic systems pna consists of drawing graphical pn diagrams and their analysis it is an analysis technique for identifying hazards dealing with the timing state transitions sequencing and repair in a real time embedded system correct actions taken extremely early or extremely late can lead to unsafe conditions therefore the analysis incorporated timing information is highly necessary the purpose of pna is to provide a method to graphically model system components over a wide range of abstraction levels to resolve the system reliability safety and dependency issues pns can be used to model an entire system a subsystem or system components over a wide range of abstraction levels from conceptual to detailed design ericson 2015 eta is a powerful tool that identifies and evaluates all the possible consequence paths generated by initiating the events in a potential accident scenario an event tree et is utilised as a visual logic tree structure to execute the analysis procedure the conception of this technique appears to have been developed in the wash 1400 nuclear power plant safety study andrews and dunnett 2000 with minor changes by us from 1975 onward the objective of eta is to determine whether the initiating event develops into a serious mishap or if the event is sufficiently controlled by the safety systems and procedures implemented in the system design ericson 2015 eta is essentially a binary decision diagram to evaluate the various multiple decision paths in a given problem fta is a top down system analysis technique used to determine the root causes and probability of occurrence of a specified undesired event using boolean algebra logic and probability theory the method was originally developed by watson to assist in the design of the minuteman guidance system in 1962 kabir 2017 fta is a graphical method that models the propagation of failures through the system it can be developed in layers levels and branches using a repetitive analysis process this method can be distinguished from qualitative and quantitative fta which determine the critical cut sets css and the probability of failure alternatively some effective extensions of the standard fault tree ft have been presented which can express features that are not expressible in the standard ftas such as dynamic ft fuzzy ft stochastic hybrid ft automaton and phased and time dependent fta ruijters and stoelinga 2015 in this paper fta is classified as a hazard analysis method which is primarily used as a root cause analysis tool to identify and evaluate hazard causal factors however it is comparatively more frequently regarded as a risk assessment tool when fta is regarded as a hazard analysis tool the graphics and logical representation of the various combinations of possible events are shown as fts once these events occur which can cause a predefined undesired event stpa is a relatively novel hazard analysis technique based on an extended model of accident causation initially it was developed by leveson 2011 to improve the design of sociotechnical systems system theoretic accident model and processes stamp provide the theoretical foundation for stpa which expands the traditional causality model beyond the chain of directly related failure events or component failures to include more complex processes and unsafe interactions among the system components this method considers safety as not only a dynamic control problem but also a failure prevention problem emphasising on the change from preventing failures to enforce constraints on the system behaviour the association studies of the above six hazard analysis methods are the vast majority of all the retrieved studies accounting for approximately 93 next these studies are analysed based on whether they fit the aim and scope of our research finally the selected most representative studies of these methods are further analysed in section 4 3 3 evaluation procedure to assess the applicability of the hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships and identify the potential gaps between them a system engineering approach blanchard and blyler 2016 is employed to develop a novel evaluation procedure despite the definition of the system being utilised loosely to describe numerous different scenarios and configurations generally a system comprises a complex combination of resources integrated such that they fulfil a specified operational requirement generally a system is developed to accomplish a specific function or a series of functions with the objective of responding to some identified needs herein the developed evaluation framework can be regarded as a simple system the aim is to determine one or more general hazard analysis methods that can capture the operation characteristics of autonomous ships to ensure and improve their safety in this development process the encountered challenges and potential gaps can be solved by system engineering system engineering may be defined in numerous ways depending on the background and personal experience the system engineering process has the basic steps of requirement analysis functional analysis requirements allocation and design optimisation these steps are iterative by nature evolving from system level definition to a subsystem level and down to the component as one progresses through the life cycle there is a need to ensure the full traceability of the requirements from the system level down to the component level it is noteworthy that inherent to the system engineering process is the need to ensure that this traceability is maintained to facilitate the development process effectively and efficiently thus based on the intended research purpose and scope the basic steps of the system engineering process are tailored and optimised to meet the needs of the system to be developed in summary the application of the evaluation procedures of the hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships is first performed in four steps first the initial definitions of the problem and the desired systems are described to ensure a good beginning a complete description should be presented in specific terms with sufficient detail to justify the progress to the next step second given the problem definition one or more specific system level safety requirement s need to be identified the requirements need to be described in a functional manner to avoid a premature commitment to a specific design concept or configuration third based on the initial identification of the functional safety requirements they need to be linked to specific design objectives to formulate appropriate evaluation criteria the effort can be considered as the benchmark and can provide an indispensable support for the follow on analysis finally eligible hazard analysis methods need to be evaluated against the criteria to accomplish the evaluation procedure the evaluation results can be used to help facilitate the development of hazard analysis methods applicable to autonomous ships in the second step some informative questions blanchard and blyler 2016 which are relevant and important to describe the system level safety requirements in a functional manner are as follows 1 what is required of the system stated in functional terms 2 what specific functions must the system accomplish 3 what are the primary functions to be accomplished 4 what are secondary functions to be accomplished 5 what must be accomplished to completely alleviate the stated deficiency 6 why must these functions be accomplished 7 when must these functions be accomplished 8 where is this to be accomplished and for how long 9 how many times must these functions be accomplished although the specific responses to these questions may slightly overlap their importance is reflected in the ability that can describe the anticipated requirements in a functional manner these questions are used as the guidelines for identifying the system level safety requirements of autonomous ships additionally the answers to the questions provide relevant input for suitable evaluation criteria in the current analytical study the general discussion for the applicability of hazard analysis methods and possible further usage for autonomous ships is presented subsequently the methods that fulfil most of the criteria are further analysed in section 4 to some extent these methods reflect a positive interaction between highly detailed modelling results and the functional safety requirements as summarised in the criteria the applicability and possible learnings from these are highlighted although it is not suggested that these hazard analysis methods may be used as they are they may be used as the basis for developing specific hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships 3 4 evaluation criteria the primary driving forces for autonomous ships are not only to reduce the operating costs and human error but also to induce a real transformation in the industry however the main function and safety requirements are the same as those of the conventional ships which transport cargo or people from one port to another in a safe and timely manner new vessel operational concepts based on autonomous and remote controlled functions should have a level of safety equivalent or better in comparison with the operations of conventional ships with respect to safeguarding life property and environment some key functions have been identified and described for autonomous ships depending on the intended loa and remote operation dnv gl 2018 most scales assume autonomous ships to adhere to a specific loa however they ignore the differences between vessel functions according to the analysis in the previous section the suitable categorisation of the system level safety requirements of autonomous ships should depend on the context they are used in in this study the functional requirements are classified into navigation engineering functions and auxiliary functions which are marked respectively as red green and yellow table 2 summarises the system level safety requirements for autonomous ships navigation functions are conventionally based on a high degree of visual observations and human decisions which frequently include but are not limited to object obstacle detection manoeuvring propulsion control steering berthing and unberthing and collision avoidance in comparison engineering functions are to a high degree fully self controlled and operate under supervision by the crew auxiliary functions mainly indicate fire detection fighting anchoring mooring unmooring and ballast water control however in the context of the introduction of autonomous ships these potential auto remote functions are expended some novel concepts such as the communication lines between autonomous ships and scc cyber security remote supervision and possible operations of maintenance and repair need to be considered independently of human intervention under the framework of autonomous ships it is almost impossible that a fully autonomous ship without human supervision will become a reality in the near future the operation of an autonomous ship will rely on a human autonomous system collaboration ramos et al 2020 in comparison with conventional ships the main expansion with regards to the autonomous or remote controlled capacity is focused on navigation functions the transformation of the operation mode motivates new safety requirements the primary objectives of engineering functions are yet to ensure that the risks associated with the expected and abnormal variations failure and incidents are mitigated by designing necessary redundancy and or fault tolerance in the vessel and its connected systems furthermore necessary auxiliary systems should be considered to support navigation and engineering functions hazard analyses are used to determine the system risk and thereby ascertain the significance of the hazards so that safety design measures can be established to eliminate or mitigate the hazard ericson 2015 different hazard analysis methods describe the differences in the scope coverage detail and life cycle phase timing which reflect and define a point in time when the analysis should begin the level of detail of the analysis the type of information available and the analysis output on the basis of identified safety requirements the evaluation criteria for autonomous ships are derived which can reflect the safety needs the criteria are presented in table 3 the rationale behind the definition and selection of respective evaluation criteria is elaborated in detail as follows traditional hazard analysis methods typically divide the system into smaller components to deal with its complexity examining and analysing each component in isolation however the significantly increased complexity of the current systems along with the introduction of software and algorithms makes it more difficult to anticipate understand plan and protect against all the potential system behaviours in addition the system properties of safety are not related to the behaviours of individual system components but instead to the interactions among the components particularly for autonomous ships system level hazards ec1 need to be identified in addition to the failure of components the system life cycle is analogous to the human life cycle of conception birth childhood adulthood death and burial it is generally condensed and summarised into five major phases as illustrated in fig 6 some prototypes of autonomous ships have been tested however the actual context of their operation is still not released thus according to the research status quo of autonomous ships necessary safety and security analysis should be executed in the development phase ec2 particularly in the preliminary design in addition prior to actual operation all the needs and potential hazards should be determined considering any requirements for the hardware ec3 software and or algorithms ec4 autonomous functions control algorithms and related hardware that are failing to a large extent influence the risk of autonomous ships moreover stable and reliable communication lines ec5 are indispensable and herein the communication line is a wide concept including links among equipment components and ships and the satellite communication links between the autonomous ships and the scc in the shipping industry it is noteworthy that traditional risk management has equalled the physical risks but the growing digitalisation and autonomy have created a need for cyber risk management the existing cyber risk or lack in the necessary security protection for the digital systems may render the ship unseaworthy hence the hazards connected to cyber security can no longer be ignored and must be addressed at the top level of the maritime industry situation awareness is the key element of the decision making processes zhou et al 2019 and a substantial amount of the human machine interaction is indispensable therefore the potential hazards of human machine interfaces ec6 should be considered unlike ec5 which is physical oriented ec7 and ec8 focus on the cooperation and interaction between the actors timely and accurate communication is necessary to detect and resolve potential hazardous scenarios of autonomous ships noteworthy that the communication between operators of autonomous ships and other marine stakeholders is not considered in ec8 the latter may include other ships or manned structures the reason is that shore based operators merely replace the crew in form without any change in the role and responsibility since autonomous or remote controlled vessels will be operated with reduced or no manning on board and such vessels may have different safety states in comparison with those of conventional ships scheduled maintenance and repair cannot be executed immediately when necessary hence the important vessel functions should generally be arranged with fault tolerance or redundancy ec9 to compensate for the failures and incidents that cannot be dealt with by manual work on board dnv gl 2018 it is worth noting that autonomous ships may be operating at one or more degrees of autonomy for the duration of a single voyage imo 2018 different loas may result in different operation modes leading to changes in the interaction between the operators crew onboard and autonomous ship these changes may influence the identification and analysis of hazards thus considering different operational modes and loas ec10 as hazard analysis methods is necessary 4 results in section 3 the retrieved results and clustering results of 29 selected hazard analysis methods were presented fig 2 5 based on further analysis six eligible methods were selected from them namely hazop fmea pna eta fta and stpa here the applicability evaluation of these methods for autonomous ships is presented and the evaluation results and analysis are described in detail 4 1 results of clustering analysis following the procedure of dataset preparation described in section 3 1 272 papers on the above six methods were retrieved after the execution of the search query to obtain more sophisticated findings clustering of the hazard analysis methods was performed for two reasons to provide information regarding the types of ships and the loas according to the research assumptions the scope was restricted to papers pertaining to a ship i e a document was recognised as relevant for the analysis if the individual concept of a ship was the applied object of the hazard analysis method the applied objects in these relevant studies include the ship as a whole subsystems components of a ship or related operations of a ship such as ship repairing operation and ship piloting operation some papers focused on ports and offshore terminals maione et al 2016 mokhtari et al 2011 anita et al 2010 alyami et al 2019 offshore wind turbines zeiler and bertsche 2015 liquefied natural gas lng bunkering operations of ports apostolopoulou et al 2018 scheduling of shipyard block erection systems zhong et al 2010 yu guang et al 2011 wang et al 2009 and ship emissions wen et al 2018 which were excluded from the analysis even if they could be included in the maritime industry after the scrutinizing of applied objects only 205 papers were regarded as relevant to the research goal and the number distribution of each method is depicted in fig 7 among them all the retrieved studies on stpa were relevant however the number of irrelevant studies exceeded the number of relevant studies on pna the studies consistent with our research topic were evaluated in depth herein the types of ships were classified by usage into military ship cargo ship passenger ship fishing ship auxiliary ship engineering ship and high speed craft and offshore unit on this basis the cargo ship was further classified into five categories tanker container ship bulk carrier ro ro ship and multi purpose ship the clustering results by the type of ship are depicted in fig 8 some studies that did not state the specific type of ship as their object of analysis or during their case study were classified into the non declaration category additionally a few studies focused on certain ships based on different propulsion types such as lng fueled ship hu et al 2019 jeong et al 2017 fu et al 2016 li and zhou 2015 all electric ship menis et al 2012 vicenzutti et al 2019 and energy efficient dual fuel diesel natural gas ship guan et al 2016 however because the usage of these ships had not been clarified they were classified into the non declaration category as depicted in fig 8 the vast majority of the studies do not state the specific type of ship but only focus on the subsystems components of a ship liu et al 2019 suo et al 2020 ünver et al 2019 aksu 2019 in these six hazard analysis methods the studies of fta included the largest number of ship types whereas pna had the least except for the non declaration category the most well known types of ship in the analysed dataset were tanker passenger ship and military ship the contribution of these three types of ships accounted for 59 of all the documents in the sample however only one paper was found to be focused on executing the safety assessment or hazard analysis process on a ro ro ship wu et al 2006 a multi purpose ship mai et al 2019 and an offshore unit overfield and collins 2002 moreover regarding the clustering of the autonomy levels the taxonomy of loas by the imo is adopted including m level manual navigation with automated processes and decision support r level remote controlled ship with crew on board ru level remote controlled ship without crew on board and a level autonomous ship some studies overlap with more than one type of loas such as r level ru level and a level in such cases one document is assigned to more than one category the weights depend on the overlap of the number of loas the clustering results by loa are depicted in fig 9 the conducted analysis of loa suggests that stpa seems to be the most dynamic one from these hazard analysis methods the number of papers focused on high levels of autonomy r level ru level a level comprised almost 25 of all the papers considered in this method however all the retrieved studies on the three hazard analysis methods hazop pna and eta were focused on conventional ships m level a few studies have achieved new explorations using fmea and fta which is a positive trend for enhancing the safety of autonomous ships 4 2 results of applicability evaluation after the determination of the data sample obtained using the procedure presented in section 3 1 some representative studies were finally reviewed from the list of the total of 269 studies the literature review conducted systematically was aimed at investigating the technological readiness herein we scrutinized these studies sequentially and grouped them with respect to the methods applied and parameters highlighting the various features of the studies table 4 summarises the attributes of the 47 reviewed studies on the six hazard analysis methods object of analysis aim of study life cycle phase and type of analysis with respect to a specific method there are eight studies using two different hazard analysis methods respectively or their integration to achieve the aim of the study moreover three studies use a graphics and mathematical modelling tool to describe the logical representation including pns m11 m14 and fts m36 the object of analysis reveals the topic and the area of interest of studies or the applied target of case study most studies focus on subsystems components of a ship m1 m3 m6 m8 m10 m13 m14 m17 m23 m27 m36 m41 particularly for machinery systems some analyses started from specific maritime accidents m11 m24 m30 m32 m34 m38 m45 and specific waterways m16 m33 m35 m37 to analyse the root cause or assess the risk few studies aimed at certain types of ships as a whole such as an oil tanker m2 an lng fueled ship m39 m40 until the date of the review protocol although only six studies focused on autonomous ships m19 m29 m42 m44 m46 their contribution has been ground breaking regarding the types of analysis only the analysis process of retrieved studies on hazop and spta is qualitative while fmea fta eta and pna can be applied by qualitative analysis and or quantitative calculation in the system safety discipline the naive hazard analysis methods primarily use the qualitative way to address a majority of safety work based on the advantages provided sometimes the strict use of quantitative methods must be tempered by utility risks are not easily estimated using probability and statistics when the hazard causal factors are not yet well understood however if the hazard analysis process is regarded as a pre analysis for risk assessment or used to address a few high risk hazards it may be necessary to conduct a quantitative analysis for more precise knowledge although most of the reviewed studies aimed at the operation of conventional ships the proposed evaluation criteria reflect the safety requirements of autonomous ships that can effectively overcome the disparity between conventional ships and autonomous ships table 5 summarises the evaluation results of 47 selected studies against the criteria among them only four studies provided sufficient information to fulfil no less than eight criteria in such cases although some studies included considerations similar to the ones in the criteria insufficient information was presented to ensure that these criteria were satisfied as presented 18 studies used hazard analysis methods to analyse system level hazards which fulfilled ec1 most studies focused on the hardware failure of the system or subsystem therefore ec3 was addressed in 39 studies regarding with life cycle phase effective safety analysis was conducted from the early system development phase ec2 in only 11 studies one starts from the production phase and others focus on the operation phase ec4 to ec10 are seven distinctive indicators derived based on the safety requirement of autonomous ships it is difficult for most studies using traditional methods to fulfil these criteria in particular the design of the analysis process is prepared for conventional ships as summarised in table 5 these papers present the performances of the applied hazard analysis methods herein the evaluation of the methods from the perspective of performance was conducted in a comprehensive manner and the results are tabulated for better readability see table 6 spta can fulfil all the evaluation criteria listed in table 3 four novel studies m42 m43 m44 m46 using stpa execute hazard analysis and management process in the concept design phase of an autonomous vessel their conclusions demonstrate the applicability of stpa importantly these four studies use stpa to identify the possible contributors to system hazards which almost cover all the criteria moreover for other methods some additional supplement needs to be elaborated from the depicted result of hazop only four criteria were met in regard to the life cycle phase although all the selected papers focus on the operation phase there is evidence showing that hazop can be used to identify safety issues early in the design process dunjó et al 2010 thus hazop analysis can be considered to meet the descriptions of ec1 ec4 moreover among the retrieved studies on pna pns are typically used with typical hazard analysis techniques such as fmea and fta which are used for knowledge representation and reasoning specifically pna is not a general purpose hazard analysis tool although it can be used in system level hazard analysis genrich and lautenbach 1981 petri 1962 jensen 1991 under the review protocol eight related studies were found to be using eta as the hazard analysis tool in which most of the data sources were based on ship accidents only the descriptions of ec1 ec3 and ec8 were fulfilled however there is evidence that eta can be applied to a system early in the design development thieme et al 2015 bagschik et al 2016 therefore ec2 can be regarded to be within the capacity of eta fmea is used for evaluating the potential individual failure modes and providing reliability information a total of 17 fmea studies were found to assess or discuss subsystems components or failure modes of ships such as ship machinery system lazakis et al 2018 medium voltage direct current shipboard power system soman et al 2009 and oil spill incident from a chemical oil tanker ship li et al 2019 hence fmea can satisfy the descriptions of ec2 5 ec8 and ec9 16 selected studies using fta or fts were found it can be observed from table 4 that most of these models apply fta not only for qualitative hazard analysis but also for quantitative risk calculations from the perspective of hazard analysis fta is only a qualitative process which provides the required root cause in a simple and highly visible form the analysis results can be provided to complete the needed risk assessment process however in the concept design and development of autonomous ships we focus more on the potential hazards that are remarkably distinct from those of conventional ships such as hazards of communication lines including cyber security hazards of human machine interfaces and hazards related situational awareness the reviewed results in table 6 indicate that the content of ec7 and ec10 is not discussed in detail in the fta framework 5 discussion this study was conducted on a relatively larger number of peer reviewed journal and conference papers in the maritime domain focused on ships the period of published studies between 1970 and may 2020 show that the hazard analysis process is indispensable in enhancing the systemic safety of ships in this section the results obtained based on the research assumptions are discussed including the limitations identified during the performed study 5 1 discussion of analysis results the contribution of this paper is that it examines and evaluates the applicability of 29 hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships the evaluation results may be used as a starting point for assisting designers of autonomous ships in analysing the safety of the innovative system and incorporating safety into the system design it is a positive exploration of developing some novel or improved approaches suitable for the safety requirements of autonomous ships under the review protocol and further analysis the integrated evaluation results of the eligible methods against the criteria are presented in table 6 to summarise the results of the analysis a detailed discussion is presented as follows among the reviewed scientific articles using hazop analysis the contribution of most studies was focused on tankers and container ships and all of them were only applied in conventional ships the finding depicted in fig 9 supports the contribution of this paper additionally there are rather limited studies using hazop analysis to identify the potential hazards of a ship or its subsystems such as the fuel system of the main engine zhan et al 2012 and crude oil tankers vidmar and perkovič 2018 in the study of ahvenjärvi 2009 no available information and mode were provided to demonstrate the application of hazop analysis vidmar and perkovič 2018 used statistics and expert opinion to complete the hazard analysis process and evaluate the probability of potential hazards for oil tankers in addition a relevant comparative analysis of hazop analysis and stpa was performed by sultana et al 2019 the results showed that stpa could be applied to understand the system behaviour of complex systems involving highly automated systems and numerous interactions between the components however the hazop analysis was more suitable for the process system that involved simple interactions and less software recently an interesting thesis zou 2018 reported the use of control hazop analysis for hazard identification by an autonomous ship control system which analysed communication digital hardware software and mechanical items of a guidance controller boundary settings and time were regarded as major obstacles however the key safety requirements of autonomous ships were not discussed in that paper generally hazop analysis focuses on guide words and single events rather than combinations of possible events some hazards not related to a guide word and common cause result in hazards being easily overlooked although hazop analysis was developed to identify the deviations caused by the system in the process industry the deviations in complicated software executing arithmetic human action organization factors are difficult to be identified in the analysis process based on the characteristics of autonomous ships the system relies increasingly on software systems and is further embedded in the socio technical environments thus the human factor is not expected to be fully removed from the system before fully autonomous ships a level become realised fan et al 2020 similarly once an autonomous ship encounters disturbance from external events whose influence and trace are difficult to be captured systematically in the hazop analysis hazop analysis will need to be improved or linked with other techniques for applications to autonomous ships from the reviewed results of fema from table 4 majority studies were found to focus on the potential hazards or failures of hardware meanwhile some studies li et al 2019 shi et al 2019 lazakis et al 2018 allal et al 2017 menis et al 2012 use the combination of fmea and other effective hazard analysis methods to analysis potential hazards the conclusions of these selected studies have shown the advantages of fmea and found the satisfactory solutions applied fmea generally the effectiveness of fmea has been confirmed in some scenarios noteworthy in spite of fmea can thoroughly evaluate potential individual failure modes and provide reliability information the failure of a combination of items has not been considered moreover most accidents and mishaps result from failure combinations in addition the hazards arising from events other than failures cannot be identified effectively furthermore fmea is best initiated during the conceptual design phase functional fmea is generally the most practical and feasible method when systems are highly complex the analysis by functional fmea generally begins at the highest system level and follows a top down way soman et al 2009 and hardware fmeas typically begin at the lowest piece part level and use a bottom up way soman et al 2012 in the study of zou 2018 functional fmea was also conducted to analyse the potential hazards of a guidance system in autonomous ships however this method cannot identify system level hazards ec1 and only searches for single component failure modes furthermore the analysis of human frailties and errors ec6 is easily overlooked these limitations make fmea difficult to be an isolated effective hazard analysis tool for autonomous ships although a wide variety of applications has been proved owing to its generality and permissiveness thus far the application of pna for system safety use is mostly limited to the examination of software control systems thong and ameedeen 2015 leveson and stolzy 1987 horvath et al 2008 bulitko and wilkins 2003 however in the maritime area most of the limited studies focus on a decision making model ma and zhang 2015 wei et al 2009 li and pu 2013 control efficiency zhang et al 2014 and scheduling system wang et al 2009 instead of safety analysis other studies use pns as the graphical and mathematical modelling tools to describe the safety critical behaviour of a control system among the hazard analysis studies using fmea m12 integrates probabilistic linguistic term sets pltss and fuzzy petri nets fpns for the risk assessment and prioritisation of failure modes moreover m15 integrates fuzzy evidential reasoning and fpns to improve the classical fmea analogous to the fpns to acquire the risk priority of the identified failure modes additionally the practice of integrating timed pns consider timing issues in the sequencing with fta has recently become popular hence one can see that pna is not a general purpose hazard analysis tool which can only identify system hazards dealing with timing and state change issues and cannot identify root causes thus pna is unsuitable as a major hazard analysis tool for autonomous ships the conducted analysis of the document collection indicates that fta has been the most concerned hazard analysis tool over the years additionally these studies using fta covered the largest number of specific types of ships in all the reviewed hazard analysis techniques the results imply that fta is a well established extensively used method in the safety engineering field of maritime for investigating design weaknesses importance of components probability of failure and probability of occurrence of various hazard events aksu 2019 cem kuzu et al 2019 ung 2019 however theoretically fta starts with a top undesired event instead of a process or an entire system which reflects the system design from a failure state viewpoint because autonomous ships are still in a conceptual phase with only a few prototypes afloat some new failure states considered relevant for the safety and performance of prospective autonomous systems can be barely modelled completely based on prior knowledge among the reviewed studies fta is primarily used to provide a probability risk assessment identify the undesired event and causal factor combinations and their relative probabilities and determine the high risk fault paths and their mechanisms from the perspective of hazard analysis most of the scenarios present the construction of fts in layers levels and branches using a repetitive analysis process as mentioned above although the individual application of fta inevitably becomes a limitation for hazard analysis of autonomous ships in the development phase the modelling of fts can still provide practical value without complete information according to the previous section eta can be used to model the system and components with different abstraction levels its purpose is to assess all the possible outcomes that can result from an initiating event however an eta can only have one initiating event producing numerous potential outcomes from a single event multiple etas are required when there are multiple initiating events for the complex system thereby making the analysis process difficult and time consuming moreover the connection and dependence between different initiating events are easily ignored from the perspective of complex systems eta is more suitable for the probability risk assessment of the possible outcomes resulting from an initiating event encountering components or subsystems furthermore the finding from fig 9 indicates that all the retrieved studies of eta do not contribute to relevant achievement for autonomous ships with a high loa some discussions on the distinctive features of the growing digitalisation and autonomy including the potential hazards of software intensive systems ec4 communication lines ec5 and human machine interaction ec6 are not attempted to summarise eta can be considered as a supplement to a system level hazard analysis process rather than an independent hazard analysis technique however it plays a significant role in the probability risk assessment of autonomous systems in contrast to other methods stpa has been successfully used in highly automated systems with safety relevance such as aviation plioutsias and karanikas 2015 lu et al 2015 and the automotive industry sotomayor martínez 2015 abdulkhaleq et al 2018 mahajan et al 2017 table 6 summarises the results indicating that stpa is the most promising method for the hazard analysis of autonomous ships similarly table 4 reveals the extensive application of stpa in autonomous ships extensively fig 9 depicts the studies that focus on autonomous ships with high loas contributing to the highest proportion among all the retrieved hazard analysis methods wróbel et al 2018a 2018b used stpa to assess the safety of a remotely controlled merchant vessel and a fully autonomous ship respectively under an identical safety control structure the potential suggestions of increasing the safety of the system were investigated the effectiveness of such measures was assessed and the influence of the uncertainties was discussed these two ground breaking studies with regards to autonomous ships cover almost all the criteria except for ec8 valdez banda et al 2019 proposed a process based on stpa for elaborating an initial hazard analysis and management since the earliest design phase of an autonomous ship incorporating the description of the hazard causal factors and a comprehensive review of the mitigation strategies in this paper two specific concepts of autonomous ferries for urban transport are introduced the hazard identification detected 15 hazards that could lead to the occurrence of the 10 defined accidents which fulfilled eight criteria namely ec1 ec2 ec3 ec4 ec6 ec7 ec9 and ec10 ultimately a safety management strategy composed of 73 safety controls was generated utne et al 2020 integrated stpa and the bayesian belief network bbn to construct a framework for the online risk modelling of autonomous ships in comparison stpa is responsible for hazard identification and analysis with a qualitative approach in this framework herein stpa provides a comprehensive process to identify hazards and reveal the causal factors the case study demonstrates the feasibility of using the qualitative results of stpa to develop nodes and a structure for a bbn to summarise the control system of an autonomous ship can be considered as a combination of individual programmable electronic systems with the basic components of sensor controllers and actuators however the autonomous operation is implemented by the interaction between mechanical systems and systems for communication and the human interface any safety strategy must involve not only all the elements within the individual programmable electronic system but also all the interactions of the components based on the results of the applicability evaluation stpa can better understand the behaviour of the system and develop causal accident scenarios that encompass the entire accident process and not just component level failures and events and their effect on the system operation the possible causes of the accident scenarios identified by stpa cover but are not limited to design errors component failures potential unsafe interaction between the non fault components inadequate software requirement analysis resonance of component performance variability system internal external coordination and vertical horizontal coordination and other social and organisational factors in the shipping industry the development focus changes from mechanical to complex software intensive systems the software share would continue to rise as the cost of electronics goes down in contrast to mechanical components it is difficult for software to exhibit random failure modes whose systematic failures frequently rooted in unsafe interactions moreover with the shift from the manual mode to remote control mode of autonomous ships most of the processes are conducted automatically the remote control from the scc may contribute to a limited perception of the actual state of the controlled process boredom loss of focus skill degradation and loss of situational awareness wahlström et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however as traditional hazard analysis techniques hazop fmea fta and eta relies on the assumption that the separation and individual analysis does not distort the phenomenon or property of interest for centuries these traditional methods broke the system into smaller components examined and analysed each component in isolation and then combined the results in order to understand the behaviour of the composed more specifically this focus on component reliability assumes that robust partitioning and interface control are valid and that components do not interact either directly or indirectly however the greatly increased complexity in software intensive systems these traditional hazard analysis techniques and the assumptions relied may be unsuitable for a complex system on the contrary stpa regards the safety issue of a system as an emergent property of the system the emphasis changes from preventing failures to enforcing constraints on the behaviour of individual components and the interactions among the components additionally the chain of failure events model is a subset of stamp stpa built on stamp can include as a subset all the results derived using the traditional hazard analysis method in this study the results of application evaluation also prove this viewpoint moreover as the safety of autonomous navigation has remained in focus there have been attempts to apply the experience gained in other domains for its quantitative evaluation for autonomous ships the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is impractical to assess the hazards in its reliability and probability based form the analysis time for stpa is longer but a more detailed analysis report is provided thus the possible combination of stpa and other hazard analysis methods can be considered in future work in summary the paper presents a comparison of the different hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships the formulation of the criteria supports the discussion of the applicability in detail the stpa method seems to be a suitable tool for analysing potential hazards for autonomous ships which can be elaborated under design recommendations for innovative technical systems at a high level 5 2 biases and limitations the first limitation of the literature review is the focus on the definition of the search strategy and data gathering process the review protocol should be formulated in such a way that all the potentially valuable documents are covered in the study sample and all the papers that are not related to the topic of the study are rejected however a low relevance paper that does not contribute to this study may be retrieved owing to the diversity and richness of the vocabulary including supply chain management manufacturing configuration of the hull structure dredging of the subsea gas pipelines and ship engine crankcase production process apart from the additional filtering by the subsequent conditioning in the review protocol manual work is still required to reject unrelated papers this results in subjectivity in the selection and analysis of the sample which cannot be completely prevented moreover relevant analysis results are not easily highlighted second although the topic of autonomous ships is currently of great interest within the entire maritime community a surprisingly limited number of papers pay close attention to the hazard analysis process for autonomous ships particularly for high loas some evaluation criteria that closely match the operation features of autonomous ships cannot be fulfilled because the vast majority of hazard analysis methods still focus on conventional ships additionally the analysis results cannot fully reflect the capacity to fulfil the evaluation criteria indicating a potential incompleteness of the selected database nevertheless this may be attributed to the fact that the studies of an autonomous ship remain at a relatively early stage we believe that more relevant achievements will be published in the near future finally more clustering analyses should be conducted to enhance the understanding of the most extensively applied subcategories of each hazard analysis method to reduce the uncertainty that may arise the number of related studies should be expanded as and when the latest studies are released or by integrating more keywords in the review protocol despite some of the limitations encountered by the research this study attempted to provide a general picture of the state of the art hazard analysis methods applied to autonomous ships in addition to defining the corresponding system requirements and evaluation criteria the analysis results indicate a general significance for autonomous systems at various stages of development 6 conclusion this study aimed to assess the applicability of 29 commonly used hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships and review 269 studies in the past nearly 50 years under the review protocol forty seven of the most representative studies were selected to implement the evaluation process twelve system safety requirements and 10 evaluation criteria for autonomous ships were derived using a system engineering approach moreover the clustering of eligible hazard analysis methods with regards to the types of ships and the loas was performed to provide the more sophisticated viewpoint for the research findings the results indicate that stpa can be regarded as the most promising hazard analysis technique for autonomous ships that fulfil all the evaluation criteria the limitations of traditional hazard analysis methods such as hazop fema pna fta and eta were discussed in detail for complex systems involving highly intelligent systems and interactions between components stpa can be applied to understand the system behaviour the novel contribution of this study is the building of an effective framework of the evaluation criteria for hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships that can reflect the system safety needs given that conventional and autonomous vessels will co exist for a considerably long period the future investigations should enforce the discussion regarding the effects of the potential hazards of remotely controlled ships and fully autonomous ships it is essential that more attributes of hazard analysis methods should be considered based on their theory and methodology to improve the reliability of the research results additionally the system model with relevant portions of the physical system to be controlled should be extended to provide automated support for hazard analysis furthermore cost reduction and improvement in the quality of the safety analysis should be achieved by using a common model for both system and safety engineering and by automating parts of the safety analysis acknowledgement this work was partly supported by national key research and development program of china grant number 2018yfc0810402 china apec cooperation fund

21602,the introduction of autonomous ships is shaping the future of the global shipping industry these ships have been successfully tested by stakeholders the minimum safety requirement for autonomous ships is that their operation should be at least as safe as that of conventional manned ships hence it is necessary to use effective analysis methods to conduct a systemic hazard analysis process since the earliest design phase of an autonomous ship in this study we investigate the applicability of 29 hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships system safety requirements and evaluation criteria based on the characteristics of autonomous ships are established using a system engineering approach to this end under a review protocol relevant and extensive studies in the past nearly 50 years are analysed in detail and clustering results of hazard analysis methods regarding the types of ship and the autonomy of levels are provided the findings reveal that traditional hazard analysis methods based on a chain of directly related failure events or component failures cannot ensure adequate safeguarding for autonomous ships in contrast system theoretic process analysis stpa is found to be a highly promising hazard analysis technique that fulfils all the evaluation criteria thus possible combinations of the stpa and other hazard analysis methods may be considered in future research keywords 1 autonomous ship 2 hazard analysis method 3 applicability evaluation 4 system engineering approach 5 safety of transportation 1 introduction following decades of research and development focused on intelligent technologies there is an increasing interest in autonomous ships the topic of autonomous ships is currently of great interest within the entire maritime community this is partly because of the increasing maturity of the technologies related to the support and execution of autonomous ships and partly because of the possibility of decrease in the occurrence of navigational accidents resulting in the improvement in the safety of maritime transportation wróbel et al 2017 in addition to generating a proactive momentum industry leaders are providing strong arguments to convince sceptical experts for the demonstrations of their prototypes and test progress of autonomous ships such as rolls royce 2018 and wärtsilä 2018a 2018b in reality the introduction of autonomous ships in the maritime industry would lead to disruptive changes in maritime traffic conditions the smart systems required by autonomous ships are becoming increasingly complex and software intensive and are composed of not only hardware components but also logic control devices and an increasing number of sensors although some studies have claimed that automation or autonomy can increase the safety of ships porathe et al 2018 burmeister et al 2014 the safety of autonomous navigation has remained in focus it is noteworthy that the minimum requirement for an autonomous vessel is for it to be at least as safe as conventional manned ships zhou et al 2019 presenting an initial high level demand from the perspective of autonomous ships the potential safety and security risks are the primary concerns whose nature needs to be comprehended and which must be expressed and evaluated with the available knowledge before and at the beginning of any voyage additionally changes in the operation mode influence the risk in relation to the autonomous ship itself and its surrounding environment in general the term risk is used in numerous ways and has different definitions depending on the field and context including business economics environment finance and safety the understanding of risk frequently varies depending on the stakeholder and the implication of the risk reduction measure in risk assessment analysts need to make assumptions and simplifications collect and analyse well founded data and develop and use models to represent the phenomena studied zio 2018 system safety is the formal process of identifying and controlling risk with systems becoming increasingly complex and hazardous the occurrence of hazards is inevitable however their risk must and can be made acceptable therefore herein risk is defined as the consequence of a hazard combined with the probability of its occurrence currently numerous studies are focused on the risk related to autonomous ships attempting to formulate a possible model to assess the risk utne et al 2017 rødseth and burmeister 2015 statheros et al 2008 thieme and utne 2017 thieme et al 2018 tam and jones 2018 ozturk and cicek 2019 huang and van gelder 2020 among them ozturk and cicek 2019 focused on the improvement of navigational safety to assess individual collision risk models based on a literature review and analysed the featured parameters of these models this study provides an improved understanding of the use and integration of the parameters and the methods for the decision support system in upcoming autonomous navigation yet unlike the generalized definition of risk the studies of collision risk are mainly confined to the area of ship collision avoidance from the perspective of navigational practice officers on watch shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists to provide support for the decision making of collision avoidance thieme et al 2018 reviewed 64 risk models published since 2005 to investigate the applicability of modelling approaches for autonomous ships the analysis results indicated that most models use historical data expert judgement published data and a combination of these to build the input for the modelling and quantification of the models however autonomous ships have not yet been practically applied and their prototypes are still being tested in some authorised waters moreover hazards leading to disruptive events are extremely uncertain and therefore are difficult to describe and model quantitatively currently there are some inevitable flaws in a few proposed risk assessment models for autonomous ships such as the validity of the risk assessment model thus such risk models are inapplicable for demonstrating the safety compliance of an autonomous ship and cannot be used directly to conduct its risk assessment in the hazard mishap actuation transition process a mishap is an actual event that has occurred and resulted in death injury or loss whereas a hazard is a potential condition that may result in death injury or loss mishaps are the immediate result of actualised hazards these two are different states of the same phenomenon linked by a state transition that must occur from the time and cost saving perspective it is essential that the safety process starts at the concept definition phase and continues throughout the life cycle thus far the necessity of initial hazard analysis of autonomous ships has been affirmed wróbel et al 2018a 2018b zou 2018 perera and murray 2019 rokseth et al 2019 valdez banda et al 2019 thieme et al 2019 wrobel et al 2019 even with very limited existing research in comparison with studies providing risk assessment models currently effective hazard analysis is more suitable for an autonomous ship in the development phase of the system life cycle herein the autonomous ship is regarded as a whole whose system hazards need to be identified eliminated or controlled and documented before the first autonomous ship is released into her actual context of operation risks such as collision risk and grounding risk which are only limited to specific aspects are not discussed however the conclusion of hazard analysis may be used as the input of risk assessment in the near future in this study one or more generic and comprehensive hazard analysis methods applicable to autonomous ships are expected to be stand out after conducting the process of applicability evaluation the evaluation process reviews the papers on 29 hazard analysis methods proposed in the past nearly 50 years and assesses whether these methods can be used to capture the unique aspects of the development and operation of autonomous ships the aim is to identify potential gaps between hazard analysis methods and autonomous ships and provide broader insight and knowledge of perceived trends furthermore the safety requirements of autonomous ships derived by a system engineering approach create a basis for developing an initial safety management strategy of autonomous shipping 2 concept description of autonomous ships thus far there has been no confirmed formal definition of autonomous ships however some relevant definitions bertram 2016 munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 bureau veritas 2017 danish maritime authority 2017 jorgensen 2016 have been discussed and applied which can provide a more accurate identification of autonomous ships in this study the definition of international maritime organization imo was considered which states that a ship can operate independent of human interaction to a varying degree imo 2018 it is worth noting that the overall design structure of an autonomous ship is remarkably different from those of the current conventional ships including the bridge structure setting hull design propulsion system and energy management additionally nearly all the subsystems of autonomous ships are controlled by a remote or an autonomous mode including collision avoidance decision making and ship state monitoring an autonomous vessel may be manned with a reduced crew or unmanned with or without supervision and has the capabilities to make decisions and perform actions with or without a human in the loop therefore it can operate independently of human interaction to a varying degree from a manual to a fully autonomous operation mode there are different levels of autonomy loas additionally the number of on board crew gradually decreases with increasing loa shore control centre scc is a generally accepted terminology for the facility controlling or supervising autonomous ships rolls royce 2016 munin 2012 kongsberg 2017 which collects all the necessary resources needed to either remotely control the ships or monitor the voyages via communication links and be standby ready to take control in case of an emergency an scc is a dedicated physical area detached from the vessel to facilitate the remote control and supervision of ship functions barriers should be arranged towards unwanted events that may affect the capability and availability of the functions of remote control and supervision thus system design with failure tolerance should be considered in an scc the industry leader lloyd s register of shipping has published the taxonomy of loas lloyd s register 2016 ranging from al1 to al6 denoting a fully autonomous ship with no access required during a mission other frameworks aiming to elaborate on the loas have also been developed rødseth and nordahl 2017 danish maritime authority 2017 bureau veritas 2017 masrwg 2017 imo 2018 considering the taxonomies of loas of lloyd s register and the imo as examples when starting from the al3 and r levels respectively only a few crew members are required to authorise decisions with high complexity or high influence as illustrated in fig 1 3 methodology in this paper the framework of the literature review and the evaluation criteria based on a system engineering approach are introduced which aim to provide support for identifying the gaps related to hazard analysis techniques for autonomous ships the results are subsequently used to identify representative papers for further thorough analysis 3 1 method description and preliminaries hazard analysis is not a one time activity but an ongoing process that aims at evaluating the design and determining the possible events that may result in hazards at the system level hazard analysis is a critical step in the early system safety program effort and forms a baseline for the numerous activities that are subsequently conducted as an analysis tool a hazard analysis technique defines a unique analysis methodology e g fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta the technique refers to a specific and unique analysis methodology that is performed following a specific set of rules and provides specific results currently there are over 100 different hazard analysis methods in existence international system safety society 1999 and the number continues to gradually grow however some methods are minor variations of other methods in this study 28 of the most commonly used hazard analysis methods and one novel method are presented preliminary hazard list phl analysis preliminary hazard analysis pha subsystem hazard analysis ssha system hazard analysis sha operating and support hazard analysis o sha health hazard analysis hha requirements hazard analysis rha environmental hazard analysis eha fta eta failure mode and effects analysis fmea hazard and operability hazop analysis functional hazard analysis fuha cause consequence analysis cca common cause failure analysis ccfa software hazard analysis swha process hazard analysis pha test hazard analysis tha fault hazard analysis faha sneak circuit analysis sca markov analysis ma petri net analysis pna barrier analysis ba bent pin analysis bpa management oversight risk tree mort analysis job hazard analysis jha threat hazard analysis tha system of systems hazard analysis sosha and system theoretic process analysis stpa respectively herein a systematic and reproducible approach was applied to collect and filter the data sample the dataset preparation for the literature review was conducted according to the review protocol summarised in table 1 all the papers determined from the scopus database were searched by focusing on the title abstract and keywords the initial search was conducted in october 2019 and subsequently repeated on may 18 2020 to update the sample with the papers published in 2019 finally the search of the selected database resulted in a list of a total of 269 papers among them 150 were conference papers and 119 were articles published in journals to determine the most active intellectual networks in the analysed field science mapping tools were used subsequently to execute the data process the retrieved dataset can be used to outline a general tendency in the scientific production related to the analysed topic the results were grouped into different categories such as the year of publication and the name of the journal for the purpose of analysis as depicted in figs 2 and 3 respectively based on the analysed data sample the number of studies shows an increase starting from 2002 this upward trend is probably due to the focus of the imo on the formal safety assessment fsa in that period the guidelines for fsa for use in the imo rule making process were approved in 2002 msc circ 1023 mepc circ 392 which are used to enhance maritime safety moreover the ongoing development of autonomous shipping will ensure this positive tendency is maintained in the near future years 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 featured the top three highest number of studies published accordingly fig 2 depicts the number of publications with respect to journals and conferences furthermore fig 3 only lists some journals that published more than two articles in the past nearly 50 years the articles of these listed journals account for 44 of the total among them approximately 50 of the papers are published in 4 journals namely safety science ocean engineering naval architect and reliability engineering and system safety under the review protocol the analysis of the content based on the search fields title abstract and keywords can produce the statistics of the most frequent words used by authors herein the data process tool vosviewer waltman et al 2010 van eck and waltman 2010 was used to map the most relevant keywords both author and index keywords network based on the number of their co occurrences in the analysed documents the mapping network is illustrated in fig 4 the normalisation was conducted using an association strength full counting in the network visualisation the keywords were represented by circles the higher the weight of a keyword the larger the circle in the visualisation the distance between two keywords indicated their relatedness the closer two keywords were located to each other the stronger their relatedness analogously the colour code indicated different clusters and the colour bar changed with the published year of the keywords fig 4 depicts that the vast majority of the co occurrence keywords is related to the maritime safety fields however some increasingly well known themes can be still captured based on the changes in the colour of the label we observe that the interest of researchers were focused on risk assessment reliability and accident prevention in the past period however recently the increasingly growing topics of interest are safety engineering hazard analysis uncertainty analysis and process analysis similarly the mapping results also reveal that the stpa as a novel hazard analysis method has attracted extensive attention in recent years 3 2 selection of hazard analysis methods according to the research assumptions a document is considered as relevant for the analysis if the full name or the abbreviation of a specific hazard analysis method is present herein under the review protocol we examined specific hazard analysis methods consecutively the number distribution is depicted in fig 5 it is worth noting that the total number of papers for each method is 293 which seems incorrect but is not in this figure the publications of each method are searched separately some papers reported more than two different hazard analysis methods or their combinations thus the same paper may be presented in different categories fig 5 indicates an interesting finding that 16 hazard analysis methods are not retrieved in any published article or conference paper suggesting that these methods may be unsuitable for executing hazard analysis targeted at ships moreover there are 7 hazard analysis methods present in a few retrieved studies in the past nearly 50 years accounting for only 7 of the total these are ba faha sca cca ccfa ma and pha the possible reasons are elaborated using some methods as examples the phl analysis is similar to a brainstorming session whose primary output is a list of hazards which provides the hazard information that serves as a starting point for pha however phl analysis is only preliminary and a complete hazard description is not always obtained in contrast a more fully investigated and complete hazard description can be achieved with pha thus a large majority of the studies may prefer to adopt pha to obtain a more detailed discussion rather than phl analysis however although 7 papers with the application of pha were retrieved it is still a very basic hazard analysis method based on brainstorming which was formally instituted and promulgated by the developers of mil std 882 moreover it was originally referred to as gross hazard analysis gha because of the performance at a gross preliminary level of detail see mil s 38130 although there are no remarkable disadvantages of the pha technique it is occasionally inappropriately depended on as the only hazard analysis technique for application particularly for autonomous ships similarly sha builds upon ssha and may use other methods such as fta to assess the impact of a certain hazard at the system level the outputs from ssha can be used as the inputs of sha to complete the examination of the entire system the emphasis is on the interactions and the interfaces of all the subsystems because they operate together ericson 2015 the success of sha is highly dependent on the completion of other system safety analyses such as pha ssha and o sha furthermore sca is accomplished by examining electrical circuits and searching unintended control sequences it has been extended for the hazard analysis and evaluation of rocket propulsion spacecrafts missiles and aircrafts yao et al 2019 xu and bao 2015 additionally it is a specialised tool for identifying specific classes of hazards and cannot identify all the system hazards but only those dealing with sneak paths therefore sca should not be used to analyse a system level hazard of autonomous ships at the present stage some other methods such as swha bpa and tha also encounter a similar scenario of inapplicability therefore in this study we only select some methods that have been extensively applied in the maritime field in the past period as the main research objects and evaluate their applicability for autonomous ships the eligible methods are hazop fmea pna eta fta and stpa whose development history and theory are briefly described below the hazop analysis is an organised structured and methodical process that utilises key guide words and system diagrams to search for hazards from the identified potential deviations in the design operational intent and attempts to determine the impact of these deviations on the system it was formulated as a critical examination analysis technique by the institute of chemical industry in the united kingdom in the mid 1960s to identify the possible hazards present in the facilities that manage highly hazardous materials ericson 2015 dunjó et al 2010 since the first publication of the study conducted by lawley in 1974 lawley 1974 the effectiveness of hazop has been demonstrated in identifying environmental safety and health hazards although the hazop analysis was initially developed and used only in the chemical process industry over the years its scope of application has extended to the petroleum food and water and maritime industries because of its success in identifying not only hazards but also operational problems the current studies using hazop have shown that it is applicable to all types of systems and equipment including subsystems assemblies components software procedures environment and human error essentially the technique is not considerably different from pha and ssha except for the application of key guide words fmea is a proactive analysis and reliability tool for evaluating the effect s of the potential failure modes of subsystems assemblies components and functions and for identifying the failure modes that would adversely affect the overall system reliability ericson 2015 akyuz et al 2016 it was developed for the u s military as a formal analysis technique dod 1980 it is a disciplined bottom up method that focuses on the designs or functions of products and processes generally it follows the methodology of dividing a system into smaller functional parts such as devices and diving the devices in turn into components subsequently a piecewise failure analysis is initiated which helps to generate fault related understanding at various complexity levels of a system conceptually functional structural and hybrid approaches are three parts of the fmea process petri nets pns have been available as modelling tools of systems in events since the late 1960s petri 1962 they can be used to model and analyse discrete event dynamic systems pna consists of drawing graphical pn diagrams and their analysis it is an analysis technique for identifying hazards dealing with the timing state transitions sequencing and repair in a real time embedded system correct actions taken extremely early or extremely late can lead to unsafe conditions therefore the analysis incorporated timing information is highly necessary the purpose of pna is to provide a method to graphically model system components over a wide range of abstraction levels to resolve the system reliability safety and dependency issues pns can be used to model an entire system a subsystem or system components over a wide range of abstraction levels from conceptual to detailed design ericson 2015 eta is a powerful tool that identifies and evaluates all the possible consequence paths generated by initiating the events in a potential accident scenario an event tree et is utilised as a visual logic tree structure to execute the analysis procedure the conception of this technique appears to have been developed in the wash 1400 nuclear power plant safety study andrews and dunnett 2000 with minor changes by us from 1975 onward the objective of eta is to determine whether the initiating event develops into a serious mishap or if the event is sufficiently controlled by the safety systems and procedures implemented in the system design ericson 2015 eta is essentially a binary decision diagram to evaluate the various multiple decision paths in a given problem fta is a top down system analysis technique used to determine the root causes and probability of occurrence of a specified undesired event using boolean algebra logic and probability theory the method was originally developed by watson to assist in the design of the minuteman guidance system in 1962 kabir 2017 fta is a graphical method that models the propagation of failures through the system it can be developed in layers levels and branches using a repetitive analysis process this method can be distinguished from qualitative and quantitative fta which determine the critical cut sets css and the probability of failure alternatively some effective extensions of the standard fault tree ft have been presented which can express features that are not expressible in the standard ftas such as dynamic ft fuzzy ft stochastic hybrid ft automaton and phased and time dependent fta ruijters and stoelinga 2015 in this paper fta is classified as a hazard analysis method which is primarily used as a root cause analysis tool to identify and evaluate hazard causal factors however it is comparatively more frequently regarded as a risk assessment tool when fta is regarded as a hazard analysis tool the graphics and logical representation of the various combinations of possible events are shown as fts once these events occur which can cause a predefined undesired event stpa is a relatively novel hazard analysis technique based on an extended model of accident causation initially it was developed by leveson 2011 to improve the design of sociotechnical systems system theoretic accident model and processes stamp provide the theoretical foundation for stpa which expands the traditional causality model beyond the chain of directly related failure events or component failures to include more complex processes and unsafe interactions among the system components this method considers safety as not only a dynamic control problem but also a failure prevention problem emphasising on the change from preventing failures to enforce constraints on the system behaviour the association studies of the above six hazard analysis methods are the vast majority of all the retrieved studies accounting for approximately 93 next these studies are analysed based on whether they fit the aim and scope of our research finally the selected most representative studies of these methods are further analysed in section 4 3 3 evaluation procedure to assess the applicability of the hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships and identify the potential gaps between them a system engineering approach blanchard and blyler 2016 is employed to develop a novel evaluation procedure despite the definition of the system being utilised loosely to describe numerous different scenarios and configurations generally a system comprises a complex combination of resources integrated such that they fulfil a specified operational requirement generally a system is developed to accomplish a specific function or a series of functions with the objective of responding to some identified needs herein the developed evaluation framework can be regarded as a simple system the aim is to determine one or more general hazard analysis methods that can capture the operation characteristics of autonomous ships to ensure and improve their safety in this development process the encountered challenges and potential gaps can be solved by system engineering system engineering may be defined in numerous ways depending on the background and personal experience the system engineering process has the basic steps of requirement analysis functional analysis requirements allocation and design optimisation these steps are iterative by nature evolving from system level definition to a subsystem level and down to the component as one progresses through the life cycle there is a need to ensure the full traceability of the requirements from the system level down to the component level it is noteworthy that inherent to the system engineering process is the need to ensure that this traceability is maintained to facilitate the development process effectively and efficiently thus based on the intended research purpose and scope the basic steps of the system engineering process are tailored and optimised to meet the needs of the system to be developed in summary the application of the evaluation procedures of the hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships is first performed in four steps first the initial definitions of the problem and the desired systems are described to ensure a good beginning a complete description should be presented in specific terms with sufficient detail to justify the progress to the next step second given the problem definition one or more specific system level safety requirement s need to be identified the requirements need to be described in a functional manner to avoid a premature commitment to a specific design concept or configuration third based on the initial identification of the functional safety requirements they need to be linked to specific design objectives to formulate appropriate evaluation criteria the effort can be considered as the benchmark and can provide an indispensable support for the follow on analysis finally eligible hazard analysis methods need to be evaluated against the criteria to accomplish the evaluation procedure the evaluation results can be used to help facilitate the development of hazard analysis methods applicable to autonomous ships in the second step some informative questions blanchard and blyler 2016 which are relevant and important to describe the system level safety requirements in a functional manner are as follows 1 what is required of the system stated in functional terms 2 what specific functions must the system accomplish 3 what are the primary functions to be accomplished 4 what are secondary functions to be accomplished 5 what must be accomplished to completely alleviate the stated deficiency 6 why must these functions be accomplished 7 when must these functions be accomplished 8 where is this to be accomplished and for how long 9 how many times must these functions be accomplished although the specific responses to these questions may slightly overlap their importance is reflected in the ability that can describe the anticipated requirements in a functional manner these questions are used as the guidelines for identifying the system level safety requirements of autonomous ships additionally the answers to the questions provide relevant input for suitable evaluation criteria in the current analytical study the general discussion for the applicability of hazard analysis methods and possible further usage for autonomous ships is presented subsequently the methods that fulfil most of the criteria are further analysed in section 4 to some extent these methods reflect a positive interaction between highly detailed modelling results and the functional safety requirements as summarised in the criteria the applicability and possible learnings from these are highlighted although it is not suggested that these hazard analysis methods may be used as they are they may be used as the basis for developing specific hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships 3 4 evaluation criteria the primary driving forces for autonomous ships are not only to reduce the operating costs and human error but also to induce a real transformation in the industry however the main function and safety requirements are the same as those of the conventional ships which transport cargo or people from one port to another in a safe and timely manner new vessel operational concepts based on autonomous and remote controlled functions should have a level of safety equivalent or better in comparison with the operations of conventional ships with respect to safeguarding life property and environment some key functions have been identified and described for autonomous ships depending on the intended loa and remote operation dnv gl 2018 most scales assume autonomous ships to adhere to a specific loa however they ignore the differences between vessel functions according to the analysis in the previous section the suitable categorisation of the system level safety requirements of autonomous ships should depend on the context they are used in in this study the functional requirements are classified into navigation engineering functions and auxiliary functions which are marked respectively as red green and yellow table 2 summarises the system level safety requirements for autonomous ships navigation functions are conventionally based on a high degree of visual observations and human decisions which frequently include but are not limited to object obstacle detection manoeuvring propulsion control steering berthing and unberthing and collision avoidance in comparison engineering functions are to a high degree fully self controlled and operate under supervision by the crew auxiliary functions mainly indicate fire detection fighting anchoring mooring unmooring and ballast water control however in the context of the introduction of autonomous ships these potential auto remote functions are expended some novel concepts such as the communication lines between autonomous ships and scc cyber security remote supervision and possible operations of maintenance and repair need to be considered independently of human intervention under the framework of autonomous ships it is almost impossible that a fully autonomous ship without human supervision will become a reality in the near future the operation of an autonomous ship will rely on a human autonomous system collaboration ramos et al 2020 in comparison with conventional ships the main expansion with regards to the autonomous or remote controlled capacity is focused on navigation functions the transformation of the operation mode motivates new safety requirements the primary objectives of engineering functions are yet to ensure that the risks associated with the expected and abnormal variations failure and incidents are mitigated by designing necessary redundancy and or fault tolerance in the vessel and its connected systems furthermore necessary auxiliary systems should be considered to support navigation and engineering functions hazard analyses are used to determine the system risk and thereby ascertain the significance of the hazards so that safety design measures can be established to eliminate or mitigate the hazard ericson 2015 different hazard analysis methods describe the differences in the scope coverage detail and life cycle phase timing which reflect and define a point in time when the analysis should begin the level of detail of the analysis the type of information available and the analysis output on the basis of identified safety requirements the evaluation criteria for autonomous ships are derived which can reflect the safety needs the criteria are presented in table 3 the rationale behind the definition and selection of respective evaluation criteria is elaborated in detail as follows traditional hazard analysis methods typically divide the system into smaller components to deal with its complexity examining and analysing each component in isolation however the significantly increased complexity of the current systems along with the introduction of software and algorithms makes it more difficult to anticipate understand plan and protect against all the potential system behaviours in addition the system properties of safety are not related to the behaviours of individual system components but instead to the interactions among the components particularly for autonomous ships system level hazards ec1 need to be identified in addition to the failure of components the system life cycle is analogous to the human life cycle of conception birth childhood adulthood death and burial it is generally condensed and summarised into five major phases as illustrated in fig 6 some prototypes of autonomous ships have been tested however the actual context of their operation is still not released thus according to the research status quo of autonomous ships necessary safety and security analysis should be executed in the development phase ec2 particularly in the preliminary design in addition prior to actual operation all the needs and potential hazards should be determined considering any requirements for the hardware ec3 software and or algorithms ec4 autonomous functions control algorithms and related hardware that are failing to a large extent influence the risk of autonomous ships moreover stable and reliable communication lines ec5 are indispensable and herein the communication line is a wide concept including links among equipment components and ships and the satellite communication links between the autonomous ships and the scc in the shipping industry it is noteworthy that traditional risk management has equalled the physical risks but the growing digitalisation and autonomy have created a need for cyber risk management the existing cyber risk or lack in the necessary security protection for the digital systems may render the ship unseaworthy hence the hazards connected to cyber security can no longer be ignored and must be addressed at the top level of the maritime industry situation awareness is the key element of the decision making processes zhou et al 2019 and a substantial amount of the human machine interaction is indispensable therefore the potential hazards of human machine interfaces ec6 should be considered unlike ec5 which is physical oriented ec7 and ec8 focus on the cooperation and interaction between the actors timely and accurate communication is necessary to detect and resolve potential hazardous scenarios of autonomous ships noteworthy that the communication between operators of autonomous ships and other marine stakeholders is not considered in ec8 the latter may include other ships or manned structures the reason is that shore based operators merely replace the crew in form without any change in the role and responsibility since autonomous or remote controlled vessels will be operated with reduced or no manning on board and such vessels may have different safety states in comparison with those of conventional ships scheduled maintenance and repair cannot be executed immediately when necessary hence the important vessel functions should generally be arranged with fault tolerance or redundancy ec9 to compensate for the failures and incidents that cannot be dealt with by manual work on board dnv gl 2018 it is worth noting that autonomous ships may be operating at one or more degrees of autonomy for the duration of a single voyage imo 2018 different loas may result in different operation modes leading to changes in the interaction between the operators crew onboard and autonomous ship these changes may influence the identification and analysis of hazards thus considering different operational modes and loas ec10 as hazard analysis methods is necessary 4 results in section 3 the retrieved results and clustering results of 29 selected hazard analysis methods were presented fig 2 5 based on further analysis six eligible methods were selected from them namely hazop fmea pna eta fta and stpa here the applicability evaluation of these methods for autonomous ships is presented and the evaluation results and analysis are described in detail 4 1 results of clustering analysis following the procedure of dataset preparation described in section 3 1 272 papers on the above six methods were retrieved after the execution of the search query to obtain more sophisticated findings clustering of the hazard analysis methods was performed for two reasons to provide information regarding the types of ships and the loas according to the research assumptions the scope was restricted to papers pertaining to a ship i e a document was recognised as relevant for the analysis if the individual concept of a ship was the applied object of the hazard analysis method the applied objects in these relevant studies include the ship as a whole subsystems components of a ship or related operations of a ship such as ship repairing operation and ship piloting operation some papers focused on ports and offshore terminals maione et al 2016 mokhtari et al 2011 anita et al 2010 alyami et al 2019 offshore wind turbines zeiler and bertsche 2015 liquefied natural gas lng bunkering operations of ports apostolopoulou et al 2018 scheduling of shipyard block erection systems zhong et al 2010 yu guang et al 2011 wang et al 2009 and ship emissions wen et al 2018 which were excluded from the analysis even if they could be included in the maritime industry after the scrutinizing of applied objects only 205 papers were regarded as relevant to the research goal and the number distribution of each method is depicted in fig 7 among them all the retrieved studies on stpa were relevant however the number of irrelevant studies exceeded the number of relevant studies on pna the studies consistent with our research topic were evaluated in depth herein the types of ships were classified by usage into military ship cargo ship passenger ship fishing ship auxiliary ship engineering ship and high speed craft and offshore unit on this basis the cargo ship was further classified into five categories tanker container ship bulk carrier ro ro ship and multi purpose ship the clustering results by the type of ship are depicted in fig 8 some studies that did not state the specific type of ship as their object of analysis or during their case study were classified into the non declaration category additionally a few studies focused on certain ships based on different propulsion types such as lng fueled ship hu et al 2019 jeong et al 2017 fu et al 2016 li and zhou 2015 all electric ship menis et al 2012 vicenzutti et al 2019 and energy efficient dual fuel diesel natural gas ship guan et al 2016 however because the usage of these ships had not been clarified they were classified into the non declaration category as depicted in fig 8 the vast majority of the studies do not state the specific type of ship but only focus on the subsystems components of a ship liu et al 2019 suo et al 2020 ünver et al 2019 aksu 2019 in these six hazard analysis methods the studies of fta included the largest number of ship types whereas pna had the least except for the non declaration category the most well known types of ship in the analysed dataset were tanker passenger ship and military ship the contribution of these three types of ships accounted for 59 of all the documents in the sample however only one paper was found to be focused on executing the safety assessment or hazard analysis process on a ro ro ship wu et al 2006 a multi purpose ship mai et al 2019 and an offshore unit overfield and collins 2002 moreover regarding the clustering of the autonomy levels the taxonomy of loas by the imo is adopted including m level manual navigation with automated processes and decision support r level remote controlled ship with crew on board ru level remote controlled ship without crew on board and a level autonomous ship some studies overlap with more than one type of loas such as r level ru level and a level in such cases one document is assigned to more than one category the weights depend on the overlap of the number of loas the clustering results by loa are depicted in fig 9 the conducted analysis of loa suggests that stpa seems to be the most dynamic one from these hazard analysis methods the number of papers focused on high levels of autonomy r level ru level a level comprised almost 25 of all the papers considered in this method however all the retrieved studies on the three hazard analysis methods hazop pna and eta were focused on conventional ships m level a few studies have achieved new explorations using fmea and fta which is a positive trend for enhancing the safety of autonomous ships 4 2 results of applicability evaluation after the determination of the data sample obtained using the procedure presented in section 3 1 some representative studies were finally reviewed from the list of the total of 269 studies the literature review conducted systematically was aimed at investigating the technological readiness herein we scrutinized these studies sequentially and grouped them with respect to the methods applied and parameters highlighting the various features of the studies table 4 summarises the attributes of the 47 reviewed studies on the six hazard analysis methods object of analysis aim of study life cycle phase and type of analysis with respect to a specific method there are eight studies using two different hazard analysis methods respectively or their integration to achieve the aim of the study moreover three studies use a graphics and mathematical modelling tool to describe the logical representation including pns m11 m14 and fts m36 the object of analysis reveals the topic and the area of interest of studies or the applied target of case study most studies focus on subsystems components of a ship m1 m3 m6 m8 m10 m13 m14 m17 m23 m27 m36 m41 particularly for machinery systems some analyses started from specific maritime accidents m11 m24 m30 m32 m34 m38 m45 and specific waterways m16 m33 m35 m37 to analyse the root cause or assess the risk few studies aimed at certain types of ships as a whole such as an oil tanker m2 an lng fueled ship m39 m40 until the date of the review protocol although only six studies focused on autonomous ships m19 m29 m42 m44 m46 their contribution has been ground breaking regarding the types of analysis only the analysis process of retrieved studies on hazop and spta is qualitative while fmea fta eta and pna can be applied by qualitative analysis and or quantitative calculation in the system safety discipline the naive hazard analysis methods primarily use the qualitative way to address a majority of safety work based on the advantages provided sometimes the strict use of quantitative methods must be tempered by utility risks are not easily estimated using probability and statistics when the hazard causal factors are not yet well understood however if the hazard analysis process is regarded as a pre analysis for risk assessment or used to address a few high risk hazards it may be necessary to conduct a quantitative analysis for more precise knowledge although most of the reviewed studies aimed at the operation of conventional ships the proposed evaluation criteria reflect the safety requirements of autonomous ships that can effectively overcome the disparity between conventional ships and autonomous ships table 5 summarises the evaluation results of 47 selected studies against the criteria among them only four studies provided sufficient information to fulfil no less than eight criteria in such cases although some studies included considerations similar to the ones in the criteria insufficient information was presented to ensure that these criteria were satisfied as presented 18 studies used hazard analysis methods to analyse system level hazards which fulfilled ec1 most studies focused on the hardware failure of the system or subsystem therefore ec3 was addressed in 39 studies regarding with life cycle phase effective safety analysis was conducted from the early system development phase ec2 in only 11 studies one starts from the production phase and others focus on the operation phase ec4 to ec10 are seven distinctive indicators derived based on the safety requirement of autonomous ships it is difficult for most studies using traditional methods to fulfil these criteria in particular the design of the analysis process is prepared for conventional ships as summarised in table 5 these papers present the performances of the applied hazard analysis methods herein the evaluation of the methods from the perspective of performance was conducted in a comprehensive manner and the results are tabulated for better readability see table 6 spta can fulfil all the evaluation criteria listed in table 3 four novel studies m42 m43 m44 m46 using stpa execute hazard analysis and management process in the concept design phase of an autonomous vessel their conclusions demonstrate the applicability of stpa importantly these four studies use stpa to identify the possible contributors to system hazards which almost cover all the criteria moreover for other methods some additional supplement needs to be elaborated from the depicted result of hazop only four criteria were met in regard to the life cycle phase although all the selected papers focus on the operation phase there is evidence showing that hazop can be used to identify safety issues early in the design process dunjó et al 2010 thus hazop analysis can be considered to meet the descriptions of ec1 ec4 moreover among the retrieved studies on pna pns are typically used with typical hazard analysis techniques such as fmea and fta which are used for knowledge representation and reasoning specifically pna is not a general purpose hazard analysis tool although it can be used in system level hazard analysis genrich and lautenbach 1981 petri 1962 jensen 1991 under the review protocol eight related studies were found to be using eta as the hazard analysis tool in which most of the data sources were based on ship accidents only the descriptions of ec1 ec3 and ec8 were fulfilled however there is evidence that eta can be applied to a system early in the design development thieme et al 2015 bagschik et al 2016 therefore ec2 can be regarded to be within the capacity of eta fmea is used for evaluating the potential individual failure modes and providing reliability information a total of 17 fmea studies were found to assess or discuss subsystems components or failure modes of ships such as ship machinery system lazakis et al 2018 medium voltage direct current shipboard power system soman et al 2009 and oil spill incident from a chemical oil tanker ship li et al 2019 hence fmea can satisfy the descriptions of ec2 5 ec8 and ec9 16 selected studies using fta or fts were found it can be observed from table 4 that most of these models apply fta not only for qualitative hazard analysis but also for quantitative risk calculations from the perspective of hazard analysis fta is only a qualitative process which provides the required root cause in a simple and highly visible form the analysis results can be provided to complete the needed risk assessment process however in the concept design and development of autonomous ships we focus more on the potential hazards that are remarkably distinct from those of conventional ships such as hazards of communication lines including cyber security hazards of human machine interfaces and hazards related situational awareness the reviewed results in table 6 indicate that the content of ec7 and ec10 is not discussed in detail in the fta framework 5 discussion this study was conducted on a relatively larger number of peer reviewed journal and conference papers in the maritime domain focused on ships the period of published studies between 1970 and may 2020 show that the hazard analysis process is indispensable in enhancing the systemic safety of ships in this section the results obtained based on the research assumptions are discussed including the limitations identified during the performed study 5 1 discussion of analysis results the contribution of this paper is that it examines and evaluates the applicability of 29 hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships the evaluation results may be used as a starting point for assisting designers of autonomous ships in analysing the safety of the innovative system and incorporating safety into the system design it is a positive exploration of developing some novel or improved approaches suitable for the safety requirements of autonomous ships under the review protocol and further analysis the integrated evaluation results of the eligible methods against the criteria are presented in table 6 to summarise the results of the analysis a detailed discussion is presented as follows among the reviewed scientific articles using hazop analysis the contribution of most studies was focused on tankers and container ships and all of them were only applied in conventional ships the finding depicted in fig 9 supports the contribution of this paper additionally there are rather limited studies using hazop analysis to identify the potential hazards of a ship or its subsystems such as the fuel system of the main engine zhan et al 2012 and crude oil tankers vidmar and perkovič 2018 in the study of ahvenjärvi 2009 no available information and mode were provided to demonstrate the application of hazop analysis vidmar and perkovič 2018 used statistics and expert opinion to complete the hazard analysis process and evaluate the probability of potential hazards for oil tankers in addition a relevant comparative analysis of hazop analysis and stpa was performed by sultana et al 2019 the results showed that stpa could be applied to understand the system behaviour of complex systems involving highly automated systems and numerous interactions between the components however the hazop analysis was more suitable for the process system that involved simple interactions and less software recently an interesting thesis zou 2018 reported the use of control hazop analysis for hazard identification by an autonomous ship control system which analysed communication digital hardware software and mechanical items of a guidance controller boundary settings and time were regarded as major obstacles however the key safety requirements of autonomous ships were not discussed in that paper generally hazop analysis focuses on guide words and single events rather than combinations of possible events some hazards not related to a guide word and common cause result in hazards being easily overlooked although hazop analysis was developed to identify the deviations caused by the system in the process industry the deviations in complicated software executing arithmetic human action organization factors are difficult to be identified in the analysis process based on the characteristics of autonomous ships the system relies increasingly on software systems and is further embedded in the socio technical environments thus the human factor is not expected to be fully removed from the system before fully autonomous ships a level become realised fan et al 2020 similarly once an autonomous ship encounters disturbance from external events whose influence and trace are difficult to be captured systematically in the hazop analysis hazop analysis will need to be improved or linked with other techniques for applications to autonomous ships from the reviewed results of fema from table 4 majority studies were found to focus on the potential hazards or failures of hardware meanwhile some studies li et al 2019 shi et al 2019 lazakis et al 2018 allal et al 2017 menis et al 2012 use the combination of fmea and other effective hazard analysis methods to analysis potential hazards the conclusions of these selected studies have shown the advantages of fmea and found the satisfactory solutions applied fmea generally the effectiveness of fmea has been confirmed in some scenarios noteworthy in spite of fmea can thoroughly evaluate potential individual failure modes and provide reliability information the failure of a combination of items has not been considered moreover most accidents and mishaps result from failure combinations in addition the hazards arising from events other than failures cannot be identified effectively furthermore fmea is best initiated during the conceptual design phase functional fmea is generally the most practical and feasible method when systems are highly complex the analysis by functional fmea generally begins at the highest system level and follows a top down way soman et al 2009 and hardware fmeas typically begin at the lowest piece part level and use a bottom up way soman et al 2012 in the study of zou 2018 functional fmea was also conducted to analyse the potential hazards of a guidance system in autonomous ships however this method cannot identify system level hazards ec1 and only searches for single component failure modes furthermore the analysis of human frailties and errors ec6 is easily overlooked these limitations make fmea difficult to be an isolated effective hazard analysis tool for autonomous ships although a wide variety of applications has been proved owing to its generality and permissiveness thus far the application of pna for system safety use is mostly limited to the examination of software control systems thong and ameedeen 2015 leveson and stolzy 1987 horvath et al 2008 bulitko and wilkins 2003 however in the maritime area most of the limited studies focus on a decision making model ma and zhang 2015 wei et al 2009 li and pu 2013 control efficiency zhang et al 2014 and scheduling system wang et al 2009 instead of safety analysis other studies use pns as the graphical and mathematical modelling tools to describe the safety critical behaviour of a control system among the hazard analysis studies using fmea m12 integrates probabilistic linguistic term sets pltss and fuzzy petri nets fpns for the risk assessment and prioritisation of failure modes moreover m15 integrates fuzzy evidential reasoning and fpns to improve the classical fmea analogous to the fpns to acquire the risk priority of the identified failure modes additionally the practice of integrating timed pns consider timing issues in the sequencing with fta has recently become popular hence one can see that pna is not a general purpose hazard analysis tool which can only identify system hazards dealing with timing and state change issues and cannot identify root causes thus pna is unsuitable as a major hazard analysis tool for autonomous ships the conducted analysis of the document collection indicates that fta has been the most concerned hazard analysis tool over the years additionally these studies using fta covered the largest number of specific types of ships in all the reviewed hazard analysis techniques the results imply that fta is a well established extensively used method in the safety engineering field of maritime for investigating design weaknesses importance of components probability of failure and probability of occurrence of various hazard events aksu 2019 cem kuzu et al 2019 ung 2019 however theoretically fta starts with a top undesired event instead of a process or an entire system which reflects the system design from a failure state viewpoint because autonomous ships are still in a conceptual phase with only a few prototypes afloat some new failure states considered relevant for the safety and performance of prospective autonomous systems can be barely modelled completely based on prior knowledge among the reviewed studies fta is primarily used to provide a probability risk assessment identify the undesired event and causal factor combinations and their relative probabilities and determine the high risk fault paths and their mechanisms from the perspective of hazard analysis most of the scenarios present the construction of fts in layers levels and branches using a repetitive analysis process as mentioned above although the individual application of fta inevitably becomes a limitation for hazard analysis of autonomous ships in the development phase the modelling of fts can still provide practical value without complete information according to the previous section eta can be used to model the system and components with different abstraction levels its purpose is to assess all the possible outcomes that can result from an initiating event however an eta can only have one initiating event producing numerous potential outcomes from a single event multiple etas are required when there are multiple initiating events for the complex system thereby making the analysis process difficult and time consuming moreover the connection and dependence between different initiating events are easily ignored from the perspective of complex systems eta is more suitable for the probability risk assessment of the possible outcomes resulting from an initiating event encountering components or subsystems furthermore the finding from fig 9 indicates that all the retrieved studies of eta do not contribute to relevant achievement for autonomous ships with a high loa some discussions on the distinctive features of the growing digitalisation and autonomy including the potential hazards of software intensive systems ec4 communication lines ec5 and human machine interaction ec6 are not attempted to summarise eta can be considered as a supplement to a system level hazard analysis process rather than an independent hazard analysis technique however it plays a significant role in the probability risk assessment of autonomous systems in contrast to other methods stpa has been successfully used in highly automated systems with safety relevance such as aviation plioutsias and karanikas 2015 lu et al 2015 and the automotive industry sotomayor martínez 2015 abdulkhaleq et al 2018 mahajan et al 2017 table 6 summarises the results indicating that stpa is the most promising method for the hazard analysis of autonomous ships similarly table 4 reveals the extensive application of stpa in autonomous ships extensively fig 9 depicts the studies that focus on autonomous ships with high loas contributing to the highest proportion among all the retrieved hazard analysis methods wróbel et al 2018a 2018b used stpa to assess the safety of a remotely controlled merchant vessel and a fully autonomous ship respectively under an identical safety control structure the potential suggestions of increasing the safety of the system were investigated the effectiveness of such measures was assessed and the influence of the uncertainties was discussed these two ground breaking studies with regards to autonomous ships cover almost all the criteria except for ec8 valdez banda et al 2019 proposed a process based on stpa for elaborating an initial hazard analysis and management since the earliest design phase of an autonomous ship incorporating the description of the hazard causal factors and a comprehensive review of the mitigation strategies in this paper two specific concepts of autonomous ferries for urban transport are introduced the hazard identification detected 15 hazards that could lead to the occurrence of the 10 defined accidents which fulfilled eight criteria namely ec1 ec2 ec3 ec4 ec6 ec7 ec9 and ec10 ultimately a safety management strategy composed of 73 safety controls was generated utne et al 2020 integrated stpa and the bayesian belief network bbn to construct a framework for the online risk modelling of autonomous ships in comparison stpa is responsible for hazard identification and analysis with a qualitative approach in this framework herein stpa provides a comprehensive process to identify hazards and reveal the causal factors the case study demonstrates the feasibility of using the qualitative results of stpa to develop nodes and a structure for a bbn to summarise the control system of an autonomous ship can be considered as a combination of individual programmable electronic systems with the basic components of sensor controllers and actuators however the autonomous operation is implemented by the interaction between mechanical systems and systems for communication and the human interface any safety strategy must involve not only all the elements within the individual programmable electronic system but also all the interactions of the components based on the results of the applicability evaluation stpa can better understand the behaviour of the system and develop causal accident scenarios that encompass the entire accident process and not just component level failures and events and their effect on the system operation the possible causes of the accident scenarios identified by stpa cover but are not limited to design errors component failures potential unsafe interaction between the non fault components inadequate software requirement analysis resonance of component performance variability system internal external coordination and vertical horizontal coordination and other social and organisational factors in the shipping industry the development focus changes from mechanical to complex software intensive systems the software share would continue to rise as the cost of electronics goes down in contrast to mechanical components it is difficult for software to exhibit random failure modes whose systematic failures frequently rooted in unsafe interactions moreover with the shift from the manual mode to remote control mode of autonomous ships most of the processes are conducted automatically the remote control from the scc may contribute to a limited perception of the actual state of the controlled process boredom loss of focus skill degradation and loss of situational awareness wahlström et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however as traditional hazard analysis techniques hazop fmea fta and eta relies on the assumption that the separation and individual analysis does not distort the phenomenon or property of interest for centuries these traditional methods broke the system into smaller components examined and analysed each component in isolation and then combined the results in order to understand the behaviour of the composed more specifically this focus on component reliability assumes that robust partitioning and interface control are valid and that components do not interact either directly or indirectly however the greatly increased complexity in software intensive systems these traditional hazard analysis techniques and the assumptions relied may be unsuitable for a complex system on the contrary stpa regards the safety issue of a system as an emergent property of the system the emphasis changes from preventing failures to enforcing constraints on the behaviour of individual components and the interactions among the components additionally the chain of failure events model is a subset of stamp stpa built on stamp can include as a subset all the results derived using the traditional hazard analysis method in this study the results of application evaluation also prove this viewpoint moreover as the safety of autonomous navigation has remained in focus there have been attempts to apply the experience gained in other domains for its quantitative evaluation for autonomous ships the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is impractical to assess the hazards in its reliability and probability based form the analysis time for stpa is longer but a more detailed analysis report is provided thus the possible combination of stpa and other hazard analysis methods can be considered in future work in summary the paper presents a comparison of the different hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships the formulation of the criteria supports the discussion of the applicability in detail the stpa method seems to be a suitable tool for analysing potential hazards for autonomous ships which can be elaborated under design recommendations for innovative technical systems at a high level 5 2 biases and limitations the first limitation of the literature review is the focus on the definition of the search strategy and data gathering process the review protocol should be formulated in such a way that all the potentially valuable documents are covered in the study sample and all the papers that are not related to the topic of the study are rejected however a low relevance paper that does not contribute to this study may be retrieved owing to the diversity and richness of the vocabulary including supply chain management manufacturing configuration of the hull structure dredging of the subsea gas pipelines and ship engine crankcase production process apart from the additional filtering by the subsequent conditioning in the review protocol manual work is still required to reject unrelated papers this results in subjectivity in the selection and analysis of the sample which cannot be completely prevented moreover relevant analysis results are not easily highlighted second although the topic of autonomous ships is currently of great interest within the entire maritime community a surprisingly limited number of papers pay close attention to the hazard analysis process for autonomous ships particularly for high loas some evaluation criteria that closely match the operation features of autonomous ships cannot be fulfilled because the vast majority of hazard analysis methods still focus on conventional ships additionally the analysis results cannot fully reflect the capacity to fulfil the evaluation criteria indicating a potential incompleteness of the selected database nevertheless this may be attributed to the fact that the studies of an autonomous ship remain at a relatively early stage we believe that more relevant achievements will be published in the near future finally more clustering analyses should be conducted to enhance the understanding of the most extensively applied subcategories of each hazard analysis method to reduce the uncertainty that may arise the number of related studies should be expanded as and when the latest studies are released or by integrating more keywords in the review protocol despite some of the limitations encountered by the research this study attempted to provide a general picture of the state of the art hazard analysis methods applied to autonomous ships in addition to defining the corresponding system requirements and evaluation criteria the analysis results indicate a general significance for autonomous systems at various stages of development 6 conclusion this study aimed to assess the applicability of 29 commonly used hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships and review 269 studies in the past nearly 50 years under the review protocol forty seven of the most representative studies were selected to implement the evaluation process twelve system safety requirements and 10 evaluation criteria for autonomous ships were derived using a system engineering approach moreover the clustering of eligible hazard analysis methods with regards to the types of ships and the loas was performed to provide the more sophisticated viewpoint for the research findings the results indicate that stpa can be regarded as the most promising hazard analysis technique for autonomous ships that fulfil all the evaluation criteria the limitations of traditional hazard analysis methods such as hazop fema pna fta and eta were discussed in detail for complex systems involving highly intelligent systems and interactions between components stpa can be applied to understand the system behaviour the novel contribution of this study is the building of an effective framework of the evaluation criteria for hazard analysis methods for autonomous ships that can reflect the system safety needs given that conventional and autonomous vessels will co exist for a considerably long period the future investigations should enforce the discussion regarding the effects of the potential hazards of remotely controlled ships and fully autonomous ships it is essential that more attributes of hazard analysis methods should be considered based on their theory and methodology to improve the reliability of the research results additionally the system model with relevant portions of the physical system to be controlled should be extended to provide automated support for hazard analysis furthermore cost reduction and improvement in the quality of the safety analysis should be achieved by using a common model for both system and safety engineering and by automating parts of the safety analysis acknowledgement this work was partly supported by national key research and development program of china grant number 2018yfc0810402 china apec cooperation fund

21603,this paper investigates a novel robust path following control scheme for unmanned surface vehicle usv with unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation in the guidance loop an improved predictor line of sight plos guidance law is presented which is used in any parametric paths in the control loop we propose a yaw rate controller and a surge speed controller using trajectory linearization control tlc technology finite time nonlinear tracking differentiator ftntd minimal learning parameter mlp technique and auxiliary system the advantages of the developed scheme are that first the proposed plos provides the estimates of unknown sideslip angle and currents second the introduced tlc has a concise structure and strong robustness and enhanced tlc only needs two parameters to be adjusted a mlp technique is constructed to approximate lumped unknown dynamics where the norm of all the weights is estimated instead of estimating each element to reduce computational burden a ftntd is concurrently used to achieve satisfactory differential and filter performance subsequently a smooth auxiliary system is applied to handle input saturation constraint on actuator theoretical analysis illuminates that the system is semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sgubb the effectiveness of the developed scheme is verified by simulation comparison and the error quantification performance keywords unmanned surface vehicle path following line of sight trajectory linearization control technology minimal learning parameter finite time nonlinear tracking differentiator 1 introduction in recent years unmanned surface vehicle usv has attracted significant attention due to characterized by small size low cost autonomy and intelligence which is deployed to conduct various missions such as rescue exploration military etc zhao et al 2002 liu and bucknall 2018 kim 2018 wang and han 2016 zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b since usv has been always working in the unstructured and extreme environment it invariably suffers from uncertainties and unknown external disturbances which inevitably lead to a challenging issue on accurate path following peng et al 2019 shen et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 paliotta et al 2019 liu et al 2018 consequently it is very necessary to design a high precision path following controller in the existing research works a popular and effective guidance algorithm adopted in path following is the line of sight los guidance caharija et al 2016 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2019a 2018 zheng et al 2018 fossen and pettersen 2014 the main idea is to implement a lookahead based los guidance law mimicking a helmsman and generate a desired heading angle which is fed into the inner dynamics loop in liu et al 2016a an integral los ilos algorithm is adopted to provide the guidance law where the integral term is used to eliminate the influence of sideslip angle by proposing a time varying lookahead distance an ilos guidance law is modified in lekkas 2014 since different lookahead distances result in different maneuvering behaviors the paper fossen et al 2015 proposes an adaptive los alos algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles in which an adaptive law is constructed to handle the unknown sideslip angle in liu et al 2017a a novel guidance control method is presented for underactuated usv where the unknown sideslip angle is estimated using a reduced order extended state observer eso the paper liu et al 2016b develops a predictor based los plos control strategy for underactuated usv where the predictor is presented to identify the unknown vehicle sideslip a novel finite time plos ftplos guidance law is proposed for usvs in yu et al 2018 compared with liu et al 2016b ftplos is able to errors converge to zero in fixed time with better performance transient nevertheless the aforementioned literature ignored ocean currents in guidance law design which would result in the undesirable control performance of systems in zheng and sun 2016 a modified ailos guidance method is developed to provide the desired yaw and compensate for the currents the paper miao et al 2017 presents a compound los clos guidance algorithm where the proposed guidance law is not only suitable for fast changing curvilinear paths but also can handle the unknown sideslip angle and currents similar to the former problem the design control subsystem provides the actual signals to track given signals governed by the guidance system some related research works have been extensively investigated in yu et al 2019a a concise and effective control strategy is synthesized by combining the integral sliding mode method which is to ensure that tracking errors can precisely converge to zero within a finitely short time an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc law is developed for underactuated surface vehicles in yu et al 2019b and its advantage is that the velocity does not need to be measured using dynamic surface control dsc method the paper shin et al 2017 presents the velocity and course angle controllers whose advantage is to follow several way points and velocity command in qiu et al 2019a a novel robust control approach is developed using tlc technology for usv where the proposed yaw rate controller is not only simple in structure but also robust the paper wang et al 2014 proposes a novel cooperative control scheme for multiple usvs compared with previous works peng et al 2013 2011 the assumption of measurable velocities is relaxed by the observer based control it is worthwhile to mention that usv is easily affected by external factors during the mission various ways have been adopted to handle uncertainties and disturbances such as neural networks nns van 2019 qiu et al 2019b yan et al 2016 fuzzy systems wang and er 2016 peng et al 2018 disturbance observers shao and wang 2015a qiu et al 2019c shao and wang 2015b 2014 and so on nn is one of the classic ways to deal with the lumped unknown dynamics but the number of nn nodes determines the approximation ability and with the increase of nn nodes it undoubtedly increases the computing burden of the controller in mu et al 2019 a minimal learning parameter mlp technique replaces radial basis function nn rbfnn to online compensate uncertainties and disturbances the main principle is that a single parameter replaces all weights online learning and thereby reducing the computational burden online besides input saturation du et al 2016 chen et al 2011 is common and inevitable which may lead to system instability considering disturbances and input saturation the paper zhu et al 2019 develops a novel adaptive nn control strategy in which a hyperbolic tangent function is used to eliminate actuator saturation the paper zheng and feroskhan 2017 introduces an auxiliary design system to handle input saturation unlike mu et al 2019 du et al 2016 it avoided the singularity problem by using the switching function in this paper in order to address problems of unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation in path following an innovative fuzzy plos fplos based tlc scheme is developed and achieved accurate path following of the underactuated usv this paper covers the following three contributions 1 a fplos guidance law is presented to provide the desired heading and identify the unknown sideslip angle and currents simultaneously in a uniform form for all kinds of parametric paths in which a fuzzy algorithm is adopted to online optimize the lookahead distance to achieve better convergence quality 2 based on three degrees of freedom model an enhanced tlc technology is first used to develop a path following controller for underactuated usv as a result only two parameters of the enhanced tlc need to be adjusted which makes it easy to implement in practice 3 fully consider many practical situations a mlp technique with less calculation burden and an adaptive robust term are used to handle lumped unknown dynamics and approximation errors respectively and an auxiliary system based on smooth switching function is incorporated in the control subsection to solve the issue of actuator saturation the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 states some preliminaries and problem formulations section 3 presents a guidance control strategy for underactuated usv in section 4 stability analysis is given section 5 is the simulation result verification section 6 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 preliminaries for a given vector represents the absolute value of and

2019c shao and wang 2015b tlc is a nonlinear time varying control technique in tracking and decoupling which consists of an open loop nonlinear dynamic inversion and a linear time varying ltv feedback stabilization as illustrated in fig 1 the nominal controller is adopted to calculate τ by ψ d u d which can approximately cancel the plant nonlinearity in the open loop a closed loop tracking error regulator τ is used to reduce the tracking error which facilitates the controlled object to get a good dynamic response hence tlc produces robust stability and anti interference ability for which tlc has been reported to be applied to missile mobile robot car like ground vehicle shao and wang 2015b liu et al 2008 chen and zhu 2017 neural network for any nonlinear function δ f x ℜ m ℜ over a

equations of underactuated usv in horizontal plane is described as 8 x u r cos ψ v r sin ψ v x y u r sin ψ v r cos ψ v y ψ r where x y ψ describe the inertial frame i position and heading respectively u r v r r include the body fixed frame b surge sway and yaw velocities respectively v x v y represent ocean current velocity in i and the current velocity u c v c in b meets 9 u c v c t r t ψ v x v y

constants assumption 2 suppose v x v y are irrotational and constant such as u c v x 2 v y 2 and the direction β c atan 2 v y v x assumption 3 the given command heading ψ d can be accurately tracked by actual heading ψ assumption 4 the velocity vectors u r v r r are measurable remark 3 from li et al 2008 the sway velocity v r is passive bounded control objective we design a guidance law for ψ d and a novel control law for the yaw moment τ r and the surge force τ u with lumped unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation so that usv tracks a given path x f ω y f ω with arbitrarily small error this is lim t x x f υ x lim t y y f υ y lim t u r u r d υ u where u r d denotes the desired surge velocity and υ x υ y υ u are small positive constants 3 guidance control system design in this section the developed control scheme is shown in fig 2 we can see from fig 2 that it consists mainly of an adaptive fplos guidance and a composite control strategy the proposed guidance strategy provides the guidance heading angle and identifies unknown sideslip angle and currents the proposed composite control strategy includes two parts a yaw rate control and a surge speed control which ensures that the velocity and attitude track the virtual command produced by guidance system 3 1 fplos guidance 3 1 1 sideslip angle and ocean current identification in the guidance loop fig 3 depicts that p f ω x f ω y f ω t is the reference path of independent variable ω and ψ f ω atan 2 y f ω x f ω is the path tangential angle where x f ω x f ω y f ω y f ω β r atan 2 v r u r represents the sideslip angle and ψ w ψ β r is course angle x e y e t is the position error which in the x s f o y s f frame can be expressed as 13 x e y e cos ψ f sin ψ f sin ψ f cos ψ f t x x f ω y y f ω differentiating x e and y e along 8 yields 14 x e u r cos ψ ψ f cos β r u r sin ψ ψ f sin β r ψ f y e θ x u f y e u r sin ψ ψ f cos β r u r cos ψ ψ f sin β r ψ f x e θ y where u r u r 2 v r 2 and 0 u

then 14 is reduced to 15 x e u r cos ψ ψ f u r sin ψ ψ f β r ψ f y e θ x u f y e u r sin ψ ψ f u r cos ψ ψ f β r ψ f x e θ y in order to handle unknown sideslip angle and ocean currents two predictors

y f ω we expect to select a smaller δ when the usv is close to x f ω y f ω we expect to select a larger δ remark 4 different from the existing plos guidance in liu et al 2016b δ of this paper is a variable lookahead distance its main advantage is to optimize δ through fuzzy algorithm thereby producing an aggressive behavior to decrease y e faster thus δ is designed as δ δ min δ max δ min in which is the output of fuzzy algorithm the velocity u f is designed to stabilize x e as virtual input which is determined by 23 u f u r cos ψ ψ f u r sin ψ ψ f β ˆ r k p x ˆ e θ ˆ x where k p is a

are obtained by mu et al 2018 and initial conditions of usv are x 0 y 0 ψ 0 10 0 0 u r 0 v r 0 r 0 0 01 0 0 the design parameters are described in table 1 meanwhile under the same design parameters we consider the following two scenarios case 1 under the same control method to verify the effectiveness of the guidance strategy a comparative simulation was given between fplos and plos case 2 the proposed scheme excluding actuator saturation is marked as without sa in order to verify the performance of the control method we conducted a comparative analysis among tlc fplos with sa tlc fplos without sa and backstepping adaptive method remark 7 to better tune the parameters some suggestions are provided through trial and error we choose design parameters k x k y k 1 k 2 then ϖ 1 i and ϖ u 2 of tlc are chosen using pole assignment technique r i play a significant role in all parameters of ftntd in a certain range as r i becomes larger ftntd has a fast convergence and noise tolerance the selection principles of γ 1 γ 1 κ r 2 k ζ j κ u 1 and k s j are multiple adjustments in a small range in short design parameters need to be adjusted together instead of single parameter adjustment in case 1 simulation results are shown in figs 6 11 and mia indexes of the error are provided in table 2 it can be seen from fig 6 that the reference path can be accurately tracked by the proposed fplos with fast transient response position errors x e and y e are shown in fig 7 since the lookahead distance δ is optimized by fuzzy algorithm y e of fplos achieves a faster convergence than plos fig 8 demonstrates that the auxiliary system can satisfactorily handle input saturation fig 9 shows that the actual heading can effectively track the given heading figs 10 11 depict that estimation errors θ

33 3 of plos although fplos needs to adjust multiple parameters the proposed fplos achieves satisfactory control performance in case 2 the simulation results are plotted in figs 12 17 and indices of tracking error are provided in table 3 fig 12 depicts that the tlc fplos scheme with sa provides better convergence and tracking performance than without sa and backstepping method we can also further observe in fig 13 that the position errors under tlc fplos with sa converge almost zero and the ones by the other two control methods oscillate around zero fig 14 demonstrates the control inputs τ u τ r of three controllers and input saturation problems of tlc fplos with sa and backstepping are effectively compensated by auxiliary dynamic system however a large initial value is generated by tlc fplos without sa which affects the stability and performance of the system fig 15 shows that actual heading can track the guidance heading with arbitrarily small error under tlc fplos with sa fig 16 17 show that the sideslip angle and ocean currents can be effectively estimated it can be seen from table 3 that the tlc fplos with sa indicates better tracking performance 6 conclusion this paper focuses on the study of path following control problem for underactuated usv in the presence of unknown dynamics ocean currents and input saturation the proposed fplos not only calculates the desired heading but also provides an estimation and compensation of sideslip angle and ocean currents more importantly tlc is introduced into underactuated usv field to develop a practical path following controller as new effective technique and the enhanced tlc only needs to regulate two parameters in addition lumped unknown dynamics and actuator saturation are compensated by mlp technique and auxiliary dynamic system respectively the superiority and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy are also confirmed using simulation results and comparisons in two cases the next step work is to consider the application of this method in cooperative path following and trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles kumar et al 2018 garg et al 2019 2018 aggarwal and kumar 2020 li et al 2019

21603,this paper investigates a novel robust path following control scheme for unmanned surface vehicle usv with unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation in the guidance loop an improved predictor line of sight plos guidance law is presented which is used in any parametric paths in the control loop we propose a yaw rate controller and a surge speed controller using trajectory linearization control tlc technology finite time nonlinear tracking differentiator ftntd minimal learning parameter mlp technique and auxiliary system the advantages of the developed scheme are that first the proposed plos provides the estimates of unknown sideslip angle and currents second the introduced tlc has a concise structure and strong robustness and enhanced tlc only needs two parameters to be adjusted a mlp technique is constructed to approximate lumped unknown dynamics where the norm of all the weights is estimated instead of estimating each element to reduce computational burden a ftntd is concurrently used to achieve satisfactory differential and filter performance subsequently a smooth auxiliary system is applied to handle input saturation constraint on actuator theoretical analysis illuminates that the system is semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sgubb the effectiveness of the developed scheme is verified by simulation comparison and the error quantification performance keywords unmanned surface vehicle path following line of sight trajectory linearization control technology minimal learning parameter finite time nonlinear tracking differentiator 1 introduction in recent years unmanned surface vehicle usv has attracted significant attention due to characterized by small size low cost autonomy and intelligence which is deployed to conduct various missions such as rescue exploration military etc zhao et al 2002 liu and bucknall 2018 kim 2018 wang and han 2016 zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b since usv has been always working in the unstructured and extreme environment it invariably suffers from uncertainties and unknown external disturbances which inevitably lead to a challenging issue on accurate path following peng et al 2019 shen et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 paliotta et al 2019 liu et al 2018 consequently it is very necessary to design a high precision path following controller in the existing research works a popular and effective guidance algorithm adopted in path following is the line of sight los guidance caharija et al 2016 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2019a 2018 zheng et al 2018 fossen and pettersen 2014 the main idea is to implement a lookahead based los guidance law mimicking a helmsman and generate a desired heading angle which is fed into the inner dynamics loop in liu et al 2016a an integral los ilos algorithm is adopted to provide the guidance law where the integral term is used to eliminate the influence of sideslip angle by proposing a time varying lookahead distance an ilos guidance law is modified in lekkas 2014 since different lookahead distances result in different maneuvering behaviors the paper fossen et al 2015 proposes an adaptive los alos algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles in which an adaptive law is constructed to handle the unknown sideslip angle in liu et al 2017a a novel guidance control method is presented for underactuated usv where the unknown sideslip angle is estimated using a reduced order extended state observer eso the paper liu et al 2016b develops a predictor based los plos control strategy for underactuated usv where the predictor is presented to identify the unknown vehicle sideslip a novel finite time plos ftplos guidance law is proposed for usvs in yu et al 2018 compared with liu et al 2016b ftplos is able to errors converge to zero in fixed time with better performance transient nevertheless the aforementioned literature ignored ocean currents in guidance law design which would result in the undesirable control performance of systems in zheng and sun 2016 a modified ailos guidance method is developed to provide the desired yaw and compensate for the currents the paper miao et al 2017 presents a compound los clos guidance algorithm where the proposed guidance law is not only suitable for fast changing curvilinear paths but also can handle the unknown sideslip angle and currents similar to the former problem the design control subsystem provides the actual signals to track given signals governed by the guidance system some related research works have been extensively investigated in yu et al 2019a a concise and effective control strategy is synthesized by combining the integral sliding mode method which is to ensure that tracking errors can precisely converge to zero within a finitely short time an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control afsmc law is developed for underactuated surface vehicles in yu et al 2019b and its advantage is that the velocity does not need to be measured using dynamic surface control dsc method the paper shin et al 2017 presents the velocity and course angle controllers whose advantage is to follow several way points and velocity command in qiu et al 2019a a novel robust control approach is developed using tlc technology for usv where the proposed yaw rate controller is not only simple in structure but also robust the paper wang et al 2014 proposes a novel cooperative control scheme for multiple usvs compared with previous works peng et al 2013 2011 the assumption of measurable velocities is relaxed by the observer based control it is worthwhile to mention that usv is easily affected by external factors during the mission various ways have been adopted to handle uncertainties and disturbances such as neural networks nns van 2019 qiu et al 2019b yan et al 2016 fuzzy systems wang and er 2016 peng et al 2018 disturbance observers shao and wang 2015a qiu et al 2019c shao and wang 2015b 2014 and so on nn is one of the classic ways to deal with the lumped unknown dynamics but the number of nn nodes determines the approximation ability and with the increase of nn nodes it undoubtedly increases the computing burden of the controller in mu et al 2019 a minimal learning parameter mlp technique replaces radial basis function nn rbfnn to online compensate uncertainties and disturbances the main principle is that a single parameter replaces all weights online learning and thereby reducing the computational burden online besides input saturation du et al 2016 chen et al 2011 is common and inevitable which may lead to system instability considering disturbances and input saturation the paper zhu et al 2019 develops a novel adaptive nn control strategy in which a hyperbolic tangent function is used to eliminate actuator saturation the paper zheng and feroskhan 2017 introduces an auxiliary design system to handle input saturation unlike mu et al 2019 du et al 2016 it avoided the singularity problem by using the switching function in this paper in order to address problems of unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation in path following an innovative fuzzy plos fplos based tlc scheme is developed and achieved accurate path following of the underactuated usv this paper covers the following three contributions 1 a fplos guidance law is presented to provide the desired heading and identify the unknown sideslip angle and currents simultaneously in a uniform form for all kinds of parametric paths in which a fuzzy algorithm is adopted to online optimize the lookahead distance to achieve better convergence quality 2 based on three degrees of freedom model an enhanced tlc technology is first used to develop a path following controller for underactuated usv as a result only two parameters of the enhanced tlc need to be adjusted which makes it easy to implement in practice 3 fully consider many practical situations a mlp technique with less calculation burden and an adaptive robust term are used to handle lumped unknown dynamics and approximation errors respectively and an auxiliary system based on smooth switching function is incorporated in the control subsection to solve the issue of actuator saturation the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 states some preliminaries and problem formulations section 3 presents a guidance control strategy for underactuated usv in section 4 stability analysis is given section 5 is the simulation result verification section 6 concludes this paper 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 preliminaries for a given vector represents the absolute value of and

2019c shao and wang 2015b tlc is a nonlinear time varying control technique in tracking and decoupling which consists of an open loop nonlinear dynamic inversion and a linear time varying ltv feedback stabilization as illustrated in fig 1 the nominal controller is adopted to calculate τ by ψ d u d which can approximately cancel the plant nonlinearity in the open loop a closed loop tracking error regulator τ is used to reduce the tracking error which facilitates the controlled object to get a good dynamic response hence tlc produces robust stability and anti interference ability for which tlc has been reported to be applied to missile mobile robot car like ground vehicle shao and wang 2015b liu et al 2008 chen and zhu 2017 neural network for any nonlinear function δ f x ℜ m ℜ over a

and width of the gaussian function respectively remark 2 we know that increasing nodes can enhance the approximation ability of rbfnn but it also increases the computational burden in this note a mlp technique is introduced to reduce the computational complexity by defining a constant ξ w 2 and ξ ˆ is adopted to estimate the weight vector 2 2 problem formulation from fossen 2012 the kinematics equations of underactuated usv in horizontal plane is described as 8 x u r cos ψ v r sin ψ v x y u r sin ψ v r cos ψ v y ψ r where x y ψ describe the inertial frame i position and heading respectively u r v r r include the body fixed frame b surge sway and yaw velocities respectively v x v y represent ocean current velocity in i and the current velocity u c v c in b meets 9 u c v c t r t ψ v x v y t where r t ψ cos ψ sin ψ sin ψ cos ψ is the rotation matrix the generalized velocities u u c u r v v c v r according to theorem 2 in fossen 2012 the dynamic equations are written as 10 u r m 22 m 11

by actual heading ψ assumption 4 the velocity vectors u r v r r are measurable remark 3 from li et al 2008 the sway velocity v r is passive bounded control objective we design a guidance law for ψ d and a novel control law for the yaw moment τ r and the surge force τ u with lumped unknown dynamics currents and actuator saturation so that usv tracks a given path x f ω y f ω with arbitrarily small error this is lim t x x f υ x lim t y y f υ y lim t u r u r d υ u where u r d denotes the desired surge velocity and υ x υ y υ u are small positive constants 3 guidance control system design in this section the developed control scheme is shown in fig 2 we can see from fig 2 that it consists mainly of an adaptive fplos guidance and a composite control strategy the proposed guidance strategy provides the guidance heading angle and identifies unknown sideslip angle and currents the proposed composite control strategy includes two parts a yaw rate control and a surge speed control which ensures that the velocity and attitude track the virtual command produced by guidance system 3 1 fplos guidance 3 1 1 sideslip angle and ocean current identification in the guidance loop fig 3 depicts that p f ω x f ω y f ω t is the reference path of independent variable ω and ψ f ω atan 2 y f ω x f ω is the path tangential angle where x f ω x f ω y f ω y f ω β r atan 2 v r u r represents the sideslip angle and ψ w ψ β r is course angle x e y e t is the position error which in the x s f o y s f frame can be expressed as 13 x e y e cos ψ f sin ψ f sin ψ f cos ψ f t x x f ω y y f ω differentiating x e and y e along 8 yields 14 x e u r cos ψ ψ f cos β r u r sin ψ ψ f sin β r ψ f y e θ x u f y e u r sin ψ ψ f cos β r u r cos ψ ψ f sin β r ψ f x e θ y where u r u r 2 v r 2 and 0 u

then 14 is reduced to 15 x e u r cos ψ ψ f u r sin ψ ψ f β r ψ f y e θ x u f y e u r sin ψ ψ f u r cos ψ ψ f β r ψ f x e θ y in order to handle unknown sideslip angle and ocean currents two predictors

y f ω we expect to select a smaller δ when the usv is close to x f ω y f ω we expect to select a larger δ remark 4 different from the existing plos guidance in liu et al 2016b δ of this paper is a variable lookahead distance its main advantage is to optimize δ through fuzzy algorithm thereby producing an aggressive behavior to decrease y e faster thus δ is designed as δ δ min δ max δ min in which is the output of fuzzy algorithm the velocity u f is designed to stabilize x e as virtual input which is determined by 23 u f u r cos ψ ψ f u r sin ψ ψ f β ˆ r k p x ˆ e θ ˆ x where k p is a

computation results are compared with that plos in liu et al 2016b and backstepping method in mu et al 2017 the lumped dynamics are assumed as δ f u δ f v δ f r t 0 5 f u f v f r t d 1 1200 400 sin 0

are obtained by mu et al 2018 and initial conditions of usv are x 0 y 0 ψ 0 10 0 0 u r 0 v r 0 r 0 0 01 0 0 the design parameters are described in table 1 meanwhile under the same design parameters we consider the following two scenarios case 1 under the same control method to verify the effectiveness of the guidance strategy a comparative simulation was given between fplos and plos case 2 the proposed scheme excluding actuator saturation is marked as without sa in order to verify the performance of the control method we conducted a comparative analysis among tlc fplos with sa tlc fplos without sa and backstepping adaptive method remark 7 to better tune the parameters some suggestions are provided through trial and error we choose design parameters k x k y k 1 k 2 then ϖ 1 i and ϖ u 2 of tlc are chosen using pole assignment technique r i play a significant role in all parameters of ftntd in a certain range as r i becomes larger ftntd has a fast convergence and noise tolerance the selection principles of γ 1 γ 1 κ r 2 k ζ j κ u 1 and k s j are multiple adjustments in a small range in short design parameters need to be adjusted together instead of single parameter adjustment in case 1 simulation results are shown in figs 6 11 and mia indexes of the error are provided in table 2 it can be seen from fig 6 that the reference path can be accurately tracked by the proposed fplos with fast transient response position errors x e and y e are shown in fig 7 since the lookahead distance δ is optimized by fuzzy algorithm y e of fplos achieves a faster convergence than plos fig 8 demonstrates that the auxiliary system can satisfactorily handle input saturation fig 9 shows that the actual heading can effectively track the given heading figs 10 11 depict that estimation errors θ x θ y and β r converge to a small neighborhood of the origin in addition from table 1 the mia value of the proposed fplos is 0 0366 0 3433 0 01943 0 005253 0 01216 and it is only 53 5 59 6 41 1 58 5 33 3 of plos although fplos needs to adjust multiple parameters the proposed fplos achieves satisfactory control performance in case 2 the simulation results are plotted in figs 12 17 and indices of tracking error are provided in table 3 fig 12 depicts that the tlc fplos scheme with sa provides better convergence and tracking performance than without sa and backstepping method we can also further observe in fig 13 that the position errors under tlc fplos with sa converge almost zero and the ones by the other two control methods oscillate around zero fig 14 demonstrates the control inputs τ u τ r of three controllers and input saturation problems of tlc fplos with sa and backstepping are effectively compensated by auxiliary dynamic system however a large initial value is generated by tlc fplos without sa which affects the stability and performance of the system fig 15 shows that actual heading can track the guidance heading with arbitrarily small error under tlc fplos with sa fig 16 17 show that the sideslip angle and ocean currents can be effectively estimated it can be seen from table 3 that the tlc fplos with sa indicates better tracking performance 6 conclusion this paper focuses on the study of path following control problem for underactuated usv in the presence of unknown dynamics ocean currents and input saturation the proposed fplos not only calculates the desired heading but also provides an estimation and compensation of sideslip angle and ocean currents more importantly tlc is introduced into underactuated usv field to develop a practical path following controller as new effective technique and the enhanced tlc only needs to regulate two parameters in addition lumped unknown dynamics and actuator saturation are compensated by mlp technique and auxiliary dynamic system respectively the superiority and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy are also confirmed using simulation results and comparisons in two cases the next step work is to consider the application of this method in cooperative path following and trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles kumar et al 2018 garg et al 2019 2018 aggarwal and kumar 2020 li et al 2019

21604,this paper investigates the ultimate tension failure behavior of sandwich composite l joints for ship structures experiments are conducted on l joints whose transitional area radius r are 45 mm 90 mm and 180 mm matrix tension damage is identified through sudden changes in strain values results show significant differences in the damage process and failure modes between the different l joints simulations are conducted using a progressive damage method that could differentiate between matrix tension damage and fiber tension break simulations present matching results that clearly describe the damage expansion and final failure of each type of l joint further analysis with a series of simulations reveal a perspicuous map of the transformation of the damage process and failure modes additionally the failure map of two more types of l joints are provided the results of the extended l joint shows the great potential if the original l joints were not impaired by the bonding connection the improved l joint offers a significant mechanical performance improvement compared to the original l joint keywords sandwich composite l joint damage mode failure mode progressive damage method 1 introduction composite structures are widely used nowadays in the aerospace industry as main bearing components khosravani and weinberg 2017 the material is light and can take on enough load at the same time while maintaining at a reasonable building cost khosravani 2011 ma and mahfuz 2012 the ship building industry have also started to exploit the benefit of this relatively novel kind of material it is not difficult for small structures e g yachts or patrol boats to achieve the same success savin barcan et al 2018 however larger marine structures are complex and bulky they require more load carrying capabilities but are less sensitive to space occupation sandwich composite increase its section modulus by separating the laminate facesheets with even lighter core material which fits perfectly in this case kocaman et al 2018 nevertheless the ultimate failure and reliability problem of sandwich composite structures still requires thorough study especially when being applicated to large scale marine structures in marine structures l joint and similar components are very common zeng et al 2018 for instance they can be easily found at the intersections between the boardside and the upper deck fig 1 design methods and performance evaluations of similar steel structures are already simple mature and precise enough for engineering but as for sandwich composite structures they rely much on subjective experience or direct model test due to its many compositions and complex damage modes as one of the basic structural components in large composite marine structures the mechanical performance of l joints requires more attention li et al 2019 points out that the connection of the l joint is the key to its performance and he proposed a new type of l joint khosravani et al 2018 adopted a case based reasoning methodology to predict fracture occurrence in adhesively bonded sandwich corner joints shen et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 both looked into a l joint quite similar with the subject of this paper wei shen was more focused on the fatigue side of performance and put forward a fatigue life model validated with tests zeng analyzed the functional relationship between the load bearing capacity and some of the dimensions she recommends increasing the arc radius r if higher strength is needed when investigating the damage process of l joint kai et al 2020 pointed out that the tension damage of the gfrp skin glass fiber reinforced plastic skin can be divided into the matrix tension damage and the fiber tension break failure the latter one can cause total structural collapse directly while the matrix tension damage can take place at a much lower stress level without giving out any obvious sign the structure this paper investigates is a typical sandwich l joint with a strengthener in the middle as is shown in fig 2 this joint has multiple geometric parameters but in actual ship design most dimensions are not solely determined by the required mechanical performance of the l joint itself for instance thickness and layer layup of the base panel depends on the boardside plate or deck plate the l joint attaches to strengtheners are actually the extension of girders whose sectional dimensions are decided with more global concerns as a matter of fact the key geometric parameter of the composite l joint is the radius of the transitional area r that connects the longitudinal strengtheners it is not only relatively independent but also crucially important to the mechanical performance of the l joint the aim of this paper is to look into the tension damage behavior of the l joint and further investigate the influences of the radius of the transitional area to seek possible design suggestions in this paper l joints whose radius are r 45 mm r 90 mm r 180 mm are examined through experiments the damage process and failure modes of the three l joints are compared simulations are conducted on a series of l joints whose radius of transitional area ranges from 45 mm to 180 mm a damage theory that is able to differentiate between matrix tension damage and fiber tension failure has been applicated to identify the damage types further analysis of the simulation results presents a transformation map of the damage process and failure modes from this map we can predict the type of damages that will appear the minimum loads that will cause these damages and the final failure modes when the structure finally collapses 2 experiment methods the l joint consists of two base sandwich panels one longitudinal stiffener in the middle and two transverse stiffeners the schematics are presented in fig 2 there are 3 specimens for each type of l joint 9 in total skin material of the l joint is 3 mm thick gfrp which is made up of orthogonal plain woven cloth and epoxy resin the core material is polyvinyl chloride pvc the specimens are manufactured through vacuum assistant resin infusion vari process detailed material properties are listed in table 1 experiments of the l joints are conducted on the test machine shown in fig 3 a during the experiments the two ends of the l joint are clapped by premade steel fixtures the lower end is latched to the test bench and the upper end is latched to the actuator the applied load is controlled through the displacement of the actuator which is set at the speed of 2 mm min upwards strain gauges are attached to several locations as is marked out in fig 2 3 simulation methods 3 1 progressive damage model of the gfrp skin progressive damage method is applied when simulating the failure of the gfrp skin the new damage criterion introduced by kai et al 2020 is adopted the corresponding strategy of stiffness degradation further separates the tension failure of gfrp materials into two categories or stages which are matrix tension damage and fiber tension damage matrix tension damage only partially impairs the stiffness while fiber tension damage leads to an instant element failure the reason why this relatively novel damage model is introduced is because each of the two types of tension damage has evident phenomenon in the experiment that corresponds while this is the only simulation method that can clearly identify the matrix tension damage the first tension damage stage which is matrix tension damage is governed by the following criterion kai et al 2020 1 m a t r i x t e n s i o n o n f i b e r d i r e c t i o n s σ x x x t m 2 τ x y s x y 2 τ x z s x z 2 1 σ x x 0 where x t m is the skin matrix tension fail stress on x direction s x y s x z is the shear strength on xy xz directions when this criterion is met in the simulation the local material will suffer from an instant stiffness degradation that describes its matrix tension damage state the stiffness degradation ratio is calculated through an idealized basic unit assumption that connects the gfrp skin s macroscopic material properties to the properties of the matrix and the fiber bundles inside kai et al 2020 the stiffness degradation ratio is k 0 4917 in this paper s simulations the second tension failure stage is fiber tension break it is governed by the max stress theory on the fiber

aforementioned criteria describe the tensile failure conditions on the same two fiber directions x y directions additionally although this paper is focused only on tension damage behaviors along fiber directions criteria for compressive damage and damage on the layup direction should also be setup to form a complete damage model the classic quadratic form is used in these situations as listed in

damage flags to describe the state of each element this kind of implementation also requires user input of 32 2 5 32 sets of engineering materials each calculated according to its corresponding damaged state combination the stiffness degradation strategy damage flags and their corresponding damage types are listed in table 2 3 2 general finite element simulation setup the finite element fe simulations are conducted using commercial fe software abaqus the fe models for the l joints include the entire composite model but not the fixtures bonding layers are set between the strengtheners and the base panel as well as on the intersections of the longitudinal and transverse strengtheners as is shown in fig 2 the clapping areas at the two ends of the joint are coupled each with a single reference point at the corresponding loading or constraining latching point as in the experiment then displacement load and constraints can be directly applied on the reference points fig 3c the plastic foam is regarded as ideal elastic plastic the bonding layer simulation uses cohesive element method with traction separation techniques the initial failure is governed by a quadratic stress criterion eq 6 damage evolution is based on maximum energy degradation and the softening traction separation law is linear ridha et al 2011 detailed material parameters of the debond simulation are listed in table 3 6 t n t n 0 2 t s t s 0 2 t t t t 0 2 1 where t n t s t t are respectively the normal and shear components of tractions t n 0 t s 0 t t 0 are the corresponding strength of the normal and shear tractions the simulations are performed with abaqus explicit module both the instant stiffness degradation strategy adopted in the progressive failure process and the traction separation theory adopted in the cohesive bonding layer are very likely to cause convergence problems in a general static stress analysis while the explicit procedures require no iterations and no tangent stiffness matrix dassault systèmes 2013 therefore explicit quasi static calculation is introduced in this paper s simulations when the user defined step time of the analysis is long enough to limit the kinetic energy to a very small fraction of the total energy of the model the analysis results are believed to be accurate for a quasi static analysis mesh sensitivity is also looked into on the r45 model with the current mesh length doubled and halved results show no significant difference in results and the current mesh length provides more stable curve data while maintaining an acceptable solve time after some trials it is discovered that to acquire more stable and accurate results computing power is better spent on extending the step time to minimize the kinetic energy when the mesh size is acceptable the kinetic energy ratio is kept below 0 1 before the final failure and 1 throughout the simulations 4 experiment simulation results analysis of r45 r90 r180 l joints the load displacement curves l d curves are plotted in fig 4 generally the ultimate forces of the simulation results agree with the experiments but the overall stiffness in the fe model is much higher this problem is not originated from inaccurate material or geometry data because if we take a closer look at the initial stages of the experiment magnified in fig 4 the slope rates of the l d curves actually match really well the authors think there are two main reasons for the error in stiffness one of them is manufacturing defects that will emerge immediately after a small tension load is applied due to the unique geometry of the l joint small defects in the transitional area can cause a significant stiffness drop the other one is in plane shear nonlinearity which mainly exists on the side wall of the longitudinal stiffener the nonlinearity becomes more significant as the load increases as a combined effect the displacement results in the experiments are much larger than the simulations however further analysis revealed that the timing of the major matrix tension damages can be recognized through sudden strain changes recorded during the experiments therefore this section mainly focusses on comparing the corresponding load forces when damage occurs 4 1 r45 l joints the experiment results of r45 joints are presented in fig 5 the b strain curve always experience fluctuations relatively early when the load displacement curve is not affected then all the strain curves are affected by next bump in displacement curve the matching phenomenon in simulation results reveals that the first fluctuation is the initiation of matrix tension damage and the next fluctuation with a bump in the displacement curve is caused by the merging of the previously scattered matrix tension damage in simulation the final failure of r45 joints happens immediately after fiber tension failure appears which matches the phenomenon in experiment when r45 joints fail fig 6 compares the detailed damage and failure modes in the photo of r45 s final failure fig 6c a clear crack cuts through the transitional corner and white areas exist around the edge and the upper face of the longitudinal strengthener the crack corresponds to the fiber tension break and the white area matches the matrix tension damage the final failure mode in simulation fig 6b is captured right after the load force dramatically drops further dynamic motion of the l joint may continue to cause more damage this is why the experiments final failure always seem more severe than the simulations 4 2 r90 l joints for r90 joints the matrix tension damage s initiation can be identified just like the r45 joints the first fluctuation of b strain although does not affect the displacement load curve causes stress redistribution judging from the altered pattern of strain curves in fig 7 specimen 2 b and d strain of the second r90 joint see a huge jump at 53 60 kn but the load displacement curve is not affected until later at around 60 kn in fig 7 specimen 3 b and d strain of the third r90 joint alter their courses immediately after 50 95 kn the first fluctuation in fig 7 specimen 1 is less obvious and only happens on b strain at 53 27 kn the damage acceleration point can be found in specimen 1 2 but the displacement load curve of fig 7 specimen 3 and the fig 7 simulation has no obvious fluctuation before final failure so this feature point has not been marked in the plots in simulation the final failure of r90 joint happens immediately after the debond failure caused detachment at the bonding face between the longitudinal and the transverse strengthener which matches the phenomenon in experiment fig 8 aside from the debond final failure at the end the whitened area on the upper edge of the strengthener are clearly shown as matrix tension damage in simulation 4 3 r180 l joints as for r180 joints the final failure mode is the same with r90 joints the difference is that no obvious strain fluctuations can be recognized before r180 joints final failure in simulation no matrix tension damage is found until the total failure of the bonding face at the intersection fig 9 for r180 joint in fig 10 except for the detachment at the end intersection no whitened areas can be observed around the transitional area of the strengthener which confirms that no tension damage has taken place 4 4 damage failure mode conclusion the damage failure modes and the corresponding load forces are concluded in fig 11 there are in total three types of damage failure types that can be clearly identified in the experiments the visually recognizable whitened areas are regarded as matrix tension damage which appeared in the early stages of r45 r90 experiments the fiber tension failure is only observed in the final failure of r45 joints and the debond failure at the end intersection is the direct cause of r90 r180 joints final failure normally matrix tension damage along fiber direction is not clearly addressed in the simulation of plain woven cloth gfrp materials the simulation methods in this paper manage to provide the accurate initiation force and matching damage areas generally speaking both the damage modes and the corresponding forces agree between the experiments and simulations this suggests that the simulation methods adopted in this paper can effectively simulate the damage and failure process of the l joints under tension load 5 damage failure modes shift and prediction the damage and failure process of r45 r90 r180 l joints presents a problem when the radius of the transitional area increases from 45 mm to 180 mm there must exist a turning point where the final failure modes transforms from fiber tension break to strengthener debond at the end intersection meanwhile there should also be a critical point beyond which the matrix tension damage disappears 5 1 acquiring the damage process failure mode prediction map on purpose of searching for the critical points ultimate tension simulations of l joints are conducted with multiple transitional area radius ranging from 37 5 mm to 180 mm the corresponding loads of damage initiation and final failure are documented which is shown as the triangular data points in fig 12 linear fit is conducted on each type of data because of the obvious linear trend as a result these prediction lines acquired from linear fit have divided the 2 dimensional space in fig 12 into several zones which is essentially a map of damage and failure prediction for the l joints 5 2 physical meaning controlling criteria of the prediction lines matrix tension line the green line in fig 12 is the prediction line for the initiation of matrix tension damage it also refers to the first irregular fluctuation of strain data during the experiments matrix tension damage will happen for any condition directly above this line the criterion governing this damage is eq 1 when under tension the shear stress on the upper surface of the transitional area is not significant the longitudinal stress is the determining factor for the initiation of matrix tension damage additionally when the load condition is approximately linear the relationship between the σ x of the transitional area and the radius r is also linear because of the local geometry as a result the matrix tension initiation data have a strong linear trend fiber tension failure line the red line in fig 12 is the prediction line for the fiber tension break damage which normally leads directly to structural collapse it also corresponds to the final tension break of r45 joints in the experiment the criterion governing this damage is eq 2 this type of damage happens after matrix tension damage so this line is well above the matrix tension line and it is also approximately linear for the same reason with the matrix tension line load force directly above this line exceeds the estimate ultimate force and the final failure mode is fiber tension break debond damage prediction line the blue line in fig 12 marks the lowest load force that will cause total stiffness regression of the first cohesive element this means the element meets eq 6 additionally the separation distance of the bonding layer is large enough to cause the local traction force to disappear this may continue to expand and cause the debond failure of the structure debond failure line the purple line in fig 12 marks the ultimate condition when the remaining traction provided by the bonding layer can no longer bear the separation load which eventually results in the total failure of the entire structure 5 3 further understanding of the damage failure map with the help of the map the problem raised at the beginning of this section can now be answered r 60 mm is the turning point where the ultimate failure shifts from fiber tension to debond the matrix tension damage no longer appears when r is roughly larger than 135 mm more importantly based on this failure map for any tension load and a given corner radius within this range it is easy to predict the detailed damage condition or failure modes it is even possible to retrace its entire damage process meanwhile structure designers can also customize their preferred r based on their different strength requirements for example r 60 mm may be a suitable choice if the designer pursues maximum ultimate tension force if zero tolerance of damage is more important the intersection point of matrix damage line and debond damage line near r 67 5 mm is a wiser option 6 debond damage limitations and further improvement 6 1 potential without limitation of debond damage the extended l joint the failure map in fig 12 also reveals a fact that when r is relatively larger debond damage at the intersection between the longitudinal and transverse strengthener has severely limited the no damage zone as well as the ultimate bearing force compared to the l joint whose longitudinal strengthener is bonded to transverse strengtheners at its both ends as is shown in fig 2 and referred to as type a in the following descriptions a more common structure is that the longitudinal strengthener extends along the boardside or deck plate referred to as type b and shown in fig 13 although not included in the experiment the structure type b joints represents is more typical series of simulations are also conducted for type b joints not only to examine its damage process and ultimate force results but also to find out how much the debond failure at the end intersections have impaired the type a joints the damage and failure map of type b joint is shown in fig 14 it is obvious that its tension ultimate strength which is essentially dependent to fiber tension failure now increases rapidly and linearly with the radius r within this entire 30 180 mm range bonding layers at the intersection are no longer there but bonding layer still exists between the longitudinal strengthener and the base panels the debond damage initiated from near the toe of the transitional area fig 15 a but does not seem to have influenced the ultimate strength of the whole structure judging from its linearly climbing trend the corresponding debond damage initiation force is evenly 10 20 kn above that of the matrix tension damage as a result the no damage zone is solely dependent to matrix tension damage and grows linearly with the radius r by comparing type a s failure map fig 12 with that of type b fig 14 it is obvious that when r increases debond damage at the intersection between the longitudinal and transverse strengthener has severely limited the no damage zone and the ultimate bearing force of type a joints the extended l joints type b can achieve significantly more strength reserve by simply increase its radius of the transitional area but if the strengthener needs to connect to another transverse girder like type a joint design of the intersection needs to be improved to reach a similar strength level 6 2 an improved design the authors provide an improved design shown in fig 16 b referred to as type c joints in the following descriptions bonding mechanism at the ends are replaced with an integrated molding t structure with rounded corners to avoid direct load upon bonding layer the damage map of type c joints is shown in fig 17 compared to type b joints type c joints have a lower momentum passing efficiency at the ends which can increase the sectional shear force thus applying more load on the bonding layer as a result when r 135 mm the ultimate failure mode converts to complete debond failure of the bonding layer fig 15b but still compared to the original type a joints both the no damage zone and ultimate strength are greatly increased compared to type a joints when r is relatively larger 7 conclusions this paper first investigates the ultimate tension damage and failure process of the l joints for ship structures with three transitional area radiuses r 45 mm 90 mm 180 mm a progressive gfrp tension damage theory that can identify matrix tension damage is adopted in the simulations the results of experiments and simulations present a consistent and clear path of the damage evolution process and failure modes for each joint then a series of simulations with altered radius 37 5 mm r 180 mm are conducted based on the load force data of different damage states acquired the prediction lines are drawn each with a clear physical meaning and a controlling criterion the prediction lines together form a damage map this map provides valuable information that would not only tell us when and how but also explain why the damage process and failure modes shift when r alters further investigation into a more typical extended l joints revealed its great strength potential this also suggests that the bonding failure have impaired the original l joints significantly an improved design is provided which can greatly increase the no damage zone and ultimate strength it should be noted that although for gfrp components compression strength is generally lower than tension strength but the matrix tension damage can happen much earlier compared to the fiber tensile failure 39 kn vs 68 kn in r45 test average and as suggested by the failure map of the extended l joint type b this difference will grow wider linearly as the transitional radius r increases moreover the ultimate tension strength can also be impaired by other failure types such as the debond failure in r90 r180 tests therefore tensile damage behavior should not be overlooked for l joints generally compared to conventional metal materials on naval structures sandwich composites have a variety of damage and failure modes each with a different nature when these damage modes interact with each other and combine their influence the approach provided in this paper can be applied to identify the potential matrix tension damage and acquire a general view of how all the damage modes may shift for structure designers with high requirements for strength the failure map can not only be used directly for optimal design with different design targets the physical meaning for each prediction line damage zones can also provide valuable information if the performance of the structure needs to be improved credit authorship contribution statement qin

21604,this paper investigates the ultimate tension failure behavior of sandwich composite l joints for ship structures experiments are conducted on l joints whose transitional area radius r are 45 mm 90 mm and 180 mm matrix tension damage is identified through sudden changes in strain values results show significant differences in the damage process and failure modes between the different l joints simulations are conducted using a progressive damage method that could differentiate between matrix tension damage and fiber tension break simulations present matching results that clearly describe the damage expansion and final failure of each type of l joint further analysis with a series of simulations reveal a perspicuous map of the transformation of the damage process and failure modes additionally the failure map of two more types of l joints are provided the results of the extended l joint shows the great potential if the original l joints were not impaired by the bonding connection the improved l joint offers a significant mechanical performance improvement compared to the original l joint keywords sandwich composite l joint damage mode failure mode progressive damage method 1 introduction composite structures are widely used nowadays in the aerospace industry as main bearing components khosravani and weinberg 2017 the material is light and can take on enough load at the same time while maintaining at a reasonable building cost khosravani 2011 ma and mahfuz 2012 the ship building industry have also started to exploit the benefit of this relatively novel kind of material it is not difficult for small structures e g yachts or patrol boats to achieve the same success savin barcan et al 2018 however larger marine structures are complex and bulky they require more load carrying capabilities but are less sensitive to space occupation sandwich composite increase its section modulus by separating the laminate facesheets with even lighter core material which fits perfectly in this case kocaman et al 2018 nevertheless the ultimate failure and reliability problem of sandwich composite structures still requires thorough study especially when being applicated to large scale marine structures in marine structures l joint and similar components are very common zeng et al 2018 for instance they can be easily found at the intersections between the boardside and the upper deck fig 1 design methods and performance evaluations of similar steel structures are already simple mature and precise enough for engineering but as for sandwich composite structures they rely much on subjective experience or direct model test due to its many compositions and complex damage modes as one of the basic structural components in large composite marine structures the mechanical performance of l joints requires more attention li et al 2019 points out that the connection of the l joint is the key to its performance and he proposed a new type of l joint khosravani et al 2018 adopted a case based reasoning methodology to predict fracture occurrence in adhesively bonded sandwich corner joints shen et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 both looked into a l joint quite similar with the subject of this paper wei shen was more focused on the fatigue side of performance and put forward a fatigue life model validated with tests zeng analyzed the functional relationship between the load bearing capacity and some of the dimensions she recommends increasing the arc radius r if higher strength is needed when investigating the damage process of l joint kai et al 2020 pointed out that the tension damage of the gfrp skin glass fiber reinforced plastic skin can be divided into the matrix tension damage and the fiber tension break failure the latter one can cause total structural collapse directly while the matrix tension damage can take place at a much lower stress level without giving out any obvious sign the structure this paper investigates is a typical sandwich l joint with a strengthener in the middle as is shown in fig 2 this joint has multiple geometric parameters but in actual ship design most dimensions are not solely determined by the required mechanical performance of the l joint itself for instance thickness and layer layup of the base panel depends on the boardside plate or deck plate the l joint attaches to strengtheners are actually the extension of girders whose sectional dimensions are decided with more global concerns as a matter of fact the key geometric parameter of the composite l joint is the radius of the transitional area r that connects the longitudinal strengtheners it is not only relatively independent but also crucially important to the mechanical performance of the l joint the aim of this paper is to look into the tension damage behavior of the l joint and further investigate the influences of the radius of the transitional area to seek possible design suggestions in this paper l joints whose radius are r 45 mm r 90 mm r 180 mm are examined through experiments the damage process and failure modes of the three l joints are compared simulations are conducted on a series of l joints whose radius of transitional area ranges from 45 mm to 180 mm a damage theory that is able to differentiate between matrix tension damage and fiber tension failure has been applicated to identify the damage types further analysis of the simulation results presents a transformation map of the damage process and failure modes from this map we can predict the type of damages that will appear the minimum loads that will cause these damages and the final failure modes when the structure finally collapses 2 experiment methods the l joint consists of two base sandwich panels one longitudinal stiffener in the middle and two transverse stiffeners the schematics are presented in fig 2 there are 3 specimens for each type of l joint 9 in total skin material of the l joint is 3 mm thick gfrp which is made up of orthogonal plain woven cloth and epoxy resin the core material is polyvinyl chloride pvc the specimens are manufactured through vacuum assistant resin infusion vari process detailed material properties are listed in table 1 experiments of the l joints are conducted on the test machine shown in fig 3 a during the experiments the two ends of the l joint are clapped by premade steel fixtures the lower end is latched to the test bench and the upper end is latched to the actuator the applied load is controlled through the displacement of the actuator which is set at the speed of 2 mm min upwards strain gauges are attached to several locations as is marked out in fig 2 3 simulation methods 3 1 progressive damage model of the gfrp skin progressive damage method is applied when simulating the failure of the gfrp skin the new damage criterion introduced by kai et al 2020 is adopted the corresponding strategy of stiffness degradation further separates the tension failure of gfrp materials into two categories or stages which are matrix tension damage and fiber tension damage matrix tension damage only partially impairs the stiffness while fiber tension damage leads to an instant element failure the reason why this relatively novel damage model is introduced is because each of the two types of tension damage has evident phenomenon in the experiment that corresponds while this is the only simulation method that can clearly identify the matrix tension damage the first tension damage stage which is matrix tension damage is governed by the following criterion kai et al 2020 1 m a t r i x t e n s i o n o n f i b e r d i r e c t i o n s σ x x x t m 2 τ x y s x y 2 τ x z s x z 2 1 σ x x 0 where x t m is the skin matrix tension fail stress on x direction s x y s x z is the shear strength on xy xz directions when this criterion is met in the simulation the local material will suffer from an instant stiffness degradation that describes its matrix tension damage state the stiffness degradation ratio is calculated through an idealized basic unit assumption that connects the gfrp skin s macroscopic material properties to the properties of the matrix and the fiber bundles inside kai et al 2020 the stiffness degradation ratio is k 0 4917 in this paper s simulations the second tension failure stage is fiber tension break it is governed by the max stress theory on the fiber direction pinho et al 2006 also suggested this approach in their physically based failure models 2 f i b e r t e n s i o n σ x x x t f 2 1 σ x x 0 where x t f is the skin fiber tension fail stress on x direction when this criterion is met in the simulation the stiffness of the local material will decrease to almost zero right away this value is set as 0 01 in this paper s simulations the aforementioned criteria describe the tensile failure conditions on the same two fiber directions x y directions additionally although this paper is focused only on tension damage behaviors along fiber directions criteria for compressive damage and damage on the layup direction should also be setup to form a complete damage model the classic quadratic form is used in these situations as listed in the following equations which are directly borrowed from the shokrieh hashin criteria shokrieh et al 1996 3 f i b e r c o m p r e s s i o n σ x x x c 2 τ x y s x y 2 τ x z s x z 2 1 σ x x 0 4 c o m p

strong linear trend fiber tension failure line the red line in fig 12 is the prediction line for the fiber tension break damage which normally leads directly to structural collapse it also corresponds to the final tension break of r45 joints in the experiment the criterion governing this damage is eq 2 this type of damage happens after matrix tension damage so this line is well above the matrix tension line and it is also approximately linear for the same reason with the matrix tension line load force directly above this line exceeds the estimate ultimate force and the final failure mode is fiber tension break debond damage prediction line the blue line in fig 12 marks the lowest load force that will cause total stiffness regression of the first cohesive element this means the element meets eq 6 additionally the separation distance of the bonding layer is large enough to cause the local traction force to disappear this may continue to expand and cause the debond failure of the structure debond failure line the purple line in fig 12 marks the ultimate condition when the remaining traction provided by the bonding layer can no longer bear the separation load which eventually results in the total failure of the entire structure 5 3 further understanding of the damage failure map with the help of the map the problem raised at the beginning of this section can now be answered r 60 mm is the turning point where the ultimate failure shifts from fiber tension to debond the matrix tension damage no longer appears when r is roughly larger than 135 mm more importantly based on this failure map for any tension load and a given corner radius within this range it is easy to predict the detailed damage condition or failure modes it is even possible to retrace its entire damage process meanwhile structure designers can also customize their preferred r based on their different strength requirements for example r 60 mm may be a suitable choice if the designer pursues maximum ultimate tension force if zero tolerance of damage is more important the intersection point of matrix damage line and debond damage line near r 67 5 mm is a wiser option 6 debond damage limitations and further improvement 6 1 potential without limitation of debond damage the extended l joint the failure map in fig 12 also reveals a fact that when r is relatively larger debond damage at the intersection between the longitudinal and transverse strengthener has severely limited the no damage zone as well as the ultimate bearing force compared to the l joint whose longitudinal strengthener is bonded to transverse strengtheners at its both ends as is shown in fig 2 and referred to as type a in the following descriptions a more common structure is that the longitudinal strengthener extends along the boardside or deck plate referred to as type b and shown in fig 13 although not included in the experiment the structure type b joints represents is more typical series of simulations are also conducted for type b joints not only to examine its damage process and ultimate force results but also to find out how much the debond failure at the end intersections have impaired the type a joints the damage and failure map of type b joint is shown in fig 14 it is obvious that its tension ultimate strength which is essentially dependent to fiber tension failure now increases rapidly and linearly with the radius r within this entire 30 180 mm range bonding layers at the intersection are no longer there but bonding layer still exists between the longitudinal strengthener and the base panels the debond damage initiated from near the toe of the transitional area fig 15 a but does not seem to have influenced the ultimate strength of the whole structure judging from its linearly climbing trend the corresponding debond damage initiation force is evenly 10 20 kn above that of the matrix tension damage as a result the no damage zone is solely dependent to matrix tension damage and grows linearly with the radius r by comparing type a s failure map fig 12 with that of type b fig 14 it is obvious that when r increases debond damage at the intersection between the longitudinal and transverse strengthener has severely limited the no damage zone and the ultimate bearing force of type a joints the extended l joints type b can achieve significantly more strength reserve by simply increase its radius of the transitional area but if the strengthener needs to connect to another transverse girder like type a joint design of the intersection needs to be improved to reach a similar strength level 6 2 an improved design the authors provide an improved design shown in fig 16 b referred to as type c joints in the following descriptions bonding mechanism at the ends are replaced with an integrated molding t structure with rounded corners to avoid direct load upon bonding layer the damage map of type c joints is shown in fig 17 compared to type b joints type c joints have a lower momentum passing efficiency at the ends which can increase the sectional shear force thus applying more load on the bonding layer as a result when r 135 mm the ultimate failure mode converts to complete debond failure of the bonding layer fig 15b but still compared to the original type a joints both the no damage zone and ultimate strength are greatly increased compared to type a joints when r is relatively larger 7 conclusions this paper first investigates the ultimate tension damage and failure process of the l joints for ship structures with three transitional area radiuses r 45 mm 90 mm 180 mm a progressive gfrp tension damage theory that can identify matrix tension damage is adopted in the simulations the results of experiments and simulations present a consistent and clear path of the damage evolution process and failure modes for each joint then a series of simulations with altered radius 37 5 mm r 180 mm are conducted based on the load force data of different damage states acquired the prediction lines are drawn each with a clear physical meaning and a controlling criterion the prediction lines together form a damage map this map provides valuable information that would not only tell us when and how but also explain why the damage process and failure modes shift when r alters further investigation into a more typical extended l joints revealed its great strength potential this also suggests that the bonding failure have impaired the original l joints significantly an improved design is provided which can greatly increase the no damage zone and ultimate strength it should be noted that although for gfrp components compression strength is generally lower than tension strength but the matrix tension damage can happen much earlier compared to the fiber tensile failure 39 kn vs 68 kn in r45 test average and as suggested by the failure map of the extended l joint type b this difference will grow wider linearly as the transitional radius r increases moreover the ultimate tension strength can also be impaired by other failure types such as the debond failure in r90 r180 tests therefore tensile damage behavior should not be overlooked for l joints generally compared to conventional metal materials on naval structures sandwich composites have a variety of damage and failure modes each with a different nature when these damage modes interact with each other and combine their influence the approach provided in this paper can be applied to identify the potential matrix tension damage and acquire a general view of how all the damage modes may shift for structure designers with high requirements for strength the failure map can not only be used directly for optimal design with different design targets the physical meaning for each prediction line damage zones can also provide valuable information if the performance of the structure needs to be improved credit authorship contribution statement qin
