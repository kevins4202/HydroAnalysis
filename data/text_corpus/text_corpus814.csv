transport and retention in porous media is a common phenomenon in nature however retention mechanisms are not fully revealed based on macroscale experimental observations the pore network model pnm is an effective method to account for the pore structure of a porous medium and provides a direct connection between pore scale retention mechanisms and macroscale phenomenon in this study pnms with cylindrical pore throats and spherical pore bodies are used to upscale water flow and colloid transport from pore to macro scales taking into consideration surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity of pore water on colloid transport and retention behavior results show that hydrodynamic bridging and straining produce hyper exponential retention profiles whereas surface deposition due to nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity yields exponential or uniform retention profiles hydrodynamic bridging will not happen when the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity are lower than some threshold value r p 500 nm c 0 7 1 1014 nc m3 u 0 0 1 m d under the conditions of this study the relative importance of hydrodynamic bridging in comparison to surface deposition increases with an increase in the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity the pnm is a useful tool to discriminate different retention mechanisms and to predict colloid transport and retention behavior in porous media keywords colloid transport and retention pore network model hydrodynamic bridging straining surface deposition 1 introduction colloid transport and retention are of fundamental significance to many engineering and natural systems like the transport of bacteria and viruses or the remediation of underground systems using nanomaterials elimelech et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 babakhani et al 2017 the mobility and fate of colloids are significantly influenced by retention in porous media auset and keller 2006 sasidharan et al 2017 hilpert and johnson 2018 numerous theoretical and experimental studies have reported that the retention of colloids is influenced by many hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions including flow velocity kermani et al 2020 initial concentration of colloids wang et al 2012a particle size wang et al 2012a ionic strength saleh et al 2008 and surface heterogeneity trauscht et al 2015 colloid retention can happen due to different mechanisms including surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining sen and khilar 2006 gao 2008 yang and balhoff 2017 fig 1 presents a schematic illustrating these retention mechanisms surface deposition or attachment depends on the mass transfer of colloids to the solid water interface and the balance of forces and torques at a given location bradford and torkzaban 2015 hydrodynamic bridging refers to the simultaneous arrival and jamming of several colloids in a pore throat to form a stable bridge or arch even though the individual colloid size is smaller than the pore throat ramachandran and fogler 1999 zwart 2007 mondal et al 2016 straining happens when a colloid with a size larger than the pore throat is trapped in a pore body tufenkji et al 2004 auset and keller 2006 the surface deposition has been assumed to be controlled by adhesive interactions and contributes to ripening and blocking behavior molnar et al 2015 whereas straining is dependent on physical factors related to size considerations that influence clogging kermani et al 2020 hydrodynamic bridging can be treated as a physical process that is related to particle concentration and size zwart 2007 mondal et al 2016 but it can also be accompanied by particle aggregation that is affected by chemical conditions kermani et al 2020 it should be mentioned that different terminology has been employed to describe the above retention mechanisms for example hydrodynamic bridging is also described as jamming clogging plugging blockage or straining torkzaban et al 2015 mondal et al 2016 and straining can also be expressed as size exclusion moghadasi et al 2004 yang and balhoff 2017 and sieving dressaire and sauret 2016 notice that the colloid colloid interaction is not considered in the retention mechanisms shown in fig 1 when colloid colloid interaction is considered colloids could also attach to previously attached colloids and aggregate forms in the liquid could also be trapped at the inlet of the pore throat kermani et al 2020 column scale studies have commonly been conducted to study the influence of different physiochemical factors on colloid transport and retention busch et al 2014 treumann et al 2014 lin et al 2021b the results of column studies are usually represented as breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 raychoudhury and surasani 2017 yu et al 2018 hyper exponential rps a decreasing rate of retention with distance have been commonly reported in column studies for different types of colloids and nanoparticles tong et al 2005 wang et al 2017 johnson 2020 previous studies have attributed hyper exponential rps to different mechanisms including nanoscale heterogeneity tufenkji and elimelech 2005 johnson et al 2018 colloid polydispersity tong and johnson 2007 yang and balhoff 2017 colloid detachment tufenkji et al 2003 straining bradford et al 2006 and colloid aggregation chatterjee and gupta 2009 most of the previous work is based on the inverse fitting of parameters from the advection dispersion equation ade with different deposition kinetics to experimental btcs and rps however it is difficult to decipher isolate and predict the underlying retention mechanisms from fitting parameters of such studies due to the complexity of the porous medium structure and colloid suspension as well as other contributing factors molnar et al 2015 column studies therefore frequently show inconsistency in results and interpretations li et al 2015 hu et al 2017 pore network models pnms have been reported to be an effective method for studying transport problems in porous media long and hilpert 2009 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 which has been used to study colloid transport and retention in recent years seetha et al 2017 yang and balhoff 2017 meng and yang 2019 one of the main advantages of a pnm is that it can provide a direct connection between pore scale mechanisms to macro or continuum scale observations acharya et al 2004 simulation of colloid transport in a pnm can therefore provide a promising approach to help understand and unambiguously determine retention mechanisms under various physicochemical conditions lin et al 2021a utilized a pnm to consider the influence of nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity on the surface deposition of mono dispersed colloids in porous media however straining hydrodynamic bridging and poly dispersed suspensions were not considered in that study the objective of this study is to use a pnm to study and predict colloid transport behavior in the presence of different retention mechanisms the pnm employs cylindrical pore throats and spherical pore bodies to simulate the transport and retention of colloids in a porous medium this paper is the first to simultaneously consider all these three retention mechanisms surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining in a pnm the influence of colloid size initial concentration and water velocity on btcs and rps of pnms are then discussed 2 methodology 2 1 pore network models pnms pnms with spherical pore bodies and cylindrical tube pore throats are used to simulate solute or colloid transport in porous media raoof 2011 zhang et al 2017 of which the details have been reported in previous work lin et al 2021a fig 2 shows the geometries of two pnms with different pore sizes denoted as pnm1 and pnm2 that are employed to study different retention mechanisms both pnms contain 2000 pore bodies 10 10 20 have a porosity of 0 3 and are isotropic pnm1 contains 6637 pore throats and pnm2 contains 6810 pore throats the radius of pore bodies and pore throats obey normal distributions shown in table 1 the pore sizes of pnm1 and pnm2 are used to represent sand and silt respectively reddi and inyang 2000 minagawa et al 2008 the calculation method for the flow field in the pnm is discussed in the supporting information si the ability of the pnm to reasonably describe the transport of a methyl orange tracer is reported in the si results confirm that the advective dispersive transport of this tracer was accurately described using the pnm 2 2 colloid transport and retention three retention mechanisms shown in fig 1 are included in the pnm in which the pore structure is described by pore bodies and pore throats 2 2 1 surface deposition in this study the deposition of colloids is assumed to happen on pore throat surfaces the colloid size can be considered as a uniform or a piecewise uniform size distribution the transport and retention of different size colloids occurs by linear superimposition in the pore throat the governing aqueous and solid phase mass balance equations for a pore throat are given as 1 c k t t s k t t u t c k t x 2 s k t t ψ k t k att k t c k t k det k t s k t where c k t ncl 3 is the liquid phase colloid concentration s k t ncl 3 is the solid phase colloid concentration d l t l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the pore throat u t lt 1 is the average flow velocity in the pore throat k att k t t 1 is the attachment coefficient k det k t t 1 is the detachment coefficient and ψ k t is a dimensionless blocking function in this section the subscript k on parameters denotes the colloid size class and the subscript t denotes the tube scale pore scale parameter hydrodynamic dispersion is neglected in eq 1 because it has an insignificant effect at the tube scale raoof et al 2010 the value of k att k t is defined analogously to conventional colloid filtration theory yao et al 1971 as 3 k att k t η k t α k t u t l t where l t l is the length of the pore throat η k t is the collector efficiency and α k t is the sticking efficiency the value of η k t is determined from the known pore scale flow field ostadfar 2016 and numerical simulation of the convective diffusion equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the value of α k t is predicted from the force and torque balances on the solid water interface swi that contains nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity using a method described by previous work bradford and torkzaban 2015 the details of the calculation of η k t and α k t are outlined in the si and our previous work wang et al 2014 lin et al 2021a the value of k det k t is set to 0 01 k att k t in this study bradford and bettahar 2006 cohen et al 2019 blocking is accounted for in the model using the following equation for ψ k t 4 ψ k t 1 k r p k 2 s k t r c k 2 s max k t where s max k t ncl 3 is the maximum solid phase concentration for the colloid class and r p k l is the radius of the colloid equation 4 is a modified form of the langmuirian blocking function that assumes other colloid classes contribute to the filling of s max k t in a linear manner here we assume that s max k t for different size particles can encompass the same area on the porous medium zhang et al 2019 which is related to the fraction of the swi that contributes to retention for the colloid class s f k t as bradford and torkzaban 2012 5 s max k t 2 1 γ s f k t r t π r p k 2 where r t l is the radius of the pore throat and γ is the porosity of the colloid packing on the swi that is taken to be 0 5 johnson and elimelech 1995 similar to α k t the value of s f k t is predicted from the force and torque balances on an swi that contain nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity see si the importance of nanoscale heterogeneities on surface deposition has been experimentally confirmed in impinging jet and micromodel experiments rasmuson et al 2017 shen et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrodynamic bridging hydrodynamic bridging happens in a pore body when several colloids simultaneously arrive at the inlet of a pore throat and forms a colloid bridge or arc the number of colloids n k nc of which the radius equals to r q k that arrives at a pore throat during a time interval δt t is given as 6 n k q t c k t δ t where q t l3t 1 is the water flux the value of δt reflects the time limit for hydrodynamic bridging the sum of projection areas of all colloids that arrive at the pore throat a sum l2 equals 7 a sum k n k π r q k 2 note that eq 7 provides a conservative estimate of a sum because it does not consider the role of the energy barrier which occurs at separation distances from the colloid and solid surfaces under unfavorable conditions keller and auset 2007 shen et al 2018 in this study the criterion for hydrodynamic bridging is based on a comparison of a sum to the area of the pore throat as 8 a sum π r t 2 ω where ω is the porosity of the colloid bridge when this criterion for hydrodynamic bridging is satisfied the colloids do not get into the pore throat and are retained in the pore body this clogged pore throat is assumed to not contribute to colloid transport and retention during subsequent time steps our criterion for hydrodynamic bridging eq 8 is similar to other works that are based on the comparison of the sum of projection areas of all colloids and the cross sectional area of the pore throat wyss et al 2006 de zwart 2007 in support of this modeling approach microscopic observations show that hydrodynamic bridging occurs at the entrance of pore throats mustin and stoeber 2010 agbangla et al 2012 and increases with the ratio of the colloid to the pore size colloid concentration and pore water velocity ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 the above approach indicates that hydrodynamic bridging depends on the selected values of δt and ω a sensitive analysis is therefore conducted to assess the influence of these parameters on simulation results values of δt and ω for subsequent simulations are selected based on this analysis unless otherwise noted the values of δt and ω are set to 0 1 s and 0 8 respectively note that a lower limit for ω is expected to be around 0 5 to obtain a monolayer covering over the pore throat johnson and elimelech 1995 however it is reasonable to anticipate that bridging may also occur at pore throats for larger values of ω due to variations in a colloid bridge configuration incomplete coverage of the pore throat and deviations from the assumed cylindrical pore throat geometry 2 2 3 straining straining occurs in the pnm when the size of the colloid is larger than that of the inlet of a pore throat in this case the excluded colloids are retained in the pore body yang and balhoff 2017 this modeling approach is supported by microscopic observations of straining at the entrance of pore throats mustin and stoeber 2010 agbangla et al 2012 that is mainly influenced by the ratio of the colloid to the pore size ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 however it should be mentioned that this criterium may be overly conservative under unfavorable attachment conditions because it does not consider the role of the energy barrier which occurs at separation distances from the colloid and solid surfaces keller and auset 2007 shen et al 2018 2 3 simulation scenarios different numerical experiments are conducted to study the influence of surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging or straining under various initial concentrations velocities and colloid sizes table 2 provides a summary of the experimental conditions pnm1 is used to study hydrodynamic bridging and surface deposition no size exclusion happens in pnm1 because all colloid sizes are smaller than the smallest pore throat pnm2 is used to study the influence of straining and surface deposition bridging is turned off in pnm2 to show the influence of straining more clearly surface deposition depends on the properties of the solution and surface conditions of pore throats including the ionic strength nanoscale roughness charge heterogeneity macroscopic roughness etc the ionic strength is set at 80 mm and the zeta potentials of the colloid and swi are 23 4 mv and 11 9 mv respectively treumann et al 2014 the density of the colloid is set to 1500 kg m3 the mean value of the nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity fractions on the entire surface of the pnm are both set at 0 1 whereas spatial variability in these properties follows independent binominal distributions the height of the nanoscale roughness ranges from 0 to 50 nm the positive zeta potential ranges from 0 to 30 mv and the height of macroscopic roughness varies from 0 to 5000 nm bradford and torkzaban 2015 the hamaker constant between the colloid and the swi is 4 10 21 j and young s modulus of the colloid is 4 109 pa numerical experiments consist of injecting a 3 pore volume pv pulse of colloid suspension with a concentration of c 0 from the left side of the network followed by 7 pv of water the three dimensional pore structure is included in the model see fig 2 and the method provided here can be used to simulate two or three dimensional transport and retention processes furthermore pore scale parameter distributions for surface deposition parameters are also calculated to help interpret the results however one dimensional colloid transport and retention processes are usually considered at the continuum macro or column scale in this work the continuum scale btcs on the right side of the network and the final rps along the x direction are determined for each colloid size in the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 colloid size the btcs and rps profiles for various sized colloids r p 500 1000 1500 and 2000 nm are shown in fig 3 when considering different retention mechanisms the btcs are plotted as a function of normalized liquid phase concentration c c 0 versus pv whereas rps are plotted as normalized solid phase concentration s c 0 versus relative distance x x0 from the network inlet fig 3a and 3b show btcs and rps respectively when considering both surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging whereas fig 3c and 3d present similar information when only considering surface deposition in the model results show that the rps are uniform with relative distance when considering only surface deposition fig 3d which is due to blocking in contrast most of the retention happens near the network inlet for larger colloids rp 1500 and 2000 nm and in this case the rps exhibit a hyper exponential shape when considering hydrodynamic bridging and surface deposition fig 3b previous studies have attributed hyper exponential rps to different mechanisms including nanoscale heterogeneity tufenkji and elimelech 2005 johnson et al 2018 colloid polydispersity tong and johnson 2007 yang and balhoff 2017 colloid detachment tufenkji et al 2003 straining bradford et al 2006 and colloid aggregation chatterjee and gupta 2009 however it should be mentioned that it is difficult to infer the exact retention mechanisms from column scale observations the developed pnm provides an opportunity to mechanistically determine the contributions for various retention mechanisms it is worth mentioning that the influence of nanoscale roughness chemical heterogeneity macroscopic roughness and velocity variations is considered in surface deposition simulations but rps are still uniform lin et al 2021a results shown in fig 3 indicate that hydrodynamic bridging provides a viable explanation for hyper exponential rps fig 3 also shows the influence of colloid size on both surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging fig 3a and 3b show that larger colloids have much more retention near the inlet when considering hydrodynamic bridging these findings are consistent with previous microscopic experimental observations ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 sen and khilar 2006 in contrast fig 3c and 3d show that less retention occurs for larger colloids when only considering surface deposition the amount of surface deposition is determined by distributions of pore scale retention parameters which are shown in fig 4 larger colloids have a higher η k t because the probability for sedimentation increases with an increase in colloid size tufenkji and elimelech 2004 conversely values of α k t and s f k t are lower for larger colloids because the applied hydrodynamic torque increases more rapidly than the resisting adhesive torque bradford and torkzaban 2015 the value of k att k t is determined by the product of η k t and α k t when the velocity and geometry are constant in this study k att k t slightly increases with the colloid size however larger colloids also have a higher projection area and lower s f k t therefore the influence of blocking is more pronounced for larger colloids and this causes less retention sasidharan et al 2014 3 2 colloid size distribution fig 3 also includes btcs and rps red line with square marks for a colloid distribution that includes an equal number of colloids 1 6 1015 nc m3 in each size class r p 500 1000 1500 and 2000 nm note that total number concentrations are used in this figure the btc and rp for this colloid distribution most closely resembled those for the monodispersed r p 1500 nm suspension this implies that the transport and retention of this colloid distribution is controlled by larger colloid sizes because they contributed more area for blocking and hydrodynamic bridging conversely bradford and leij 2018 simulated the transport behavior of poly dispersed colloid suspensions when using a constant value of α and continuum scale values of η predicted from filtration theory and found that colloids with r p around 750 nm exhibited the greatest transport potential previous literature has reported different transport and retention behavior with the colloid size distribution some researchers reported that the average colloid aggregate size increased after passing through the porous media solovitch et al 2010 wang et al 2012c but others reported the opposite trend chen et al 2011 wang et al 2012b colloids with different sizes can have different pore scale parameters which are further influenced by the solution chemistry roughness and charge heterogeneity conditions lin et al 2021a further research is warranted about the influence of the colloid size distribution on retention processes and its variation during transport the corresponding relative effluent concentrations for each colloid size class are shown in fig 5 results show that smaller colloids preferentially breakthrough during the initial injection period because of their smaller deposition and or bridging rates however differences in effluent concentrations with the colloid size tend to diminish at later times because of blocking these trends are relatively consistent in simulations with fig 5a and without fig 5b hydrodynamic bridging this implies that bridging is a process in which different sized colloids work together although small colloids will not independently form a bridge they apparently can contribute to bridges with larger colloids 3 3 colloid concentration blocking and hydrodynamic bridging are both functions of the initial colloid concentration additional numerical simulations on pnm1 are therefore conducted to study the influence of initial concentration c 0 ranged from 7 14 1014 to 1 9 1016 nc m3 on surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging when r p 1500 nm fig 6 presents btcs and rps for these simulations simulations with and without hydrodynamic bridging are the same when c 0 7 14 1014 nc m3 this indicates that hydrodynamic bridging did not happen at these concentration levels conversely results are sensitive to the input concentration when c 0 greater than 7 14 1014 nc m3 however the concentration dependency shows opposite trends for simulations with and without hydrodynamic bridging higher c 0 causes more relative retention near the inlet when hydrodynamic bridging is considered in the simulations fig 6a and 6b because the projection area of colloids in a pore throat increases with c 0 eqs 6 7 this prediction is consistent with some previous experimental observations ramachandran and fogler 1999 auset and keller 2006 conversely higher c 0 leads to less relative retention fig 6c and 6d when only considering surface deposition wang et al 2012a reported the results of column studies on silica nanoparticles and their results show that higher particle number concentration led to lower relative retention a similar tendency has also been reported by leij et al 2015 and this is attributed to faster blocking of the limit surface area for attachment these observations suggest that the concentration dependency of colloid retention will depend on the relative strength of blocking and hydrodynamic bridging it should be mentioned that experimental observations on the influence of colloid size on retention are inconsistent some of the previous work reported that larger colloids have higher breakthrough concentrations wang et al 2012a sasidharan et al 2014 chen et al 2015 but others reported opposite trends lecoanet et al 2004 hu et al 2017 results and discussion associated with fig 6 suggest that this discrepancy can at least be partially explained by differences in the input concentration and retention mechanisms differences in concentration dependency of blocking and bridging besides some studies investigating the influence of colloid size employed the same input mass concentration hu et al 2017 whereas others have employed the same initial number concentration wang et al 2012a note that the number concentration for smaller colloids will be much higher than larger colloids when using the same input mass concentration it is therefore important to consider the definition and influence of concentration on retention mechanisms when investigating the effect of colloid size 3 4 pore fluid velocity numerical simulations are conducted to study the influence of velocity un ranged from 0 1 to 10 m d in pnm1 in the presence surface deposition and bridging and absence only surface deposition of hydrodynamic bridging when r p 1500 nm and c 0 2 1 1015 nc m3 fig 7 presents btcs and rps for these simulations increasing the velocity produced more bridging because more colloids come to the inlet of the pore throats in the same δt almost all the particles are retained at the inlet by bridging when the u n is larger than 10 m d fig 7a and 7c some experimental observations are consistent with this trend ramachandran and fogler 1999 sen and khilar 2006 but other studies have shown greater retention of colloids near the inlet under lower velocity conditions bradford et al 2007 several factors can contribute to this discrepancy for example torkzaban et al 2015 showed that increasing the hydrodynamic force velocity can overcome some colloid bridges to produce colloid release and a corresponding increase in permeability also the residence time for colloid aggregation increases under lower velocity conditions and this may increase bridging whereas flow induced aggregation can enhance bridging under high velocity conditions ramachandran et al 2000 mondal et al 2016 therefore the influence of velocity on bridging can be complicated and is dependent on colloid aggregation and hydrodynamic forces as well as the colloid size and concentration the influence of velocity on surface deposition has previously been discussed in detail by lin et al 2021a a brief discussion follows below for comparison purposes with the hydrodynamic bridging simulations fig 7c and 7d show btcs and rps respectively under various velocity conditions when only surface deposition is considered in pnm1 fig 8 shows the corresponding distribution of pore scale retention parameters η k t α k t and s f k t in pnm1 more retention happens at a lower velocity when the u n is greater or equal to 1 m d this occurs because the pore scale retention parameters tended to increase with a decrease in velocity in contrast less colloid retention happened when u n equals 0 1 than when u n equals 1 m d fig 7c and 7d this can be explained by the influence of detachment on transport and retention processes in this study the value of k det k t is set equal to 0 01 k att k t a higher value of k att k t under low velocity conditions therefore also produces a higher value of k det k t and greater residence time this higher value of k det k t and greater residence time when u n 0 1 m d caused a delay in the arrival of the btc and greater amounts of low concentration tailing in comparison to the higher velocity simulations fig 7c it also alters the shape of the rp as the colloids detach and move downgradient through the network in particular detachment and re attachment cause the rp to transition from a uniform shape to more retention at greater depths with increasing time fig s1 3 5 straining straining is another physical removal mechanism for colloids especially for larger colloids in finer textured soils fig 9 a and 9b show btcs and rps respectively for different colloid sizes rp 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 nm in pnm2 when considering straining and surface deposition results show that straining can cause hyper exponential rps which is also reported by previous simulation work yang and balhoff 2017 there is almost no breakthrough and most of the colloids are retained near the inlet when the colloid size is larger than the mean pore throat size e g r p 3000 nm and 4000 nm conversely the influence of straining is not significant when the colloid size e g r p 1000 nm and 2000 nm is smaller than the mean pore throat size hydrodynamic bridging is not considered in fig 9 to more clearly show the influence of straining comparison of figs 3 and 9 reveal that hydrodynamic bridging and straining both depend on the size of the colloid relative to the pore throat in contrast straining occurs over a smaller range in pore sizes and is not influenced by the colloid concentration or velocity furthermore the retention caused by hydrodynamic bridging usually happens very close to the inlet whereas retention caused by straining can happen over a longer relative distance the criterion for straining employed in this manuscript is based only on the relative size of the colloid to the pore throat microscopic observations and previous literature support this modeling approach for straining ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 however we acknowledge that this criterium is likely to be conservative because it does not consider the potential roles of i an energy barrier at a separation distance between the colloid and the solid surface wyss et al 2006 ii the number of streamlines that transport colloids through a capillary tube decrease as the size of the colloid approaches that of the pore throat kermani et al 2020 iii the available tube radius for colloid transport decreases with surface deposition chen et al 2008 and iv colloid aggregation in solution or on the solid surface can be mobilized to pore throats by hydrodynamic forces kermani et al 2020 note that retention of aggregates at the entrance of a pore throat can be viewed as a form of straining auset and keller 2006 that also depends on physicochemical factors e g concentration solution chemistry and hydrodynamics the inclusion of colloid aggregation in the pnm is a topic of ongoing research but is beyond the scope of this paper in addition the criterium for straining is also expected to change with the colloid shape with the longest dimension of a colloid mainly contributing to straining li and ma 2021 3 6 other factors equations 6 8 indicate that a higher δt and a lower ω will lead to more hydrodynamic bridging in the model the value of δt ω is therefore a critical factor in determining hydrodynamic bridging fig 10 summarizes the results of a sensitivity analysis to determine the fraction of the final retention caused by bridging f bridging as a function of δt ω when r p 1500 nm c 0 6 4 1015 nc m3 and u n 1 m d note that the final retention is determined at the end of the simulation 10 pv the value of f bridging is calculated as the ratio of the solid phase colloid concentration in pore bodies to that in pore bodies and throats hydrodynamic bridging is sensitive to the number of colloids that simultaneously arrive at the tube inlet eqs 6 8 larger values of δt ω reflect an increasing number of colloids at the inlet the value of f bridging in fig 10 therefore rapidly goes from 0 to 1 as δt ω increases in this study a value of δt ω 0 125 s is selected to produce a relatively small value of f bridging it should be mentioned that the sensitivity of bridging to δt ω is also expected to change with the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity figs 3 6 7 hydrodynamic bridging is considered in this work to be a purely physical process and surface deposition is influenced by chemical factors like ionic strength is consequently the relative importance of bridging and surface deposition is expected to change with the chemical conditions figs s2a and s2b show btcs and rps respectively under different is conditions 10 and 80 mm in the presence of bridging and surface deposition when r p 1500 nm c 0 6 4 1015 nc m3 and u n 1 m d the btcs show that blocking of surface deposition sites is significant when the is 80 mm in contrast there is very little surface deposition when the is 10 mm and the retention is almost exclusively controlled by bridging it should be mentioned that colloid interactions are not considered in this work if the interaction between colloids is attractive then aggregation can happen during transport kermani et al 2020 and large sized colloid aggregates are expected to produce more hydrodynamic bridging and or straining figs 3 and 9 the size distribution of colloids will change during aggregation bradford and leij 2018 the shape of an aggregate can be complicated and is reported to influence the transport and retention behavior kermani et al 2020 furthermore chemical conditions like ph and is will influence hydrodynamic bridging when particle particle interaction is considered agbangla et al 2012 surface deposition can also decrease the effective radius of a pore throat to enhance hydrodynamic bridging and straining conversely colloid bridges at pore throats might be impeded or destroyed by transient hydrodynamic forces or colloid collisions if the interactions are repulsive additional research at the pore and continuum scales are warranted to fully resolve these issues for example kermani et al 2020 recently presented computationally intensive constricted capillary tube scale simulations that explicitly considered colloid colloid and colloid solid interactions but neglected the role of roughness and charge heterogeneity 4 conclusions in this work pore network modeling is conducted to study the transport and retention behavior of colloids in porous media different retention mechanisms are systematically considered including surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining specific numerical experiments investigate the influence of colloid size initial colloid concentration and pore water velocity on the btcs and rps hydrodynamic bridging increases with an increase in the colloid size initial concentration and pore fluid velocity even though the colloid size is smaller than the pore throat in contrast surface deposition decreases with an increase in colloid size initial colloid concentration and pore fluid velocity straining happens when the colloid size is larger than the pore throat size and is not influenced by the concentration and velocity conditions the rps of the model may vary due to different retention mechanisms bridging and straining can both cause hyper experiential rps in contrast surface deposition can produce rps that are exponential or uniform in shape or increase with distance due to blocking and re attachment changes in the relative importance of hydrodynamic bridging straining and surface deposition can help explain previously reported inconsistencies in experimental

transport and retention in porous media is a common phenomenon in nature however retention mechanisms are not fully revealed based on macroscale experimental observations the pore network model pnm is an effective method to account for the pore structure of a porous medium and provides a direct connection between pore scale retention mechanisms and macroscale phenomenon in this study pnms with cylindrical pore throats and spherical pore bodies are used to upscale water flow and colloid transport from pore to macro scales taking into consideration surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity of pore water on colloid transport and retention behavior results show that hydrodynamic bridging and straining produce hyper exponential retention profiles whereas surface deposition due to nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity yields exponential or uniform retention profiles hydrodynamic bridging will not happen when the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity are lower than some threshold value r p 500 nm c 0 7 1 1014 nc m3 u 0 0 1 m d under the conditions of this study the relative importance of hydrodynamic bridging in comparison to surface deposition increases with an increase in the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity the pnm is a useful tool to discriminate different retention mechanisms and to predict colloid transport and retention behavior in porous media keywords colloid transport and retention pore network model hydrodynamic bridging straining surface deposition 1 introduction colloid transport and retention are of fundamental significance to many engineering and natural systems like the transport of bacteria and viruses or the remediation of underground systems using nanomaterials elimelech et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 babakhani et al 2017 the mobility and fate of colloids are significantly influenced by retention in porous media auset and keller 2006 sasidharan et al 2017 hilpert and johnson 2018 numerous theoretical and experimental studies have reported that the retention of colloids is influenced by many hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions including flow velocity kermani et al 2020 initial concentration of colloids wang et al 2012a particle size wang et al 2012a ionic strength saleh et al 2008 and surface heterogeneity trauscht et al 2015 colloid retention can happen due to different mechanisms including surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining sen and khilar 2006 gao 2008 yang and balhoff 2017 fig 1 presents a schematic illustrating these retention mechanisms surface deposition or attachment depends on the mass transfer of colloids to the solid water interface and the balance of forces and torques at a given location bradford and torkzaban 2015 hydrodynamic bridging refers to the simultaneous arrival and jamming of several colloids in a pore throat to form a stable bridge or arch even though the individual colloid size is smaller than the pore throat ramachandran and fogler 1999 zwart 2007 mondal et al 2016 straining happens when a colloid with a size larger than the pore throat is trapped in a pore body tufenkji et al 2004 auset and keller 2006 the surface deposition has been assumed to be controlled by adhesive interactions and contributes to ripening and blocking behavior molnar et al 2015 whereas straining is dependent on physical factors related to size considerations that influence clogging kermani et al 2020 hydrodynamic bridging can be treated as a physical process that is related to particle concentration and size zwart 2007 mondal et al 2016 but it can also be accompanied by particle aggregation that is affected by chemical conditions kermani et al 2020 it should be mentioned that different terminology has been employed to describe the above retention mechanisms for example hydrodynamic bridging is also described as jamming clogging plugging blockage or straining torkzaban et al 2015 mondal et al 2016 and straining can also be expressed as size exclusion moghadasi et al 2004 yang and balhoff 2017 and sieving dressaire and sauret 2016 notice that the colloid colloid interaction is not considered in the retention mechanisms shown in fig 1 when colloid colloid interaction is considered colloids could also attach to previously attached colloids and aggregate forms in the liquid could also be trapped at the inlet of the pore throat kermani et al 2020 column scale studies have commonly been conducted to study the influence of different physiochemical factors on colloid transport and retention busch et al 2014 treumann et al 2014 lin et al 2021b the results of column studies are usually represented as breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 raychoudhury and surasani 2017 yu et al 2018 hyper exponential rps a decreasing rate of retention with distance have been commonly reported in column studies for different types of colloids and nanoparticles tong et al 2005 wang et al 2017 johnson 2020 previous studies have attributed hyper exponential rps to different mechanisms including nanoscale heterogeneity tufenkji and elimelech 2005 johnson et al 2018 colloid polydispersity tong and johnson 2007 yang and balhoff 2017 colloid detachment tufenkji et al 2003 straining bradford et al 2006 and colloid aggregation chatterjee and gupta 2009 most of the previous work is based on the inverse fitting of parameters from the advection dispersion equation ade with different deposition kinetics to experimental btcs and rps however it is difficult to decipher isolate and predict the underlying retention mechanisms from fitting parameters of such studies due to the complexity of the porous medium structure and colloid suspension as well as other contributing factors molnar et al 2015 column studies therefore frequently show inconsistency in results and interpretations li et al 2015 hu et al 2017 pore network models pnms have been reported to be an effective method for studying transport problems in porous media long and hilpert 2009 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 which has been used to study colloid transport and retention in recent years seetha et al 2017 yang and balhoff 2017 meng and yang 2019 one of the main advantages of a pnm is that it can provide a direct connection between pore scale mechanisms to macro or continuum scale observations acharya et al 2004 simulation of colloid transport in a pnm can therefore provide a promising approach to help understand and unambiguously determine retention mechanisms under various physicochemical conditions lin et al 2021a utilized a pnm to consider the influence of nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity on the surface deposition of mono dispersed colloids in porous media however straining hydrodynamic bridging and poly dispersed suspensions were not considered in that study the objective of this study is to use a pnm to study and predict colloid transport behavior in the presence of different retention mechanisms the pnm employs cylindrical pore throats and spherical pore bodies to simulate the transport and retention of colloids in a porous medium this paper is the first to simultaneously consider all these three retention mechanisms surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining in a pnm the influence of colloid size initial concentration and water velocity on btcs and rps of pnms are then discussed 2 methodology 2 1 pore network models pnms pnms with spherical pore bodies and cylindrical tube pore throats are used to simulate solute or colloid transport in porous media raoof 2011 zhang et al 2017 of which the details have been reported in previous work lin et al 2021a fig 2 shows the geometries of two pnms with different pore sizes denoted as pnm1 and pnm2 that are employed to study different retention mechanisms both pnms contain 2000 pore bodies 10 10 20 have a porosity of 0 3 and are isotropic pnm1 contains 6637 pore throats and pnm2 contains 6810 pore throats the radius of pore bodies and pore throats obey normal distributions shown in table 1 the pore sizes of pnm1 and pnm2 are used to represent sand and silt respectively reddi and inyang 2000 minagawa et al 2008 the calculation method for the flow field in the pnm is discussed in the supporting information si the ability of the pnm to reasonably describe the transport of a methyl orange tracer is reported in the si results confirm that the advective dispersive transport of this tracer was accurately described using the pnm 2 2 colloid transport and retention three retention mechanisms shown in fig 1 are included in the pnm in which the pore structure is described by pore bodies and pore throats 2 2 1 surface deposition in this study the deposition of colloids is assumed to happen on pore throat surfaces the colloid size can be considered as a uniform or a piecewise uniform size distribution the transport and retention of different size colloids occurs by linear superimposition in the pore throat the governing aqueous and solid phase mass balance equations for a pore throat are given as 1 c k t t s k t t u t c k t x 2 s k t t ψ k t k att k t c k t k det k t s k t where c k t ncl 3 is the liquid phase colloid concentration s k t ncl 3 is the solid phase colloid concentration d l t l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the pore throat u t lt 1 is the average flow velocity in the pore throat k att k t t 1 is the attachment coefficient k det k t t 1 is the detachment coefficient and ψ k t is a dimensionless blocking function in this section the subscript k on parameters denotes the colloid size class and the subscript t denotes the tube scale pore scale parameter hydrodynamic dispersion is neglected in eq 1 because it has an insignificant effect at the tube scale raoof et al 2010 the value of k att k t is defined analogously to conventional colloid filtration theory yao et al 1971 as 3 k att k t η k t α k t u t l t where l t l is the length of the pore throat η k t is the collector efficiency and α k t is the sticking efficiency the value of η k t is determined from the known pore scale flow field ostadfar 2016 and numerical simulation of the convective diffusion equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the value of α k t is predicted from the force and torque balances on the solid water interface swi that contains nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity using a method described by previous work bradford and torkzaban 2015 the details of the calculation of η k t and α k t are outlined in the si and our previous work wang et al 2014 lin et al 2021a the value of k det k t is set to 0 01 k att k t in this study bradford and bettahar 2006 cohen et al 2019 blocking is accounted for in the model using the following equation for ψ k t 4 ψ k t 1 k r p k 2 s k t r c k 2 s max k t where s max k t ncl 3 is the maximum solid phase concentration for the colloid class and r p k l is the radius of the colloid equation 4 is a modified form of the langmuirian blocking function that assumes other colloid classes contribute to the filling of s max k t in a linear manner here we assume that s max k t for different size particles can encompass the same area on the porous medium zhang et al 2019 which is related to the fraction of the swi that contributes to retention for the colloid class s f k t as bradford and torkzaban 2012 5 s max k t 2 1 γ s f k t r t π r p k 2 where r t l is the radius of the pore throat and γ is the porosity of the colloid packing on the swi that is taken to be 0 5 johnson and elimelech 1995 similar to α k t the value of s f k t is predicted from the force and torque balances on an swi that contain nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity see si the importance of nanoscale heterogeneities on surface deposition has been experimentally confirmed in impinging jet and micromodel experiments rasmuson et al 2017 shen et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrodynamic bridging hydrodynamic bridging happens in a pore body when several colloids simultaneously arrive at the inlet of a pore throat and forms a colloid bridge or arc the number of colloids n k nc of which the radius equals to r q k that arrives at a pore throat during a time interval δt t is given as 6 n k q t c k t δ t where q t l3t 1 is the water flux the value of δt reflects the time limit for hydrodynamic bridging the sum of projection areas of all colloids that arrive at the pore throat a sum l2 equals 7 a sum k n k π r q k 2 note that eq 7 provides a conservative estimate of a sum because it does not consider the role of the energy barrier which occurs at separation distances from the colloid and solid surfaces under unfavorable conditions keller and auset 2007 shen et al 2018 in this study the criterion for hydrodynamic bridging is based on a comparison of a sum to the area of the pore throat as 8 a sum π r t 2 ω where ω is the porosity of the colloid bridge when this criterion for hydrodynamic bridging is satisfied the colloids do not get into the pore throat and are retained in the pore body this clogged pore throat is assumed to not contribute to colloid transport and retention during subsequent time steps our criterion for hydrodynamic bridging eq 8 is similar to other works that are based on the comparison of the sum of projection areas of all colloids and the cross sectional area of the pore throat wyss et al 2006 de zwart 2007 in support of this modeling approach microscopic observations show that hydrodynamic bridging occurs at the entrance of pore throats mustin and stoeber 2010 agbangla et al 2012 and increases with the ratio of the colloid to the pore size colloid concentration and pore water velocity ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 the above approach indicates that hydrodynamic bridging depends on the selected values of δt and ω a sensitive analysis is therefore conducted to assess the influence of these parameters on simulation results values of δt and ω for subsequent simulations are selected based on this analysis unless otherwise noted the values of δt and ω are set to 0 1 s and 0 8 respectively note that a lower limit for ω is expected to be around 0 5 to obtain a monolayer covering over the pore throat johnson and elimelech 1995 however it is reasonable to anticipate that bridging may also occur at pore throats for larger values of ω due to variations in a colloid bridge configuration incomplete coverage of the pore throat and deviations from the assumed cylindrical pore throat geometry 2 2 3 straining straining occurs in the pnm when the size of the colloid is larger than that of the inlet of a pore throat in this case the excluded colloids are retained in the pore body yang and balhoff 2017 this modeling approach is supported by microscopic observations of straining at the entrance of pore throats mustin and stoeber 2010 agbangla et al 2012 that is mainly influenced by the ratio of the colloid to the pore size ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 however it should be mentioned that this criterium may be overly conservative under unfavorable attachment conditions because it does not consider the role of the energy barrier which occurs at separation distances from the colloid and solid surfaces keller and auset 2007 shen et al 2018 2 3 simulation scenarios different numerical experiments are conducted to study the influence of surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging or straining under various initial concentrations velocities and colloid sizes table 2 provides a summary of the experimental conditions pnm1 is used to study hydrodynamic bridging and surface deposition no size exclusion happens in pnm1 because all colloid sizes are smaller than the smallest pore throat pnm2 is used to study the influence of straining and surface deposition bridging is turned off in pnm2 to show the influence of straining more clearly surface deposition depends on the properties of the solution and surface conditions of pore throats including the ionic strength nanoscale roughness charge heterogeneity macroscopic roughness etc the ionic strength is set at 80 mm and the zeta potentials of the colloid and swi are 23 4 mv and 11 9 mv respectively treumann et al 2014 the density of the colloid is set to 1500 kg m3 the mean value of the nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity fractions on the entire surface of the pnm are both set at 0 1 whereas spatial variability in these properties follows independent binominal distributions the height of the nanoscale roughness ranges from 0 to 50 nm the positive zeta potential ranges from 0 to 30 mv and the height of macroscopic roughness varies from 0 to 5000 nm bradford and torkzaban 2015 the hamaker constant between the colloid and the swi is 4 10 21 j and young s modulus of the colloid is 4 109 pa numerical experiments consist of injecting a 3 pore volume pv pulse of colloid suspension with a concentration of c 0 from the left side of the network followed by 7 pv of water the three dimensional pore structure is included in the model see fig 2 and the method provided here can be used to simulate two or three dimensional transport and retention processes furthermore pore scale parameter distributions for surface deposition parameters are also calculated to help interpret the results however one dimensional colloid transport and retention processes are usually considered at the continuum macro or column scale in this work the continuum scale btcs on the right side of the network and the final rps along the x direction are determined for each colloid size in the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 colloid size the btcs and rps profiles for various sized colloids r p 500 1000 1500 and 2000 nm are shown in fig 3 when considering different retention mechanisms the btcs are plotted as a function of normalized liquid phase concentration c c 0 versus pv whereas rps are plotted as normalized solid phase concentration s c 0 versus relative distance x x0 from the network inlet fig 3a and 3b show btcs and rps respectively when considering both surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging whereas fig 3c and 3d present similar information when only considering surface deposition in the model results show that the rps are uniform with relative distance when considering only surface deposition fig 3d which is due to blocking in contrast most of the retention happens near the network inlet for larger colloids rp 1500 and 2000 nm and in this case the rps exhibit a hyper exponential shape when considering hydrodynamic bridging and surface deposition fig 3b previous studies have attributed hyper exponential rps to different mechanisms including nanoscale heterogeneity tufenkji and elimelech 2005 johnson et al 2018 colloid polydispersity tong and johnson 2007 yang and balhoff 2017 colloid detachment tufenkji et al 2003 straining bradford et al 2006 and colloid aggregation chatterjee and gupta 2009 however it should be mentioned that it is difficult to infer the exact retention mechanisms from column scale observations the developed pnm provides an opportunity to mechanistically determine the contributions for various retention mechanisms it is worth mentioning that the influence of nanoscale roughness chemical heterogeneity macroscopic roughness and velocity variations is considered in surface deposition simulations but rps are still uniform lin et al 2021a results shown in fig 3 indicate that hydrodynamic bridging provides a viable explanation for hyper exponential rps fig 3 also shows the influence of colloid size on both surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging fig 3a and 3b show that larger colloids have much more retention near the inlet when considering hydrodynamic bridging these findings are consistent with previous microscopic experimental observations ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 sen and khilar 2006 in contrast fig 3c and 3d show that less retention occurs for larger colloids when only considering surface deposition the amount of surface deposition is determined by distributions of pore scale retention parameters which are shown in fig 4 larger colloids have a higher η k t because the probability for sedimentation increases with an increase in colloid size tufenkji and elimelech 2004 conversely values of α k t and s f k t are lower for larger colloids because the applied hydrodynamic torque increases more rapidly than the resisting adhesive torque bradford and torkzaban 2015 the value of k att k t is determined by the product of η k t and α k t when the velocity and geometry are constant in this study k att k t slightly increases with the colloid size however larger colloids also have a higher projection area and lower s f k t therefore the influence of blocking is more pronounced for larger colloids and this causes less retention sasidharan et al 2014 3 2 colloid size distribution fig 3 also includes btcs and rps red line with square marks for a colloid distribution that includes an equal number of colloids 1 6 1015 nc m3 in each size class r p 500 1000 1500 and 2000 nm note that total number concentrations are used in this figure the btc and rp for this colloid distribution most closely resembled those for the monodispersed r p 1500 nm suspension this implies that the transport and retention of this colloid distribution is controlled by larger colloid sizes because they contributed more area for blocking and hydrodynamic bridging conversely bradford and leij 2018 simulated the transport behavior of poly dispersed colloid suspensions when using a constant value of α and continuum scale values of η predicted from filtration theory and found that colloids with r p around 750 nm exhibited the greatest transport potential previous literature has reported different transport and retention behavior with the colloid size distribution some researchers reported that the average colloid aggregate size increased after passing through the porous media solovitch et al 2010 wang et al 2012c but others reported the opposite trend chen et al 2011 wang et al 2012b colloids with different sizes can have different pore scale parameters which are further influenced by the solution chemistry roughness and charge heterogeneity conditions lin et al 2021a further research is warranted about the influence of the colloid size distribution on retention processes and its variation during transport the corresponding relative effluent concentrations for each colloid size class are shown in fig 5 results show that smaller colloids preferentially breakthrough during the initial injection period because of their smaller deposition and or bridging rates however differences in effluent concentrations with the colloid size tend to diminish at later times because of blocking these trends are relatively consistent in simulations with fig 5a and without fig 5b hydrodynamic bridging this implies that bridging is a process in which different sized colloids work together although small colloids will not independently form a bridge they apparently can contribute to bridges with larger colloids 3 3 colloid concentration blocking and hydrodynamic bridging are both functions of the initial colloid concentration additional numerical simulations on pnm1 are therefore conducted to study the influence of initial concentration c 0 ranged from 7 14 1014 to 1 9 1016 nc m3 on surface deposition and hydrodynamic bridging when r p 1500 nm fig 6 presents btcs and rps for these simulations simulations with and without hydrodynamic bridging are the same when c 0 7 14 1014 nc m3 this indicates that hydrodynamic bridging did not happen at these concentration levels conversely results are sensitive to the input concentration when c 0 greater than 7 14 1014 nc m3 however the concentration dependency shows opposite trends for simulations with and without hydrodynamic bridging higher c 0 causes more relative retention near the inlet when hydrodynamic bridging is considered in the simulations fig 6a and 6b because the projection area of colloids in a pore throat increases with c 0 eqs 6 7 this prediction is consistent with some previous experimental observations ramachandran and fogler 1999 auset and keller 2006 conversely higher c 0 leads to less relative retention fig 6c and 6d when only considering surface deposition wang et al 2012a reported the results of column studies on silica nanoparticles and their results show that higher particle number concentration led to lower relative retention a similar tendency has also been reported by leij et al 2015 and this is attributed to faster blocking of the limit surface area for attachment these observations suggest that the concentration dependency of colloid retention will depend on the relative strength of blocking and hydrodynamic bridging it should be mentioned that experimental observations on the influence of colloid size on retention are inconsistent some of the previous work reported that larger colloids have higher breakthrough concentrations wang et al 2012a sasidharan et al 2014 chen et al 2015 but others reported opposite trends lecoanet et al 2004 hu et al 2017 results and discussion associated with fig 6 suggest that this discrepancy can at least be partially explained by differences in the input concentration and retention mechanisms differences in concentration dependency of blocking and bridging besides some studies investigating the influence of colloid size employed the same input mass concentration hu et al 2017 whereas others have employed the same initial number concentration wang et al 2012a note that the number concentration for smaller colloids will be much higher than larger colloids when using the same input mass concentration it is therefore important to consider the definition and influence of concentration on retention mechanisms when investigating the effect of colloid size 3 4 pore fluid velocity numerical simulations are conducted to study the influence of velocity un ranged from 0 1 to 10 m d in pnm1 in the presence surface deposition and bridging and absence only surface deposition of hydrodynamic bridging when r p 1500 nm and c 0 2 1 1015 nc m3 fig 7 presents btcs and rps for these simulations increasing the velocity produced more bridging because more colloids come to the inlet of the pore throats in the same δt almost all the particles are retained at the inlet by bridging when the u n is larger than 10 m d fig 7a and 7c some experimental observations are consistent with this trend ramachandran and fogler 1999 sen and khilar 2006 but other studies have shown greater retention of colloids near the inlet under lower velocity conditions bradford et al 2007 several factors can contribute to this discrepancy for example torkzaban et al 2015 showed that increasing the hydrodynamic force velocity can overcome some colloid bridges to produce colloid release and a corresponding increase in permeability also the residence time for colloid aggregation increases under lower velocity conditions and this may increase bridging whereas flow induced aggregation can enhance bridging under high velocity conditions ramachandran et al 2000 mondal et al 2016 therefore the influence of velocity on bridging can be complicated and is dependent on colloid aggregation and hydrodynamic forces as well as the colloid size and concentration the influence of velocity on surface deposition has previously been discussed in detail by lin et al 2021a a brief discussion follows below for comparison purposes with the hydrodynamic bridging simulations fig 7c and 7d show btcs and rps respectively under various velocity conditions when only surface deposition is considered in pnm1 fig 8 shows the corresponding distribution of pore scale retention parameters η k t α k t and s f k t in pnm1 more retention happens at a lower velocity when the u n is greater or equal to 1 m d this occurs because the pore scale retention parameters tended to increase with a decrease in velocity in contrast less colloid retention happened when u n equals 0 1 than when u n equals 1 m d fig 7c and 7d this can be explained by the influence of detachment on transport and retention processes in this study the value of k det k t is set equal to 0 01 k att k t a higher value of k att k t under low velocity conditions therefore also produces a higher value of k det k t and greater residence time this higher value of k det k t and greater residence time when u n 0 1 m d caused a delay in the arrival of the btc and greater amounts of low concentration tailing in comparison to the higher velocity simulations fig 7c it also alters the shape of the rp as the colloids detach and move downgradient through the network in particular detachment and re attachment cause the rp to transition from a uniform shape to more retention at greater depths with increasing time fig s1 3 5 straining straining is another physical removal mechanism for colloids especially for larger colloids in finer textured soils fig 9 a and 9b show btcs and rps respectively for different colloid sizes rp 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 nm in pnm2 when considering straining and surface deposition results show that straining can cause hyper exponential rps which is also reported by previous simulation work yang and balhoff 2017 there is almost no breakthrough and most of the colloids are retained near the inlet when the colloid size is larger than the mean pore throat size e g r p 3000 nm and 4000 nm conversely the influence of straining is not significant when the colloid size e g r p 1000 nm and 2000 nm is smaller than the mean pore throat size hydrodynamic bridging is not considered in fig 9 to more clearly show the influence of straining comparison of figs 3 and 9 reveal that hydrodynamic bridging and straining both depend on the size of the colloid relative to the pore throat in contrast straining occurs over a smaller range in pore sizes and is not influenced by the colloid concentration or velocity furthermore the retention caused by hydrodynamic bridging usually happens very close to the inlet whereas retention caused by straining can happen over a longer relative distance the criterion for straining employed in this manuscript is based only on the relative size of the colloid to the pore throat microscopic observations and previous literature support this modeling approach for straining ramachandran and fogler 1999 poesio and ooms 2004 however we acknowledge that this criterium is likely to be conservative because it does not consider the potential roles of i an energy barrier at a separation distance between the colloid and the solid surface wyss et al 2006 ii the number of streamlines that transport colloids through a capillary tube decrease as the size of the colloid approaches that of the pore throat kermani et al 2020 iii the available tube radius for colloid transport decreases with surface deposition chen et al 2008 and iv colloid aggregation in solution or on the solid surface can be mobilized to pore throats by hydrodynamic forces kermani et al 2020 note that retention of aggregates at the entrance of a pore throat can be viewed as a form of straining auset and keller 2006 that also depends on physicochemical factors e g concentration solution chemistry and hydrodynamics the inclusion of colloid aggregation in the pnm is a topic of ongoing research but is beyond the scope of this paper in addition the criterium for straining is also expected to change with the colloid shape with the longest dimension of a colloid mainly contributing to straining li and ma 2021 3 6 other factors equations 6 8 indicate that a higher δt and a lower ω will lead to more hydrodynamic bridging in the model the value of δt ω is therefore a critical factor in determining hydrodynamic bridging fig 10 summarizes the results of a sensitivity analysis to determine the fraction of the final retention caused by bridging f bridging as a function of δt ω when r p 1500 nm c 0 6 4 1015 nc m3 and u n 1 m d note that the final retention is determined at the end of the simulation 10 pv the value of f bridging is calculated as the ratio of the solid phase colloid concentration in pore bodies to that in pore bodies and throats hydrodynamic bridging is sensitive to the number of colloids that simultaneously arrive at the tube inlet eqs 6 8 larger values of δt ω reflect an increasing number of colloids at the inlet the value of f bridging in fig 10 therefore rapidly goes from 0 to 1 as δt ω increases in this study a value of δt ω 0 125 s is selected to produce a relatively small value of f bridging it should be mentioned that the sensitivity of bridging to δt ω is also expected to change with the colloid size initial concentration and flow velocity figs 3 6 7 hydrodynamic bridging is considered in this work to be a purely physical process and surface deposition is influenced by chemical factors like ionic strength is consequently the relative importance of bridging and surface deposition is expected to change with the chemical conditions figs s2a and s2b show btcs and rps respectively under different is conditions 10 and 80 mm in the presence of bridging and surface deposition when r p 1500 nm c 0 6 4 1015 nc m3 and u n 1 m d the btcs show that blocking of surface deposition sites is significant when the is 80 mm in contrast there is very little surface deposition when the is 10 mm and the retention is almost exclusively controlled by bridging it should be mentioned that colloid interactions are not considered in this work if the interaction between colloids is attractive then aggregation can happen during transport kermani et al 2020 and large sized colloid aggregates are expected to produce more hydrodynamic bridging and or straining figs 3 and 9 the size distribution of colloids will change during aggregation bradford and leij 2018 the shape of an aggregate can be complicated and is reported to influence the transport and retention behavior kermani et al 2020 furthermore chemical conditions like ph and is will influence hydrodynamic bridging when particle particle interaction is considered agbangla et al 2012 surface deposition can also decrease the effective radius of a pore throat to enhance hydrodynamic bridging and straining conversely colloid bridges at pore throats might be impeded or destroyed by transient hydrodynamic forces or colloid collisions if the interactions are repulsive additional research at the pore and continuum scales are warranted to fully resolve these issues for example kermani et al 2020 recently presented computationally intensive constricted capillary tube scale simulations that explicitly considered colloid colloid and colloid solid interactions but neglected the role of roughness and charge heterogeneity 4 conclusions in this work pore network modeling is conducted to study the transport and retention behavior of colloids in porous media different retention mechanisms are systematically considered including surface deposition hydrodynamic bridging and straining specific numerical experiments investigate the influence of colloid size initial colloid concentration and pore water velocity on the btcs and rps hydrodynamic bridging increases with an increase in the colloid size initial concentration and pore fluid velocity even though the colloid size is smaller than the pore throat in contrast surface deposition decreases with an increase in colloid size initial colloid concentration and pore fluid velocity straining happens when the colloid size is larger than the pore throat size and is not influenced by the concentration and velocity conditions the rps of the model may vary due to different retention mechanisms bridging and straining can both cause hyper experiential rps in contrast surface deposition can produce rps that are exponential or uniform in shape or increase with distance due to blocking and re attachment changes in the relative importance of hydrodynamic bridging straining and surface deposition can help explain previously reported inconsistencies in experimental

4071,the indian subcontinent suffers from a decline in the per capita of water resources in the course of recent decades due to exponential population growth in india the majority of the population is reliant on agribusiness which is in turn primarily dependent on water from monsoons regions that get lower precipitation than needed experience water deficits which impact agriculture however investigation of linkages between the trends in water balance components and land cover distribution has not been performed in our work we focus on the water balance for the major river basins in india utilizing the following satellite and model based datasets terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace precipitation p from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm evapotranspiration et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and total runoff surface overflow and baseflow r from the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas we assessed the seasonal spatio temporal changes in the water balance from 2002 to 2019 and observed that agriculture and urban are the two most disrupted land cover types displaying a monotonic increasing decreasing trend in the components of water balance we also observed from the svd singular value decomposition analysis that the inherent spatial variability between p et r and twsa do not correlate well we also found that north eastern india and regions in southern india along the west coast show large negative trends of p 15 to 20 mm and r 10 to 15 mm in the monsoon season indicating that these regions suffer from drier monsoon seasons over the study period 2002 2019 from the land cover linkages it was found that 74 of monotonic trends observed in several of river basins were linked to agricultural land cover type and 19 were linked to urban land cover type these linkages suggest that agricultural lands are more vulnerable to changes in the components of the water balance 1 introduction india has a strong monsoonal influence which implies that most of india receives over half of the annual precipitation during the four monsoon months between june and september this likewise suggests that roughly 80 of the streamflow occurs between june and september kripalani et al 2003 krishnamurthy and kirtman 2009 after all the surface water has been spent individual farmers resort to harvesting rainwater storages and pumping groundwater to meet their water demands there is a need for management and planning of how the water will be utilized after the rainfall season specifically with a focus on the river basins that receive low precipitation to carry out such planning it is necessary to monitor the changes in the seasonal patterns of the components of water balance precipitation p runoff r evapotranspiration et and water storage the indian population of roughly 1 3 billion individuals relies upon agriculture for food and livelihood as cultivable land is the principal source of financial security https www indiawaterportal org topics agriculture the per capita water accessibility has fallen by 400 in the past 60 years the world bank 2019 world bank 2010 owing to these issues it is critical to consider the changes in accessible water i e surface water and groundwater for all the major river basins in india which are lifelines of india s economy asoka et al 2018 2017 misra 2014 wada et al 2010 agribusiness a fundamental segment of the economy represents 14 of india s gross domestic product gdp a study by bhanja and mukherjee 2019 shows that despite the increasing precipitation some regions display high rates of groundwater losses attributed due to excessive pumping the anthropogenic impact on water utilization has triggered the impractical utilization of accessible water resources ashraf et al 2017 taylor et al 2013b vörösmarty et al 2000 additionally there have been studies that show the various sectors of the water usage aerts et al 2006 asoka et al 2018 macdonald et al 2015 shah et al 2016 this has further influenced the harvest designs in various river basins macdonald et al 2016 taylor et al 2013a yield patterns of crops primarily correspond to the seasonal precipitation cycle and sudden changes to this seasonal cycle particularly the monsoon season represent a threat especially to the rural communities of the country in the context of indian river basins there are very limited studies that analyse the hydrologic fluxes and storages chen et al 2014 rodell et al 2009a soni and syed 2015 one such study by soni and syed 2015 characterizes the role of hydrologic fluxes using the total water storage tws anomaly the study concludes that groundwater storage is depleting in the ganga whereas it is increasing in the godavari and krishna basins a limitation to this study is that it only considers four of the major river basins of india ganga godavari krishna and mahanadi additionally the study does not examine the relationship between the trends of water balance components and land cover type other studies chen et al 2014 rodell et al 2009 mainly focus on the north western india where highly negative tws anomalies have been observed thereby lacking the analysis of other parts of india in order to examine the impact of different water balance components influencing water resources numerous studies have been carried out in india and across the globe these include research that have detailed the impacts of environmental change and population rise that have made water security an important issue in the river basins of india china greece and united states barnett et al 2004 christensen et al 2004 fishman et al 2011 gemitzi and lakshmi 2018 piao et al 2010 shah 2009 a worldwide investigation of accessible water by lakshmi et al 2018 presents an extensive spatial and temporal examination of the hydrological factors related to water budget for significant river basins across various continents with different climate and ecological conditions a study by rodell et al 2018 attributes the drivers of changes in total water into interannual variability groundwater utilization and environmental change because of climate change there are more frequent extreme precipitation events and land surface and sea surface temperatures are exhibiting positive anomalies kingston et al 2011 kite 2001 mishra and lilhare 2016 ragab and prudhomme 2002 around 5 6 million people in india will be inhabiting exceptionally water scarce regions by 2055 arnell 2004 this issue has initiated discussions around the world that are not simply restricted to india on issues related to water security babovic et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2007 nazemi and madani 2018 a few research studies have also called attention to the excessive usage of groundwater on a global scale alcamo et al 2007 oki and kanae 2006 wada et al 2012 several satellite datasets from different sources have been used to carry out this study table 1 satellite datasets indirectly measure the actual physical quantities from space and they do not matchup perfectly to in situ observations these hydrological variables have been validated at global scale with in situ observations but sufficient validation at watershed scales especially in india are lacking in the literature for instance precipitation is sufficiently validated for the indian subcontinent mondal et al 2018b mondal et al 2018 found that trmm tmpa tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis estimated precipitation shows good agreement with indian meteorological department imd in situ observations in addition precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann also shows good agreement in terms of annual and monsoonal trends with imd in situ observations tmpa product showed the lowest mean root mean squared error rmse of 25 to 50 mm for majority of central southern and north western india mondal et al 2018 they reported correlation coefficients between 0 8 and 1 for all regions in india except the northern himalayas the study concluded that tmpa and persiann can be reliably used in hydrological and climate studies in the river basins of india for runoff there are no validation studies performed that are specific to the indian subcontinent there are two reasons for the lack of such studies 1 validation of gldas runoff requires building a land surface water routing model and 2 there is a lack of publicly available in situ streamflow observations in the northern north western and north eastern parts of india these regions contain transboundary river basins which includes the ganga the brahmaputra and the indus river and hence the central water commission cwc of india does not publicly share streamflow observations for these river basins the fundamental objective of the current research is to address the following question are the trends in hydrological variables linked to land cover distribution 2 data and study area 2 1 indian major river basins in our study we analyse nine major river basins brahmaputra cauvery pennar ganga godavari indus krishna mahanadi narmada tapti and sabarmati mahi fig 1 we selected the river basins with an area 50 000 km2 to avoid the complexities from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace estimates due to its coarse resolution these nine river basins represent diverse topography land cover distributions size of the watershed climate and weather patterns across india for the trans boundary river basins we only consider the areal extent inside india to observe the changes occurring in these watershed systems there have been very few previous studies bhuvaneswari et al 2013 van beek et al 2011a on each of the individual basins table 2 and a comprehensive study of all major river basins in india has not been conducted in the last decade 2 2 grace and grace fo in our study we use grace rl06 product and grace fo rl06 product from nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum gfz and center for space research at university of texas austin csr for terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa syed et al 2008 ensemble mean of products from all three organizations was used to reduce the uncertainty in the processing algorithms but this does not improve the resolution of the data the data is available at a spatial grid of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of one month https grace jpl nasa gov data grace months for the terrestrial water anomalies these anomalies depict the changes in the total water column of earth which includes surface sub surface and groundwater components syed et al 2008 grace has been used in numerous regional swenson et al 2003 swenson and wahr 2009 voss et al 2013 and continental scale schmidt et al 2006 tapley et al 2004a van beek et al 2011 water budget studies 2 3 trmm the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite was launched in 1997 to study tropical and subtropical rainfall kummerow et al 2000 simpson et al 1996 we used the version 7 tmpa trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis product for our study this product is the most widely used trmm product and is available at 0 25 spatial resolution covering the region between 50 n 50 s latitudes at a daily temporal repeat from 1998 to the present several studies have evaluated trmm tmpa accuracy using gauge precipitation data over different parts across the world including south america rozante et al 2010 kyrgyzstan karaseva et al 2012 tibetan plateau xu 2016 indonesia prasetia et al 2013 china li et al 2013 and india kirtsaeng et al 2011 mondal et al 2018 prakash and gairola 2014 shah et al 2016 2 4 gldas global land data assimilation system gldas is an assimilation model which combines satellite and ground based observational data products through different land surface models to generate land surface states and fluxes at the global scale rodell et al 2004 five different land surface models noah variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic common land model clm and catchment are used for assimilation we decided to use noah derived runoff as it has better performance compared to the other model outputs bai et al 2016 lohmann et al 2004 zaitchik et al 2010 apart from the comparison between different gldas model outputs these studies also validate it at several regional scales in different parts of the world since a study does not exist which validates gldas output for indian watersheds we performed validation with observed data in order to assess its performance gldas noah model outputs are simulated by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc in this study we only use the model outputs generated at nasa gsfc further information on forcing inputs to gldas models can be found on https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas forcing data in this study we use total runoff surface runoff baseflow output from the gldas v2 1 assimilated data simulated from noah lsm model l4 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 at a monthly time step this dataset has been validated at different locations with in situ observation data bai et al 2016 kim et al 2018 li et al 2015 for runoff soil moisture et and several other hydrological variables since this dataset provides modelled outputs for 36 different hydrological variables at a global scale it is frequently used in the studies of the data sparse region and continental scale studies lorenz et al 2014 zawadzki and kȩdzior 2014 2 5 modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is the main sensor on the terra and aqua satellites launched by nasa in 1999 and 2002 respectively the modis sensor observes surface brightness temperature in 36 spectral bands which is used in imaging the atmosphere land and ocean we used the mod16a2 product which provides et estimates based on the penman monteith method mu et al 2011 mod16a2 is available at 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution validation has been performed for different parts of asia and australia for the et estimates based on modis cleugh et al 2007 kim et al 2012 2 6 climate change initiative cci land cover european space agency esa started the cci program which provides land cover maps from 1998 to 2018 at a native spatial resolution of 300 m european space agency these spatial maps are produced globally 2 7 uncertainties associated with satellite observations and model outputs satellite data uncertainties are dependent on the retrieval algorithm as well as the spatio temporal scale affected by the cloud cover reflectance thermal radiance and infrequent satellite overpasses aghakouchak et al 2009 chang and chiu 1997 hossain et al 2006 morrissey and greene 1998 precipitation data from trmm has seasonal as well as spatial bias when compared to the rain gauge station data obtained from the indian meteorological department le et al 2018 shukla et al 2019 topography and local climate conditions predominantly affect the uncertainties in the trmm estimates bharti and singh 2015 further modelled data provides runoff which has been validated at global and continental scales but these datasets underperform at the regional scale there are issues with modis evapotranspiration as it underestimates the et as found in several studies conducted across the globe aguilar et al 2018 du and song 2018 tang et al 2015 in addition to the uncertainty in precipitation et and modelled runoff grace derived total water storage anomalies has errors in estimation errors these errors are in the form of monthly gravity field solutions and the error caused by detecting mass changes other than the mass water storage changes swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 2006 these satellite datasets with coarse resolutions of the order of tens of kilometres can lead to unsatisfactory consistency issues while precipitation and runoff data are available at 0 25 evapotranspiration data is available at a spatial resolution of 500 m and the best available resolution for grace twsa is 0 5 to reduce the uncertainty from using a single grace product we have used an ensemble of all three grace products gfz csr and jpl seo et al 2009 concluded that the coarse resolution of grace can provide inaccurate results especially for basins smaller than 90 000 km2 in reference to our study only the sabarmati mahi river basin the smallest river basin in our study has an area of 72 170 km2 for the sabarmati mahi sixteen pixels cover the river basin we found that the grace twsa has a fairly good correlation with p et r and the peaks and lows of the time series correlate well for the sabarmati mahi river basin finally we wanted to make our study consistent by including all the major river basins of india hence we have not excluded them from our analysis owing to issuing arising from the grace spatial resolution 3 methodology our analysis is divided into four parts validation of the data sets seasonal analysis of the water budgets seasonal singular value decomposition and trend analysis and linkage between water balance components and land cover 3 1 validation of datasets for the analysis in this study satellite datasets for precipitation were used in addition to modelled outputs for evapotranspiration and runoff in this study we performed validation of gldas based runoff with streamflow data obtained from global runoff data do et al 2017 fig 3 the observed in situ data was compared with gldas modelled runoff output using correlation coefficients and paired significance t test as building a runoff routing model was beyond the scope of this study a total of 310 stations were used for the validation process which were located in central western and southern india 3 2 seasonal analysis and water budget using p et r and δs to observe the seasonality in water balance components we plotted the boxplots of each with their monthly distribution during a year these boxplots represent the median variation of the corresponding monthly values along with its 25 and 75 distribution and minimum and maximum values for a corresponding month the following equation gives the water balance of a river basin 2 p et r δ s where p et r and δ s are monthly averaged values for p precipitation et evapotranspiration r runoff and changes in water surface and sub surface storage separately for each river basin if there exists a significant anthropogenic influence in a river basin we must incorporate this influence in equation 2 to consider the water withdrawal for irrigation and household use haddeland et al 2014 querner 2000 veldkamp et al 2017 since the withdrawal term is small in comparison with δs we have disregarded it in the water balance computation similar to lakshmi et al 2018 in many cases there would be a lag between precipitation and runoff or changes in sub surface hence we perform a lagged analysis to determine the most suitable relationship between the p et r and twsa time series to calculate the r squared values we assigned lag between 0 and 6 months to the grace twsa and calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between p et r and lag assigned twsa 3 3 seasonal singular value decomposition and trend analysis to understand any inherent co variability and patterns in the water balance we performed singular value decomposition svd on two individual datasets p et r and twsa for every season svd is used to analyze the coupled variability in these two datasets bretherton et al 1992 wallace et al 1992 in order to perform svd analysis we calculate the spatial cross covariance matrix of the whole grid if we consider a data field a with m spatial grid points and n temporal observations seasonal summation for each year we can write the svd data matrix as svd a w where a is an n m matrix n observations with m grid points svd is an orthogonal projections matrix with the shape of n n matrix n svd components with n observations and w is a weight matrix with the shape of m n n singular values with m variable weights the components of svd matrix are orthogonal linear projections that represent the directions of greatest variability the singular vectors corresponding to w matrix are the loadings corresponding to each svd component the magnitude of these singular vectors represents the variance explained by the corresponding component as indicated by the indian meteorological department imd there are four seasons in india pre monsoon southwest monsoon post monsoon and winter the pre monsoon season includes the months from march to may the southwest monsoon season is from june to september the post monsoon season is from october to december and the winter season includes the months of january and february in addition to the spatial patterns we analysed the seasonal trends in each water balance components to examine the temporal variability since our datasets exhibit annual seasonality we chose to use the seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 to examine monotonic patterns the slope for the monotonic trends was determined utilizing sen s slope estimator the trend results are significant at p 0 05 spatial averaging was performed over the river basins for each season to conduct the test 3 4 analyze the linkage between water balance components and landcover we classified the landcover distribution for each river basin into major land cover types we used land cover maps from 2002 and 2018 to compare the differences in the percentage of each land cover type for the nine major river basins since the resolution of the land cover map is much finer 300 m we aggregate the land cover pixels at 300 m to the grace pixels at 0 5 the aggregation was done based on majority statistic for land cover types in that pixel we further use this information to link these land cover types with the increasing and decreasing patterns of twsa the satellite datasets we use in the study have different spatial resolutions while p and r information have the same spatial resolution of 0 25 modis et is at 500 m land cover at 300 m dem at 30 m and grace twsa are at a spatial resolution of 0 5 considering the low spatial resolution of the grace dataset we upscaled the p et r land cover and dem values to a spatial resolution of 0 5 we used averaging as the aggregation method for upscaling we used grace twsa at its native resolution of 0 5 4 results 4 1 seasonal cycle dominant seasonal variations are a significant characteristic of the hydrology of indian river basins to understand these seasonal variations we examined the mean monthly precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff for the study period at their native spatial resolution 2002 2019 fig 2 the boxplot shows the measure of five statistics minimum maximum upper 75 and lower 25 quartile and the median from the plots we observe that all river basins receive most of their precipitation during the months corresponding to the monsoon i e june to september the brahmaputra river basin receives a median precipitation of 400 mm in june 427 mm in july 366 mm in august and 296 mm in september of the annual total of 2130 mm and 1489 mm falls between june to september on the other hand for the indus river basin with the lowest annual precipitation of 525 mm it receives 51 mm in june 108 mm in july 103 mm in august and 69 mm in september which amounts to 330 mm between june to september further we observe that mahanadi river and sabarmati mahi river show high variability in precipitation 300 350 mm for july and august respectively corresponding to the monsoon season godavari and krishna river basins receive annual rainfall of 1121 mm and 977 mm respectively with much less precipitation 50 mm during non monsoon months the indus and ganga river basins receive snowfall at higher elevations during the winter months which can be seen from the precipitation in january and february similarly we observe that runoff for all the river basins follow the variability similar to precipitation implying higher runoff values corresponding to monsoon months and relatively lower runoff for the rest of the year boxplots of et do not follow any particular pattern although we observe relatively higher values during monsoon summer months 4 2 hydrological water balance firstly gldas generated runoff was validated with observed streamflow fig 3 we found that gldas generated runoff had mean correlation r2 of 0 53 across all the stations for et india does not have an established flux network hence we did not perform a validation for modis et products we examined the twsa derived from grace and p et r from individual satellite observations and model output to consider the annual cycle of the water balance components for every river basin from 2002 to 2019 fig 4 the time series in most of the river basins exhibit seasonality with the p et r and twsa having maximum values during the monsoon season with the exception of the indus and cauvery river basin where we do not observe strong seasonality twsa lags p et r in a several of the river basins with all river basins indicating a one month lag except the indus river basin which does not show any lag table 3 to evaluate the direct relationship between p et r and twsa we calculated the pearson relationship coefficients at a 5 significant level for each river basin the ganga river basin alongside the southern and western india river basins show a higher relationship r2 0 5 while indus shows a lower value r2 0 3 significance at a p value of 0 05 table 3 two potential reasons that these river basins show higher correlation could be due to either low human intervention in the river basin or due to high recharge rate for the watershed which can be caused by higher precipitation in the case of a developing country such as india with a high population density it is unlikely for the former to be the explanation for the higher correlation i e human intervention will exist normally river basins with tropical and subtropical climatic conditions show high relationship similar to the case in our examination godavari r2 0 60 and ganga r2 0 54 while the indus river basin shows a lower r2 of 0 25 the two semi arid river basins in western india narmada tapti r2 0 59 and sabarmati mahi r2 0 57 display correlation coefficients similar to the tropical river basin like ganga r2 0 54 which can be ascribed to increased precipitation in western india over the previous decade asoka et al 2017 4 3 seasonal svd analysis we plotted the first orthogonal components obtained using singular value decomposition for determining spatial patterns in p et r and twsa fig 5 the dark red and dark green coloured regions in the map depict regions which explain the most variability in the corresponding seasons over entire india for the winter season variability in northern india is strongly coupled with southern india since these two regions have opposite signs for their corresponding eigenvector components increase or decrease in one region implies a corresponding decrease or increase of p et r in the other region similarly the pre monsoon season depicts weak coupling of north eastern india with central and north western india for the monsoon season we found that the western coast of india and southern part of the brahmaputra river basin have strong co variability whereas there is weak co variability associated with the other parts of india it is important to note that there is strong variability in the brahmaputra river basin during pre monsoon season which dominates the water storage changes led by significant changes in precipitation lastly for the post monsoon season we observe that the variability can be attributed majorly to central india in addition it is interesting to note that the inherent spatial patterns in twsa are inconsistent with the inherent spatial patterns in p et r this difference in spatial pattern is attributed to the anthropogenic interactions causing disruptions in the total water storage for the principal components in twsa we observed highly negative dominant loadings for winter pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in north western india these inherent patterns again suggest that north western india faces an acute problem of decreasing twsa over the past two decades similar negative loadings are observed for eastern india states of bihar and west bengal but high positive loadings in the pre monsoon season for this region offsets the negative impacts of decreasing twsa 4 4 seasonal mann kendall trend analysis to understand the trends in river basins across different seasons we used de seasonalized data to perform mann kendall mk test hirsch et al 1982 and assessed the monotonic patterns utilizing sen s slope estimator fig 6 table 4 all the patterns estimated are significant at p 0 05 the spatial patterns show monotonic decrease in monsoonal p and r whereas there is an increase in the et we observe that south western india central india and eastern india show high decreasing trends 15 mm for the monsoon season corresponding to p and r whereas et shows increasing trends 10 15 mm mostly in central and eastern india for other seasons there are relatively lower rates of increasing decreasing trends it can be further observed that southern india shows high decreasing trends in p and r for the post monsoon season 10 15 mm whereas the rest of india shows very little variation lastly as expected the trends in r to have very high spatial correlation with the trends in p from the temporal analysis table 4 fig s1 we observe that for the brahmaputra river basin p shows a decrease of 0 56 mm yr an increase in et and r by 0 01 mm yr and 0 36 mm yr respectively and a large decline in twsa of 18 mm yr further the ganga river basin shows a decrease in twsa with a rate of 18 mm yr and no patterns in other components of the water balance the indus river basin shows a decline of 11 mm yr in twsa and an increase of runoff by 0 25 mm yr the mahanadi river basin indicated a decreasing trend in twsa at a rate of 9 mm yr however the krishna river basin shows an increase in runoff at 0 03 mm yr 4 5 land cover linkage from the comparison of the 300 m land cover map with the 50 km land cover map we found that the majority statistic realistically represents the landcover distribution inside large as well as smaller river basins fig s2 and figure table s1 for instance for ganga river basin agricultural land is the major land cover type with 83 75 coverage in the 50 km resampled map whereas it is 78 5 in the original land cover map from the land cover comparison of 2002 and 2018 we did not find any significant percent changes in the land use classes for any of the river basins fig 7 table 5 all of the river basins show that agricultural land is the major land cover type except for brahmaputra and sabarmati mahi river basin these river basins with the major land cover type corresponding to agriculture belong to northern central and southern india which comprises of the major crop production regions for the brahmaputra river basin the majority land cover type is vegetated land whereas for the sabarmati river basin it is forest covered land since all the river basins have differences in size we compared the percentage land cover instead of absolute area to make observations across each of them we detect that agricultural land has decreased by approximately 1 for all the river basins on the contrary forest and urban land have increased in the range of 0 5 1 for all the river basins it is also interesting to note the increase in water land cover type for all the basins which corresponds to surface water stored in reservoirs we further analysed the relation between p et r and twsa for each land cover type for entire country fig 8 we observe that agricultural land and water pixels show low correlation between p et r and twsa r 0 3 whereas snow pixels show the highest amount of correlation r 0 7 we also observe that urban land shows high standard deviation 40 mm whereas agricultural and barren land show the lowest standard deviation amongst all the land cover types 20 mm for the difference between p et r and twsa 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we analyzed nine major river basins in india utilizing publicly available satellite and modelled dataset information for the time period from 2002 to 2019 water balance components p r et and twsa were examined for each of these river basins time series of the water balance components demonstrated that all the river basins exhibit strong seasonality with peaks during the monsoon season june september the seasonal analysis demonstrated that southern and north eastern parts of india experience water deficit due to decreasing monsoonal precipitation combined with increasing et and decrease in twsa for example brahmaputra river basin shows a decline of 0 56 mm yr in precipitation along with a decline of 18 mm yr in twsa whereas an increase of 0 01 mm yr in et and 0 36 mm yr in r was observed most of the farmland in india follow cropping patterns that maximize the use of rainwater from the monsoons but any changes in this seasonal cycle represent a serious threat to food production with changes in monsoon precipitation as seen in this study as seen in brahmaputra mahanadi krishna cauvery and narmada tapi river basin we believe that there is a need for capacity building and effective engagement at the level of local water agencies as well as farmers about these changing seasonal patterns while the farmers have started adapting to drip and sprinkler based irrigation under pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy scheme but as of february 2020 only 4 300 000 ha of land out of 68 300 000 ha of net irrigated land has been covered under the drip and sprinkler based irrigation schemes ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2020 this only accounts for 10 of the net irrigated area remaining agricultural land still uses groundwater wells for irrigating their lands the net cultivated area in india is 140 000 000 ha which implies that 71 700 000 ha of agricultural land still depends on monsoonal rainwater this makes the agricultural lands in the major river basins of india vulnerable to climatic changes further observations from the grace sensor are very helpful in understanding the water status of a river basin however it is important to note that while grace twsa is helpful to observe changes at the global scale the spatial resolution is coarse when applied to smaller river basins further we found linkage between the land cover type of agricultural and urban with the monotonic trends in water balance components 74 of the monotonic trends were associated with agricultural land whereas 19 were associated with urban land finally from the svd analysis for p et r and twsa we observed that north western india consistently shows high negative loadings of the first principal component explaining the most significant variability for these datasets and there does not exist synchronous co variability between p et r and twsa in a study which involves the use of satellite datasets it is important to be aware of the uncertainties associated with these datasets the conclusions made from the analysis using satellite data should consider these limitations of the uncertainty aside from the errors in the datasets in the water balance components we assumed that twsa is a proxy variable for changes in water storage this assumption may not hold true as the water balance is disturbed by anthropogenic interactions in spite of these restrictions our outcomes are consistent with past investigations for example in our study we find that average monthly et for the ganga river basin is generally 66 of the average monthly p et 60 mm and p 90 mm which agrees with the report distributed by the ganga river basin management plan http cganga org wp content transfers destinations 3 2018 11 057 wrm 23 09 2015 pdf there are numerous studies that have indicated decreasing twsa in north western india in parts of the indus and the ganga river basins asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009b yet in our investigation we discovered that during 2019 the brahmaputra river basin experiences a decrease in total water this was seen as 18 mm yr which is comparable to the magnitudes of decreasing twsa in north western india the changes in the water balance may have been influenced by land use changes in this region overall our investigation shows that it is essential to continually monitor the water balance of these major river basin for effective management as these river basins serve as major sources of freshwater for the population in these river basins and are drivers of the economy it becomes fundamental to examine the seasonal and annual variability of the water budget for these river basins transboundary river basins such as the ganga brahmaputra and indus need data and analyses to settle water disputes as the streamflow observations for these river basins are not publicly available decision making has to rely on methods and data models and satellite sensors such as those presented in this

4071,the indian subcontinent suffers from a decline in the per capita of water resources in the course of recent decades due to exponential population growth in india the majority of the population is reliant on agribusiness which is in turn primarily dependent on water from monsoons regions that get lower precipitation than needed experience water deficits which impact agriculture however investigation of linkages between the trends in water balance components and land cover distribution has not been performed in our work we focus on the water balance for the major river basins in india utilizing the following satellite and model based datasets terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace precipitation p from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm evapotranspiration et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and total runoff surface overflow and baseflow r from the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas we assessed the seasonal spatio temporal changes in the water balance from 2002 to 2019 and observed that agriculture and urban are the two most disrupted land cover types displaying a monotonic increasing decreasing trend in the components of water balance we also observed from the svd singular value decomposition analysis that the inherent spatial variability between p et r and twsa do not correlate well we also found that north eastern india and regions in southern india along the west coast show large negative trends of p 15 to 20 mm and r 10 to 15 mm in the monsoon season indicating that these regions suffer from drier monsoon seasons over the study period 2002 2019 from the land cover linkages it was found that 74 of monotonic trends observed in several of river basins were linked to agricultural land cover type and 19 were linked to urban land cover type these linkages suggest that agricultural lands are more vulnerable to changes in the components of the water balance 1 introduction india has a strong monsoonal influence which implies that most of india receives over half of the annual precipitation during the four monsoon months between june and september this likewise suggests that roughly 80 of the streamflow occurs between june and september kripalani et al 2003 krishnamurthy and kirtman 2009 after all the surface water has been spent individual farmers resort to harvesting rainwater storages and pumping groundwater to meet their water demands there is a need for management and planning of how the water will be utilized after the rainfall season specifically with a focus on the river basins that receive low precipitation to carry out such planning it is necessary to monitor the changes in the seasonal patterns of the components of water balance precipitation p runoff r evapotranspiration et and water storage the indian population of roughly 1 3 billion individuals relies upon agriculture for food and livelihood as cultivable land is the principal source of financial security https www indiawaterportal org topics agriculture the per capita water accessibility has fallen by 400 in the past 60 years the world bank 2019 world bank 2010 owing to these issues it is critical to consider the changes in accessible water i e surface water and groundwater for all the major river basins in india which are lifelines of india s economy asoka et al 2018 2017 misra 2014 wada et al 2010 agribusiness a fundamental segment of the economy represents 14 of india s gross domestic product gdp a study by bhanja and mukherjee 2019 shows that despite the increasing precipitation some regions display high rates of groundwater losses attributed due to excessive pumping the anthropogenic impact on water utilization has triggered the impractical utilization of accessible water resources ashraf et al 2017 taylor et al 2013b vörösmarty et al 2000 additionally there have been studies that show the various sectors of the water usage aerts et al 2006 asoka et al 2018 macdonald et al 2015 shah et al 2016 this has further influenced the harvest designs in various river basins macdonald et al 2016 taylor et al 2013a yield patterns of crops primarily correspond to the seasonal precipitation cycle and sudden changes to this seasonal cycle particularly the monsoon season represent a threat especially to the rural communities of the country in the context of indian river basins there are very limited studies that analyse the hydrologic fluxes and storages chen et al 2014 rodell et al 2009a soni and syed 2015 one such study by soni and syed 2015 characterizes the role of hydrologic fluxes using the total water storage tws anomaly the study concludes that groundwater storage is depleting in the ganga whereas it is increasing in the godavari and krishna basins a limitation to this study is that it only considers four of the major river basins of india ganga godavari krishna and mahanadi additionally the study does not examine the relationship between the trends of water balance components and land cover type other studies chen et al 2014 rodell et al 2009 mainly focus on the north western india where highly negative tws anomalies have been observed thereby lacking the analysis of other parts of india in order to examine the impact of different water balance components influencing water resources numerous studies have been carried out in india and across the globe these include research that have detailed the impacts of environmental change and population rise that have made water security an important issue in the river basins of india china greece and united states barnett et al 2004 christensen et al 2004 fishman et al 2011 gemitzi and lakshmi 2018 piao et al 2010 shah 2009 a worldwide investigation of accessible water by lakshmi et al 2018 presents an extensive spatial and temporal examination of the hydrological factors related to water budget for significant river basins across various continents with different climate and ecological conditions a study by rodell et al 2018 attributes the drivers of changes in total water into interannual variability groundwater utilization and environmental change because of climate change there are more frequent extreme precipitation events and land surface and sea surface temperatures are exhibiting positive anomalies kingston et al 2011 kite 2001 mishra and lilhare 2016 ragab and prudhomme 2002 around 5 6 million people in india will be inhabiting exceptionally water scarce regions by 2055 arnell 2004 this issue has initiated discussions around the world that are not simply restricted to india on issues related to water security babovic et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2007 nazemi and madani 2018 a few research studies have also called attention to the excessive usage of groundwater on a global scale alcamo et al 2007 oki and kanae 2006 wada et al 2012 several satellite datasets from different sources have been used to carry out this study table 1 satellite datasets indirectly measure the actual physical quantities from space and they do not matchup perfectly to in situ observations these hydrological variables have been validated at global scale with in situ observations but sufficient validation at watershed scales especially in india are lacking in the literature for instance precipitation is sufficiently validated for the indian subcontinent mondal et al 2018b mondal et al 2018 found that trmm tmpa tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis estimated precipitation shows good agreement with indian meteorological department imd in situ observations in addition precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann also shows good agreement in terms of annual and monsoonal trends with imd in situ observations tmpa product showed the lowest mean root mean squared error rmse of 25 to 50 mm for majority of central southern and north western india mondal et al 2018 they reported correlation coefficients between 0 8 and 1 for all regions in india except the northern himalayas the study concluded that tmpa and persiann can be reliably used in hydrological and climate studies in the river basins of india for runoff there are no validation studies performed that are specific to the indian subcontinent there are two reasons for the lack of such studies 1 validation of gldas runoff requires building a land surface water routing model and 2 there is a lack of publicly available in situ streamflow observations in the northern north western and north eastern parts of india these regions contain transboundary river basins which includes the ganga the brahmaputra and the indus river and hence the central water commission cwc of india does not publicly share streamflow observations for these river basins the fundamental objective of the current research is to address the following question are the trends in hydrological variables linked to land cover distribution 2 data and study area 2 1 indian major river basins in our study we analyse nine major river basins brahmaputra cauvery pennar ganga godavari indus krishna mahanadi narmada tapti and sabarmati mahi fig 1 we selected the river basins with an area 50 000 km2 to avoid the complexities from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace estimates due to its coarse resolution these nine river basins represent diverse topography land cover distributions size of the watershed climate and weather patterns across india for the trans boundary river basins we only consider the areal extent inside india to observe the changes occurring in these watershed systems there have been very few previous studies bhuvaneswari et al 2013 van beek et al 2011a on each of the individual basins table 2 and a comprehensive study of all major river basins in india has not been conducted in the last decade 2 2 grace and grace fo in our study we use grace rl06 product and grace fo rl06 product from nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl geoforschungszentrum gfz and center for space research at university of texas austin csr for terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa syed et al 2008 ensemble mean of products from all three organizations was used to reduce the uncertainty in the processing algorithms but this does not improve the resolution of the data the data is available at a spatial grid of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of one month https grace jpl nasa gov data grace months for the terrestrial water anomalies these anomalies depict the changes in the total water column of earth which includes surface sub surface and groundwater components syed et al 2008 grace has been used in numerous regional swenson et al 2003 swenson and wahr 2009 voss et al 2013 and continental scale schmidt et al 2006 tapley et al 2004a van beek et al 2011 water budget studies 2 3 trmm the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite was launched in 1997 to study tropical and subtropical rainfall kummerow et al 2000 simpson et al 1996 we used the version 7 tmpa trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis product for our study this product is the most widely used trmm product and is available at 0 25 spatial resolution covering the region between 50 n 50 s latitudes at a daily temporal repeat from 1998 to the present several studies have evaluated trmm tmpa accuracy using gauge precipitation data over different parts across the world including south america rozante et al 2010 kyrgyzstan karaseva et al 2012 tibetan plateau xu 2016 indonesia prasetia et al 2013 china li et al 2013 and india kirtsaeng et al 2011 mondal et al 2018 prakash and gairola 2014 shah et al 2016 2 4 gldas global land data assimilation system gldas is an assimilation model which combines satellite and ground based observational data products through different land surface models to generate land surface states and fluxes at the global scale rodell et al 2004 five different land surface models noah variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic common land model clm and catchment are used for assimilation we decided to use noah derived runoff as it has better performance compared to the other model outputs bai et al 2016 lohmann et al 2004 zaitchik et al 2010 apart from the comparison between different gldas model outputs these studies also validate it at several regional scales in different parts of the world since a study does not exist which validates gldas output for indian watersheds we performed validation with observed data in order to assess its performance gldas noah model outputs are simulated by nasa goddard space flight center gsfc in this study we only use the model outputs generated at nasa gsfc further information on forcing inputs to gldas models can be found on https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas forcing data in this study we use total runoff surface runoff baseflow output from the gldas v2 1 assimilated data simulated from noah lsm model l4 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 at a monthly time step this dataset has been validated at different locations with in situ observation data bai et al 2016 kim et al 2018 li et al 2015 for runoff soil moisture et and several other hydrological variables since this dataset provides modelled outputs for 36 different hydrological variables at a global scale it is frequently used in the studies of the data sparse region and continental scale studies lorenz et al 2014 zawadzki and kȩdzior 2014 2 5 modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is the main sensor on the terra and aqua satellites launched by nasa in 1999 and 2002 respectively the modis sensor observes surface brightness temperature in 36 spectral bands which is used in imaging the atmosphere land and ocean we used the mod16a2 product which provides et estimates based on the penman monteith method mu et al 2011 mod16a2 is available at 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution validation has been performed for different parts of asia and australia for the et estimates based on modis cleugh et al 2007 kim et al 2012 2 6 climate change initiative cci land cover european space agency esa started the cci program which provides land cover maps from 1998 to 2018 at a native spatial resolution of 300 m european space agency these spatial maps are produced globally 2 7 uncertainties associated with satellite observations and model outputs satellite data uncertainties are dependent on the retrieval algorithm as well as the spatio temporal scale affected by the cloud cover reflectance thermal radiance and infrequent satellite overpasses aghakouchak et al 2009 chang and chiu 1997 hossain et al 2006 morrissey and greene 1998 precipitation data from trmm has seasonal as well as spatial bias when compared to the rain gauge station data obtained from the indian meteorological department le et al 2018 shukla et al 2019 topography and local climate conditions predominantly affect the uncertainties in the trmm estimates bharti and singh 2015 further modelled data provides runoff which has been validated at global and continental scales but these datasets underperform at the regional scale there are issues with modis evapotranspiration as it underestimates the et as found in several studies conducted across the globe aguilar et al 2018 du and song 2018 tang et al 2015 in addition to the uncertainty in precipitation et and modelled runoff grace derived total water storage anomalies has errors in estimation errors these errors are in the form of monthly gravity field solutions and the error caused by detecting mass changes other than the mass water storage changes swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 2006 these satellite datasets with coarse resolutions of the order of tens of kilometres can lead to unsatisfactory consistency issues while precipitation and runoff data are available at 0 25 evapotranspiration data is available at a spatial resolution of 500 m and the best available resolution for grace twsa is 0 5 to reduce the uncertainty from using a single grace product we have used an ensemble of all three grace products gfz csr and jpl seo et al 2009 concluded that the coarse resolution of grace can provide inaccurate results especially for basins smaller than 90 000 km2 in reference to our study only the sabarmati mahi river basin the smallest river basin in our study has an area of 72 170 km2 for the sabarmati mahi sixteen pixels cover the river basin we found that the grace twsa has a fairly good correlation with p et r and the peaks and lows of the time series correlate well for the sabarmati mahi river basin finally we wanted to make our study consistent by including all the major river basins of india hence we have not excluded them from our analysis owing to issuing arising from the grace spatial resolution 3 methodology our analysis is divided into four parts validation of the data sets seasonal analysis of the water budgets seasonal singular value decomposition and trend analysis and linkage between water balance components and land cover 3 1 validation of datasets for the analysis in this study satellite datasets for precipitation were used in addition to modelled outputs for evapotranspiration and runoff in this study we performed validation of gldas based runoff with streamflow data obtained from global runoff data do et al 2017 fig 3 the observed in situ data was compared with gldas modelled runoff output using correlation coefficients and paired significance t test as building a runoff routing model was beyond the scope of this study a total of 310 stations were used for the validation process which were located in central western and southern india 3 2 seasonal analysis and water budget using p et r and δs to observe the seasonality in water balance components we plotted the boxplots of each with their monthly distribution during a year these boxplots represent the median variation of the corresponding monthly values along with its 25 and 75 distribution and minimum and maximum values for a corresponding month the following equation gives the water balance of a river basin 2 p et r δ s where p et r and δ s are monthly averaged values for p precipitation et evapotranspiration r runoff and changes in water surface and sub surface storage separately for each river basin if there exists a significant anthropogenic influence in a river basin we must incorporate this influence in equation 2 to consider the water withdrawal for irrigation and household use haddeland et al 2014 querner 2000 veldkamp et al 2017 since the withdrawal term is small in comparison with δs we have disregarded it in the water balance computation similar to lakshmi et al 2018 in many cases there would be a lag between precipitation and runoff or changes in sub surface hence we perform a lagged analysis to determine the most suitable relationship between the p et r and twsa time series to calculate the r squared values we assigned lag between 0 and 6 months to the grace twsa and calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between p et r and lag assigned twsa 3 3 seasonal singular value decomposition and trend analysis to understand any inherent co variability and patterns in the water balance we performed singular value decomposition svd on two individual datasets p et r and twsa for every season svd is used to analyze the coupled variability in these two datasets bretherton et al 1992 wallace et al 1992 in order to perform svd analysis we calculate the spatial cross covariance matrix of the whole grid if we consider a data field a with m spatial grid points and n temporal observations seasonal summation for each year we can write the svd data matrix as svd a w where a is an n m matrix n observations with m grid points svd is an orthogonal projections matrix with the shape of n n matrix n svd components with n observations and w is a weight matrix with the shape of m n n singular values with m variable weights the components of svd matrix are orthogonal linear projections that represent the directions of greatest variability the singular vectors corresponding to w matrix are the loadings corresponding to each svd component the magnitude of these singular vectors represents the variance explained by the corresponding component as indicated by the indian meteorological department imd there are four seasons in india pre monsoon southwest monsoon post monsoon and winter the pre monsoon season includes the months from march to may the southwest monsoon season is from june to september the post monsoon season is from october to december and the winter season includes the months of january and february in addition to the spatial patterns we analysed the seasonal trends in each water balance components to examine the temporal variability since our datasets exhibit annual seasonality we chose to use the seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 to examine monotonic patterns the slope for the monotonic trends was determined utilizing sen s slope estimator the trend results are significant at p 0 05 spatial averaging was performed over the river basins for each season to conduct the test 3 4 analyze the linkage between water balance components and landcover we classified the landcover distribution for each river basin into major land cover types we used land cover maps from 2002 and 2018 to compare the differences in the percentage of each land cover type for the nine major river basins since the resolution of the land cover map is much finer 300 m we aggregate the land cover pixels at 300 m to the grace pixels at 0 5 the aggregation was done based on majority statistic for land cover types in that pixel we further use this information to link these land cover types with the increasing and decreasing patterns of twsa the satellite datasets we use in the study have different spatial resolutions while p and r information have the same spatial resolution of 0 25 modis et is at 500 m land cover at 300 m dem at 30 m and grace twsa are at a spatial resolution of 0 5 considering the low spatial resolution of the grace dataset we upscaled the p et r land cover and dem values to a spatial resolution of 0 5 we used averaging as the aggregation method for upscaling we used grace twsa at its native resolution of 0 5 4 results 4 1 seasonal cycle dominant seasonal variations are a significant characteristic of the hydrology of indian river basins to understand these seasonal variations we examined the mean monthly precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff for the study period at their native spatial resolution 2002 2019 fig 2 the boxplot shows the measure of five statistics minimum maximum upper 75 and lower 25 quartile and the median from the plots we observe that all river basins receive most of their precipitation during the months corresponding to the monsoon i e june to september the brahmaputra river basin receives a median precipitation of 400 mm in june 427 mm in july 366 mm in august and 296 mm in september of the annual total of 2130 mm and 1489 mm falls between june to september on the other hand for the indus river basin with the lowest annual precipitation of 525 mm it receives 51 mm in june 108 mm in july 103 mm in august and 69 mm in september which amounts to 330 mm between june to september further we observe that mahanadi river and sabarmati mahi river show high variability in precipitation 300 350 mm for july and august respectively corresponding to the monsoon season godavari and krishna river basins receive annual rainfall of 1121 mm and 977 mm respectively with much less precipitation 50 mm during non monsoon months the indus and ganga river basins receive snowfall at higher elevations during the winter months which can be seen from the precipitation in january and february similarly we observe that runoff for all the river basins follow the variability similar to precipitation implying higher runoff values corresponding to monsoon months and relatively lower runoff for the rest of the year boxplots of et do not follow any particular pattern although we observe relatively higher values during monsoon summer months 4 2 hydrological water balance firstly gldas generated runoff was validated with observed streamflow fig 3 we found that gldas generated runoff had mean correlation r2 of 0 53 across all the stations for et india does not have an established flux network hence we did not perform a validation for modis et products we examined the twsa derived from grace and p et r from individual satellite observations and model output to consider the annual cycle of the water balance components for every river basin from 2002 to 2019 fig 4 the time series in most of the river basins exhibit seasonality with the p et r and twsa having maximum values during the monsoon season with the exception of the indus and cauvery river basin where we do not observe strong seasonality twsa lags p et r in a several of the river basins with all river basins indicating a one month lag except the indus river basin which does not show any lag table 3 to evaluate the direct relationship between p et r and twsa we calculated the pearson relationship coefficients at a 5 significant level for each river basin the ganga river basin alongside the southern and western india river basins show a higher relationship r2 0 5 while indus shows a lower value r2 0 3 significance at a p value of 0 05 table 3 two potential reasons that these river basins show higher correlation could be due to either low human intervention in the river basin or due to high recharge rate for the watershed which can be caused by higher precipitation in the case of a developing country such as india with a high population density it is unlikely for the former to be the explanation for the higher correlation i e human intervention will exist normally river basins with tropical and subtropical climatic conditions show high relationship similar to the case in our examination godavari r2 0 60 and ganga r2 0 54 while the indus river basin shows a lower r2 of 0 25 the two semi arid river basins in western india narmada tapti r2 0 59 and sabarmati mahi r2 0 57 display correlation coefficients similar to the tropical river basin like ganga r2 0 54 which can be ascribed to increased precipitation in western india over the previous decade asoka et al 2017 4 3 seasonal svd analysis we plotted the first orthogonal components obtained using singular value decomposition for determining spatial patterns in p et r and twsa fig 5 the dark red and dark green coloured regions in the map depict regions which explain the most variability in the corresponding seasons over entire india for the winter season variability in northern india is strongly coupled with southern india since these two regions have opposite signs for their corresponding eigenvector components increase or decrease in one region implies a corresponding decrease or increase of p et r in the other region similarly the pre monsoon season depicts weak coupling of north eastern india with central and north western india for the monsoon season we found that the western coast of india and southern part of the brahmaputra river basin have strong co variability whereas there is weak co variability associated with the other parts of india it is important to note that there is strong variability in the brahmaputra river basin during pre monsoon season which dominates the water storage changes led by significant changes in precipitation lastly for the post monsoon season we observe that the variability can be attributed majorly to central india in addition it is interesting to note that the inherent spatial patterns in twsa are inconsistent with the inherent spatial patterns in p et r this difference in spatial pattern is attributed to the anthropogenic interactions causing disruptions in the total water storage for the principal components in twsa we observed highly negative dominant loadings for winter pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in north western india these inherent patterns again suggest that north western india faces an acute problem of decreasing twsa over the past two decades similar negative loadings are observed for eastern india states of bihar and west bengal but high positive loadings in the pre monsoon season for this region offsets the negative impacts of decreasing twsa 4 4 seasonal mann kendall trend analysis to understand the trends in river basins across different seasons we used de seasonalized data to perform mann kendall mk test hirsch et al 1982 and assessed the monotonic patterns utilizing sen s slope estimator fig 6 table 4 all the patterns estimated are significant at p 0 05 the spatial patterns show monotonic decrease in monsoonal p and r whereas there is an increase in the et we observe that south western india central india and eastern india show high decreasing trends 15 mm for the monsoon season corresponding to p and r whereas et shows increasing trends 10 15 mm mostly in central and eastern india for other seasons there are relatively lower rates of increasing decreasing trends it can be further observed that southern india shows high decreasing trends in p and r for the post monsoon season 10 15 mm whereas the rest of india shows very little variation lastly as expected the trends in r to have very high spatial correlation with the trends in p from the temporal analysis table 4 fig s1 we observe that for the brahmaputra river basin p shows a decrease of 0 56 mm yr an increase in et and r by 0 01 mm yr and 0 36 mm yr respectively and a large decline in twsa of 18 mm yr further the ganga river basin shows a decrease in twsa with a rate of 18 mm yr and no patterns in other components of the water balance the indus river basin shows a decline of 11 mm yr in twsa and an increase of runoff by 0 25 mm yr the mahanadi river basin indicated a decreasing trend in twsa at a rate of 9 mm yr however the krishna river basin shows an increase in runoff at 0 03 mm yr 4 5 land cover linkage from the comparison of the 300 m land cover map with the 50 km land cover map we found that the majority statistic realistically represents the landcover distribution inside large as well as smaller river basins fig s2 and figure table s1 for instance for ganga river basin agricultural land is the major land cover type with 83 75 coverage in the 50 km resampled map whereas it is 78 5 in the original land cover map from the land cover comparison of 2002 and 2018 we did not find any significant percent changes in the land use classes for any of the river basins fig 7 table 5 all of the river basins show that agricultural land is the major land cover type except for brahmaputra and sabarmati mahi river basin these river basins with the major land cover type corresponding to agriculture belong to northern central and southern india which comprises of the major crop production regions for the brahmaputra river basin the majority land cover type is vegetated land whereas for the sabarmati river basin it is forest covered land since all the river basins have differences in size we compared the percentage land cover instead of absolute area to make observations across each of them we detect that agricultural land has decreased by approximately 1 for all the river basins on the contrary forest and urban land have increased in the range of 0 5 1 for all the river basins it is also interesting to note the increase in water land cover type for all the basins which corresponds to surface water stored in reservoirs we further analysed the relation between p et r and twsa for each land cover type for entire country fig 8 we observe that agricultural land and water pixels show low correlation between p et r and twsa r 0 3 whereas snow pixels show the highest amount of correlation r 0 7 we also observe that urban land shows high standard deviation 40 mm whereas agricultural and barren land show the lowest standard deviation amongst all the land cover types 20 mm for the difference between p et r and twsa 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we analyzed nine major river basins in india utilizing publicly available satellite and modelled dataset information for the time period from 2002 to 2019 water balance components p r et and twsa were examined for each of these river basins time series of the water balance components demonstrated that all the river basins exhibit strong seasonality with peaks during the monsoon season june september the seasonal analysis demonstrated that southern and north eastern parts of india experience water deficit due to decreasing monsoonal precipitation combined with increasing et and decrease in twsa for example brahmaputra river basin shows a decline of 0 56 mm yr in precipitation along with a decline of 18 mm yr in twsa whereas an increase of 0 01 mm yr in et and 0 36 mm yr in r was observed most of the farmland in india follow cropping patterns that maximize the use of rainwater from the monsoons but any changes in this seasonal cycle represent a serious threat to food production with changes in monsoon precipitation as seen in this study as seen in brahmaputra mahanadi krishna cauvery and narmada tapi river basin we believe that there is a need for capacity building and effective engagement at the level of local water agencies as well as farmers about these changing seasonal patterns while the farmers have started adapting to drip and sprinkler based irrigation under pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy scheme but as of february 2020 only 4 300 000 ha of land out of 68 300 000 ha of net irrigated land has been covered under the drip and sprinkler based irrigation schemes ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2020 this only accounts for 10 of the net irrigated area remaining agricultural land still uses groundwater wells for irrigating their lands the net cultivated area in india is 140 000 000 ha which implies that 71 700 000 ha of agricultural land still depends on monsoonal rainwater this makes the agricultural lands in the major river basins of india vulnerable to climatic changes further observations from the grace sensor are very helpful in understanding the water status of a river basin however it is important to note that while grace twsa is helpful to observe changes at the global scale the spatial resolution is coarse when applied to smaller river basins further we found linkage between the land cover type of agricultural and urban with the monotonic trends in water balance components 74 of the monotonic trends were associated with agricultural land whereas 19 were associated with urban land finally from the svd analysis for p et r and twsa we observed that north western india consistently shows high negative loadings of the first principal component explaining the most significant variability for these datasets and there does not exist synchronous co variability between p et r and twsa in a study which involves the use of satellite datasets it is important to be aware of the uncertainties associated with these datasets the conclusions made from the analysis using satellite data should consider these limitations of the uncertainty aside from the errors in the datasets in the water balance components we assumed that twsa is a proxy variable for changes in water storage this assumption may not hold true as the water balance is disturbed by anthropogenic interactions in spite of these restrictions our outcomes are consistent with past investigations for example in our study we find that average monthly et for the ganga river basin is generally 66 of the average monthly p et 60 mm and p 90 mm which agrees with the report distributed by the ganga river basin management plan http cganga org wp content transfers destinations 3 2018 11 057 wrm 23 09 2015 pdf there are numerous studies that have indicated decreasing twsa in north western india in parts of the indus and the ganga river basins asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009b yet in our investigation we discovered that during 2019 the brahmaputra river basin experiences a decrease in total water this was seen as 18 mm yr which is comparable to the magnitudes of decreasing twsa in north western india the changes in the water balance may have been influenced by land use changes in this region overall our investigation shows that it is essential to continually monitor the water balance of these major river basin for effective management as these river basins serve as major sources of freshwater for the population in these river basins and are drivers of the economy it becomes fundamental to examine the seasonal and annual variability of the water budget for these river basins transboundary river basins such as the ganga brahmaputra and indus need data and analyses to settle water disputes as the streamflow observations for these river basins are not publicly available decision making has to rely on methods and data models and satellite sensors such as those presented in this

4072,measuring surface water temperature spatial variability is needed to estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater evaluate fish habitat and thermal inertia and to estimate streamflow frequency and duration fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts has been used in rivers and lakes providing high resolution and sensitive temperature monitoring over large temporal and spatial scales however in streams with cobbly or bedrock lined streambeds and variable bathymetry use of fo dts to measure temperature close to the surface water and groundwater interface can be challenging if even feasible fo dts can also be costly involve difficult installations and require an advanced understanding of the technology calibration and data processing in this study we compared fo dts stream temperature survey results to an alternative temperature survey method employing a towed transect of high resolution temperature loggers spaced at 1 m and transported in the stream along the study reach to measure the spatial distribution of stream water temperature in east fork poplar creek near oak ridge tennessee usa we assessed the applicability and limitations of the two methods and quantitatively compared in situ temperature survey results measured simultaneously with each method regression results showed strong temporal and spatial correlation between the two methods differences were only elevated near the stream banks in areas that were coincident with correlation slope deviations from unity which was attributed to shallower water and lower data density kriging standard errors were also low at channel center with minor increases near the stream banks the results suggested that the array of the individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to fo dts for thermal characterization of surface water providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement with greater simplicity

conant et al 2019 the bidirectional interaction is important in controlling the transport and fate of contaminants and nutrients evaluating ecosystem habitat enhancing thermal refugia and metabolism of benthic community and controlling the discharge and water level fluctuations thermal buffering and biogeochemical reactions in water bodies temperature differential measurement was introduced as a method to estimate groundwater surface water interaction in the early 1960s sorey 1971 stallman 1965 it has also been used in streams and lakes to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone to estimate depth to salt water interface and to estimate parameters for heat flow models temperature is considered a relatively robust and inexpensive parameter to measure in surface water systems and the distinctive difference between surface water and groundwater temperatures have allowed for the identification of locations with colder or warmer seeps that may be attributed to groundwater influx stoneman and constantz 2003 winter et al 1988 measurement of temperature gradients and hydraulic gradients in at least two depths in the sediments are required to estimate the rate of heat transfer through the streambed and methods to measure temperature at a fine spatial resolution are often needed lateral spatial temperature distributions measured at one depth of the stream or streambed sediment may also be used as a boundary condition in analytical solutions to the one dimensional heat transport equation keery et al 2007 kurylyk et al 2019 schornberg et al 2010 scotch et al 2021

enertia and to study the connection between the spatial distribution of fish and locations of seeps in rivers and lakes collier 2008 fullerton et al 2018 huff 2009 the distribution of fish and their spawning and metabolism and overall growth rates are directly affected by the temperature that surrounds them bond et al 2015 thermal refugia are critical to the survival of fish during summer months during extreme warming events especially in arid and semi arid regions caldwell et al 2020 three main methods have been used to map spatial stream temperature distributions including direct measurment

2020 marruedo arricibita 2018 selker et al 2006a temperature mapping using temperature sensors is an older method that has been known to be simple and inexpensive however can be limited spatially and temporally compared to fo dts and tir and it can be challenging depending on reach size and flow conditions conant 2004 gendaszek 2011 lautz et al 2010 lee 1985 vaccaro and maloy 2006 white et al 1987 initiation and use of fo dts for more than a decade to map the horizontal temperature distribution in surface water systems has reduced the need for point measurments to map temperatures selker et al 2006a selker et al 2006c fo dts has been used to quantify contaminant and nutrient exchange and transport in the hyporheic zone as well as to estimate vertical fluid velocities and to monitor temporal changes in fluid flow using heated and non heated fiber optic reference cables kurth et al 2013 read et al 2014 selker et al 2006b tyler et al 2009 fo dts can generally provide high spatial and temporal resolution sensitive temperature monitoring fast thermal response and consistent accuracy along the cable due to its integration as a single unified system that obviates separate calibration of multiple temperature sensors selker et al 2006a selker et al 2006c suárez et al 2011 fo dts has been found to have some limitations in measuring the temperature in surface water systems roshan et al 2014 solar energy penetrating through the water column can thermally affect fo dts measurements neilson et al 2010 mobile bed material can either bury the cable or separate it from the bed complicating data interpretation sebok et al 2015 implementing fo dts can also be expensive time consuming and logistically challenging with increased technical complexity both in installation and in post processing compared to most temperature logging sensors folegot 2018 fo dts temperature calibration is based on upstream and downstream temperature reference coils i e hot bath and cold bath therefore fluctuations in the temperature of the reference baths can result in calibration complications and may alter the precision of the cable tyler et al 2013 remote sensing tir has been used to map surface water temperature and to identify hyporheic zone interactions culbertson et al 2013 hare et al 2015 liu et al 2016 success with tir methods to measure temperature anomalies in the surface water bed is largely affected by the depth of water and the discharge dugdale 2016 hare et al 2015 torgersen et al 2001 hare et al 2015 found that a depth of less than 0 05 m and stream discharge range 0 002 0 2 m3 s were suitable to detect seepage thermal signature due to reduced thermal stratification in the water column tir provides a large spatial coverage of stream and streambed temperature but generally in a snapshot of time which limits the understanding of the diurnal effect on stream or streambed temperature marcus 2012 markus and helena 2002 torgersen et al 2001 it is also difficult to ascertain if seepage flux occurs along the entire reach length or whether downstream temperatures are influenced by the upstreamseepage source additionally tir imagery can introduce an error in estimating stream or streambed temperature due to the effect of camera distortion and the surrounding environmental conditions at the time of acquisition dugdale et al 2019 pai et al 2017 the tir method may underestimate or fail to detect downwelling flux of surface water to groundwater which suggests the need for a direct temperature measurement especially in streams where downwelling loss is dominant or the upwelling flux is weak dole olivier et al 2019 several studies have compared tir to fo dts to evaluate the horizontal spatial distribution of the temperature measurments dzara et al 2019 hare et al 2015 however to our knowledge this is the first study that has compared the horizontal spatial stream temperature surveys using fo dts method and highly sensitive individual temperature sensors within similar spatial and temporal setting some studies deployed fo dts cables with temperature loggers that had much lower accuracy compared to those used herein and a lower spatial coverage compared to the fiber optic cable briggs et al 2016 lowry et al 2007 mamer and lowry 2013 although fo dts has been utilized successfully to evaluate the horizontal temperature distribution along streams and lakes selker et al 2014 the fo dts method can be challenging at best to implement in streams with bedrock lined streambed channels and variable streambed bathymetry which emphasizes the need for a point measurement method as a complementary or a substitute for the fo dts method the purpose of this investigation was to develop and evaluate a simple array of highly sensitive temperature sensors to measure the spatial temperature distribution within a natural stream reach evaluation of the thermal sensors spatial survey was through direct comparison to a survey method using fo dts within the identical study reach area by identifying co located measurement locations within the data sets of each method which was implemented near station 5 4 k in east fork poplar creek efpc tennessee usa the methods were compared to evaluate their capabilities limitations strengths and weaknesses of these methods and to highlight situations in which one or the other might be a better instrument choice for monitoring or surveying stream temperatures 2 methods 2 1 study site the temperature surveys were both conducted and compared along a 250 m long reach with an average 13 m width of efpc near oak ridge tennessee usa fig 1 efpc is a third order stream characterized with partially exposed limestone bedrock variable stream bathymetry and a thin veneer of sediment about 20 60 cm deep overlying the bedrock in most but not all locations of the study reach rucker et al 2021 mohamed et al 2021 the study reach is located in a densely forested freshwater emergent wetland with native sycamore boxelder and green ash trees providing heavy canopy cover during summer months cunningham and pounds 1991 starting in the early 1950s efpc received contaminated flows with mercury and other hazardous metals affecting the creek water sediments and the floodplain along the creek brooks and southworth 2011 water quality in efpc has improved substantially over the past decades but mercury contamination in the creek remains a persistent problem research over the past several years demonstrates that diffuse legacy sources of mercury contribute to the contaminant load in the creek and that hyporheic water discharging to the surface may be an important source of that increased mercury loading brooks et al 2018 demers et al 2018 2 2 surveying of measurement locations the temperature study was conducted during august 2019 prior to the temperature measurement the creek banks were surveyed and georeferenced to allow for spatial referencing of the temperature measurements the banks were marked with landscape stakes at 1 m intervals along the banks the distance across the stream between the opposite stakes was roughly the shortest distance between the two banks i e perpendicular to the stream thalweg the location of the stakes were surveyed with a leica total station ts02 distance measurement with reflector 1 5 mm 2 0 ppm and distance measurement without reflector 2 mm 2 ppm with lowest accuracy in the measurement direction as 2 5 mm 2 3 discrete upstream and downstream temperatures in the morning of august 6 2019 prior to the stream temperature survey a set of two temperature sensors were placed at fixed locations near the upstream reach boundary another set of two sensors were placed near the downstream reach boundary and within each set included one sensor fixed in the stream water column and another sensor buried in the sediment at about 0 3 m below the top of the streambed the purpose of these sensors was to provide temporal monitoring control measurements of the temperature at those locations before and throughout the spatial temperature survey from 16 00 to 18 50 in the same day weather data was obtained from a u s department of energy doe operated meteorological tower tower l located about 5 75 km southwest of the study site 2 4 temperature sensor setup six high sensitivity temperature sensors model rbr solos3 t were used to survey the spatial temperature variability along the efpc study reach fig 2 the reported accuracy of the sensors was 0 002 c with a stability of 0 002 c year its 90 and nist traceable standards with response time of 0 1 s the absolute accuracy of the sensors used in this study ranged between 0 004 c and 0 012 c based on the calibration year each temperature sensor was attached to a support box at the bottom of a 2 54 cm diameter pvc pipe hereafter termed poles fig 2a the six poles were oriented vertically to position the sensor within the stream at 0 05 m above the top of the streambed to allow for measurement of the stream temperature the sensors were then spaced in a straight line or transect at 1 m apart from each other using equal lengths of string the transect of temperature sensors poles was oriented perpendicular to the channel and stream flow and was moved during the sensor array survey along the direction of the channel to measure the temperature distribution along both the lateral and longitudinal directions of the stream channel each of the six equidistant poles measured along a line as they were used to move the sensors in the stream channel along the upstream flow direction with pole 1 as closest to the north bank and pole 6 closest to south bank fig 2b the number of the dataset collected with the six sensors in the array at 1 second resolution along the entire reach was 61 296 transect measurements of temperature were collected and recorded every 1 m along the length of the stream reach at the locations of the survey stakes resulting in a 1 m by 1 m grid of streambed temperatures fig 3 a the total number of data points for the sensor array survey transects was 1554 the 222 223 227 and 228 m locations had trees logs along the bank obstructing measurement the distance between the stake marks and the edge of the sensor array survey transects was measured at each measurement location during the survey the reporting interval for the temperature sensors was 1 s and the sensors were allowed 6 7 s to equilibrate at each location before taking the measurement the temperature survey using the temperature sensors started at the downstream end of the reach on august 6 2019 at 16 00 eastern standard time zone gmt 5 the time with the highest temperature difference between groundwater and surface water and ended at the upstream location at about 18 50 2 5 fo dts setup the physics of the fo dts measurement is based on a temperature dependent backscatter light mechanism including brillouin or raman backscatter selker et al 2006c it is possible to achieve sub meter scale spatial and 0 01 c thermal precision for measurement cycle times on the order of minutes for cables extending several kilometers tyler et al 2009 the principle of the fo dts method is based on releasing a pulse of laser light into the fiber optic cable and monitoring the raman backscatter light to estimate the temperature selker et al 2006c the distance from where the light was reflected is calculated by timing the return time of the laser pulse raman backscatter reflects at a wavelength shorter or longer than the wavelength of the original pulse the reflection with the longer wavelength is referred to as stokes backscatter and has an amplitude that is not temperature dependent the reflection with the shorter wavelength is called anti stokes backscatter and has an amplitude that linearly depends on temperature by measuring the stokes anti stokes ratio at different return locations the temperature of the fiber can be measured everywhere along the cable length the fo dts cable was mounted on a raft and was installed in the stream on august 5th 2019 in six passes back and forth along the length parallel to the channel of the study reach in a zig zag pattern to approximately equally distribute the cable spatially along both the width 1 m apart and length of the study reach fig 3b an original goal of the study was to measure streambed temperature at a shallow depth within the streambed to locate temperature anomalies within the streambed that may indicate groundwater seeps however due to the heterogeneous bedrock geology and variable bed bathymetry of the study reach burring the fiber optic cable in the sediment was only possible for a short length of the entire 2 km cable 18 and the majority of the cable was installed at variable depths of the water column but as close as possible to the streambed sediment to a depth between 0 and 0 1 m thus minimal cable was buried due to large sections of streambed being composed of exposed bedrock or large cobbles and buried locations were recorded by gps topcon hyperlite and using the surveyed stakes at the end of each run along the length of the reach an anchor was placed to support the cable against streamflow and the anchor was used to support the turn in the cable for the return pass in the opposite direction the location of the cable along the stream channel was referenced relative to the surveyed stakes and with a gps and the cable turn locations at the anchors were also surveyed thus each temperature value was referenced horizontally in 2d the total number of the independent temperature measurement was 6257 locations along 1934 m of installed cable fig 3b the fo dts interrogator measured the fiber temperature from august 5th until the 14th 2019 the total number of data points during the time of the temperature survey with the temperature sensors from 4 00 pm to 6 50 pm on august 6 was 56 313 both ends of the fiber were connected to the fo dts interrogator allowing for double ended measurements each channel in each direction was averaged over 10 min resulting in a dataset with a 20 min measurement interval calibration of raw stokes anti stokes values to temperature values were completed following the single end calibration procedure outlined in hausner et al 2011 using warm and cold temperature reference baths at the beginning and end of each channel during the installation of the fo dts cable we encountered some problems associated with fiber optics and fo dts during installation and data analysis the absolute temperatures estimated with the fo dts method had limited accuracy of 0 1 c in the 20 25 c range due to several factors including fluctuation of ice baths temperature which complicated the calibration manufacturing and in stream installation induced strain in the glass fiber created signal artifacts within the length of the cable to overcome this defect a calibration procedure was implemented that allowed for the differential attenuation between stokes and anti stokes to vary spatially hausner et al 2011 this reduced the average uncertainty in each observed temperature measurement by 0 07 c although the calibration procedure was successful it should be noted that there remains a slightly higher level of uncertainty andthusreducedprecision resolution in the fo dts temperature data than would be found in a typical installation as the new calibration procedure would not have entirely removed strain induced error in temperature measurements 2 6 data analysis the spatial and temporal scales for the two temperature measurement methods differed and therefore a number of steps were taken to analyze and compare the two datasets for the data collected with the temperature sensors values above the 75th percentile and below the 25th percentile for each sensor was considered an outlier and was removed from the dataset prior to data analysis and comparison with the fo dts dataset the outliers in this case generally were higher temperature values that indicated the sensor was measuring air temperature in between measurement locations eleven outliers were removed from the temperature sensor dataset i e two outliers from pole 1 four outliers from pole 5 and five outliers from pole 6 the total number of temperature measurements after removing the outliers was 1479 i e 255 in pole 1 259 in pole 2 259 in pole 3 259 in pole 4 244 in pole 5 and 203 in pole 6 the fo dts temperature data were first analyzed to corroborate visual records of fiber optic cable position as either out of water in the water column or buried within the streambed sediment cable position was determined by identifying differences in absolute temperature and variability in hour to sub daily temperature dynamics at each measurement location temperature data recorded by the temperature sensors during the study period on august 6 from 16 00 to 18 50 was compared mainly to fiber locations within the stream water column i e temperature comparison excluded fiber locations that were either out of water or buried in the sediment because the thermal sensors measurements were within the stream water column just above the top of the streambed survey data of each temperature sensor measurement and each fo dts measurement were used to identify the nearest locational pairs between the two datasets data pairs were regressed only if their distance apart was less than 0 5 m as noted above to compare temperature data between each matching location pair at similar time stamps the fo dts data was interpolated from 20 min to 1 min data using a splined interpolation approach least squares linear regression was used to fit a linear relation between temperature sensor data for each pole and the paired fo dts data using matlab r2021a r squared or coefficient of determination values provided a goodness of fit for the relationship a geostatistical analysis was performed for the contour maps of the two temperature methods created using empirical bayesian kriging method using arcgis version 10 5 1 the analysis evaluated the standard error of each prediction and the pixel difference between the two predicted distributions against the accuracy of each temperature method 3 results discussion 3 1 stream and weather conditions the timing of the temperature survey was selected between 16 00 and 19 00 to minimize the transient fluctuation in stream and air temperatures this time also afforded the maximum difference between stream and streambed temperatures which increased the potential for detection of cooler temperature anomalies associated with groundwater influx average air temperature was 24 15 4 84 c during august 6 2019 and during the time of the thermal sensors survey from 16 00 to 18 50 air temperature was relatively constant at 30 7 0 39 c fig 4 on the day of the temperature survey the discharge was at baseflow conditions average value 1 48 0 73 m3 sec brooks and lowe 2019 which allowed the stream discharge to be relatively constant during the time of the spatial survey the maximum solar radiation was recorded at 14 15 as 1046 w m2 the maximum difference between the downstream stream water and sediment temperatures was 1 3 c at 16 00 when air temperature and stream water column temperature were the highest during the day the hourly average stream water temperature gradually increased from 08 00 to the end of the spatial survey measurement at 18 50 fig 4 following the general trend of air temperature the trend of the stream water diurnal temperatures in the downstream and upstream boundaries of the study reach were very similar however stream water temperature at the downstream was consistently warmer than the upstream with a maximum difference of 0 12 c recorded at 14 00 which decreased by the end of the survey at 18 50 with 0 081 c and 0 03 c at the downstream and upstream study reach boundaries respectively the higher downstream temperature values are explained by warming of the stream as the water flows through open canopy sections from upstream to downstream during the day the diurnal variation of the temperatures within the streambed sediments in the upstream and downstream study reach boundaries were slightly different fig 4 as the stream water temperature in the downstream was consistently warmer than the upstream we expected the sediment temperatures to follow the same trend however the downstream sediment temperature was consistently lower than the upstream and remained relatively stable throughout the day the upstream sediment temperature increased during the day suggesting possible percolation of warm stream water into the sediment causing the increase in temperature values 3 2 comparison between the temperature sensor and fo dts measurements 3 2 1 raw datasets fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of the measurement locations and the values for the measured temperature at each location for both the thermal sensors fig 5a and the fo dts fig 5b the temperature trend in fig 5b closely followed the trend in fig 5a with higher temperature values mostly in the downstream and lower values in the upstream the maximum temperature recorded with the temperature sensors at 16 45 was 24 00 c and the minimum upstream temperature recorded at 18 49 was 23 82 c the difference between the maximum and minimum values 0 18 c was significant because it was higher than the accuracy and resolution of the temperature sensors and the fo dts methods and these results were consistent with those presented in fig 4 the maximum temperature measured with the fo dts method at 16 22 was 24 07 c and the minimum temperature measured at 18 50 was 23 72 c the difference between the maximum temperature value measured with the fo dts method and that measured with the temperature sensors was 0 06 c and the difference between the minimum temperature measured with the fo dts method and that measured with the temperature sensors was 0 1 c these differences were within the accuracy of the two methods 0 4 to 0 1 c which suggested that these differences were not substantial higher temperature values were recorded with both methods in the downstream relative to the lower values in the upstream portions of the study reach and the higher temperature values in the downstream were attributed to warming of the stream water as it flowed from upstream to downstream passing through locations with less canopy cover during measurement time period these two different measurement methods were able to map significant spatial variability in stream water temperature which was unexpected due to the relatively fast flowing stream water and turbulent mixing 3 2 2 regression analysis the spatial threshold value of 0 5 m noted above was used to identify paired measurement locations for the two methods the number of data points using the 0 5 m threshold was 818 compared to 1479 total data points the temperature values measured with the two methods represented mainly the temperature of the stream water column after removing the fo dts measurements from all locations that were buried in the streambed sediments and locations that were exposed to sun heating or were partly exposed to air temperature fig 6 illustrates that the regression lines for all poles consistently fell below the 1 1 line indicating that fo dts observations were consistently lower than the corresponding temperature sensor measurements this was attributed to a difference in the calibration between the two methods the fo dts was calibrated to a slightly lower temperature standard relative to the individual temperature sensors the regression between each pole and the paired fo dts measurements showed consistent and linear positive correlations fig 6 the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 71 and 0 83 and the slopes of the regressions ranged between 0 91 and 1 45 each of these correlations were impacted by moderate data scatter and the amount of scatter and the r2 values were similar for most of the poles except pole 6 which had the highest slope and intercept despite the scatter the regressions were significant and the measurements using these two methods were comparable spatial information was also represented in these method correlation plots using the color scale the zero in the legend represents the location closest to the upstream boundary and the color scale varies with increasing distance from upstream to the downstream boundary of the study reach fig 6 the regression results show a consistent trend with cooler temperatures in the upstream and warmer temperature in the downstream as observed in the raw dataset fig 5 the regression equation slopes were close to unity 3 to 9 deviation for poles 1 through 4 fig 6 pole 5 and 6 had larger deviations of the slope from unity these two poles were closer to the south bank which had the shallower water depth some sediment bars or islands and some fallen trees the north bank had a somewhat deeper water depth relative to the south bank suggesting that the thalweg runs near the north bank the increases in regression equation slopes above unity for poles 5 and 6 were attributed to the difficulties in measurement of shallow water temperature near the south bank of the efpc therefore we posit that poles 5 and 6 had a larger measurement error compared to the other four poles due to the limited stream water depth additionally each of the rbr solo temperature sensors had different accuracy and precision as the sensors were calibrated in different times another issue with direct comparison of the two methods was that each of the measurements for the two methods had slightly different spatial locations horizontally and vertically and the two spatial surveys had a different time resolution although the times and locations of measurements were coupled as closely as possible the spatial and temporal variability in the measurements between these survey methods may have added to the uncertainty in the absolute temperature of the two methods similar to the individual poles the regression including all poles and all matching fo dts measurements showed a positive linear correlation fig 7 indicating a strong correlation between the two datasets however the r2 value of the regression including all poles and the all matching fo dts measurements was 0 62 which was less than those of the individual pole regression results the increase in the data scatter for the regression including all poles relative to the individual pole regression results confirms that in stream location measurement conditions impacted the correlation between these two measurement types for example the above noted proximity to the stream bank or stream water depth limitations could have impacted these measurements however the relative amounts of data scatter were not variable with noticeable trends along the length of the stream reach i e color scale for measurement location and this relative consistency in amount of scatter along the stream channel direction seemed to be consistent between each of the individual pole data sets fig 6 and the combined data set fig 7 3 2 3 histogram of the differences the average standard deviation of the temperature sensors survey was 23 91 0 04 c and of the fo dts survey was 23 87 0 05 c the average standard deviation of the difference between the sensors and paired fo dts measurements was 0 05 c 0 04 c fig 8 the minimum difference value was 0 09 c and the maximum difference value was 0 15 c the accuracy of the fo dts method was 0 05 c 0 10 c and therefore all difference values within this range or below 0 05 c are considered biased and values greater than 0 10 c are considered significant the histogram shows that more than 95 of the differences were within the accuracy of the fo dts method and only 5 were significant the shape of the distribution of the differences between the two methods was consistent with a normally distributed variable which determines that the distributions of the two datasets were close to normality these results confirmed the null hypothesis that the two spatial stream water temperature survey methods were similar and this was also consistent with the above noted positive correlation results between the two methods 3 2 4 geostatistical analysis contour maps of the temperature sensor measurements and the paired fo dts measurements were created using empirical bayesian kriging fig 9 the trend of the spatial distribution followed closely the trend of the raw data for both measurement methods fig 5 with higher temperatures mainly in the downstream and cooler temperatures in the upstream portions of the study reach the mapped trends and variability was highly comparable between the two different measurement methods whereas there does appear to be more variability in the temperature contour distributions for the map generated using the fo dts data contour maps of the standard error of the kriging predictions generated using the temperature sensor measurements and the paired fo dts measurements are also presented fig 10 the standard error of the prediction varied and increased away from the measurement locations and close to the creek banks for both methods the center of the channel generally had low error for both methods even though the low error along the center was not as consistently distributed for the fo dts method results the standard error for the temperature sensor method was approximately an order of magnitude lower than that for the fo dts method mainly because the measuring points for the temperature sensor method were evenly spaced and more data points were removed from the fo dts measurements however the standard error for both methods was low ranging between 0 002 c and 0 008 c for the temperature sensor method and 0 03 c and 0 039 c for the fo dts method compared to the accuracy of the two methods suggesting that those errors were not significant fig 11 presents difference maps for examining the spatial distribution of the difference between the two temperature survey measurement approaches fig 11a presents the map of differences between the empirical bayesian kriging maps shown in fig 9 i e temperature sensor map minus fo dts map the difference between the two spatial maps ranged between 0 08 c and 0 15 c about 90 6 of the differences were less than 0 1 c and only 9 4 of the differences was greater than 0 1 c which therefore were considered significant and represented the measurable differences between the two methods the locations of the larger temperature differences were mainly adjacent to the south bank in the upstream and between 0 m and 12 5 m in the downstream where the stream water depth was shallower and the measurement error of the temperature sensor was higher as discussed above those locations with larger differences were consistent with the results presented in fig 11b which is the difference map of the raw data that were shown in fig 5 the difference between the raw temperature sensor and fo dts measurements fig 11b showed spatially variable differences along the study reach with relatively higher differences ranged between 0 12 c and 0 16 c located along pole 6 close the south bank and there were also a few locations of larger differences along pole 1 i e close to the north bank at meter 165 from the downstream boundary of the study reach the increased measurement difference locations that were closer to the stream banks were also consistent with the increased regression slope deviations from unity for pole 5 and pole 6 fig 6 and those locations were also consistent with the locations of the elevated standard error of the kriging prediction fig 10 as discussed previously the south bank had a shallower stream water column and therefore the temperature measured along pole 6 was likely affected by the warmer air temperatures these results illustrate the potential limitations in the comparability of these two stream water temperature survey methods which includes locations near stream banks and where stream water depth is low in fact low flow or low water depth limitations or thresholds for the applicability of these methods might be considered as well fine spatial and temporal scales are often needed to monitor hyporheic zone interaction heterogeneity for applications such as quantifying solute transport nutrient cycling ecosystem assessment and defining thermal refugia in streams and lakes fo dts can provide a continuous measurement through a single fiber that are analogous to thousands of traditional temperature sensors with a fixed accuracy and precision along the cable however fo dts can be challenging to install in streams like efpc where streambed bathymetry is variable due to the outcropping bedrock fo dts is also relatively costly data collection in remote areas is challenging due to continuous power source requirements installation can be complex the fiber is fragile and can be easily strained or broken the calibration process can be extremely difficult and the analysis can be complex and convoluted some of the advantages of the temperature sensor array was its flexibility low cost ease of implementation and ability to standardize the depth of measurement which was not possible for the fo dts cable due to the variable stream bathymetry and exposed bedrock the array structure also provided the flexibility to add more temperature sensors to achieve a finer resolution of the spatial coverage of temperature measurements however the method required more time to collect the spatial distribution of data compared to the fo dts and was not readily repeatable over time for monitoring which is an advantage of the fo dts method if the installed cable distribution can be secured for some time data implementation and analysis was also less complex with the temperature sensors though implementing the method required continuous labor throughout the temperature survey 4 summary and conclusions in this study we developed a simple array of highly sensitive temperature sensors to measure the spatial temperature distribution within a stream reach and the approach could be extended to measurement of streambed sediment temperatures by inserting the sensors into unconsolidated sediments at each measurement location moving a transect of highly sensitive temperature sensors along the stream channel produced a 1 m by 1 m spatial survey of the stream water the thermal sensors spatial survey was directly compared to a survey method using fo dts within the identical study reach area by identifying co located measurement locations within the data sets of each method the regression results between the fo dts measurements and the matching temperature sensor measurements showed correlations with r2 values ranging between 0 71 and 0 83 for the individual temperature sensor poles and 0 62 for all poles combined the regression equations were consistently positive with slopes close to 1 which confirmed the comparability and consistency of these two temperature surveying methods correlation differences from 1 to 1 were larger for measurements in shallower water near the south stream bank comparison of these mapped spatial distributions showed similar trends between the two methods with warmer temperatures at the downstream and cooler temperatures at the upstream portions of the study reach geostatistical map prediction standard errors were generally low but largest errors were along the edges of the stream banks where stream water was shallow and access limitations decreased data density the differences between the methods were also mapped temperature sensor measurements minus fo dts measurements which showed that only 16 of the difference values exceeded the accuracy of the two methods further the location of these significant differences were primarily along the south stream bank these results all suggest that method comparability and measurement limitations likely occur in less accessible and shallower water depths along stream banks despite this limitation the majority of the measurement locations were directly comparable and both methods resulted in similar high resolution spatial surveys of stream water temperature despite the low amount of temperature differences these results generally support the practical utility of using the temperature sensor method as an alternative to the use of fo dts in streams where conditions are not amenable to application of the fo dts method this study illustrated that using an array of several individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to fo dts for spatial characterization of low order streams providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement with greater simplicity and with a broader range of conditions where it may be applied although the two methods were fit to measure the water column temperature limitations may exist to use the two methods to measure the distributed temperature of the sediment in similar streams with locations of bedrock outcrop along the streambed and little or no unconsolidated sediment lining the streambed the mobile array of point temperature measurements developed herein can be used for surveying spatially distributed stream temperatures which provides a comparable approach to the fo dts for characterization and monitoring along stream and river corridors declaration of

4072,measuring surface water temperature spatial variability is needed to estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater evaluate fish habitat and thermal inertia and to estimate streamflow frequency and duration fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts has been used in rivers and lakes providing high resolution and sensitive temperature monitoring over large temporal and spatial scales however in streams with cobbly or bedrock lined streambeds and variable bathymetry use of fo dts to measure temperature close to the surface water and groundwater interface can be challenging if even feasible fo dts can also be costly involve difficult installations and require an advanced understanding of the technology calibration and data processing in this study we compared fo dts stream temperature survey results to an alternative temperature survey method employing a towed transect of high resolution temperature loggers spaced at 1 m and transported in the stream along the study reach to measure the spatial distribution of stream water temperature in east fork poplar creek near oak ridge tennessee usa we assessed the applicability and limitations of the two methods and quantitatively compared in situ temperature survey results measured simultaneously with each method regression results showed strong temporal and spatial correlation between the two methods differences were only elevated near the stream banks in areas that were coincident with correlation slope deviations from unity which was attributed to shallower water and lower data density kriging standard errors were also low at channel center with minor increases near the stream banks the results suggested that the array of the individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to fo dts for thermal characterization of surface water providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement with greater simplicity

depth to salt water interface and to estimate parameters for heat flow models temperature is considered a relatively robust and inexpensive parameter to measure in surface water systems and the

also difficult to ascertain if seepage flux occurs along the entire reach length or whether downstream temperatures are influenced by the upstreamseepage source additionally tir imagery can introduce an error in estimating stream or streambed temperature due to the effect of camera distortion and the surrounding environmental conditions at the time of acquisition dugdale et al 2019 pai et al 2017 the tir method may underestimate or fail to detect downwelling flux of surface water to groundwater which suggests the need for a direct temperature measurement especially in streams where downwelling

et al 2019 hare et al 2015 however to our knowledge this is the first study that has compared the horizontal spatial stream temperature surveys using fo dts method and highly sensitive individual temperature sensors within similar spatial and temporal setting some studies deployed fo dts cables with temperature loggers that had much lower accuracy compared to those used herein and a lower spatial coverage compared to the fiber optic cable briggs et al 2016 lowry et al 2007 mamer and lowry 2013 although fo dts has been utilized successfully to evaluate the horizontal temperature distribution along streams and lakes selker et al 2014 the fo dts method can be challenging at best to implement in streams with bedrock lined streambed channels and variable streambed bathymetry which emphasizes the need for a point measurement method as a complementary or a substitute for the fo dts method the purpose of this investigation was to develop and evaluate a simple array of highly sensitive temperature sensors to measure the spatial temperature distribution within a natural stream reach evaluation of the thermal sensors spatial survey was through direct comparison to a survey method using fo dts within the identical study reach area by identifying co located measurement locations within the data sets of each method which was implemented near station 5 4 k in east fork poplar creek efpc tennessee usa the methods were compared to evaluate their capabilities limitations strengths and weaknesses of these methods and to highlight situations in which one or the other might be a better instrument choice for monitoring or surveying stream temperatures 2 methods 2 1 study site the temperature surveys were both conducted and compared along a 250 m long reach with an average 13 m width of efpc near oak ridge tennessee usa fig 1 efpc is a third order stream characterized with partially exposed limestone bedrock variable stream bathymetry and a thin veneer of sediment about 20 60 cm deep overlying the bedrock in most but not all locations of the study reach rucker et al 2021 mohamed et al 2021 the study reach is located in a densely forested freshwater emergent wetland with native sycamore boxelder and green ash trees providing heavy canopy cover during summer months cunningham and pounds 1991 starting in the early 1950s efpc received contaminated flows with mercury and other hazardous metals affecting the creek water sediments and the floodplain along the creek brooks and southworth 2011 water quality in efpc has improved substantially over the past decades but mercury contamination in the creek remains a persistent problem research over the past several years demonstrates that diffuse legacy sources of mercury contribute to the contaminant load in the creek and that hyporheic water discharging to the surface may be an important source of that increased mercury loading brooks et al 2018 demers et al 2018 2 2 surveying of measurement locations the temperature study was conducted during august 2019 prior to the temperature measurement the creek banks were surveyed and georeferenced to allow for spatial referencing of the temperature measurements the banks were marked with landscape stakes at 1 m intervals along the banks the distance across the stream between the opposite stakes was roughly the shortest distance between the two banks i e perpendicular to the stream thalweg the location of the stakes were surveyed with a leica total station ts02 distance measurement with reflector 1 5 mm 2 0 ppm and distance measurement without reflector 2 mm 2 ppm with lowest accuracy in the measurement direction as 2 5 mm 2 3 discrete upstream and downstream temperatures in the morning of august 6 2019 prior to the stream temperature survey a set of two temperature sensors were placed at fixed locations near the upstream reach boundary another set of two sensors were placed near the downstream reach boundary and within each set included one sensor fixed in the stream water column and another sensor buried in the sediment at about 0 3 m below the top of the streambed the purpose of these sensors was to provide temporal monitoring control measurements of the temperature at those locations before and throughout the spatial temperature survey from 16 00 to 18 50 in the same day weather data was obtained from a u s department of energy doe operated meteorological tower tower l located about 5 75 km southwest of the study site 2 4 temperature sensor setup six high sensitivity temperature sensors model rbr solos3 t were used to survey the spatial temperature variability along the efpc study reach fig 2 the reported accuracy of the sensors was 0 002 c with a stability of 0 002 c year its 90 and nist traceable standards with response time of 0 1 s the absolute accuracy of the sensors used in this study ranged between 0 004 c and 0 012 c based on the calibration year each temperature sensor was attached to a support box at the bottom of a 2 54 cm diameter pvc pipe hereafter termed poles fig 2a the six poles were oriented vertically to position the sensor within the stream at 0 05 m above the top of the streambed to allow for measurement of the stream temperature the sensors were then spaced in a straight line or transect at 1 m apart from each other using equal lengths of string the transect of temperature sensors poles was oriented perpendicular to the channel and stream flow and was moved during the sensor array survey along the direction of the channel to measure the temperature distribution along both the lateral and longitudinal directions of the stream channel each of the six equidistant poles measured along a line as they were used to move the sensors in the stream channel along the upstream flow direction with pole 1 as closest to the north bank and pole 6 closest to south bank fig 2b the number of the dataset collected with the six sensors in the array at 1 second resolution along the entire reach was 61 296 transect measurements of temperature were collected and recorded every 1 m along the length of the stream reach at the locations of the survey stakes resulting in a 1 m by 1 m grid of streambed temperatures fig 3 a the total number of data points for the sensor array survey transects was 1554 the 222 223 227 and 228 m locations had trees logs along the bank obstructing measurement the distance between the stake marks and the edge of the sensor array survey transects was measured at each measurement location during the survey the reporting interval for the temperature sensors was 1 s and the sensors were allowed 6 7 s to equilibrate at each location before taking the measurement the temperature survey using the temperature sensors started at the downstream end of the reach on august 6 2019 at 16 00 eastern standard time zone gmt 5 the time with the highest temperature difference between groundwater and surface water and ended at the upstream location at about 18 50 2 5 fo dts setup the physics of the fo dts measurement is based on a temperature dependent backscatter light mechanism including brillouin or raman backscatter selker et al 2006c it is possible to achieve sub meter scale spatial and 0 01 c thermal precision for measurement cycle times on the order of minutes for cables extending several kilometers tyler et al 2009 the principle of the fo dts method is based on releasing a pulse of laser light into the fiber optic cable and monitoring the raman backscatter light to estimate the temperature selker et al 2006c the distance from where the light was reflected is calculated by timing the return time of the laser pulse raman backscatter reflects at a wavelength shorter or longer than the wavelength of the original pulse the reflection with the longer wavelength is referred to as stokes backscatter and has an amplitude that is not temperature dependent the reflection with the shorter wavelength is called anti stokes backscatter and has an amplitude that linearly depends on temperature by measuring the stokes anti stokes ratio at different return locations the temperature of the fiber can be measured everywhere along the cable length the fo dts cable was mounted on a raft and was installed in the stream on august 5th 2019 in six passes back and forth along the length parallel to the channel of the study reach in a zig zag pattern to approximately equally distribute the cable spatially along both the width 1 m apart and length of the study reach fig 3b an original goal of the study was to measure streambed temperature at a shallow depth within the streambed to locate temperature anomalies within the streambed that may indicate groundwater seeps however due to the heterogeneous bedrock geology and variable bed bathymetry of the study reach burring the fiber optic cable in the sediment was only possible for a short length of the entire 2 km cable 18 and the majority of the cable was installed at variable depths of the water column but as close as possible to the streambed sediment to a depth between 0 and 0 1 m thus minimal cable was buried due to large sections of streambed being composed of exposed bedrock or large cobbles and buried locations were recorded by gps topcon hyperlite and using the surveyed stakes at the end of each run along the length of the reach an anchor was placed to support the cable against streamflow and the anchor was used to support the turn in the cable for the return pass in the opposite direction the location of the cable along the stream channel was referenced relative to the surveyed stakes and with a gps and the cable turn locations at the anchors were also surveyed thus each temperature value was referenced horizontally in 2d the total number of the independent temperature measurement was 6257 locations along 1934 m of installed cable fig 3b the fo dts interrogator measured the fiber temperature from august 5th until the 14th 2019 the total number of data points during the time of the temperature survey with the temperature sensors from 4 00 pm to 6 50 pm on august 6 was 56 313 both ends of the fiber were connected to the fo dts interrogator allowing for double ended measurements each channel in each direction was averaged over 10 min resulting in a dataset with a 20 min measurement interval calibration of raw stokes anti stokes values to temperature values were completed following the single end calibration procedure outlined in hausner et al 2011 using warm and cold temperature reference baths at the beginning and end of each channel during the installation of the fo dts cable we encountered some problems associated with fiber optics and fo dts during installation and data analysis the absolute temperatures estimated with the fo dts method had limited accuracy of 0 1 c in the 20 25 c range due to several factors including fluctuation of ice baths temperature which complicated the calibration manufacturing and in stream installation induced strain in the glass fiber created signal artifacts within the length of the cable to overcome this defect a calibration procedure was implemented that allowed for the differential attenuation between stokes and anti stokes to vary spatially hausner et al 2011 this reduced the average uncertainty in each observed temperature measurement by 0 07 c although the calibration procedure was successful it should be noted that there remains a slightly higher level of uncertainty andthusreducedprecision resolution in the fo dts temperature data than would be found in a typical installation as the new calibration procedure would not have entirely removed strain induced error in temperature measurements 2 6 data analysis the spatial and temporal scales for the two temperature measurement methods differed and therefore a number of steps were taken to analyze and compare the two datasets for the data collected with the temperature sensors values above the 75th percentile and below the 25th percentile for each sensor was considered an outlier and was removed from the dataset prior to data analysis and comparison with the fo dts dataset the outliers in this case generally were higher temperature values that indicated the sensor was measuring air temperature in between measurement locations eleven outliers were removed from the temperature sensor dataset i e two outliers from pole 1 four outliers from pole 5 and five outliers from pole 6 the total number of temperature measurements after removing the outliers was 1479 i e 255 in pole 1 259 in pole 2 259 in pole 3 259 in pole 4 244 in pole 5 and 203 in pole 6 the fo dts temperature data were first analyzed to corroborate visual records of fiber optic cable position as either out of water in the water column or buried within the streambed sediment cable position was determined by identifying differences in absolute temperature and variability in hour to sub daily temperature dynamics at each measurement location temperature data recorded by the temperature sensors during the study period on august 6 from 16 00 to 18 50 was compared mainly to fiber locations within the stream water column i e temperature comparison excluded fiber locations that were either out of water or buried in the sediment because the thermal sensors measurements were within the stream water column just above the top of the streambed survey data of each temperature sensor measurement and each fo dts measurement were used to identify the nearest locational pairs between the two datasets data pairs were regressed only if their distance apart was less than 0 5 m as noted above to compare temperature data between each matching location pair at similar time stamps the fo dts data was interpolated from 20 min to 1 min data using a splined interpolation approach least squares linear regression was used to fit a linear relation between temperature sensor data for each pole and the paired fo dts data using matlab r2021a r squared or coefficient of determination values provided a goodness of fit for the relationship a geostatistical analysis was performed for the contour maps of the two temperature methods created using empirical bayesian kriging method using arcgis version 10 5 1 the analysis evaluated the standard error of each prediction and the pixel difference between the two predicted distributions against the accuracy of each temperature method 3 results discussion 3 1 stream and weather conditions the timing of the temperature survey was selected between 16 00 and 19 00 to minimize the transient fluctuation in stream and air temperatures this time also afforded the maximum difference between stream and streambed temperatures which increased the potential for detection of cooler temperature anomalies associated with groundwater influx average air temperature was 24 15 4 84 c during august 6 2019 and during the time of the thermal sensors survey from 16 00 to 18 50 air temperature was relatively constant at 30 7 0 39 c fig 4 on the day of the temperature survey the discharge was at baseflow conditions average value 1 48 0 73 m3 sec brooks and lowe 2019 which allowed the stream discharge to be relatively constant during the time of the spatial survey the maximum solar radiation was recorded at 14 15 as 1046 w m2 the maximum difference between the downstream stream water and sediment temperatures was 1 3 c at 16 00 when air temperature and stream water column temperature were the highest during the day the hourly average stream water temperature gradually increased from 08 00 to the end of the spatial survey measurement at 18 50 fig 4 following the general trend of air temperature the trend of the stream water diurnal temperatures in the downstream and upstream boundaries of the study reach were very similar however stream water temperature at the downstream was consistently warmer than the upstream with a maximum difference of 0 12 c recorded at 14 00 which decreased by the end of the survey at 18 50 with 0 081 c and 0 03 c at the downstream and upstream study reach boundaries respectively the higher downstream temperature values are explained by warming of the stream as the water flows through open canopy sections from upstream to downstream during the day the diurnal variation of the temperatures within the streambed sediments in the upstream and downstream study reach boundaries were slightly different fig 4 as the stream water temperature in the downstream was consistently warmer than the upstream we expected the sediment temperatures to follow the same trend however the downstream sediment temperature was consistently lower than the upstream and remained relatively stable throughout the day the upstream sediment temperature increased during the day suggesting possible percolation of warm stream water into the sediment causing the increase in temperature values 3 2 comparison between the temperature sensor and fo dts measurements 3 2 1 raw datasets fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of the measurement locations and the values for the measured temperature at each location for both the thermal sensors fig 5a and the fo dts fig 5b the temperature trend in fig 5b closely followed the trend in fig 5a with higher temperature values mostly in the downstream and lower values in the upstream the maximum temperature recorded with the temperature sensors at 16 45 was 24 00 c and the minimum upstream temperature recorded at 18 49 was 23 82 c the difference between the maximum and minimum values 0 18 c was significant because it was higher than the accuracy and resolution of the temperature sensors and the fo dts methods and these results were consistent with those presented in fig 4 the maximum temperature measured with the fo dts method at 16 22 was 24 07 c and the minimum temperature measured at 18 50 was 23 72 c the difference between the maximum temperature value measured with the fo dts method and that measured with the temperature sensors was 0 06 c and the difference between the minimum temperature measured with the fo dts method and that measured with the temperature sensors was 0 1 c these differences were within the accuracy of the two methods 0 4 to 0 1 c which suggested that these differences were not substantial higher temperature values were recorded with both methods in the downstream relative to the lower values in the upstream portions of the study reach and the higher temperature values in the downstream were attributed to warming of the stream water as it flowed from upstream to downstream passing through locations with less canopy cover during measurement time period these two different measurement methods were able to map significant spatial variability in stream water temperature which was unexpected due to the relatively fast flowing stream water and turbulent mixing 3 2 2 regression analysis the spatial threshold value of 0 5 m noted above was used to identify paired measurement locations for the two methods the number of data points using the 0 5 m threshold was 818 compared to 1479 total data points the temperature values measured with the two methods represented mainly the temperature of the stream water column after removing the fo dts measurements from all locations that were buried in the streambed sediments and locations that were exposed to sun heating or were partly exposed to air temperature fig 6 illustrates that the regression lines for all poles consistently fell below the 1 1 line indicating that fo dts observations were consistently lower than the corresponding temperature sensor measurements this was attributed to a difference in the calibration between the two methods the fo dts was calibrated to a slightly lower temperature standard relative to the individual temperature sensors the regression between each pole and the paired fo dts measurements showed consistent and linear positive correlations fig 6 the coefficient of determination r2 ranged between 0 71 and 0 83 and the slopes of the regressions ranged between 0 91 and 1 45 each of these correlations were impacted by moderate data scatter and the amount of scatter and the r2 values were similar for most of the poles except pole 6 which had the highest slope and intercept despite the scatter the regressions were significant and the measurements using these two methods were comparable spatial information was also represented in these method correlation plots using the color scale the zero in the legend represents the location closest to the upstream boundary and the color scale varies with increasing distance from upstream to the downstream boundary of the study reach fig 6 the regression results show a consistent trend with cooler temperatures in the upstream and warmer temperature in the downstream as observed in the raw dataset fig 5 the regression equation slopes were close to unity 3 to 9 deviation for poles 1 through 4 fig 6 pole 5 and 6 had larger deviations of the slope from unity these two poles were closer to the south bank which had the shallower water depth some sediment bars or islands and some fallen trees the north bank had a somewhat deeper water depth relative to the south bank suggesting that the thalweg runs near the north bank the increases in regression equation slopes above unity for poles 5 and 6 were attributed to the difficulties in measurement of shallow water temperature near the south bank of the efpc therefore we posit that poles 5 and 6 had a larger measurement error compared to the other four poles due to the limited stream water depth additionally each of the rbr solo temperature sensors had different accuracy and precision as the sensors were calibrated in different times another issue with direct comparison of the two methods was that each of the measurements for the two methods had slightly different spatial locations horizontally and vertically and the two spatial surveys had a different time resolution although the times and locations of measurements were coupled as closely as possible the spatial and temporal variability in the measurements between these survey methods may have added to the uncertainty in the absolute temperature of the two methods similar to the individual poles the regression including all poles and all matching fo dts measurements showed a positive linear correlation fig 7 indicating a strong correlation between the two datasets however the r2 value of the regression including all poles and the all matching fo dts measurements was 0 62 which was less than those of the individual pole regression results the increase in the data scatter for the regression including all poles relative to the individual pole regression results confirms that in stream location measurement conditions impacted the correlation between these two measurement types for example the above noted proximity to the stream bank or stream water depth limitations could have impacted these measurements however the relative amounts of data scatter were not variable with noticeable trends along the length of the stream reach i e color scale for measurement location and this relative consistency in amount of scatter along the stream channel direction seemed to be consistent between each of the individual pole data sets fig 6 and the combined data set fig 7 3 2 3 histogram of the differences the average standard deviation of the temperature sensors survey was 23 91 0 04 c and of the fo dts survey was 23 87 0 05 c the average standard deviation of the difference between the sensors and paired fo dts measurements was 0 05 c 0 04 c fig 8 the minimum difference value was 0 09 c and the maximum difference value was 0 15 c the accuracy of the fo dts method was 0 05 c 0 10 c and therefore all difference values within this range or below 0 05 c are considered biased and values greater than 0 10 c are considered significant the histogram shows that more than 95 of the differences were within the accuracy of the fo dts method and only 5 were significant the shape of the distribution of the differences between the two methods was consistent with a normally distributed variable which determines that the distributions of the two datasets were close to normality these results confirmed the null hypothesis that the two spatial stream water temperature survey methods were similar and this was also consistent with the above noted positive correlation results between the two methods 3 2 4 geostatistical analysis contour maps of the temperature sensor measurements and the paired fo dts measurements were created using empirical bayesian kriging fig 9 the trend of the spatial distribution followed closely the trend of the raw data for both measurement methods fig 5 with higher temperatures mainly in the downstream and cooler temperatures in the upstream portions of the study reach the mapped trends and variability was highly comparable between the two different measurement methods whereas there does appear to be more variability in the temperature contour distributions for the map generated using the fo dts data contour maps of the standard error of the kriging predictions generated using the temperature sensor measurements and the paired fo dts measurements are also presented fig 10 the standard error of the prediction varied and increased away from the measurement locations and close to the creek banks for both methods the center of the channel generally had low error for both methods even though the low error along the center was not as consistently distributed for the fo dts method results the standard error for the temperature sensor method was approximately an order of magnitude lower than that for the fo dts method mainly because the measuring points for the temperature sensor method were evenly spaced and more data points were removed from the fo dts measurements however the standard error for both methods was low ranging between 0 002 c and 0 008 c for the temperature sensor method and 0 03 c and 0 039 c for the fo dts method compared to the accuracy of the two methods suggesting that those errors were not significant fig 11 presents difference maps for examining the spatial distribution of the difference between the two temperature survey measurement approaches fig 11a presents the map of differences between the empirical bayesian kriging maps shown in fig 9 i e temperature sensor map minus fo dts map the difference between the two spatial maps ranged between 0 08 c and 0 15 c about 90 6 of the differences were less than 0 1 c and only 9 4 of the differences was greater than 0 1 c which therefore were considered significant and represented the measurable differences between the two methods the locations of the larger temperature differences were mainly adjacent to the south bank in the upstream and between 0 m and 12 5 m in the downstream where the stream water depth was shallower and the measurement error of the temperature sensor was higher as discussed above those locations with larger differences were consistent with the results presented in fig 11b which is the difference map of the raw data that were shown in fig 5 the difference between the raw temperature sensor and fo dts measurements fig 11b showed spatially variable differences along the study reach with relatively higher differences ranged between 0 12 c and 0 16 c located along pole 6 close the south bank and there were also a few locations of larger differences along pole 1 i e close to the north bank at meter 165 from the downstream boundary of the study reach the increased measurement difference locations that were closer to the stream banks were also consistent with the increased regression slope deviations from unity for pole 5 and pole 6 fig 6 and those locations were also consistent with the locations of the elevated standard error of the kriging prediction fig 10 as discussed previously the south bank had a shallower stream water column and therefore the temperature measured along pole 6 was likely affected by the warmer air temperatures these results illustrate the potential limitations in the comparability of these two stream water temperature survey methods which includes locations near stream banks and where stream water depth is low in fact low flow or low water depth limitations or thresholds for the applicability of these methods might be considered as well fine spatial and temporal scales are often needed to monitor hyporheic zone interaction heterogeneity for applications such as quantifying solute transport nutrient cycling ecosystem assessment and defining thermal refugia in streams and lakes fo dts can provide a continuous measurement through a single fiber that are analogous to thousands of traditional temperature sensors with a fixed accuracy and precision along the cable however fo dts can be challenging to install in streams like efpc where streambed bathymetry is variable due to the outcropping bedrock fo dts is also relatively costly data collection in remote areas is challenging due to continuous power source requirements installation can be complex the fiber is fragile and can be easily strained or broken the calibration process can be extremely difficult and the analysis can be complex and convoluted some of the advantages of the temperature sensor array was its flexibility low cost ease of implementation and ability to standardize the depth of measurement which was not possible for the fo dts cable due to the variable stream bathymetry and exposed bedrock the array structure also provided the flexibility to add more temperature sensors to achieve a finer resolution of the spatial coverage of temperature measurements however the method required more time to collect the spatial distribution of data compared to the fo dts and was not readily repeatable over time for monitoring which is an advantage of the fo dts method if the installed cable distribution can be secured for some time data implementation and analysis was also less complex with the temperature sensors though implementing the method required continuous labor throughout the temperature survey 4 summary and conclusions in this study we developed a simple array of highly sensitive temperature sensors to measure the spatial temperature distribution within a stream reach and the approach could be extended to measurement of streambed sediment temperatures by inserting the sensors into unconsolidated sediments at each measurement location moving a transect of highly sensitive temperature sensors along the stream channel produced a 1 m by 1 m spatial survey of the stream water the thermal sensors spatial survey was directly compared to a survey method using fo dts within the identical study reach area by identifying co located measurement locations within the data sets of each method the regression results between the fo dts measurements and the matching temperature sensor measurements showed correlations with r2 values ranging between 0 71 and 0 83 for the individual temperature sensor poles and 0 62 for all poles combined the regression equations were consistently positive with slopes close to 1 which confirmed the comparability and consistency of these two temperature surveying methods correlation differences from 1 to 1 were larger for measurements in shallower water near the south stream bank comparison of these mapped spatial distributions showed similar trends between the two methods with warmer temperatures at the downstream and cooler temperatures at the upstream portions of the study reach geostatistical map prediction standard errors were generally low but largest errors were along the edges of the stream banks where stream water was shallow and access limitations decreased data density the differences between the methods were also mapped temperature sensor measurements minus fo dts measurements which showed that only 16 of the difference values exceeded the accuracy of the two methods further the location of these significant differences were primarily along the south stream bank these results all suggest that method comparability and measurement limitations likely occur in less accessible and shallower water depths along stream banks despite this limitation the majority of the measurement locations were directly comparable and both methods resulted in similar high resolution spatial surveys of stream water temperature despite the low amount of temperature differences these results generally support the practical utility of using the temperature sensor method as an alternative to the use of fo dts in streams where conditions are not amenable to application of the fo dts method this study illustrated that using an array of several individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to fo dts for spatial characterization of low order streams providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement with greater simplicity and with a broader range of conditions where it may be applied although the two methods were fit to measure the water column temperature limitations may exist to use the two methods to measure the distributed temperature of the sediment in similar streams with locations of bedrock outcrop along the streambed and little or no unconsolidated sediment lining the streambed the mobile array of point temperature measurements developed herein can be used for surveying spatially distributed stream temperatures which provides a comparable approach to the fo dts for characterization and monitoring along stream and river corridors declaration of

4073,this study demonstrates the benefits of using a simple statistical analysis to investigate the attributions of climate variables to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationships rainfall and streamflow data from 65 catchments in southeast australia are used to quantify the rainfall streamflow relationship prior to during and after the 1997 2009 millennium drought the results showed that 1 the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall however the relationship is different in the different hydroclimate periods 2 the number of rainfall days and the mean length of wet spell mews are the two most stable variables that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated total rainfall d90max and d90p99 3 the combination of mews with several other rainfall characteristics can explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship through the different hydroclimate conditions in the eastern part of the study region and 4 the relative differences in the key rainfall characteristics can help explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the results here can help identify the key rainfall and climate characteristics to be considered in assessing the impacts of climate variability and change on streamflow and potentially for developing hydrological models that can be better extrapolated to predict streamflow under a changing climate keywords climate change and variability hydroclimate nonstationarity statistical analysis millennium drought southeast australia 1 introduction a nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship due to human activity and changing climate has been reported all over the world milly et al 2008 peterson et al 2021 vorosmarty et al 2000 for catchments with limited or no human activities one simple method to explore the impacts of climate change and variability on streamflow is to estimate the precipitation elasticity of streamflow schaake 1990 for example sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 used it to document the precipitation elasticity of streamflow for 1337 basins in the usa showing that a 1 change in precipitation results in a 1 5 2 5 change in basin runoff depending upon the degree of buffering by storage processes and other factors chiew 2006 showed that the rainfall elasticity of streamflow in australia is about 2 0 3 5 the elasticity concept can also be used with the budyko based framework to estimate the impacts of rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet or aridity index and other factors on annual streamflow chen et al 2014 coron et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 however the elasticity or budyko method generally uses mean annual rainfall and or pet to build the relationship with annual streamflow whilst the key climate variables influencing streamflow under nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship could include other climate rainfall characteristics beyond just the mean annual rainfall and pet from 1997 to 2009 southeastern australia including the state of victoria underwent a severe and prolonged dry period referred to as the millennium drought chiew et al 2014 van dijk et al 2013 fig 1 and table 1 shows the rainfall streamflow and their relationships before during and after the millennium drought averaged across 65 catchments in victoria state these differences make it an ideal case study region to explore the attributions of climatic characteristics to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship for example the annual rainfall averaged across the 65 catchments after the millennium drought 2010 2018 is 2 1 larger than long term 1971 2018 mean but its annual streamflow is still 4 3 below the long term mean this less than expected annual streamflow suggests that some rainfall climate or catchment characteristics dowdy 2020 osburn et al 2021 peterson et al 2021 post et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 are potentially more important for streamflow generation than annual rainfall itself understanding the changing rainfall streamflow relationship is not only a scientific challenge but also has implications for numerous modelling and management applications for example water resource planning and management that are based on the stationary rainfall streamflow relationship are likely to overestimate water availability delwp et al 2020 there is also spatial heterogeneity in the rainfall streamflow relationship for example saft et al 2016 showed that landscape slope and humidity can explain 75 of the variance of the rainfall streamflow anomaly during the millennium drought this study explores the influence of rainfall characteristics on the nonstationarity of annual rainfall streamflow relationship using the data before 1971 1996 during 1997 2009 and after 2010 2018 the millennium drought in southeastern australia it needs point out that the term nonstationarity has been widely used in the literature to have different implications koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 have extensively reviewed the history and concept of nonstationarity as well as its philosophical reflections stationarity under change justified use of nonstationary models and stationarity ergodicity and inductive inference from a technical point of view nonstationarity can be defined as differences in the statistical characteristics such as mean variance covariance of a variable or in statistical relationships across space or time rollinson et al 2021 the nonstationarity in the context of this study is simply the same as changing or multi state rainfall streamflow relationship during different time periods hydroclimate conditions i e the same annual rainfall amount would produce different annual streamflow before 1971 1996 during 1997 2009 and after 2010 2018 the millennium drought fig 1 and table 1 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 streamflow data the hydrologic reference stations hrs of the bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au water hrs about shtml in the state of victoria are used in this study fig 2 the 467 hrs were selected from about 4 800 streamflow gauging stations across australia the station selection guideline is a four stage process australian bureau of meteorology 2020 turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 1 identify unregulated catchments with minimal land use change 2 identify gauging stations with high quality streamflow observations and a long period of record greater than 30 years 3 ensure the distribution of streamflow reference stations is spatially representative of all hydroclimate regions in australia 4 consult with relevant agencies in each jurisdiction to review the application of the guidelines there are 67 hrs in victoria with a full record from 1971 to 2018 without any missing data however two catchments are excluded from this study due to an abnormal streamflow coefficient the ratio of streamflow to rainfall being more than 1 5 the areas of these 65 catchments used for this study vary from 5 km2 to 2677 km2 with a median value of 305 km2 and a mean value of 429 km2 the long term 1971 2018 mean annual streamflow ranges from 2 8 gl 28 8 mm to 408 5 gl 904 5 mm with a median streamflow 46 3 gl 177 5 mm and a mean value of 76 5gl 227 2 mm 2 1 2 awap rainfall and pet rainfall from the australian water availability project awap http www csiro au awap a product of the bom and csiro jones et al 2009 is used in this study the 0 05 gridded daily rainfall product was obtained by interpolating rainfall observed at gauging stations across australia the interpolation method uses a two step process beesley et al 2009 interpolation of monthly rainfall climatology using a thin plate smoothed spline and interpolation of anomalies of daily rainfall expressed as a percentage of the climatological rainfall using barnes successive correction method jones et al 2009 the pet within awap database is calculated using the penman 1948 equation the pet provides an upper limit on evaporation and transpiration from the soil and vegetation and depends solely on the available energy at the surface the daily gridded climate datasets used to produce the pet product include daily downward solar irradiance the maximum and minimum air temperatures and relative humidity from the bureau of meteorology jones et al 2009 and long term average windspeed dataset of mcvicar et al 2008 given the spatial heterogeneity these 65 catchments are divided into three groups based on hydroclimate conditions and geographic locations to explore their spatial differences west southeast and northeast catchments fig 2 the catchments in the west and southeast drain into the southeastern australian coast and the catchments in the northeast drain into the murray river there are significant differences in the hydroclimate characteristics of these three groups of catchments table 2 the catchments in the west are the driest with the smallest annual rainfall and streamflow the lowest runoff coefficient about 11 and the largest pet in contrast the northeast catchments are the wettest group with the largest annual rainfall and the highest runoff coefficient about 28 the classification of three group catchments is simply to explore the spatial differences therefore it may not be the best classification results for example the catchments in the north of port phillip bay could easily be moved to the other category based on their geographical locations instead of drainage basin used in this study 2 1 3 climate characteristics based on daily rainfall and pet 56 climate statistics variables are calculated and then used in this study to investigate their relationships with annual streamflow daily catchment average rainfall and pet was computed by area weighted aggregating all the grid cells within the catchment the 56 climate statistics were then computed using the catchment average rainfall and pet the names units and their abbreviations are listed in table 3 2 2 methods the objective of this study is to identify climate variables which are essential for annual streamflow and can be used to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after the millennium drought therefore its application of statistical techniques is different from traditional procedure which is generally to find the best performing model or the best model parameters the statistical analysis in this study comprises the following five steps step 1 a simple least squares linear eq 1 and exponential eq 2 regression is built between annual streamflow and the 56 climate variables for the 1971 1996 datasets before the millennium drought to identify the important climate variables for streamflow generation 1 y a b x 2 y a e b x where y is the annual streamflow in this study x is the climate variable s which can be one or more variables the a and b are parameters to be determined if x is a matrix to have multiple climate variables then b is a vector the reason why it called least squares is that it minimizes the total of the square of the errors since it has only one explanatory variable it is called simple linear or exponential regression the coefficient of determination r2 which is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable annual streamflow that is predictable from the independent variable climate variables is used to evaluate the model performance the r2 has an identical value as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 4 for the calibration period with a regression model a correlation coefficient cor from this linear or exponential regression which is the square root of coefficient of determination is a numerical measure on the strength of the relationship between the response annual streamflow and the explanatory variable climate variables one advantage cor over r2 is that it can show the positive or negative relationship between dependent variable and the predictors step 2 the regression model built in step 1 is used to predict annual streamflow for 1997 2009 the millennium drought and 2010 2018 after the drought two indices are used to examine the performance of the regression model relative error re of mean annual streamflow and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 3 r e 100 1 mean q sim i mean q obs i 4 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i m e a n q obs i 2 where qsim i is the simulated annual streamflow qobs i is the observed annual streamflow and n is the number of years of study period step 3 the regression model in step 1 could be extended into a two predictor regression model depending on the results of step 2 it is expected that a fitted regression in step 1 with pre drought data would overpredict the annual streamflow for the two later periods because of the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship during the three periods fig 1 and table 2 if a regression model developed using data from one climate period e g 1971 1996 in step 1 underpredicts the annual streamflow for the later periods then a natural idea would be to build a two predictor regression model comprising this specific variable and another climate variable there will be three possible outcomes 1 the two predictor regression model performs better than the original one predictor regression model this is an ideal scenario and demonstrates the importance of this specific variable 2 the updated two predictor regression model behaves worse than its original model 3 the result is mixed such as an improved nse and a larger relative error step 4 the steps 1 3 are repeated for the three groups of catchments fig 2 to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the nonstationary rainfall streamflow typology this approach not only is a scientific question related with weather system changes dowdy 2020 but also has practical applications for water resource management and planning step 5 the changes in the climate variables especially those that have been identified as essential for annual streamflow in steps 1 4 are derived and then used to investigate whether they can explain the rainfall streamflow nonstationary relationship before during and after the millennium drought given the rainfall and streamflow anomalies during and after the millennium drought table 2 it is hypothesised that the regression model developed on the 1971 1996 data might perform better at predicting annual streamflow for the wetter 2010 2018 period than the very dry 1997 2009 period therefore slightly different criteria are used to define a good model for these two periods a a regression is defined as a good model for the calibrated period 1971 1996 if its coefficient of determination is larger than 0 8 this is the largest threshold used in the literature from table 2 of moriasi et al 2007 since we are interested in which climate variable directly influences annual streamflow this could be either a linear or exponential regression for one or both b a regression built with 1971 1996 data is defined as a good model for predicting annual streamflow after the millennium drought 2010 2018 if it meets the following two criteria 1 its nse value is larger than 0 7 and 2 its relative error for the mean annual streamflow for the entire 2010 2018 period is within 5 regression models that satisfy these criteria can basically explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought that is why the streamflow is still below the long term mean after the millennium drought while its annual rainfall is above the long term mean value c a regression built with 1971 1996 data is defined as a good model for predicting annual streamflow during the millennium drought 1997 2009 if it meets the following two criteria 1 its nse value is larger than 0 5 which is threshold being considered as a satisfactory model by moriasi et al 2007 and 2 its relative error for the mean annual streamflow for the entire 1997 2009 period is within 5 regression models that satisfy these criteria can basically explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and during the millennium drought that is producing a satisfactory prediction of annual streamflow before and during the millennium drought the goal of this study is to identify climate variables which meet all criteria for a good model described in a b and c above these climatic characteristics are essential for annual streamflow and can be used to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after the millennium drought 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between annual streamflow and climate variables fig 3 shows the correlation coefficients between annual streamflow weighted average across the 65 catchments and the 56 climate variables for 1971 1996 in general the exponential correlation is marginally better than the linear regression for the majority of climate variables table 4 shows the correlation coefficients against climate variables higher than 0 8 the stronger correlated variables with the annual streamflow are explainable from the physical processes of streamflow generation and can be categorised into several groups annual rainfall ap this is expected because the annual total rainfall is usually the most important single climate variable for predicting the annual streamflow although its correlation coefficients are not always the highest among the 56 investigated climate variables table 4 effective rainfall defined as the sum of positive values of the difference between monthly rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rainpet given that rainfall and pet are the two most important variables for streamflow generation fu et al 2007 it is anticipated that their difference is also essential for streamflow however the annual streamflow correlation against ap is consistently higher to some extent than that against rainpet cool seasonal rainfall this can also be expected because most of the streamflow in victoria occurs in winter and early spring the cool season rainfall characteristics are defined here as the total rainfall from march to october m310 from april to october m410 and from may to october m510 total rainfall amount and the number of rainfall days above a certain threshold such as 5 or 10 mm day rd5 rd10 r5 and r10 in fact rd5 has a higher correlation coefficient with annual streamflow than annual rainfall this critical value 5 mm day also showed a strong correlation with groundwater recharge fu et al 2019 this might be related to interception by vegetation and or infiltration into soil that is a rainfall event of 5 mm day or less would be intercepted by vegetation and or infiltrated into dry top layer soil and then evaporated it accordingly does not result in any runoff or groundwater recharge extreme daily rainfall p95 the 95th percentile of daily rainfall has the highest correlation with annual streamflow among the three extreme rainfall indicators used in this study the 99th percentile daily rainfall also has a relatively strong relationship with annual streamflow 0 73 and 0 77 for liner and exponential regressions respectively the maximum daily rainfall correlation with the annual streamflow was relatively weak multi day accumulated rainfall d30max d30p99 d90max and d90p99 the maximum and 99th percentile of multi day accumulated rainfall also have a strong and positive correlation with annual streamflow fig 3 the rainfall accumulations over longer periods 30 and 90 days has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow than the rainfall accumulation over shorter time 3 5 and 7 days the correlation against multi day accumulated rainfall also shows the largest improvement from linear to exponential regression indicating their non linear relationship with annual streamflow dry spell days meds annual streamflow generally has a positive correlation with wet spell and a negative correlation with dry spell fig 3 for both the wet spell and dry spell the mean lengths mews and meds generally have a better correlation with annual streamflow than the maximum lengths mxws and mxds streamflow is generated from multiple rainfall events therefore mean lengths of wet spell and dry spell are more important than the maximum lengths the mean length of dry spell meds is one of top climate variables relating to annual streamflow and has the highest negative correlation coefficient with annual streamflow 3 2 predicted annual streamflow for 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 based on 1971 1996 relationship fig 4 summarises the ability of the regression models developed using 1971 1996 data in predicting the annual streamflow time series for 1997 2009 during the millennium drought and 2010 2018 after the millennium drought the plots show the relative error in the predicted total streamflow and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of predicting annual streamflow series over each of the two periods the results show as probably expected that the regression models developed using data from the wetter 1971 1996 period overpredicted the annual streamflow for the drier future periods the overprediction is much worse for the 1997 2009 millennium drought than for 2010 2018 while the latter is more similar to the 1971 1996 period for example the annual rainfall streamflow linear regression which has a correlation coefficient 0 92 and a nse 0 85 for the 1971 1996 data overestimated the annual streamflow by 27 6 and 17 6 for 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods respectively and their corresponding nse values are 0 06 and 0 58 for predicting the annual streamflow for the 2010 2018 post drought period there is only one good model according to criteria a and b in section 2 2 this is the rd number of days with rainfall above 1 mm linear regression model with a nse 0 73 and a relative error 3 1 for the post drought period this indicates that the rd is the most important climate variable here that can explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the d90max 90 day maximum rainfall and d90p99 99th percentile of 90 day rainfall have the two highest nse of about 0 85 and a relative error 5 0 and 5 1 respectively for the post drought 2010 2018 period the r2 for these two variables are just below 0 8 for the 1971 1996 calibration period the next interesting variable is the mean length of wet spell mews which has a relative error of about 5 and a reasonable nse value of 0 5 the mews is also the only variable to underestimate the annual streamflow for this period this could imply its importance in possibly combining it with other climate variables to produce a better multi regression model with two climate variables there are several other variables with a reasonable nse of greater than 0 5 a satisfactory model based on moriasi et al 2007 but a large relative error such as m310 nse 0 67 and re 10 7 m410 nse 0 50 and re 6 3 son nse 0 53 and re 8 2 rd5 nse 0 67 and re 11 5 rd10 nse 0 56 and re 14 0 and rainpet nse 0 67 and re 11 5 for predicting the annual streamflow for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period there is not a single regression model developed using the 1971 1996 data that could predict the annual streamflow during the 1997 2009 based on criteria c in section 2 2 the best performing model for the millennium drought is the linear regression model with the mean length of wet spell mews which has a relative error of 1 3 and a nse of 0 48 just slightly lower than the threshold of 0 5 the combination of this finding with its performance for the 2010 2018 period above implies that the mews might be an important variable for predicting streamflow through nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationships in a changing climate for our study region the second best model is the linear regression model with the number of rainfall days above 1 mm rd with a relative error of 9 1 and a nse of 0 53 these are only two models with a relative error smaller than 10 and a nse around 0 5 most models have a negative nse indicating that apart from mews and rd regression models developed against other rainfall characteristics using the wet 1971 1996 period overpredict the annual streamflow during the millennium drought in summary rd and mews appear to be the two most important variables to regress with annual streamflow as a single predictor model to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after millennium drought the use of mews the only variable that underpredicts annual streamflow for two latter periods as a predictor variable in a multi predictor regression model can improve streamflow prediction over different hydroclimate periods 3 3 two predictor regression model to predict annual streamflow fig 5 compares the r2 from single climate variable 55 climate variables and two climate variables each of the 55 climate variables plus mews for both linear and exponential regression with annual streamflow for the 1971 1996 period again using the weighted average values from the 65 catchments the horizonal dashed blue line is the r2 for mews which is the compulsory climate variable and the r2 of the correlation against two variables would be larger or equal to it the results show that the coefficients of determination for some of the two variable regression models have a clear increase while others are unchanged or show only a slight improvement although the increase in r2 in the 1971 1996 calibration is relatively modest fig 5 the two predictor regression model significantly improved the annual streamflow prediction for the subsequent period this improvement is clearly evident comparing the results for the two predictor model in fig 6 against the results for the one predictor model in fig 4 the relative error in the two predictor models have improved by more than 20 and almost all the nse values in the two predictor models are now positive table 5 shows the six two predictor regression models meeting criteria a and b in section 2 2 and fig 7 is an example of the observed streamflow vs the predicted streamflow based on two variable regression models both linear and exponential models this is a significant improvement because there is only one single predictor model rd that met these criteria the best results come from the combination of mews with d90p99 and d90max with nse for annual streamflow prediction of 0 6 in 1997 2009 and 0 87 in 2010 2018 and relatively small errors of about 5 in 1997 2009 and 3 in 2010 2018 table 5 it is not surprising that the combination of rd and mews is the best model in terms of relative error 0 6 to predict annual streamflow for the periods 2010 2018 because they are the two most important variables from the single predictor regression analysis in the previous section table 5 and fig 7 their linear regression model could also explain 57 of variance during the millennium drought 1997 2009 with a relative error of 3 9 although the exponential regression models showed better results compared with their respective linear regression models in the calibration period 1971 1996 as shown in section 3 1 the linear regression model consistently gives better predictions of streamflow in 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 sections 3 2 and 3 3 this is because the value of explanatory climate variables in the prediction period can fall outside the range of the calibration period and the linear regression is more conservative than the exponential regression leading to smaller errors when the model is extrapolated beyond the data range used in calibration figs 6 and 7 table 5 this is also the case for future rainfall predictions iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 that the fitted linear trends produce larger prediction errors than the simpler mean models the contribution of the mews to annual streamflow should be emphasised the mews itself is not one of the most important climate variables for streamflow generation but its combination with other climate variables can help explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship for example the combination of rd and mews only explains the same percentage 84 of variance as a single variable rd linear regression against annual streamflow in the model calibration but it reduces the relative error in the streamflow prediction from 9 1 to 3 9 and improves nse from 0 53 to 0 57 for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period and from 3 1 to 0 6 and nse from 0 73 to 0 74 for the 2010 2018 post drought period table 6 another example is the annual rainfall ap which itself cannot explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the combination of ap and mews only slightly improves the 1971 1996 calibration r2 but it reduces the relative error from 27 6 to 10 0 and increases the nse from 0 06 to 0 55 for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period and from 17 6 to 8 7 and nse from 0 58 to 0 80 for the 2010 2018 post drought period 3 4 spatial differences of rainfall streamflow relationship table 7 shows the ranking of the top 20 climate variables with the highest correlation r2 against annual streamflow weighted average over the entire 1971 2018 period for the entire 65 catchments as well as for the catchments in each of the three regions the rankings for the three regions are relatively similar with the key differences described below 1 the annual rainfall ap has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow in the southeast and northeast regions which are relatively wetter regions with a higher annual rainfall and runoff coefficient table 2 the annual rainfall is the 3rd for linear regression and 5th for exponential regression ranked variable in the drier west region 2 in the drier west region the number of rainfall days above 1 0 mm rd has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow 3 the cold season rainfall m310 m410 and m510 generally has a higher rank in west than in the southeast and northeast table 7 4 the multi day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow in the west and southeast regions than that in the northeast region 5 the magnitudes of the highest ranked correlation coefficients are similar in the three regions 0 90 0 94 but the lowest one in the west 0 59 can be quite different to those in the southeast 0 69 0 72 and northeast 0 70 0 73 table 7 it is also interesting to note that the mean length of wet spell mews has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow than the mean length of dry spell meds for the full study period 1971 2018 which is opposite of that for the 1971 1996 pre drought period section 3 1 the regression models calibrated against 1971 1996 data show different skills in predicting the streamflow for the 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods in the three different regions and these are summarised in figs 8 11 and discussed below 3 4 1 west region for catchments in the west region fig 8 the calibrated regressions against 1971 1996 data do not show any skills in predicting the annual streamflow for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the smallest relative error in the predicted annual streamflow is 41 8 from the linear regression model against rd and all nse values for prediction using the 56 climate variables are negative this is likely due to that the rainfall streamflow relationship during the 1997 2009 period has changed significantly from the 1971 1996 period the mean annual rainfall averaged over the 18 catchments in the west for 1997 2009 is about 10 5 lower than the 1971 2018 mean and this is similar for the other two regions but the mean annual streamflow for 1997 2009 is 52 5 less than the 1971 2018 mean and significantly lower than the other two regions the calibrated regressions against 1971 1996 data show better skill in predicting the annual streamflow for the wetter 2010 2018 period nevertheless none of the prediction skill satisfy criteria a and b in section 2 2 the best performed models are the linear regression models with either rd the highest nse or mews the lowest relative error the rd regression model has a nse of 0 56 and a relative error of 9 7 the mews linear regression model has a relative error of 0 6 and a nse of 0 42 these results indicate that for catchments in the west region the rd and mews may show some skills in explaining the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought but their nses both rd and mews are too low or relative errors are too large rd to be considered as a acceptable model a major difference between the west region and the entire study region fig 8 vs fig 4 is that all regression models against the climate variables result in an overprediction of annual streamflow for 2010 2018 as a result the two predictors regression model could not significantly reduce the predicted error for example a combination of these two best predictors results in a regression model having a relative error of 4 1 which is roughly half way between their individual regression model i e 0 6 mews and 8 4 rd its corresponding nse value is 0 57 which is almost the same as single predictor rd regression model 3 4 2 southeast region the overall results for the southeast region fig 9 are similar with those for the entire study region 1 the 1971 1996 calibration against the mean length of wet spell mews is the best performed model in predicting the 1997 2009 annual streamflow with a relative error of 3 7 and a nse of 0 50 it is also the only predictor to meet the selected criteria 2 the 1971 1996 calibrations against multi day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 produce the best performed models in predicting the 2010 2018 annual streamflow with a relative error of less than 1 5 and a nse of around 0 75 the rd on the other hand could yield a similar magnitude of relative error 1 3 5 1 but with a much smaller nse 0 45 0 47 3 the mews is the only predictor to underpredict the annual streamflow for both the 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods which supports the hypothesis that a combination of mews with other climate variables should produce a better multi regression model 4 the two predictor regression models significantly improve the streamflow prediction fig 10 vs fig 9 particularly for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the relative errors of the d30max and d30p99 models reduced from 50 to 60 to 3 7 for the 1997 2009 prediction and from 20 to 23 to 0 5 1 5 for the 2010 2018 prediction table 8 the nse values for annual streamflow prediction for 2010 2018 improved from 0 44 0 57 to 0 76 0 78 table 8 it needs pointing out that the combination could also potentially decrease the nse and increase the relative errors for some models which already have small relative errors such as d90max and d90p99 for the 2010 2018 period although it significantly improves the streamflow prediction for the 1997 2009 drought period table 8 3 4 3 northeast region the results for the northeast region are mixed fig 11 and generally much more similar to the southeast region than the west region 1 there is not a single regression model developed using 1971 1996 data that met all the criteria for annual streamflow prediction for the subsequent 1997 2009 drought period the number of rainfall days seems to be the best climate variable the top three models are regressed with rd the lowest relative error of 2 6 and a nse 0 48 which is close to 0 5 threshold rd10 the highest nse of 0 80 and the second smallest relative error of 7 9 and rd5 a relative errors of 8 3 and a nse value of 0 69 2 several models developed using 1971 1996 data can predict the 2010 2018 mean annual streamflow to within 5 error and a nse larger than 0 5 these include regression models using effective rainfall accumulated monthly positive difference between rainfall and pet rainpet cool season rainfall m310 m40 and m510 the numbers of rainfall days rd rd10 and rd5 mean length of wet spell mews and multi day rainfall d90max and d90p99 3 the cool season rainfall m410 and m510 is the only variable that underpredicts streamflow for 2010 2018 period and a combination of either m410 or m510 with the other 55 climate variables could potentially reduce the errors in the predicted streamflow for example there are only 11 climate variables with less than 5 predicted relative error for the 2010 2018 streamflow and this number increases to 51 and 52 while combined with m410 and m510 respectively that is almost every climate variable when combined with m410 or m510 could explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought but not during the millennium drought at least in the relative error in the total predicted streamflow but not necessarily the annual streamflow series nse the better performance of the above models than the model based on annual total rainfall ap may imply a seasonal shift in the annual rainfall cycle kiem and verdon kidd 2010 liu et al 2021 potter and chiew 2011 it is also worth mentioning that the combinations of m410 m510 with multiple day rainfall d90max and d90p99 would create a worse regression lower nses and larger relative errors than the multi day rainfall itself 3 5 changes of climate variables before during and after the millennium drought fig 12 summarises the relative differences of the 56 climate variables across the 65 catchments for the 1971 1996 period pro drought compared to the entire 1971 2018 period the annual rainfall and the cool season rainfall m510 m410 and m310 for 1971 1996 are about 5 7 larger than the rainfall averaged over the entire period with a relatively lower pet fig 13 the rainpet in 1971 1996 was about 11 12 larger the mean and maximum wet spells mews and mxws are about 6 and 10 longer and the mean and median dry spells meds are 1 5 2 5 shorter in 1971 1996 period compared to the entire period the number of rainfall days rd is about 5 6 more and the maximum and 99th percentile 90 day accumulated rainfall are about 7 8 larger all these combinations are in favour of higher streamflow generation and accordingly result in the annual streamflow in 1971 1996 being 20 larger than the 1971 2018 mean weighted average across the 65 catchments the reverse is the case when comparing the 1997 2009 millennium drought period against the entire 1971 2018 period fig 14 the annual rainfall and the cool season rainfall m510 m410 and m310 for 1997 2009 is about 12 lower than the rainfall averaged over the entire period with a relative higher pet fig 13 the rainpet in 1997 2009 is about 22 25 lower the mean and maximum wet spells mews and mxws are about 9 5 and 14 shorter and the mean and maximum dry spells meds and mxds are about 6 longer the number of rain days rd is about 10 shorter and the maximum and 99th percentile 90 day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 are about 13 smaller in 1997 2009 compared to 1971 2018 these combine to result in the 1997 2009 streamflow being about 36 lower than the 1971 2018 mean averaged across the 65 catchments fig 15 summarises the relative difference of the 56 climate variables across the 65 catchments for the 2010 2018 post drought period compared to the entire 1971 2018 period one interesting observation is that both the annual rainfall ap and the effective rainfall rainpet for 2010 2018 are about 2 higher than the 1971 2018 mean but the observed annual streamflow for 2010 2018 averaged across the 65 catchments is about 4 lower than the 1971 2018 mean there are several reasons based on regression analysis in the previous sections that may explain this 1 the number of days with rainfall above 1 mm rd which has been identified as one of the most important variables for predicting streamflow over hydroclimate periods with nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship is about 1 1 lower in 2010 2018 than for the entire 1971 2018 period 2 the mean length of wet spell mews which is another important climate variable accounting for the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship is about 4 lower than the 1971 2018 period 3 the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 which also show a strong regression with annual streamflow are also about 3 lower than the entire 1971 2018 period 4 the cool season rainfalls m310 m410 and m510 in 2010 2018 are also below the 1971 2018 mean while the higher annual rainfall in 2010 2018 is expected to result in a higher streamflow each of the above mentioned rainfall characteristics which could result from change weather system dowdy 2020 offsets the influence of the higher annual rainfall and results in a lower streamflow on the other hand the extreme high rainfall for 2010 2018 has increased for example the maximum daily rainfall in 2010 2018 is more than 7 8 higher than for the 1971 2018 entire period the annual rainfall above a daily threshold of 50 mm and the number of days with rainfall above 50 mm in 2010 2018 is 40 45 higher than for the 1971 2018 period this could increase flooding risk the mean of the observed daily maximum streamflow averaged across the 65 catchments in 2010 2018 is actually 16 7 larger than that over the 1971 2018 the climate following the millennium drought in this region has become more extreme that is a higher extreme rainfall and daily maximum streamflow in 2010 2018 combined with a slight increase in 2010 2018 rainfall but still with a smaller 2010 2018 annual streamflow relative to the 1971 2018 mean interestingly this more extreme hydroclimate has been observed dowdy 2020 osburn et al 2021 and predicted by global climate and downscaling models dowdy et al 2019 fu et al 2013 the spatial variations of climate variables make things more complicated for example an overall increase of annual rainfall by 2 varies with a range from 7 to 10 across 65 catchments the cool season rainfall has an even wider range from 14 to 15 and the r50 exhibits a range from 56 5 to 178 4 fig 15 4 applications and limitations this study proposes a framework using simple regression analysis to identify the important climate variables explaining the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship under different hydroclimate conditions i e before during and after the millennium drought the results indicate that the climate variable that has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow during the calibration period may not be the best climate variable to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the methods developed here could be applied to other areas to investigate the relationship between annual streamflow and its controlling factors under different hydroclimate conditions the simple regression model used in this study could be extended into a more complicated rainfall runoff relationship described as a volterra functional series chang et al 2019 or a temporal networks based approach dutta and maity 2020 which is not considered in this study combining this statistical regression study with hydrological modelling will also be useful chu et al 2010 hughes et al 2021 sadegh et al 2019 vaze et al 2010 these analyses could also help identify the best or optimum parameters given the equifinality for hydrological modelling beven 1993 that is to say an acceptable hydrological model can be achieved in many different ways i e different model structure or parameter sets the best parameter set for model calibration period may not be applicable for the validation period if their hydroclimate conditions have changed mathevet et al 2020 which is the case for the catchments considered in this study under changing hydroclimate conditions one major caveat of this current study is that it focuses on climate characteristics only whilst the actual physical hydrological processes might be more complicated such as changes of baseflow and groundwater level due to surface groundwater interaction for example deb et al 2019 demonstrated that endogenous catchment mechanisms i e groundwater table baseflow and vegetation have stronger influences on nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapotranspiration peterson et al 2021 have attributed it to be likely going to increased evapotranspiration per unit of precipitation having said that we did exam a regression variable rainfall on inter annual timescales such as past 2 year rainfall that could be representative of the groundwater state instead of simple annual rainfall however the results indicate that it has a weaker correlation with annual streamflow another caveat is that we focus on annual scale and does not explore the attributions of changes of inter annual cycle several studies e g liu et al 2021 have found that there are changes in rainfall seasonality in this region winter rainfall is becoming more and more unreliable despite an increase in summer rainfall in addition the 56 rainfall and pet statistics used in the regression analysis are not independent in fact many of them are highly correlated to each other especially these statistics in the same group table 3 it could have slightly effects on the two predictor models because they are not necessarily orthogonal however its overall impacts should be limited the streamflow data used for the study come from hydrological reference stations hrs which are well maintained gauges that have long and high quality streamflow records lending themselves to studies like this however data accuracy can still be a concern in specific catchments for example there are a small portion of observed daily streamflow with a quality code of poor data and unreliable data in addition two gauges are excluded from this study because of their abnormal runoff coefficients this is the main reason why this study focusses on aggregated results from 65 catchment and three regions and not at each individual catchment the awap rainfall data are interpolated from a limited number of weather stations so it also has uncertainties especially in the higher elevations where the higher rainfall is extrapolated from stations at lower elevations 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the benefits of the simple statistical analysis to investigate the attributions of climate variables to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship in the state of victoria in southeast australia the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall however the annual streamflow versus annual rainfall relationship can be very different in the different hydroclimate periods the regression model against annual rainfall ap developed using the wet 1971 1996 period significantly overestimated the streamflow in the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the model also cannot predict streamflow in the 2010 2018 post drought period where although the rainfall has recovered the streamflow is still lower than the 1971 2018 mean the number of days with rainfall above 1 mm rd and the mean length of wet spell mews are the two most stable variables that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods this is followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated total rainfall d90max and d90p99 the contributions of the mews to annual streamflow prediction should be emphasised it is the only climate variable to underpredict the annual streamflow in the 2010 2018 post drought period and therefore can be combined with other climate variables to develop a better regression model to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the combination of mews with many other climate variables significantly improved the streamflow prediction particularly during the millennium drought the results differ in the different regions the above variables can model the nonstationarity in the rainfall streamflow relationship in the east but none of the climate variables can model the nonstationarity in the much drier catchments in the west region in fact none of the regression models including multi predictor models developed using the 1971 1996 data can satisfactorily predict streamflow in the subsequent periods in the west in contrast the multi predictor regression models mews rd d30max or d30p99 can satisfactorily predict the annual streamflow in the southeast for the 2010 2018 post drought period and reasonably predict the annual streamflow in the southeast for the 1997 2009 drought period and in the northeast for the 2010 2018 period the relative differences of the climate variables in the different periods can help explain the nonstationary annual streamflow versus annual rainfall relationship the annual rainfall averaged across the 65 catchments in 2010 2018 is 2 2 higher than the 1971 2018 mean but the streamflow is 4 3 lower than the 1971 2018 mean this can be partly explained by the 2010 2018 period having 1 1 less rain days 4 lower mean length of wet spell 3 lower the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated rainfall and 3 less cool season rainfalls m410 and m510 and all of which contribute to a lower streamflow the findings of this study can help identify the key rainfall and climate characteristics to be considered in assessing the impact of climate change and variability on streamflow and water availability and potentially for developing hydrological models and hydroclimate relationships that can be better extrapolated to predict streamflow under a changing climate the methods developed in this study could be easily applied to other catchments in the world to investigate the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship which has been reported in the literature due to both human activities and climate change and

4073,this study demonstrates the benefits of using a simple statistical analysis to investigate the attributions of climate variables to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationships rainfall and streamflow data from 65 catchments in southeast australia are used to quantify the rainfall streamflow relationship prior to during and after the 1997 2009 millennium drought the results showed that 1 the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall however the relationship is different in the different hydroclimate periods 2 the number of rainfall days and the mean length of wet spell mews are the two most stable variables that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated total rainfall d90max and d90p99 3 the combination of mews with several other rainfall characteristics can explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship through the different hydroclimate conditions in the eastern part of the study region and 4 the relative differences in the key rainfall characteristics can help explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the results here can help identify the key rainfall and climate characteristics to be considered in assessing the impacts of climate variability and change on streamflow and potentially for developing hydrological models that can be better extrapolated to predict streamflow under a changing climate keywords climate change and variability hydroclimate nonstationarity statistical analysis millennium drought southeast australia 1 introduction a nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship due to human activity and changing climate has been reported all over the world milly et al 2008 peterson et al 2021 vorosmarty et al 2000 for catchments with limited or no human activities one simple method to explore the impacts of climate change and variability on streamflow is to estimate the precipitation elasticity of streamflow schaake 1990 for example sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 used it to document the precipitation elasticity of streamflow for 1337 basins in the usa showing that a 1 change in precipitation results in a 1 5 2 5 change in basin runoff depending upon the degree of buffering by storage processes and other factors chiew 2006 showed that the rainfall elasticity of streamflow in australia is about 2 0 3 5 the elasticity concept can also be used with the budyko based framework to estimate the impacts of rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet or aridity index and other factors on annual streamflow chen et al 2014 coron et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 however the elasticity or budyko method generally uses mean annual rainfall and or pet to build the relationship with annual streamflow whilst the key climate variables influencing streamflow under nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship could include other climate rainfall characteristics beyond just the mean annual rainfall and pet from 1997 to 2009 southeastern australia including the state of victoria underwent a severe and prolonged dry period referred to as the millennium drought chiew et al 2014 van dijk et al 2013 fig 1 and table 1 shows the rainfall streamflow and their relationships before during and after the millennium drought averaged across 65 catchments in victoria state these differences make it an ideal case study region to explore the attributions of climatic characteristics to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship for example the annual rainfall averaged across the 65 catchments after the millennium drought 2010 2018 is 2 1 larger than long term 1971 2018 mean but its annual streamflow is still 4 3 below the long term mean this less than expected annual streamflow suggests that some rainfall climate or catchment characteristics dowdy 2020 osburn et al 2021 peterson et al 2021 post et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 are potentially more important for streamflow generation than annual rainfall itself understanding the changing rainfall streamflow relationship is not only a scientific challenge but also has implications for numerous modelling and management applications for example water resource planning and management that are based on the stationary rainfall streamflow relationship are likely to overestimate water availability delwp et al 2020 there is also spatial heterogeneity in the rainfall streamflow relationship for example saft et al 2016 showed that landscape slope and humidity can explain 75 of the variance of the rainfall streamflow anomaly during the millennium drought this study explores the influence of rainfall characteristics on the nonstationarity of annual rainfall streamflow relationship using the data before 1971 1996 during 1997 2009 and after 2010 2018 the millennium drought in southeastern australia it needs point out that the term nonstationarity has been widely used in the literature to have different implications koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 have extensively reviewed the history and concept of nonstationarity as well as its philosophical reflections stationarity under change justified use of nonstationary models and stationarity ergodicity and inductive inference from a technical point of view nonstationarity can be defined as differences in the statistical characteristics such as mean variance covariance of a variable or in statistical relationships across space or time rollinson et al 2021 the nonstationarity in the context of this study is simply the same as changing or multi state rainfall streamflow relationship during different time periods hydroclimate conditions i e the same annual rainfall amount would produce different annual streamflow before 1971 1996 during 1997 2009 and after 2010 2018 the millennium drought fig 1 and table 1 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 streamflow data the hydrologic reference stations hrs of the bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au water hrs about shtml in the state of victoria are used in this study fig 2 the 467 hrs were selected from about 4 800 streamflow gauging stations across australia the station selection guideline is a four stage process australian bureau of meteorology 2020 turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 1 identify unregulated catchments with minimal land use change 2 identify gauging stations with high quality streamflow observations and a long period of record greater than 30 years 3 ensure the distribution of streamflow reference stations is spatially representative of all hydroclimate regions in australia 4 consult with relevant agencies in each jurisdiction to review the application of the guidelines there are 67 hrs in victoria with a full record from 1971 to 2018 without any missing data however two catchments are excluded from this study due to an abnormal streamflow coefficient the ratio of streamflow to rainfall being more than 1 5 the areas of these 65 catchments used for this study vary from 5 km2 to 2677 km2 with a median value of 305 km2 and a mean value of 429 km2 the long term 1971 2018 mean annual streamflow ranges from 2 8 gl 28 8 mm to 408 5 gl 904 5 mm with a median streamflow 46 3 gl 177 5 mm and a mean value of 76 5gl 227 2 mm 2 1 2 awap rainfall and pet rainfall from the australian water availability project awap http www csiro au awap a product of the bom and csiro jones et al 2009 is used in this study the 0 05 gridded daily rainfall product was obtained by interpolating rainfall observed at gauging stations across australia the interpolation method uses a two step process beesley et al 2009 interpolation of monthly rainfall climatology using a thin plate smoothed spline and interpolation of anomalies of daily rainfall expressed as a percentage of the climatological rainfall using barnes successive correction method jones et al 2009 the pet within awap database is calculated using the penman 1948 equation the pet provides an upper limit on evaporation and transpiration from the soil and vegetation and depends solely on the available energy at the surface the daily gridded climate datasets used to produce the pet product include daily downward solar irradiance the maximum and minimum air temperatures and relative humidity from the bureau of meteorology jones et al 2009 and long term average windspeed dataset of mcvicar et al 2008 given the spatial heterogeneity these 65 catchments are divided into three groups based on hydroclimate conditions and geographic locations to explore their spatial differences west southeast and northeast catchments fig 2 the catchments in the west and southeast drain into the southeastern australian coast and the catchments in the northeast drain into the murray river there are significant differences in the hydroclimate characteristics of these three groups of catchments table 2 the catchments in the west are the driest with the smallest annual rainfall and streamflow the lowest runoff coefficient about 11 and the largest pet in contrast the northeast catchments are the wettest group with the largest annual rainfall and the highest runoff coefficient about 28 the classification of three group catchments is simply to explore the spatial differences therefore it may not be the best classification results for example the catchments in the north of port phillip bay could easily be moved to the other category based on their geographical locations instead of drainage basin used in this study 2 1 3 climate characteristics based on daily rainfall and pet 56 climate statistics variables are calculated and then used in this study to investigate their relationships with annual streamflow daily catchment average rainfall and pet was computed by area weighted aggregating all the grid cells within the catchment the 56 climate statistics were then computed using the catchment average rainfall and pet the names units and their abbreviations are listed in table 3 2 2 methods the objective of this study is to identify climate variables which are essential for annual streamflow and can be used to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after the millennium drought therefore its application of statistical techniques is different from traditional procedure which is generally to find the best performing model or the best model parameters the statistical analysis in this study comprises the following five steps step 1 a simple least squares linear eq 1 and exponential eq 2 regression is built between annual streamflow and the 56 climate variables for the 1971 1996 datasets before the millennium drought to identify the important climate variables for streamflow generation 1 y a b x 2 y a e b x where y is the annual streamflow in this study x is the climate variable s which can be one or more variables the a and b are parameters to be determined if x is a matrix to have multiple climate variables then b is a vector the reason why it called least squares is that it minimizes the total of the square of the errors since it has only one explanatory variable it is called simple linear or exponential regression the coefficient of determination r2 which is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable annual streamflow that is predictable from the independent variable climate variables is used to evaluate the model performance the r2 has an identical value as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 4 for the calibration period with a regression model a correlation coefficient cor from this linear or exponential regression which is the square root of coefficient of determination is a numerical measure on the strength of the relationship between the response annual streamflow and the explanatory variable climate variables one advantage cor over r2 is that it can show the positive or negative relationship between dependent variable and the predictors step 2 the regression model built in step 1 is used to predict annual streamflow for 1997 2009 the millennium drought and 2010 2018 after the drought two indices are used to examine the performance of the regression model relative error re of mean annual streamflow and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 3 r e 100 1 mean q sim i mean q obs i 4 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i m e a n q obs i 2 where qsim i is the simulated annual streamflow qobs i is the observed annual streamflow and n is the number of years of study period step 3 the regression model in step 1 could be extended into a two predictor regression model depending on the results of step 2 it is expected that a fitted regression in step 1 with pre drought data would overpredict the annual streamflow for the two later periods because of the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship during the three periods fig 1 and table 2 if a regression model developed using data from one climate period e g 1971 1996 in step 1 underpredicts the annual streamflow for the later periods then a natural idea would be to build a two predictor regression model comprising this specific variable and another climate variable there will be three possible outcomes 1 the two predictor regression model performs better than the original one predictor regression model this is an ideal scenario and demonstrates the importance of this specific variable 2 the updated two predictor regression model behaves worse than its original model 3 the result is mixed such as an improved nse and a larger relative error step 4 the steps 1 3 are repeated for the three groups of catchments fig 2 to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the nonstationary rainfall streamflow typology this approach not only is a scientific question related with weather system changes dowdy 2020 but also has practical applications for water resource management and planning step 5 the changes in the climate variables especially those that have been identified as essential for annual streamflow in steps 1 4 are derived and then used to investigate whether they can explain the rainfall streamflow nonstationary relationship before during and after the millennium drought given the rainfall and streamflow anomalies during and after the millennium drought table 2 it is hypothesised that the regression model developed on the 1971 1996 data might perform better at predicting annual streamflow for the wetter 2010 2018 period than the very dry 1997 2009 period therefore slightly different criteria are used to define a good model for these two periods a a regression is defined as a good model for the calibrated period 1971 1996 if its coefficient of determination is larger than 0 8 this is the largest threshold used in the literature from table 2 of moriasi et al 2007 since we are interested in which climate variable directly influences annual streamflow this could be either a linear or exponential regression for one or both b a regression built with 1971 1996 data is defined as a good model for predicting annual streamflow after the millennium drought 2010 2018 if it meets the following two criteria 1 its nse value is larger than 0 7 and 2 its relative error for the mean annual streamflow for the entire 2010 2018 period is within 5 regression models that satisfy these criteria can basically explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought that is why the streamflow is still below the long term mean after the millennium drought while its annual rainfall is above the long term mean value c a regression built with 1971 1996 data is defined as a good model for predicting annual streamflow during the millennium drought 1997 2009 if it meets the following two criteria 1 its nse value is larger than 0 5 which is threshold being considered as a satisfactory model by moriasi et al 2007 and 2 its relative error for the mean annual streamflow for the entire 1997 2009 period is within 5 regression models that satisfy these criteria can basically explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and during the millennium drought that is producing a satisfactory prediction of annual streamflow before and during the millennium drought the goal of this study is to identify climate variables which meet all criteria for a good model described in a b and c above these climatic characteristics are essential for annual streamflow and can be used to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after the millennium drought 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between annual streamflow and climate variables fig 3 shows the correlation coefficients between annual streamflow weighted average across the 65 catchments and the 56 climate variables for 1971 1996 in general the exponential correlation is marginally better than the linear regression for the majority of climate variables table 4 shows the correlation coefficients against climate variables higher than 0 8 the stronger correlated variables with the annual streamflow are explainable from the physical processes of streamflow generation and can be categorised into several groups annual rainfall ap this is expected because the annual total rainfall is usually the most important single climate variable for predicting the annual streamflow although its correlation coefficients are not always the highest among the 56 investigated climate variables table 4 effective rainfall defined as the sum of positive values of the difference between monthly rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rainpet given that rainfall and pet are the two most important variables for streamflow generation fu et al 2007 it is anticipated that their difference is also essential for streamflow however the annual streamflow correlation against ap is consistently higher to some extent than that against rainpet cool seasonal rainfall this can also be expected because most of the streamflow in victoria occurs in winter and early spring the cool season rainfall characteristics are defined here as the total rainfall from march to october m310 from april to october m410 and from may to october m510 total rainfall amount and the number of rainfall days above a certain threshold such as 5 or 10 mm day rd5 rd10 r5 and r10 in fact rd5 has a higher correlation coefficient with annual streamflow than annual rainfall this critical value 5 mm day also showed a strong correlation with groundwater recharge fu et al 2019 this might be related to interception by vegetation and or infiltration into soil that is a rainfall event of 5 mm day or less would be intercepted by vegetation and or infiltrated into dry top layer soil and then evaporated it accordingly does not result in any runoff or groundwater recharge extreme daily rainfall p95 the 95th percentile of daily rainfall has the highest correlation with annual streamflow among the three extreme rainfall indicators used in this study the 99th percentile daily rainfall also has a relatively strong relationship with annual streamflow 0 73 and 0 77 for liner and exponential regressions respectively the maximum daily rainfall correlation with the annual streamflow was relatively weak multi day accumulated rainfall d30max d30p99 d90max and d90p99 the maximum and 99th percentile of multi day accumulated rainfall also have a strong and positive correlation with annual streamflow fig 3 the rainfall accumulations over longer periods 30 and 90 days has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow than the rainfall accumulation over shorter time 3 5 and 7 days the correlation against multi day accumulated rainfall also shows the largest improvement from linear to exponential regression indicating their non linear relationship with annual streamflow dry spell days meds annual streamflow generally has a positive correlation with wet spell and a negative correlation with dry spell fig 3 for both the wet spell and dry spell the mean lengths mews and meds generally have a better correlation with annual streamflow than the maximum lengths mxws and mxds streamflow is generated from multiple rainfall events therefore mean lengths of wet spell and dry spell are more important than the maximum lengths the mean length of dry spell meds is one of top climate variables relating to annual streamflow and has the highest negative correlation coefficient with annual streamflow 3 2 predicted annual streamflow for 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 based on 1971 1996 relationship fig 4 summarises the ability of the regression models developed using 1971 1996 data in predicting the annual streamflow time series for 1997 2009 during the millennium drought and 2010 2018 after the millennium drought the plots show the relative error in the predicted total streamflow and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of predicting annual streamflow series over each of the two periods the results show as probably expected that the regression models developed using data from the wetter 1971 1996 period overpredicted the annual streamflow for the drier future periods the overprediction is much worse for the 1997 2009 millennium drought than for 2010 2018 while the latter is more similar to the 1971 1996 period for example the annual rainfall streamflow linear regression which has a correlation coefficient 0 92 and a nse 0 85 for the 1971 1996 data overestimated the annual streamflow by 27 6 and 17 6 for 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods respectively and their corresponding nse values are 0 06 and 0 58 for predicting the annual streamflow for the 2010 2018 post drought period there is only one good model according to criteria a and b in section 2 2 this is the rd number of days with rainfall above 1 mm linear regression model with a nse 0 73 and a relative error 3 1 for the post drought period this indicates that the rd is the most important climate variable here that can explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the d90max 90 day maximum rainfall and d90p99 99th percentile of 90 day rainfall have the two highest nse of about 0 85 and a relative error 5 0 and 5 1 respectively for the post drought 2010 2018 period the r2 for these two variables are just below 0 8 for the 1971 1996 calibration period the next interesting variable is the mean length of wet spell mews which has a relative error of about 5 and a reasonable nse value of 0 5 the mews is also the only variable to underestimate the annual streamflow for this period this could imply its importance in possibly combining it with other climate variables to produce a better multi regression model with two climate variables there are several other variables with a reasonable nse of greater than 0 5 a satisfactory model based on moriasi et al 2007 but a large relative error such as m310 nse 0 67 and re 10 7 m410 nse 0 50 and re 6 3 son nse 0 53 and re 8 2 rd5 nse 0 67 and re 11 5 rd10 nse 0 56 and re 14 0 and rainpet nse 0 67 and re 11 5 for predicting the annual streamflow for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period there is not a single regression model developed using the 1971 1996 data that could predict the annual streamflow during the 1997 2009 based on criteria c in section 2 2 the best performing model for the millennium drought is the linear regression model with the mean length of wet spell mews which has a relative error of 1 3 and a nse of 0 48 just slightly lower than the threshold of 0 5 the combination of this finding with its performance for the 2010 2018 period above implies that the mews might be an important variable for predicting streamflow through nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationships in a changing climate for our study region the second best model is the linear regression model with the number of rainfall days above 1 mm rd with a relative error of 9 1 and a nse of 0 53 these are only two models with a relative error smaller than 10 and a nse around 0 5 most models have a negative nse indicating that apart from mews and rd regression models developed against other rainfall characteristics using the wet 1971 1996 period overpredict the annual streamflow during the millennium drought in summary rd and mews appear to be the two most important variables to regress with annual streamflow as a single predictor model to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before during and after millennium drought the use of mews the only variable that underpredicts annual streamflow for two latter periods as a predictor variable in a multi predictor regression model can improve streamflow prediction over different hydroclimate periods 3 3 two predictor regression model to predict annual streamflow fig 5 compares the r2 from single climate variable 55 climate variables and two climate variables each of the 55 climate variables plus mews for both linear and exponential regression with annual streamflow for the 1971 1996 period again using the weighted average values from the 65 catchments the horizonal dashed blue line is the r2 for mews which is the compulsory climate variable and the r2 of the correlation against two variables would be larger or equal to it the results show that the coefficients of determination for some of the two variable regression models have a clear increase while others are unchanged or show only a slight improvement although the increase in r2 in the 1971 1996 calibration is relatively modest fig 5 the two predictor regression model significantly improved the annual streamflow prediction for the subsequent period this improvement is clearly evident comparing the results for the two predictor model in fig 6 against the results for the one predictor model in fig 4 the relative error in the two predictor models have improved by more than 20 and almost all the nse values in the two predictor models are now positive table 5 shows the six two predictor regression models meeting criteria a and b in section 2 2 and fig 7 is an example of the observed streamflow vs the predicted streamflow based on two variable regression models both linear and exponential models this is a significant improvement because there is only one single predictor model rd that met these criteria the best results come from the combination of mews with d90p99 and d90max with nse for annual streamflow prediction of 0 6 in 1997 2009 and 0 87 in 2010 2018 and relatively small errors of about 5 in 1997 2009 and 3 in 2010 2018 table 5 it is not surprising that the combination of rd and mews is the best model in terms of relative error 0 6 to predict annual streamflow for the periods 2010 2018 because they are the two most important variables from the single predictor regression analysis in the previous section table 5 and fig 7 their linear regression model could also explain 57 of variance during the millennium drought 1997 2009 with a relative error of 3 9 although the exponential regression models showed better results compared with their respective linear regression models in the calibration period 1971 1996 as shown in section 3 1 the linear regression model consistently gives better predictions of streamflow in 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 sections 3 2 and 3 3 this is because the value of explanatory climate variables in the prediction period can fall outside the range of the calibration period and the linear regression is more conservative than the exponential regression leading to smaller errors when the model is extrapolated beyond the data range used in calibration figs 6 and 7 table 5 this is also the case for future rainfall predictions iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2020 that the fitted linear trends produce larger prediction errors than the simpler mean models the contribution of the mews to annual streamflow should be emphasised the mews itself is not one of the most important climate variables for streamflow generation but its combination with other climate variables can help explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship for example the combination of rd and mews only explains the same percentage 84 of variance as a single variable rd linear regression against annual streamflow in the model calibration but it reduces the relative error in the streamflow prediction from 9 1 to 3 9 and improves nse from 0 53 to 0 57 for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period and from 3 1 to 0 6 and nse from 0 73 to 0 74 for the 2010 2018 post drought period table 6 another example is the annual rainfall ap which itself cannot explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the combination of ap and mews only slightly improves the 1971 1996 calibration r2 but it reduces the relative error from 27 6 to 10 0 and increases the nse from 0 06 to 0 55 for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period and from 17 6 to 8 7 and nse from 0 58 to 0 80 for the 2010 2018 post drought period 3 4 spatial differences of rainfall streamflow relationship table 7 shows the ranking of the top 20 climate variables with the highest correlation r2 against annual streamflow weighted average over the entire 1971 2018 period for the entire 65 catchments as well as for the catchments in each of the three regions the rankings for the three regions are relatively similar with the key differences described below 1 the annual rainfall ap has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow in the southeast and northeast regions which are relatively wetter regions with a higher annual rainfall and runoff coefficient table 2 the annual rainfall is the 3rd for linear regression and 5th for exponential regression ranked variable in the drier west region 2 in the drier west region the number of rainfall days above 1 0 mm rd has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow 3 the cold season rainfall m310 m410 and m510 generally has a higher rank in west than in the southeast and northeast table 7 4 the multi day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow in the west and southeast regions than that in the northeast region 5 the magnitudes of the highest ranked correlation coefficients are similar in the three regions 0 90 0 94 but the lowest one in the west 0 59 can be quite different to those in the southeast 0 69 0 72 and northeast 0 70 0 73 table 7 it is also interesting to note that the mean length of wet spell mews has a stronger correlation with annual streamflow than the mean length of dry spell meds for the full study period 1971 2018 which is opposite of that for the 1971 1996 pre drought period section 3 1 the regression models calibrated against 1971 1996 data show different skills in predicting the streamflow for the 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods in the three different regions and these are summarised in figs 8 11 and discussed below 3 4 1 west region for catchments in the west region fig 8 the calibrated regressions against 1971 1996 data do not show any skills in predicting the annual streamflow for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the smallest relative error in the predicted annual streamflow is 41 8 from the linear regression model against rd and all nse values for prediction using the 56 climate variables are negative this is likely due to that the rainfall streamflow relationship during the 1997 2009 period has changed significantly from the 1971 1996 period the mean annual rainfall averaged over the 18 catchments in the west for 1997 2009 is about 10 5 lower than the 1971 2018 mean and this is similar for the other two regions but the mean annual streamflow for 1997 2009 is 52 5 less than the 1971 2018 mean and significantly lower than the other two regions the calibrated regressions against 1971 1996 data show better skill in predicting the annual streamflow for the wetter 2010 2018 period nevertheless none of the prediction skill satisfy criteria a and b in section 2 2 the best performed models are the linear regression models with either rd the highest nse or mews the lowest relative error the rd regression model has a nse of 0 56 and a relative error of 9 7 the mews linear regression model has a relative error of 0 6 and a nse of 0 42 these results indicate that for catchments in the west region the rd and mews may show some skills in explaining the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought but their nses both rd and mews are too low or relative errors are too large rd to be considered as a acceptable model a major difference between the west region and the entire study region fig 8 vs fig 4 is that all regression models against the climate variables result in an overprediction of annual streamflow for 2010 2018 as a result the two predictors regression model could not significantly reduce the predicted error for example a combination of these two best predictors results in a regression model having a relative error of 4 1 which is roughly half way between their individual regression model i e 0 6 mews and 8 4 rd its corresponding nse value is 0 57 which is almost the same as single predictor rd regression model 3 4 2 southeast region the overall results for the southeast region fig 9 are similar with those for the entire study region 1 the 1971 1996 calibration against the mean length of wet spell mews is the best performed model in predicting the 1997 2009 annual streamflow with a relative error of 3 7 and a nse of 0 50 it is also the only predictor to meet the selected criteria 2 the 1971 1996 calibrations against multi day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 produce the best performed models in predicting the 2010 2018 annual streamflow with a relative error of less than 1 5 and a nse of around 0 75 the rd on the other hand could yield a similar magnitude of relative error 1 3 5 1 but with a much smaller nse 0 45 0 47 3 the mews is the only predictor to underpredict the annual streamflow for both the 1997 2009 and 2010 2018 periods which supports the hypothesis that a combination of mews with other climate variables should produce a better multi regression model 4 the two predictor regression models significantly improve the streamflow prediction fig 10 vs fig 9 particularly for the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the relative errors of the d30max and d30p99 models reduced from 50 to 60 to 3 7 for the 1997 2009 prediction and from 20 to 23 to 0 5 1 5 for the 2010 2018 prediction table 8 the nse values for annual streamflow prediction for 2010 2018 improved from 0 44 0 57 to 0 76 0 78 table 8 it needs pointing out that the combination could also potentially decrease the nse and increase the relative errors for some models which already have small relative errors such as d90max and d90p99 for the 2010 2018 period although it significantly improves the streamflow prediction for the 1997 2009 drought period table 8 3 4 3 northeast region the results for the northeast region are mixed fig 11 and generally much more similar to the southeast region than the west region 1 there is not a single regression model developed using 1971 1996 data that met all the criteria for annual streamflow prediction for the subsequent 1997 2009 drought period the number of rainfall days seems to be the best climate variable the top three models are regressed with rd the lowest relative error of 2 6 and a nse 0 48 which is close to 0 5 threshold rd10 the highest nse of 0 80 and the second smallest relative error of 7 9 and rd5 a relative errors of 8 3 and a nse value of 0 69 2 several models developed using 1971 1996 data can predict the 2010 2018 mean annual streamflow to within 5 error and a nse larger than 0 5 these include regression models using effective rainfall accumulated monthly positive difference between rainfall and pet rainpet cool season rainfall m310 m40 and m510 the numbers of rainfall days rd rd10 and rd5 mean length of wet spell mews and multi day rainfall d90max and d90p99 3 the cool season rainfall m410 and m510 is the only variable that underpredicts streamflow for 2010 2018 period and a combination of either m410 or m510 with the other 55 climate variables could potentially reduce the errors in the predicted streamflow for example there are only 11 climate variables with less than 5 predicted relative error for the 2010 2018 streamflow and this number increases to 51 and 52 while combined with m410 and m510 respectively that is almost every climate variable when combined with m410 or m510 could explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship before and after the millennium drought but not during the millennium drought at least in the relative error in the total predicted streamflow but not necessarily the annual streamflow series nse the better performance of the above models than the model based on annual total rainfall ap may imply a seasonal shift in the annual rainfall cycle kiem and verdon kidd 2010 liu et al 2021 potter and chiew 2011 it is also worth mentioning that the combinations of m410 m510 with multiple day rainfall d90max and d90p99 would create a worse regression lower nses and larger relative errors than the multi day rainfall itself 3 5 changes of climate variables before during and after the millennium drought fig 12 summarises the relative differences of the 56 climate variables across the 65 catchments for the 1971 1996 period pro drought compared to the entire 1971 2018 period the annual rainfall and the cool season rainfall m510 m410 and m310 for 1971 1996 are about 5 7 larger than the rainfall averaged over the entire period with a relatively lower pet fig 13 the rainpet in 1971 1996 was about 11 12 larger the mean and maximum wet spells mews and mxws are about 6 and 10 longer and the mean and median dry spells meds are 1 5 2 5 shorter in 1971 1996 period compared to the entire period the number of rainfall days rd is about 5 6 more and the maximum and 99th percentile 90 day accumulated rainfall are about 7 8 larger all these combinations are in favour of higher streamflow generation and accordingly result in the annual streamflow in 1971 1996 being 20 larger than the 1971 2018 mean weighted average across the 65 catchments the reverse is the case when comparing the 1997 2009 millennium drought period against the entire 1971 2018 period fig 14 the annual rainfall and the cool season rainfall m510 m410 and m310 for 1997 2009 is about 12 lower than the rainfall averaged over the entire period with a relative higher pet fig 13 the rainpet in 1997 2009 is about 22 25 lower the mean and maximum wet spells mews and mxws are about 9 5 and 14 shorter and the mean and maximum dry spells meds and mxds are about 6 longer the number of rain days rd is about 10 shorter and the maximum and 99th percentile 90 day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 are about 13 smaller in 1997 2009 compared to 1971 2018 these combine to result in the 1997 2009 streamflow being about 36 lower than the 1971 2018 mean averaged across the 65 catchments fig 15 summarises the relative difference of the 56 climate variables across the 65 catchments for the 2010 2018 post drought period compared to the entire 1971 2018 period one interesting observation is that both the annual rainfall ap and the effective rainfall rainpet for 2010 2018 are about 2 higher than the 1971 2018 mean but the observed annual streamflow for 2010 2018 averaged across the 65 catchments is about 4 lower than the 1971 2018 mean there are several reasons based on regression analysis in the previous sections that may explain this 1 the number of days with rainfall above 1 mm rd which has been identified as one of the most important variables for predicting streamflow over hydroclimate periods with nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship is about 1 1 lower in 2010 2018 than for the entire 1971 2018 period 2 the mean length of wet spell mews which is another important climate variable accounting for the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship is about 4 lower than the 1971 2018 period 3 the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated rainfall d90max and d90p99 which also show a strong regression with annual streamflow are also about 3 lower than the entire 1971 2018 period 4 the cool season rainfalls m310 m410 and m510 in 2010 2018 are also below the 1971 2018 mean while the higher annual rainfall in 2010 2018 is expected to result in a higher streamflow each of the above mentioned rainfall characteristics which could result from change weather system dowdy 2020 offsets the influence of the higher annual rainfall and results in a lower streamflow on the other hand the extreme high rainfall for 2010 2018 has increased for example the maximum daily rainfall in 2010 2018 is more than 7 8 higher than for the 1971 2018 entire period the annual rainfall above a daily threshold of 50 mm and the number of days with rainfall above 50 mm in 2010 2018 is 40 45 higher than for the 1971 2018 period this could increase flooding risk the mean of the observed daily maximum streamflow averaged across the 65 catchments in 2010 2018 is actually 16 7 larger than that over the 1971 2018 the climate following the millennium drought in this region has become more extreme that is a higher extreme rainfall and daily maximum streamflow in 2010 2018 combined with a slight increase in 2010 2018 rainfall but still with a smaller 2010 2018 annual streamflow relative to the 1971 2018 mean interestingly this more extreme hydroclimate has been observed dowdy 2020 osburn et al 2021 and predicted by global climate and downscaling models dowdy et al 2019 fu et al 2013 the spatial variations of climate variables make things more complicated for example an overall increase of annual rainfall by 2 varies with a range from 7 to 10 across 65 catchments the cool season rainfall has an even wider range from 14 to 15 and the r50 exhibits a range from 56 5 to 178 4 fig 15 4 applications and limitations this study proposes a framework using simple regression analysis to identify the important climate variables explaining the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship under different hydroclimate conditions i e before during and after the millennium drought the results indicate that the climate variable that has the strongest correlation with annual streamflow during the calibration period may not be the best climate variable to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the methods developed here could be applied to other areas to investigate the relationship between annual streamflow and its controlling factors under different hydroclimate conditions the simple regression model used in this study could be extended into a more complicated rainfall runoff relationship described as a volterra functional series chang et al 2019 or a temporal networks based approach dutta and maity 2020 which is not considered in this study combining this statistical regression study with hydrological modelling will also be useful chu et al 2010 hughes et al 2021 sadegh et al 2019 vaze et al 2010 these analyses could also help identify the best or optimum parameters given the equifinality for hydrological modelling beven 1993 that is to say an acceptable hydrological model can be achieved in many different ways i e different model structure or parameter sets the best parameter set for model calibration period may not be applicable for the validation period if their hydroclimate conditions have changed mathevet et al 2020 which is the case for the catchments considered in this study under changing hydroclimate conditions one major caveat of this current study is that it focuses on climate characteristics only whilst the actual physical hydrological processes might be more complicated such as changes of baseflow and groundwater level due to surface groundwater interaction for example deb et al 2019 demonstrated that endogenous catchment mechanisms i e groundwater table baseflow and vegetation have stronger influences on nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapotranspiration peterson et al 2021 have attributed it to be likely going to increased evapotranspiration per unit of precipitation having said that we did exam a regression variable rainfall on inter annual timescales such as past 2 year rainfall that could be representative of the groundwater state instead of simple annual rainfall however the results indicate that it has a weaker correlation with annual streamflow another caveat is that we focus on annual scale and does not explore the attributions of changes of inter annual cycle several studies e g liu et al 2021 have found that there are changes in rainfall seasonality in this region winter rainfall is becoming more and more unreliable despite an increase in summer rainfall in addition the 56 rainfall and pet statistics used in the regression analysis are not independent in fact many of them are highly correlated to each other especially these statistics in the same group table 3 it could have slightly effects on the two predictor models because they are not necessarily orthogonal however its overall impacts should be limited the streamflow data used for the study come from hydrological reference stations hrs which are well maintained gauges that have long and high quality streamflow records lending themselves to studies like this however data accuracy can still be a concern in specific catchments for example there are a small portion of observed daily streamflow with a quality code of poor data and unreliable data in addition two gauges are excluded from this study because of their abnormal runoff coefficients this is the main reason why this study focusses on aggregated results from 65 catchment and three regions and not at each individual catchment the awap rainfall data are interpolated from a limited number of weather stations so it also has uncertainties especially in the higher elevations where the higher rainfall is extrapolated from stations at lower elevations 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the benefits of the simple statistical analysis to investigate the attributions of climate variables to the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship in the state of victoria in southeast australia the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall however the annual streamflow versus annual rainfall relationship can be very different in the different hydroclimate periods the regression model against annual rainfall ap developed using the wet 1971 1996 period significantly overestimated the streamflow in the 1997 2009 millennium drought period the model also cannot predict streamflow in the 2010 2018 post drought period where although the rainfall has recovered the streamflow is still lower than the 1971 2018 mean the number of days with rainfall above 1 mm rd and the mean length of wet spell mews are the two most stable variables that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods this is followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated total rainfall d90max and d90p99 the contributions of the mews to annual streamflow prediction should be emphasised it is the only climate variable to underpredict the annual streamflow in the 2010 2018 post drought period and therefore can be combined with other climate variables to develop a better regression model to explain the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship the combination of mews with many other climate variables significantly improved the streamflow prediction particularly during the millennium drought the results differ in the different regions the above variables can model the nonstationarity in the rainfall streamflow relationship in the east but none of the climate variables can model the nonstationarity in the much drier catchments in the west region in fact none of the regression models including multi predictor models developed using the 1971 1996 data can satisfactorily predict streamflow in the subsequent periods in the west in contrast the multi predictor regression models mews rd d30max or d30p99 can satisfactorily predict the annual streamflow in the southeast for the 2010 2018 post drought period and reasonably predict the annual streamflow in the southeast for the 1997 2009 drought period and in the northeast for the 2010 2018 period the relative differences of the climate variables in the different periods can help explain the nonstationary annual streamflow versus annual rainfall relationship the annual rainfall averaged across the 65 catchments in 2010 2018 is 2 2 higher than the 1971 2018 mean but the streamflow is 4 3 lower than the 1971 2018 mean this can be partly explained by the 2010 2018 period having 1 1 less rain days 4 lower mean length of wet spell 3 lower the maximum and 99th percentile of 90 day accumulated rainfall and 3 less cool season rainfalls m410 and m510 and all of which contribute to a lower streamflow the findings of this study can help identify the key rainfall and climate characteristics to be considered in assessing the impact of climate change and variability on streamflow and water availability and potentially for developing hydrological models and hydroclimate relationships that can be better extrapolated to predict streamflow under a changing climate the methods developed in this study could be easily applied to other catchments in the world to investigate the nonstationary rainfall streamflow relationship which has been reported in the literature due to both human activities and climate change and

4074,understanding hillslope scale surface runoff generation processes are challenging due to the non linear interactions among the different hydro meteorological variables often the complex connection between different hydrologic variables is little understood i e the spatial temporal connection among the same variable and between two different variables therefore in this paper we present a network theory based approach to understand the complex connections of hydrological processes the article mainly focuses on identifying runoff thresholds in grassed ga and agro forested agf hillslopes and on testing of suitability of network theory for explaining the hillslope hydrological processes after analyzing 22 rainfall events of agf and 37 events from ga hillslope our findings highlight that the runoff generation is associated with the peak rainfall intensity initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall duration the runoff thresholds of ga hillslope are higher than the agf hillslope due to its surface resistance and presence of extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity 6 mm h at the upslope location further from network analysis we found that the network s topology was highly dependent on event characteristics and soil hydraulic conductivity the strong network connectivity was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes during high runoff generating events as the runoff and infiltration take place simultaneously however during the low runoff generating events a weak connection was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes as most rainwater infiltrates over the hillslope the outcomes of this study indicate the usefulness of network theory in hillslope scale runoff process understanding to identify the significant connections keywords runoff thresholds lesser himalayan hillslopes network theory clustering coefficient soil moisture 1 introduction identification of various thresholds associated with surface runoff is very critical to understand the multiple hydrological processes at different spatial and temporal scales the non linear behaviour of soil moisture and rainfall influence the hillslope runoff generation mechanism and its thresholds radatz et al 2013 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld mcdonnell 2006 these thresholds can be used as a suitable index for comparing runoff generation process of different landscapes moreover this can also be used in model calibration and validation by grouping the equivalent runoff responses graham mcdonnell 2010 thresholds controlling hillslope runoff have been studied widely in subsurface storm flow and saturation excess se dominanted hillslopes especially in western countries and australia detty mcguire 2010 radatz et al 2013 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld mcdonnell 2006 western et al 1998 antecedent wetness condition and rainfall plays a major role in identifying the runoff threshold at saturation excess dominanted alpine headwater catchment italy penna et al 2011 the same findings are also observed by the western et al 1998 in tarrawarra catchment of south eastern australia by saffarpour et al 2016 in the lang lang river catchment australia and by radatz et al 2013 in southwestern wisconsin agricultural watersheds of usa though thresholds are very useful tool to analyse the hydrological processes no study has addressed this issue in the indian himalayan region region nanda et al 2018 found infiltration excess ie is the dominant process in two lesser himalayan plots and hillslopes during artificial and natural rainfall conditions while the thresholds in saturation excess runoff dominant overland flow have received wide attention the effect of initial soil moisture condition varying rainfall intensity and duration on hillslope runoff in infiltration excess dominated regions are less studied sarkar et al 2015 carried out runoff generation study in vegetative hillslope plot of the brahmaputra river basin and they observed the dominance of infiltration excess process they also concluded that the rainfall depth rainfall duration peak rainfall intensity and antecedent moisture condition are major overland flow controlling factor however martínez mena et al 1998 stated about the control of peak rainfall intensity on infiltration excess surface runoff in semi arid mediterranean micro catchments moreover cammeraat 2004 studied various runoff thresholds i e vegetation type surface roughness rainfall characteristics depth duration and intensity in a semi arid catchment of spain thus in this study the threshold concept was used to determine various triggers for hillslope runoff generation in the lesser himalayan region different components of the hydrological processes are either direct indirect or forward backwards related with each other sivakumar 2014 some of these connections are more significant than others and determine the dynamics of hydrological processes for example in a soil moisture network some soil moisture points are more significantly connected with runoff than others these connections which are dependent on rainfall and soil moisture characteristics vary in both spatial and temporal domains the detailed understanding of type and extent of connections remains a challenge in hydrology even after developing large numbers of models and mathematical theories sivakumar 2014 inherent complexities of the hydrological processes in micro to macro scale hydrological systems insufficient data availability and absence of a suitable method to study these complex connections are some of the reasons behind this lack of scientific development in this context network theory is a beneficial tool to deal with all kinds of hydrological connections sivakumar 2014 the applicability of network theory is vast in different dimensions of research such as transportation hydrology climate science ecology communication and sociology halverson and fleming 2015 in hydrology the application of complex network theory was initiated for river networks and precipitation and streamflow monitoring network agarwal et al 2020 boers et al 2013 rinaldo et al 2006 scarsoglio et al 2013 these studies discussed the optimum number of gauging stations spatial and temporal connections of these monitoring networks and their relationship with terrain conditions network theory has also been used to study the hydro climatic extremes like drought konapala mishra 2017 community detection halverson and fleming 2015 and teleconnections moreover many previous studies used the unweighted network type same weight assign to each link to understand the streamflow sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 and rainfall jha et al 2015 dynamics but in a natural system connections generally have different weights such as some connections are stronger while other are weaker therefore the weighted network can help us to better understand the network connections and strength network theory can also be used to study the direct or indirect connections between different components of the hydrological cycle i e precipitation surface flow infiltration subsurface flow like groundwater flow interflow and baseflow sivakumar 2014 however the use of network theory for a detailed understanding of the hydrological cycle and processes is still in its nascent phase very few studies related to network theory have been conducted to understand the linkage among different components of runoff generation process however network theory has also been used in the field of sediment routing and connectivity and channel networks marra et al 2014 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 phillips et al 2011 used the network theory to understand the hydrological connectivity among 11 sub watersheds where the sub watersheds and stream reaches were presented as the nodes and edges of the network masselink et al 2017 applied the graph theory to understand the overland flow connectivity using high resolution digital elevation model dem and dense networks of overland flow sensors but we have used the spatial network of soil moisture sensors instead of overland flow sensors thus we used infiltration pattern of rain water over the hillslope to identify the runoff generating areas zuecco et al 2019 used the graph theory for quantifying the subsurface hydrologic connectivity between groundwater level and streamflow but they did not consider the influence of rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition on network structure further they have not examined the influence of these variables on the inherent network structure characteristics considering the above discussion this study tries to answer the following research questions i what are the key factors that influence the runoff generation thresholds for infiltration excess dominated landscapes ii can network theory explain the connection between soil moisture and runoff iii how various rainfall events influence the network structure and its characteristics the first part of this paper focuses on thresholds related to lesser himalayan hillslopes the second part used the network theory for hillslope scale process understanding especially to analyse the connection between runoff and soil moisture during different rainfall events further the dependency of network properties on event characteristics were also examined in the current study this study has two key novelties 1 the analysis of thresholds controlling the runoff generation for two different lesser himalayan hillslopes and 2 this is the first application of network theory to understand the connection between soil moisture and runoff for different runoff generating groups hillslope scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental hillslopes are located in the aglar river watershed of tehri garhwal district uttarakhand india fig 1 the grassed ga and agro forested agf hillslopes are located at the south and north aspect of the watershed respectively the elevations of ga and agf hillslope are 1267 m and 1142 m climate of the study area is subtropical highland climate according to koppen climate classification and the area receives 75 of the rainfall during the monsoon june september the ga hillslope is dominated with native grasses however the 60 area of agf hillslope is covered with fallow land and rest of area is covered with some medicinal and fruit trees like grewia optiva bombax ceiba rubus ellipticus sm the hillslopes are kept undisturbed e g no human interventions and grazing for studied period tables 1 and 2 the seasonal variation in daily average soil moisture and soil temperature are between 0 10 m3 m3 to 0 15 m3 m3 and 6 c to 27 c respectively at agf hillslope however the daily average soil temperature of ga hillslope i e 11 c to 29 c is higher due to southern aspect nanda et al 2020 the seasonal variation in daily averaged soil moisture is varied between 0 10 m3 m3 to 0 20 m3 m3 at ga hillslope slope based on a digital elevation model with a 0 5 m resolution is 20 7 for agf hillslope and 14 4 for ga hillslope infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant runoff mechanism 2 2 hydro meteorological data the hillslopes were instrumented with an hs flume with capacitance based odyssey water level sensor to measure the hillslope runoff the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture was recorded by decagon 5tm meter environment usa and odyssey dataflow systems ltd new zealand soil moisture sensors at 15 20 cm below the ground surface the rainfall depth was recorded using tipping bucket rain gauges at each hillslope rainwise inc usa all the hydrological variables were logged at 5 min intervals both the hillslopes were divided into three soil conductivity zones i low conductivity zones 10 mm h ii medium conductivity zones 10 15 mm h and iii high conductivity zones 15 mm h the low medium and high conductivity zones cover 63 22 and 14 areas in ga hillslope respectively similarly for agf hillslope 45 36 and 19 of total hillslope area are covered by low medium and high conductivity zones respectively these zones were classified by conducting unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity experiments using a mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices inc pullman wa nanda et al 2019 the detailed description of hydraulic conductivity experiments is provided in the supplementary document the hydro meteorological i e runoff soil moisture and rainfall data have been collected since june 2017 we used two years of datasets for ga hillslope 2017 2018 and one year of the dataset for agf hillslope 2017 for analyzing runoff thresholds 2 3 rainfall and runoff events the rainfall events were defined as an event with total rainfall amount and peak 5 min rainfall intensity greater than equal to 5 mm and 4 mm h respectively in total 22 rainfall runoff events for the agf hillslope and 37 events for the ga hillslope to determine the runoff threshold initial soil moisture is the average of all soil moisture sensors at the 5 min time step just before rain started 2 4 network theory a network graph consists of a set of vertices nodes that are connected by links edges we used the runoff and soil moisture sensor points and represented connection between them as links or edges fig 2 the pictorial form of the network was created after calculating the two dimensional adjacency matrix m m each value of the adjacency matrix indicates the existence and nonexistence of links between any two nodes fig 2 a shows the simplest unweighted network graph which is generated using the adjacency matrix as shown in fig 2 b the unweighted blue star in a matrix cell represents the presence of links or edges whereas the void cells illustrate no link condition between two nodes thus the binary representation can be used in the adjacency matrix of unweighted network graph for showing the presence or absence of link in the current study we have used the weighted network graph as shown in fig 2 c the adjacency matrix of a weighted network structure is different from the unweighted graph fig 2d instead of the same colored star three different colored stars are used in this matrix to represent different weights which are reflected in the form of edge thickness in network structure fig 2c the pearson correlation c was calculated among all the hillslope hydrological nodes soil moisture and runoff nodes the network graph was created once the correlation value exceeds the threshold correlation ct value the weighted adjacency matrix of hillslope mw can be represented as m w c i f c c t 0 o t h e r w i s e the nonzero values of the adjacency matrix represent the connection between the two nodes whereas zero represents no connection between the two nodes for creating the network structure and to calculate clustering coefficient the selection of ct plays a vital role we have followed the below mentioned steps for estimating the ct for all the selected rainfall events the connections between spatial soil moisture pattern and runoff were examined by linear cross correlation analysis the average correlation was computed for that node jha et al 2015 used an approach where they tested the network structure for cts varying from 0 1 to 0 9 and the correlation value at which the network showed significant change between the connections of nodes was selected as ct for their study we used a similar approach where we checked the network structure for different events for all the ct values ranging between 0 1 and 0 9 to identify the correlation threshold as the network was developed for infiltration excess dominated hillslope stronger network connection i e represented by thick edge between soil moisture node and runoff node represents either simultaneous increase or decrease in soil moisture and runoff for example during a high runoff generating events the soil moisture node which has strong correlation with runoff node indicates less runoff and more infiltration from that particular patch and vice versa however weak connection represents opposite behavior in soil moisture and runoff it can also be observed for high runoff generating events that the soil moisture which has weaker network connectivity i e represented by thin edge with runoff node represents the high runoff and less infiltration for that particular soil moisture patch 2 4 1 clustering coefficient this is the most fundamental characteristic of a complex network networks often contain clusters among the nodes and to measure the local density of these nodes the clustering coefficient has been widely used in many studies sivakumar 2014 konapala and mishra 2017 the clustering coefficient is computed at the local node level as well as at the network level also consider the i th node in the network which has links to other neighboring k i nodes if all these k i nodes are interconnected and form a cluster then there would be total k i k i 1 2 links between them therefore the local clustering coefficient at the node i is defined as the ratio between the actual links e i in the cluster and maximum possible links in the cluster k i k i 1 2 cc i e i k i k i 1 the global clustering coefficient gcc is defined as the average of all local clustering coefficients cc the gcc in the current study represents the total cohesiveness among the runoff and soil moisture nodes and this study examines how the gcc varies during different hydrological and meteorological conditions the cc values indicate the strength of the connections of individual nodes to other nodes the network analysis was performed in r using the igraph package csárdi nepusz 2006 3 results 3 1 runoff thresholds we analyzed four different runoff thresholds rainfall depth rainfall intensity rainfall duration and initial soil moisture conditions the higher intensity rainfall events had generally a short duration fig 3 for example the longer duration rainfall events 10 h had an average rainfall intensity 5 mm h and the peak rainfall intensity 50 mm h for event with a duration 10 h the average rainfall intensity was between 5 mm h and 10 mm h similarly the higher average rainfall intensity 10 mm h events generally had a rainfall duration 7 5 h the influence of total event rainfall and 5 min peak intensity on hillslope runoff is presented in fig 4 which represents the total event runoff as a dependent variable of event rainfall depth and the peak rainfall intensity is shown by colors the higher rainfall intensity event results in a larger amount of total rainfall total event runoff depth was found to be 0 25 mm while the total event rainfall was 25 mm fig 4 events larger than 50 mm could produce more than 0 25 mm runoff similarly the event produces runoff 1 mm only occurred when event rainfall is 100 mm overall it can be concluded that the total runoff increases with increase in rainfall depth runoff depth is strongly associated with the rainfall depth having correlation value 0 65 further it can be seen from fig 4b that two events produced total runoff 0 25 mm even when the total rainfall is greater than 50 mm and peak rainfall intensity is greater than 50 mm h these results may be due to either low initial soil moisture condition or short rainfall duration the above observation from fig 3 highlights that not only rainfall intensity but also rainfall duration and soil moisture condition have control over runoff thresholds further we have plotted multi variable graph for both ga and agf hillslopes to understand the combined effects of these variables on hillslope runoff thresholds of hillslope runoff mechanism is plotted in fig 5 as mentioned by nanda et al 2019 ga and agf possess different initial soil moisture condition surface resistance and hence show diverse hillslope response thus the combine impact of three factors on runoff thresholds were analyzed in fig 5 a and b for agf and ga hillslope respectively the initial soil moisture condition and 5 min peak rainfall intensity is plotted on x axis and y axis respectively whereas the colour of the triangular points represents the rainfall duration and the size of the triangle shows the runoff coefficient rc value factors controlling the agf hillslope runoff threshold are grouped into three categories group i events are significant runoff generating events these events generally converted more than 0 4 of rainfall to runoff when a peak rainfall intensity was greater than 12 mm h and the initial soil moisture content was greater than 0 200 m3 m3 however some events in group i which had more than 0 7 rc were observed to have the peak intensity 35 mm h but one exception was also observed i e very negligible amount of runoff was generated on 28 08 2017 as the event rainfall duration was quite less 1 55 h this shorter duration rainfall cannot satisfy the infiltration capacity of soil thus was not able to generate the runoff for group ii events either no runoff or extreme low runoff was produced rc 0 1 when the initial soil moisture content was 0 200 m3 m3 and peak rainfall intensity 35 mm h in contrast rc of 0 43 was recorded on 23 09 2017 event due to longer rainfall duration of 20 16 h but it is worth to notice that the runoff was only generated for the time steps when the rainfall intensity was greater than 20 mm h i e greater than soil hydraulic conductivity fig s5 this longer duration rainfall is satisfying the infiltration capacity of soil even if peak rainfall intensity was 35 mm h as it can be observed from fig 5 group iii events produced runoff even when the initial soil moisture was 0 200 m3 m3 due to peak rainfall intensity being 35 mm h however only two events i e 26 06 2017 and 6 07 2017 were categorized in group iii these events occurred during the beginning of monsoon and resulted in a rc of 0 17 and 0 24 respectively the runoff at low initial soil moisture condition occurred only if the rainfall intensity is high i e 94 4 mm h and 45 mm h on 26 06 2017 and 6 07 2017 event respectively similarly for ga hillslope the runoff coefficient behaviour is divided in three categories i group i events which produced more than 0 7 of runoff coefficient had a peak rainfall intensity greater than 35 mm h and the initial soil moisture content 0 25 m3 m3 ii group ii events produced no runoff or extremely low runoff 0 1 and had a peak rainfall intensity 35 mm h and iii group iii events produced runoff when peak rainfall intensity was greater than 50 mm h and soil moisture condition 0 25 m3 m3 further it can be noticed that every category has some exceptions which can be explained by the rainfall duration two events of group i 9 08 2017 and 31 08 2017 converted 0 35 and 0 43 percent of rainfall into runoff as the total rainfall duration is quite short i e 2 91 h and 1 08 h respectively similarly one event of group iii produced extremely low runoff 0 1 as the rainfall duration was 1 5 h and the rainfall intensity was high at the beginning of the event this phenomenon was observed for the agf hillslope as well however the 26 06 17 event of group iii category converted 0 18 of rainfall into runoff even when the peak rainfall intensity was 58 mm h as the hillslope initial soil moisture was low 0 201 m3 m3 in infiltration excess dominated hillslope runoff is generated when the rainfall intensity is larger than the infiltration capacity of the soil either short duration rainfall or rainfall during low soil moisture condition is mainly absorbed by the soil layers fig s1 e and f fig s2 e and f which results in less runoff at the outlet the longer rainfall duration can satisfy infiltration capacity of the hillslope even if the rainfall intensity is smaller for example one rainfall event i e 27 07 2018 from group ii category having rainfall duration 27 6 h and initial soil moisture of 0 301 m3 m3 had a 1 36 of runoff coefficient in this event not only longer rainfall duration but higher initial soil moisture also plays significant role in the runoff generation however it is worth to notice that the significant runoff was generated only when the rainfall intensity was greater than the soil hydraulic conductivity fig s5 moreover it was also found that rc of 0 15 and 0 195 was generated on 1 09 2018 and 2 09 2018 respectively when the initial soil moisture condition was 0 320 m3 m3 and peak rainfall intensity is 35 mm h in group ii category even during high soil moisture condition the lower rainfall intensity resulted very less runoff at the outlet which indicate towards infiltration excess runoff 3 2 hillslope connections using network theory one event from each runoff group was selected for a detailed understanding of the hillslope processes using the concept of network theory events on 12 07 2017 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 were selected from group i ii and iii for the agf hillslope respectively fig s2 similarly 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were selected for the ga hillslope s group i ii and iii respectively fig s1 the linear correlation and clustering coefficient analysis were conducted for the above mentioned six events to get the in depth insight of formation of networks between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes for the infiltration excess dominant system 3 2 1 linear correlation analysis the connections between the spatial soil moisture pattern and the runoff were examined by linear cross correlation analysis the average correlation values of all soil moisture and runoff nodes are presented in figs 6 and 7 for both the agf and ga hillslopes respectively the correlation value of runoff for 10 07 2017 group i rainfall event was 0 73 whereas it was comparatively less for the 29 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events i e 0 52 and 0 33 respectively the high intensity rainfall 103 5 mm h and the high initial soil moisture condition of 0 20 m3 m3 were resulted in a 5 runoff ratio at the outlet on 10 07 2017 during this high intensity event the soil moisture rises and the runoff generation took place significantly as the rainfall intensity is far greater than the high soil hydraulic conductivity zone value 15 mm h thus the average correlation values of most of the soil moisture points are greater than 0 7 however the rc of 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were 0 17 and 0 19 respectively due to very low initial soil moisture conditions 0 102 m3 m3 and lower rainfall intensity 16 8 mm h respectively for these runoff producing events the correlation of hillslope runoff with soil moisture was less but higher correlation value 0 8 at soil moisture points were observed for these low runoff producing events as dry soil condition and low rainfall intensity allow more water to infiltrate similar inferences were also observed from events at the ga hillslope fig 7 the correlation coefficient of runoff for the group i event 25 07 2018 was 0 69 whereas it was 0 42 and 0 30 for the events of 26 06 2017 group iii and 29 07 2017 group ii respectively these correlation values were correlated with the runoff coefficient which was 3 75 0 18 and 0 1 on 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 respectively the average correlation values for most of the soil moisture points were higher than the 0 8 for all the three events as the runoff conversion rate of both hillslope was maximum up to 5 thus the average correlation of runoff point was less than all the soil moisture points for all the representative events of ga and agf hillslopes 3 2 2 network connectivity and clustering coefficient analysis the event based clustering coefficient was calculated for all the selected events for the grass ga and agro forest agf hillslopes as mentioned in the methodology we have checked the network structure for different correlation thresholds ct ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 an interesting observation was that for different events the significant change in network structure occurs when the ct is approximately equal to the average runoff correlation values therefore the correlation value of runoff point was adopted as the threshold values for the networks the correlation thresholds ct for 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were found to be 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 respectively further for better understanding the network structure for different ct at the increments of 0 1 above the selected threshold maximum up to 0 9 for each of the events are plotted in figs 8 and 9 jha et al 2015 and sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 also computed the network characteristics for thresholds value in range of 0 70 0 90 and 0 70 0 85 for rainfall and streamflow network analysis respectively interestingly the correlation threshold ct was observed to be dependent on event characteristics in the current study thus it varies from high runoff generating event to least runoff generating event the network structures of three selected events for the ga hillslope is presented in figs 8 and 9 for different correlation thresholds ct along with their clustering coefficient in the form of a radar chart the thickness of the line represents the correlation strength i e higher the correlation the thicker is the line it can be observed from fig 8 that the network links between runoff and soil moisture became weaker as the event rainfall intensity decreased for example the width of edge connecting the soil moisture and the runoff nodes was thicker for some of the soil moisture nodes sm6 and sm9 during the high intensity events 25 07 2018 and 26 06 2017 compared to the low intensity event of 29 07 2017 similarly as the ct value increases the soil moisture stations which had weaker correlation with runoff point became disconnected first from the runoff node for example for the event of 26 06 2017 the runoff node was connected to sm9 sm6 sm8 sm3 and sm7 soil moisture nodes for ct of 0 4 but with the increase in ct value to 0 5 the connection of runoff node with sm8 and sm3 nodes became disconnected further the sm7 disconnects from the runoff node with further increase in ct to 0 6 the sm6 and sm9 points showed high rise in soil moisture during the runoff generation of the 26 06 2017 event fig s1 e and f this results in high correlation between these soil moisture nodes and runoff compared to other sm nodes thus these sm nodes remain connected with runoff node even up to ct 0 7 this high intensity rainfall and low soil moisture event results in quite high and dynamic soil moisture infiltration at sm9 and sm6 in the high and medium conductivity zones the drop in the network connection between the soil moisture nodes and the runoff is governed not only by the event characteristics but also by the topography and soil properties especially the soil hydraulic conductivity at soil moisture sensor location similarly for the low intensity event of 29 07 2017 all the soil moisture links were disconnected from runoff point at ct 0 5 fig 8k the actual network structure of the low intensity event elucidates the strong and dense network connection among all the soil moisture stations for all the ct values however a weak connection between the soil moisture and the runoff the soil moisture network was found to be very dense and strongly connected among each other during a low intensity rainfall event in comparison to high intensity events fig 9 a e and j shows that all the soil moisture nodes were densely connected for ct 0 9 during the low intensity event 29 07 2017 in comparison to high intensity events during the low intensity rainfall all the soil moisture points are responding similarly i e rise of soil moisture is uniform all over all hillslope fig s1 c and d however during high intensity event the rise in soil moisture is non uniform which results in loss of connections at higher thresholds the cc also explains the strong network structure among soil moisture nodes during the low intensity event the cc was greater than 0 8 for all the soil moisture nodes at ct 0 9 for the event of 29 07 2017 interestingly for the high intensity events a significant heterogeneity in cc was observed for different nodes the cc values were either very high at some nodes or very low values for other nodes the main reason for such behaviour can be attributed to variation in the infiltration over the hillslopes the high infiltrating soil moisture points i e sm6 and sm9 disconnected from other soil moisture nodes at ct 0 9 as their dynamic is poorly correlated with other points the clustering coefficient cc of all the nodes was 1 when the ct value was in between 0 1 and 0 5 during the high runoff generating event 25 07 2018 for the ga hillslope while moving beyond 0 5 the clustering coefficient cc value of soil moisture points started to drop however the cc value of runoff location remained 1 fig 8d but the number of edges changed from 7 cc 0 6 to 5 cc 0 7 even if the cc was unaltered at the runoff point this behaviour of cc was also observed by sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 while analyzing the complex networks of streamflow stations the similar behavior of cc is also observed for low runoff generating events while analyzing the low runoff generating group ii event 29 07 2017 it was found that the individual cc value of soil moisture points started dropping even when the ct value was 0 2 this indicates poor correlation between runoff and soil moisture as most of the rainfall infiltrates into the soil the runoff point cc value was 1 for all the ct values ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 but the number of linked soil moisture stations kept reducing from 2 to 8 in that range to understand the detailed behaviour of the clustering coefficient in different correlation threshold and event conditions we analyzed the global clustering coefficient gcc of all the networks fig 10 as it can be seen from fig 10 that the gcc of all three events declines with an increase in ct values which indicate a decrease in network connectivity between the nodes for higher ct for ct 0 8 the gcc values for the low intensity events were higher than the high intensity events as the soil moisture networks are very strong and dense during low intensity events for high ct values however for ct 0 7 the gcc values of 25 07 2018 event is higher than the other two events because of its strong correlation with hillslope runoff which later gets disconnected from the network system the gcc value of a network is influenced by the inter connection of runoff and the soil moisture processes and thus varies according to the processes variation similar network analysis was carried out for three selected events of agro forested agf hillslope the correlation threshold of 10 07 2017 29 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events were chosen as 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the sensitivity of ct on network structure and clustering coefficient was analyzed for different events up to ct 0 9 figs s3 and s4 the influence of ct on gcc during different rainfall intensities and soil moisture conditions is presented in fig 11 the network structures of agf hillslope follow the same trend as the ga hillslope for group i group ii and group iii events the following common observations are observed from the network analysis of both the hillslopes i events having high rainfall intensity and high low soil moisture condition i e the group i events 10 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events of agf show the more robust network connectivity between the runoff and the soil moisture points as well as among the soil moisture stations ii the low intensity rainfall i e group ii events 29 07 2017 of both the hillslope show stronger network connectivity among the soil moisture and the weak network connectivity between the runoff and the soil moisture points iii the global clustering coefficient gcc of all the events declines with an increase in the correlation threshold ct figs 10 and 11 iv further gcc of low intensity event is higher than the other events when ct 0 8 but an exception was observed in agf hillslope for ct 0 8 the agf hydrological network is divided into fully connected two clusters fig s3 which resulted in gcc equal to 1 v overall it was observed that for high intensity events the strongly connected network between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes represents less runoff from that zone in an infiltration excess dominated hillslope the overall runoff framework considering the threshold and complex network theory is presented in fig 12 the high runoff generating events group i show the stronger network connectivity between soil moisture and runoff the negligible or very low runoff generating events group ii result in a very strong and dense connection among the soil moisture nodes and the weaker connection between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes moderate network connection exists between the soil moisture and the runoff during the high rainfall intensity and low moisture condition event group iii 4 discussion 4 1 hillslope runoff thresholds the hillslope scale hydrometric data identify the runoff threshold of infiltration excess dominated landscapes the peak rainfall intensity threshold of 35 mm h and initial soil moisture content of 0 25 m3 m3 are required to be surpassed for generating a significant amount of runoff in grassed ga hillslopes similarly for agro forested agf hillslope the runoff conversion of more than 0 7 was recorded once the peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions exceed the value of 12 mm h and 0 200 m3 m3 as the name indicated the ga hillslope is covered with native grasses however 60 area of agf hillslope is fallow land so the ga hillslope possesses more surface resistance comparison to agf hillslope while generating runoff this results in higher runoff velocity and less infiltration time in agf hillslope than ga hillslope masselink et al 2017 further the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity of ga hillslope 2 34 mm h is also higher than the agf hillslope 2 23 mm h furthermore it was also observed that the extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity zone 6 mm h of ga hillslope is located at the upslope of the hillslope whereas the same is located at the outlet for agf hillslope supplementary material thus the value of runoff thresholds for the ga hillslope is higher than the agf hillslope hu et al 2021 studied the impact of vegetation cover and rainfall on runoff in the fen river basin china they also found that for generating equal units of runoff the area having higher vegetation coverage 45 85 required more precipitation comparison to the less vegetation 35 45 covered area they also stated that higher soil hydraulic conductivity is associated with dense root growth resulting in less runoff our study also observes this phenomenon as the ga hillslopes generate less runoff than the agf hillslope sarkar et al 2015 studied runoff generation processes and thresholds for the vegetated hillslope plot 18 m 6m in the brahmaputra river basin of northeast india they found that the runoff was generated when the peak rainfall intensity duration and depth of rainfall were greater than the 42 mm h 59 min and 28 mm respectively we have compared the threshold values of the vegetative hillslope plot sarkar et al 2015 and the ga hillslope as they both have the same land cover and come under the wet subtropical zone but while comparing the peak rainfall intensity threshold of both the studies it was found that the threshold value of the vegetative hillslope plot is greater than the ga hillslope 35 mm h the difference in the values is resulted due to the scale issues cammeraat 2004 and the presence of impervious layer at 1 m depth from the ground level in the vegetative hillslope plot sarkar et al 2015 as the soil moisture data sets are not recorded for the year 2008 2010 they used the antecedent moisture condition amc for representing the wet or dry condition of the vegetative hillslope plot further they observed that the surface runoff generation is rare during dry antecedent moisture conditions similar findings are also observed for the group ii events when the initial soil moisture condition is 0 200 m3 m3 and 0 250 m3 m3 in the agf and ga hillslope respectively however some rainfall events with higher intensity group iii could generate runoff even in dry soil moisture conditions sarkar et al 2015 also mentioned the same hydrological behavior during dry amc conditions janzen and mcdonnell 2015 and saffarpour et al 2016 mentioned the generation of runoff at the outlet during dry antecedent soil moisture conditions only when the rainfall intensity is high similarly in the current study even though the rainfall intensity of 26 06 2017 is high 94 4 mm h the rc is quite low due to the prevalence of extremely dry soil moisture conditions 0 100 m3 m3 in agf hillslope similarly the rainfall event of 6 07 2017 group iii had a very short rainfall duration 1 16 h during low moisture conditions 0 175 m3 m3 and resulted in very little runoff in agf hillslope as mentioned by nanda et al 2019 the runoff was only generated near the outlet of the agf hillslope at lower conductivity zone and most of the upslope water reinfiltrate into the hillslope during dry soil moisture conditions the ga hillslope also behaved in the same way during dry soil moisture and high rainfall intensity conditions from the correlation analysis we observed that the runoff conversion at hillslope is strongly correlated with the peak rainfall intensity r 0 66 for agf and r 0 68 for ga and weakly correlated with the initial soil moisture condition r 0 36 for agf and r 0 10 for ga however both peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition are significantly correlated with the runoff coefficient martínez mena et al 1998 also stated the strong influence of rainfall intensity on runoff in infiltration excess dominated systems the rainfall duration also has significant but little correlation with the runoff coefficient i e 0 17 for agf hillslope and 0 12 for ga hillslope it can be concluded that rainfall intensity is the main driving force for generating hillslope runoff however in saturation excess dominated hillslope antecedent rainfall condition plays major role for generating the runoff saffarpour et al 2016 penna et al 2011 4 2 network characteristics and hydrological processes the average correlation coefficient of each node runoff and soil moisture nodes was calculated for three different rainfall runoff events which comes under three different runoff generating groups it was noticed that the average correlation coefficient of runoff node decreases with decrease in runoff coefficient however the average correlation coefficient of soil moisture nodes is higher during low runoff generating events figs 6 and 7 due to high infiltration uniformly over the hillslopes moreover the correlation threshold ct is also following the trend of runoff nodes further we have analysed the behaviour of network structure and their characteristics cc and gcc in different runoff generating events and the changing pattern of cc in different soil hydraulic conductivity zone and for different correlation thresholds ct as mentioned by masselink et al 2017 using network theory one can study about the nodes edges and the characteristics of the complete network structure at the same time in this paper we also analysed the different properties of network structure during different rainfall runoff events and try to extract the information about the runoff generation processes using the concept of network connectivity the cc value of each node represents how densely each node is connected to other nodes in a network structure the cc of runoff node is greater for high intensity event and high runoff generating events group i than the other runoff generating event groups during the high intensity rainfall runoff generation and infiltration takes place simultaneously thus runoff node is strongly connected to the all the soil moisture nodes however the infiltration pattern over the hillslope is not uniform which reflects the in the cc values of soil moisture nodes however the low intensity event shows uniform infiltration over the hillslope generating very less runoff at the outlet rc 0 1 the uniform infiltration pattern over the hillslope is reflected in cc value of all soil moisture nodes which is greater than 0 8 at ct 0 9 and the network structure also looks dense this is also reflecting in the global clustering coefficient as the runoff node is strongly connected with soil moisture nodes for group i rainfall events the gcc value is higher than the group ii events for the ct 0 7 as the ct value increases beyond 0 7 the runoff node has missed his connection with the sm nodes which results in drop in gcc values below 0 8 the gcc values of low intensity group ii events are greater than 0 8 for all the ct value due to strong network connectivity among all the soil moisture nodes sun et al 2018 also mentioned that the characteristics of a soil moisture network are dependent on the soil texture and soil hydraulic conductivity further these networks also explain the different physical processes of landscape similar in runoff generation behaviour is also observed in this present study this is the preliminary study to understand the soil moisture and runoff network behaviour during different rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions this study demonstrates how the soil hydraulic conductivity is linked with the network characteristics and how network topology explains the runoff behaviour of hillslope this type of study can be performed in the entire catchment to understand the connections between the soil moisture and runoff we have conducted this study in the infiltration excess dominated hillslopes we encourage the researchers to explore similar approaches in saturation excess dominated hillslopes where the thresholds twining between soil moisture and runoff are different which may result in a totally different network structure moreover the application of complex network theory has been very less explored in the core hydrological process understanding and the hydrologic cycle thus this study can be used as an explorative study to investigate hydrological data in the direction of runoff process understanding further the results of this network analysis can be useful for process modelling for example the dominant soil moisture nodes which carries the maximum information about runoff can be utilized to generate runoff using machine learning models 5 conclusions this study has analyzed the role of rainfall intensity initial soil moisture condition and rainfall duration for understanding the hillslope response of grassed and agro forested hillslopes in the infiltration excess dominated landscapes further the complex network theory was used to understand the soil moisture and runoff network behavior during different runoff generating groups the runoff generation in grassed ga hillslope is significantly triggered rc 0 7 when the 5 min peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions exceed 50 mm h and 0 250 m3 m3 respectively the runoff generation in agro forested agf hillslope is triggered rc 0 7 when the 5 min peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition cross the mark of 12 mm h and 0 200 m3 m3 accordingly the surface resistance and spatial pattern of soil hydraulic conductivity causes higher threshold values of ga hillslope than the agf hillslope further from network analysis it was found that the behavior of runoff and soil moisture networks are dependent upon not only on the event characteristics but also on the soil properties the correlation threshold ct value of network is event dependent as the dynamic between soil moisture and runoff changes in different rainfall runoff events and the value is approximately equal to average correlation value of runoff nodes during a high runoff generating event the strong network strength between the soil moisture and the runoff was observed however a strong network strength among the soil moisture points was noticed during the low runoff generating events the uniform infiltration over the hillslope during low rainfall intensity event results stronger network connectivity among soil moisture nodes which reflects in higher clustering coefficient values the proposed methodological framework can be replicated at watershed scale for identifying the dominant connections for example among various soil moisture sensor points we can identify which sensor point spatial variability has more significant connections with stream discharge further the network theory can be applied to examine the seasonal changes temporal variability among the dominant connections overall the framework could be used to identify the dominant nodes for long term monitoring towards developing effective model

4074,understanding hillslope scale surface runoff generation processes are challenging due to the non linear interactions among the different hydro meteorological variables often the complex connection between different hydrologic variables is little understood i e the spatial temporal connection among the same variable and between two different variables therefore in this paper we present a network theory based approach to understand the complex connections of hydrological processes the article mainly focuses on identifying runoff thresholds in grassed ga and agro forested agf hillslopes and on testing of suitability of network theory for explaining the hillslope hydrological processes after analyzing 22 rainfall events of agf and 37 events from ga hillslope our findings highlight that the runoff generation is associated with the peak rainfall intensity initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall duration the runoff thresholds of ga hillslope are higher than the agf hillslope due to its surface resistance and presence of extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity 6 mm h at the upslope location further from network analysis we found that the network s topology was highly dependent on event characteristics and soil hydraulic conductivity the strong network connectivity was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes during high runoff generating events as the runoff and infiltration take place simultaneously however during the low runoff generating events a weak connection was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes as most rainwater infiltrates over the hillslope the outcomes of this study indicate the usefulness of network theory in hillslope scale runoff process understanding to identify the significant connections keywords runoff thresholds lesser himalayan hillslopes network theory clustering coefficient soil moisture 1 introduction identification of various thresholds associated with surface runoff is very critical to understand the multiple hydrological processes at different spatial and temporal scales the non linear behaviour of soil moisture and rainfall influence the hillslope runoff generation mechanism and its thresholds radatz et al 2013 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld mcdonnell 2006 these thresholds can be used as a suitable index for comparing runoff generation process of different landscapes moreover this can also be used in model calibration and validation by grouping the equivalent runoff responses graham mcdonnell 2010 thresholds controlling hillslope runoff have been studied widely in subsurface storm flow and saturation excess se dominanted hillslopes especially in western countries and australia detty mcguire 2010 radatz et al 2013 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld mcdonnell 2006 western et al 1998 antecedent wetness condition and rainfall plays a major role in identifying the runoff threshold at saturation excess dominanted alpine headwater catchment italy penna et al 2011 the same findings are also observed by the western et al 1998 in tarrawarra catchment of south eastern australia by saffarpour et al 2016 in the lang lang river catchment australia and by radatz et al 2013 in southwestern wisconsin agricultural watersheds of usa though thresholds are very useful tool to analyse the hydrological processes no study has addressed this issue in the indian himalayan region region nanda et al 2018 found infiltration excess ie is the dominant process in two lesser himalayan plots and hillslopes during artificial and natural rainfall conditions while the thresholds in saturation excess runoff dominant overland flow have received wide attention the effect of initial soil moisture condition varying rainfall intensity and duration on hillslope runoff in infiltration excess dominated regions are less studied sarkar et al 2015 carried out runoff generation study in vegetative hillslope plot of the brahmaputra river basin and they observed the dominance of infiltration excess process they also concluded that the rainfall depth rainfall duration peak rainfall intensity and antecedent moisture condition are major overland flow controlling factor however martínez mena et al 1998 stated about the control of peak rainfall intensity on infiltration excess surface runoff in semi arid mediterranean micro catchments moreover cammeraat 2004 studied various runoff thresholds i e vegetation type surface roughness rainfall characteristics depth duration and intensity in a semi arid catchment of spain thus in this study the threshold concept was used to determine various triggers for hillslope runoff generation in the lesser himalayan region different components of the hydrological processes are either direct indirect or forward backwards related with each other sivakumar 2014 some of these connections are more significant than others and determine the dynamics of hydrological processes for example in a soil moisture network some soil moisture points are more significantly connected with runoff than others these connections which are dependent on rainfall and soil moisture characteristics vary in both spatial and temporal domains the detailed understanding of type and extent of connections remains a challenge in hydrology even after developing large numbers of models and mathematical theories sivakumar 2014 inherent complexities of the hydrological processes in micro to macro scale hydrological systems insufficient data availability and absence of a suitable method to study these complex connections are some of the reasons behind this lack of scientific development in this context network theory is a beneficial tool to deal with all kinds of hydrological connections sivakumar 2014 the applicability of network theory is vast in different dimensions of research such as transportation hydrology climate science ecology communication and sociology halverson and fleming 2015 in hydrology the application of complex network theory was initiated for river networks and precipitation and streamflow monitoring network agarwal et al 2020 boers et al 2013 rinaldo et al 2006 scarsoglio et al 2013 these studies discussed the optimum number of gauging stations spatial and temporal connections of these monitoring networks and their relationship with terrain conditions network theory has also been used to study the hydro climatic extremes like drought konapala mishra 2017 community detection halverson and fleming 2015 and teleconnections moreover many previous studies used the unweighted network type same weight assign to each link to understand the streamflow sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 halverson and fleming 2015 and rainfall jha et al 2015 dynamics but in a natural system connections generally have different weights such as some connections are stronger while other are weaker therefore the weighted network can help us to better understand the network connections and strength network theory can also be used to study the direct or indirect connections between different components of the hydrological cycle i e precipitation surface flow infiltration subsurface flow like groundwater flow interflow and baseflow sivakumar 2014 however the use of network theory for a detailed understanding of the hydrological cycle and processes is still in its nascent phase very few studies related to network theory have been conducted to understand the linkage among different components of runoff generation process however network theory has also been used in the field of sediment routing and connectivity and channel networks marra et al 2014 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 phillips et al 2011 used the network theory to understand the hydrological connectivity among 11 sub watersheds where the sub watersheds and stream reaches were presented as the nodes and edges of the network masselink et al 2017 applied the graph theory to understand the overland flow connectivity using high resolution digital elevation model dem and dense networks of overland flow sensors but we have used the spatial network of soil moisture sensors instead of overland flow sensors thus we used infiltration pattern of rain water over the hillslope to identify the runoff generating areas zuecco et al 2019 used the graph theory for quantifying the subsurface hydrologic connectivity between groundwater level and streamflow but they did not consider the influence of rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition on network structure further they have not examined the influence of these variables on the inherent network structure characteristics considering the above discussion this study tries to answer the following research questions i what are the key factors that influence the runoff generation thresholds for infiltration excess dominated landscapes ii can network theory explain the connection between soil moisture and runoff iii how various rainfall events influence the network structure and its characteristics the first part of this paper focuses on thresholds related to lesser himalayan hillslopes the second part used the network theory for hillslope scale process understanding especially to analyse the connection between runoff and soil moisture during different rainfall events further the dependency of network properties on event characteristics were also examined in the current study this study has two key novelties 1 the analysis of thresholds controlling the runoff generation for two different lesser himalayan hillslopes and 2 this is the first application of network theory to understand the connection between soil moisture and runoff for different runoff generating groups hillslope scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental hillslopes are located in the aglar river watershed of tehri garhwal district uttarakhand india fig 1 the grassed ga and agro forested agf hillslopes are located at the south and north aspect of the watershed respectively the elevations of ga and agf hillslope are 1267 m and 1142 m climate of the study area is subtropical highland climate according to koppen climate classification and the area receives 75 of the rainfall during the monsoon june september the ga hillslope is dominated with native grasses however the 60 area of agf hillslope is covered with fallow land and rest of area is covered with some medicinal and fruit trees like grewia optiva bombax ceiba rubus ellipticus sm the hillslopes are kept undisturbed e g no human interventions and grazing for studied period tables 1 and 2 the seasonal variation in daily average soil moisture and soil temperature are between 0 10 m3 m3 to 0 15 m3 m3 and 6 c to 27 c respectively at agf hillslope however the daily average soil temperature of ga hillslope i e 11 c to 29 c is higher due to southern aspect nanda et al 2020 the seasonal variation in daily averaged soil moisture is varied between 0 10 m3 m3 to 0 20 m3 m3 at ga hillslope slope based on a digital elevation model with a 0 5 m resolution is 20 7 for agf hillslope and 14 4 for ga hillslope infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant runoff mechanism 2 2 hydro meteorological data the hillslopes were instrumented with an hs flume with capacitance based odyssey water level sensor to measure the hillslope runoff the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture was recorded by decagon 5tm meter environment usa and odyssey dataflow systems ltd new zealand soil moisture sensors at 15 20 cm below the ground surface the rainfall depth was recorded using tipping bucket rain gauges at each hillslope rainwise inc usa all the hydrological variables were logged at 5 min intervals both the hillslopes were divided into three soil conductivity zones i low conductivity zones 10 mm h ii medium conductivity zones 10 15 mm h and iii high conductivity zones 15 mm h the low medium and high conductivity zones cover 63 22 and 14 areas in ga hillslope respectively similarly for agf hillslope 45 36 and 19 of total hillslope area are covered by low medium and high conductivity zones respectively these zones were classified by conducting unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity experiments using a mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices inc pullman wa nanda et al 2019 the detailed description of hydraulic conductivity experiments is provided in the supplementary document the hydro meteorological i e runoff soil moisture and rainfall data have been collected since june 2017 we used two years of datasets for ga hillslope 2017 2018 and one year of the dataset for agf hillslope 2017 for analyzing runoff thresholds 2 3 rainfall and runoff events the rainfall events were defined as an event with total rainfall amount and peak 5 min rainfall intensity greater than equal to 5 mm and 4 mm h respectively in total 22 rainfall runoff events for the agf hillslope and 37 events for the ga hillslope to determine the runoff threshold initial soil moisture is the average of all soil moisture sensors at the 5 min time step just before rain started 2 4 network theory a network graph consists of a set of vertices nodes that are connected by links edges we used the runoff and soil moisture sensor points and represented connection between them as links or edges fig 2 the pictorial form of the network was created after calculating the two dimensional adjacency matrix m m each value of the adjacency matrix indicates the existence and nonexistence of links between any two nodes fig 2 a shows the simplest unweighted network graph which is generated using the adjacency matrix as shown in fig 2 b the unweighted blue star in a matrix cell represents the presence of links or edges whereas the void cells illustrate no link condition between two nodes thus the binary representation can be used in the adjacency matrix of unweighted network graph for showing the presence or absence of link in the current study we have used the weighted network graph as shown in fig 2 c the adjacency matrix of a weighted network structure is different from the unweighted graph fig 2d instead of the same colored star three different colored stars are used in this matrix to represent different weights which are reflected in the form of edge thickness in network structure fig 2c the pearson correlation c was calculated among all the hillslope hydrological nodes soil moisture and runoff nodes the network graph was created once the correlation value exceeds the threshold correlation ct value the weighted adjacency matrix of hillslope mw can be represented as m w c i f c c t 0 o t h e r w i s e the nonzero values of the adjacency matrix represent the connection between the two nodes whereas zero represents no connection between the two nodes for creating the network structure and to calculate clustering coefficient the selection of ct plays a vital role we have followed the below mentioned steps for estimating the ct for all the selected rainfall events the connections between spatial soil moisture pattern and runoff were examined by linear cross correlation analysis the average correlation was computed for that node jha et al 2015 used an approach where they tested the network structure for cts varying from 0 1 to 0 9 and the correlation value at which the network showed significant change between the connections of nodes was selected as ct for their study we used a similar approach where we checked the network structure for different events for all the ct values ranging between 0 1 and 0 9 to identify the correlation threshold as the network was developed for infiltration excess dominated hillslope stronger network connection i e represented by thick edge between soil moisture node and runoff node represents either simultaneous increase or decrease in soil moisture and runoff for example during a high runoff generating events the soil moisture node which has strong correlation with runoff node indicates less runoff and more infiltration from that particular patch and vice versa however weak connection represents opposite behavior in soil moisture and runoff it can also be observed for high runoff generating events that the soil moisture which has weaker network connectivity i e represented by thin edge with runoff node represents the high runoff and less infiltration for that particular soil moisture patch 2 4 1 clustering coefficient this is the most fundamental characteristic of a complex network networks often contain clusters among the nodes and to measure the local density of these nodes the clustering coefficient has been widely used in many studies sivakumar 2014 konapala and mishra 2017 the clustering coefficient is computed at the local node level as well as at the network level also consider the i th node in the network which has links to other neighboring k i nodes if all these k i nodes are interconnected and form a cluster then there would be total k i k i 1 2 links between them therefore the local clustering coefficient at the node i is defined as the ratio between the actual links e i in the cluster and maximum possible links in the cluster k i k i 1 2 cc i e i k i k i 1 the global clustering coefficient gcc is defined as the average of all local clustering coefficients cc the gcc in the current study represents the total cohesiveness among the runoff and soil moisture nodes and this study examines how the gcc varies during different hydrological and meteorological conditions the cc values indicate the strength of the connections of individual nodes to other nodes the network analysis was performed in r using the igraph package csárdi nepusz 2006 3 results 3 1 runoff thresholds we analyzed four different runoff thresholds rainfall depth rainfall intensity rainfall duration and initial soil moisture conditions the higher intensity rainfall events had generally a short duration fig 3 for example the longer duration rainfall events 10 h had an average rainfall intensity 5 mm h and the peak rainfall intensity 50 mm h for event with a duration 10 h the average rainfall intensity was between 5 mm h and 10 mm h similarly the higher average rainfall intensity 10 mm h events generally had a rainfall duration 7 5 h the influence of total event rainfall and 5 min peak intensity on hillslope runoff is presented in fig 4 which represents the total event runoff as a dependent variable of event rainfall depth and the peak rainfall intensity is shown by colors the higher rainfall intensity event results in a larger amount of total rainfall total event runoff depth was found to be 0 25 mm while the total event rainfall was 25 mm fig 4 events larger than 50 mm could produce more than 0 25 mm runoff similarly the event produces runoff 1 mm only occurred when event rainfall is 100 mm overall it can be concluded that the total runoff increases with increase in rainfall depth runoff depth is strongly associated with the rainfall depth having correlation value 0 65 further it can be seen from fig 4b that two events produced total runoff 0 25 mm even when the total rainfall is greater than 50 mm and peak rainfall intensity is greater than 50 mm h these results may be due to either low initial soil moisture condition or short rainfall duration the above observation from fig 3 highlights that not only rainfall intensity but also rainfall duration and soil moisture condition have control over runoff thresholds further we have plotted multi variable graph for both ga and agf hillslopes to understand the combined effects of these variables on hillslope runoff thresholds of hillslope runoff mechanism is plotted in fig 5 as mentioned by nanda et al 2019 ga and agf possess different initial soil moisture condition surface resistance and hence show diverse hillslope response thus the combine impact of three factors on runoff thresholds were analyzed in fig 5 a and b for agf and ga hillslope respectively the initial soil moisture condition and 5 min peak rainfall intensity is plotted on x axis and y axis respectively whereas the colour of the triangular points represents the rainfall duration and the size of the triangle shows the runoff coefficient rc value factors controlling the agf hillslope runoff threshold are grouped into three categories group i events are significant runoff generating events these events generally converted more than 0 4 of rainfall to runoff when a peak rainfall intensity was greater than 12 mm h and the initial soil moisture content was greater than 0 200 m3 m3 however some events in group i which had more than 0 7 rc were observed to have the peak intensity 35 mm h but one exception was also observed i e very negligible amount of runoff was generated on 28 08 2017 as the event rainfall duration was quite less 1 55 h this shorter duration rainfall cannot satisfy the infiltration capacity of soil thus was not able to generate the runoff for group ii events either no runoff or extreme low runoff was produced rc 0 1 when the initial soil moisture content was 0 200 m3 m3 and peak rainfall intensity 35 mm h in contrast rc of 0 43 was recorded on 23 09 2017 event due to longer rainfall duration of 20 16 h but it is worth to notice that the runoff was only generated for the time steps when the rainfall intensity was greater than 20 mm h i e greater than soil hydraulic conductivity fig s5 this longer duration rainfall is satisfying the infiltration capacity of soil even if peak rainfall intensity was 35 mm h as it can be observed from fig 5 group iii events produced runoff even when the initial soil moisture was 0 200 m3 m3 due to peak rainfall intensity being 35 mm h however only two events i e 26 06 2017 and 6 07 2017 were categorized in group iii these events occurred during the beginning of monsoon and resulted in a rc of 0 17 and 0 24 respectively the runoff at low initial soil moisture condition occurred only if the rainfall intensity is high i e 94 4 mm h and 45 mm h on 26 06 2017 and 6 07 2017 event respectively similarly for ga hillslope the runoff coefficient behaviour is divided in three categories i group i events which produced more than 0 7 of runoff coefficient had a peak rainfall intensity greater than 35 mm h and the initial soil moisture content 0 25 m3 m3 ii group ii events produced no runoff or extremely low runoff 0 1 and had a peak rainfall intensity 35 mm h and iii group iii events produced runoff when peak rainfall intensity was greater than 50 mm h and soil moisture condition 0 25 m3 m3 further it can be noticed that every category has some exceptions which can be explained by the rainfall duration two events of group i 9 08 2017 and 31 08 2017 converted 0 35 and 0 43 percent of rainfall into runoff as the total rainfall duration is quite short i e 2 91 h and 1 08 h respectively similarly one event of group iii produced extremely low runoff 0 1 as the rainfall duration was 1 5 h and the rainfall intensity was high at the beginning of the event this phenomenon was observed for the agf hillslope as well however the 26 06 17 event of group iii category converted 0 18 of rainfall into runoff even when the peak rainfall intensity was 58 mm h as the hillslope initial soil moisture was low 0 201 m3 m3 in infiltration excess dominated hillslope runoff is generated when the rainfall intensity is larger than the infiltration capacity of the soil either short duration rainfall or rainfall during low soil moisture condition is mainly absorbed by the soil layers fig s1 e and f fig s2 e and f which results in less runoff at the outlet the longer rainfall duration can satisfy infiltration capacity of the hillslope even if the rainfall intensity is smaller for example one rainfall event i e 27 07 2018 from group ii category having rainfall duration 27 6 h and initial soil moisture of 0 301 m3 m3 had a 1 36 of runoff coefficient in this event not only longer rainfall duration but higher initial soil moisture also plays significant role in the runoff generation however it is worth to notice that the significant runoff was generated only when the rainfall intensity was greater than the soil hydraulic conductivity fig s5 moreover it was also found that rc of 0 15 and 0 195 was generated on 1 09 2018 and 2 09 2018 respectively when the initial soil moisture condition was 0 320 m3 m3 and peak rainfall intensity is 35 mm h in group ii category even during high soil moisture condition the lower rainfall intensity resulted very less runoff at the outlet which indicate towards infiltration excess runoff 3 2 hillslope connections using network theory one event from each runoff group was selected for a detailed understanding of the hillslope processes using the concept of network theory events on 12 07 2017 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 were selected from group i ii and iii for the agf hillslope respectively fig s2 similarly 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were selected for the ga hillslope s group i ii and iii respectively fig s1 the linear correlation and clustering coefficient analysis were conducted for the above mentioned six events to get the in depth insight of formation of networks between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes for the infiltration excess dominant system 3 2 1 linear correlation analysis the connections between the spatial soil moisture pattern and the runoff were examined by linear cross correlation analysis the average correlation values of all soil moisture and runoff nodes are presented in figs 6 and 7 for both the agf and ga hillslopes respectively the correlation value of runoff for 10 07 2017 group i rainfall event was 0 73 whereas it was comparatively less for the 29 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events i e 0 52 and 0 33 respectively the high intensity rainfall 103 5 mm h and the high initial soil moisture condition of 0 20 m3 m3 were resulted in a 5 runoff ratio at the outlet on 10 07 2017 during this high intensity event the soil moisture rises and the runoff generation took place significantly as the rainfall intensity is far greater than the high soil hydraulic conductivity zone value 15 mm h thus the average correlation values of most of the soil moisture points are greater than 0 7 however the rc of 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were 0 17 and 0 19 respectively due to very low initial soil moisture conditions 0 102 m3 m3 and lower rainfall intensity 16 8 mm h respectively for these runoff producing events the correlation of hillslope runoff with soil moisture was less but higher correlation value 0 8 at soil moisture points were observed for these low runoff producing events as dry soil condition and low rainfall intensity allow more water to infiltrate similar inferences were also observed from events at the ga hillslope fig 7 the correlation coefficient of runoff for the group i event 25 07 2018 was 0 69 whereas it was 0 42 and 0 30 for the events of 26 06 2017 group iii and 29 07 2017 group ii respectively these correlation values were correlated with the runoff coefficient which was 3 75 0 18 and 0 1 on 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 respectively the average correlation values for most of the soil moisture points were higher than the 0 8 for all the three events as the runoff conversion rate of both hillslope was maximum up to 5 thus the average correlation of runoff point was less than all the soil moisture points for all the representative events of ga and agf hillslopes 3 2 2 network connectivity and clustering coefficient analysis the event based clustering coefficient was calculated for all the selected events for the grass ga and agro forest agf hillslopes as mentioned in the methodology we have checked the network structure for different correlation thresholds ct ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 an interesting observation was that for different events the significant change in network structure occurs when the ct is approximately equal to the average runoff correlation values therefore the correlation value of runoff point was adopted as the threshold values for the networks the correlation thresholds ct for 25 07 2018 26 06 2017 and 29 07 2017 events were found to be 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 respectively further for better understanding the network structure for different ct at the increments of 0 1 above the selected threshold maximum up to 0 9 for each of the events are plotted in figs 8 and 9 jha et al 2015 and sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 also computed the network characteristics for thresholds value in range of 0 70 0 90 and 0 70 0 85 for rainfall and streamflow network analysis respectively interestingly the correlation threshold ct was observed to be dependent on event characteristics in the current study thus it varies from high runoff generating event to least runoff generating event the network structures of three selected events for the ga hillslope is presented in figs 8 and 9 for different correlation thresholds ct along with their clustering coefficient in the form of a radar chart the thickness of the line represents the correlation strength i e higher the correlation the thicker is the line it can be observed from fig 8 that the network links between runoff and soil moisture became weaker as the event rainfall intensity decreased for example the width of edge connecting the soil moisture and the runoff nodes was thicker for some of the soil moisture nodes sm6 and sm9 during the high intensity events 25 07 2018 and 26 06 2017 compared to the low intensity event of 29 07 2017 similarly as the ct value increases the soil moisture stations which had weaker correlation with runoff point became disconnected first from the runoff node for example for the event of 26 06 2017 the runoff node was connected to sm9 sm6 sm8 sm3 and sm7 soil moisture nodes for ct of 0 4 but with the increase in ct value to 0 5 the connection of runoff node with sm8 and sm3 nodes became disconnected further the sm7 disconnects from the runoff node with further increase in ct to 0 6 the sm6 and sm9 points showed high rise in soil moisture during the runoff generation of the 26 06 2017 event fig s1 e and f this results in high correlation between these soil moisture nodes and runoff compared to other sm nodes thus these sm nodes remain connected with runoff node even up to ct 0 7 this high intensity rainfall and low soil moisture event results in quite high and dynamic soil moisture infiltration at sm9 and sm6 in the high and medium conductivity zones the drop in the network connection between the soil moisture nodes and the runoff is governed not only by the event characteristics but also by the topography and soil properties especially the soil hydraulic conductivity at soil moisture sensor location similarly for the low intensity event of 29 07 2017 all the soil moisture links were disconnected from runoff point at ct 0 5 fig 8k the actual network structure of the low intensity event elucidates the strong and dense network connection among all the soil moisture stations for all the ct values however a weak connection between the soil moisture and the runoff the soil moisture network was found to be very dense and strongly connected among each other during a low intensity rainfall event in comparison to high intensity events fig 9 a e and j shows that all the soil moisture nodes were densely connected for ct 0 9 during the low intensity event 29 07 2017 in comparison to high intensity events during the low intensity rainfall all the soil moisture points are responding similarly i e rise of soil moisture is uniform all over all hillslope fig s1 c and d however during high intensity event the rise in soil moisture is non uniform which results in loss of connections at higher thresholds the cc also explains the strong network structure among soil moisture nodes during the low intensity event the cc was greater than 0 8 for all the soil moisture nodes at ct 0 9 for the event of 29 07 2017 interestingly for the high intensity events a significant heterogeneity in cc was observed for different nodes the cc values were either very high at some nodes or very low values for other nodes the main reason for such behaviour can be attributed to variation in the infiltration over the hillslopes the high infiltrating soil moisture points i e sm6 and sm9 disconnected from other soil moisture nodes at ct 0 9 as their dynamic is poorly correlated with other points the clustering coefficient cc of all the nodes was 1 when the ct value was in between 0 1 and 0 5 during the high runoff generating event 25 07 2018 for the ga hillslope while moving beyond 0 5 the clustering coefficient cc value of soil moisture points started to drop however the cc value of runoff location remained 1 fig 8d but the number of edges changed from 7 cc 0 6 to 5 cc 0 7 even if the cc was unaltered at the runoff point this behaviour of cc was also observed by sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 while analyzing the complex networks of streamflow stations the similar behavior of cc is also observed for low runoff generating events while analyzing the low runoff generating group ii event 29 07 2017 it was found that the individual cc value of soil moisture points started dropping even when the ct value was 0 2 this indicates poor correlation between runoff and soil moisture as most of the rainfall infiltrates into the soil the runoff point cc value was 1 for all the ct values ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 but the number of linked soil moisture stations kept reducing from 2 to 8 in that range to understand the detailed behaviour of the clustering coefficient in different correlation threshold and event conditions we analyzed the global clustering coefficient gcc of all the networks fig 10 as it can be seen from fig 10 that the gcc of all three events declines with an increase in ct values which indicate a decrease in network connectivity between the nodes for higher ct for ct 0 8 the gcc values for the low intensity events were higher than the high intensity events as the soil moisture networks are very strong and dense during low intensity events for high ct values however for ct 0 7 the gcc values of 25 07 2018 event is higher than the other two events because of its strong correlation with hillslope runoff which later gets disconnected from the network system the gcc value of a network is influenced by the inter connection of runoff and the soil moisture processes and thus varies according to the processes variation similar network analysis was carried out for three selected events of agro forested agf hillslope the correlation threshold of 10 07 2017 29 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events were chosen as 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the sensitivity of ct on network structure and clustering coefficient was analyzed for different events up to ct 0 9 figs s3 and s4 the influence of ct on gcc during different rainfall intensities and soil moisture conditions is presented in fig 11 the network structures of agf hillslope follow the same trend as the ga hillslope for group i group ii and group iii events the following common observations are observed from the network analysis of both the hillslopes i events having high rainfall intensity and high low soil moisture condition i e the group i events 10 07 2017 and 26 06 2017 events of agf show the more robust network connectivity between the runoff and the soil moisture points as well as among the soil moisture stations ii the low intensity rainfall i e group ii events 29 07 2017 of both the hillslope show stronger network connectivity among the soil moisture and the weak network connectivity between the runoff and the soil moisture points iii the global clustering coefficient gcc of all the events declines with an increase in the correlation threshold ct figs 10 and 11 iv further gcc of low intensity event is higher than the other events when ct 0 8 but an exception was observed in agf hillslope for ct 0 8 the agf hydrological network is divided into fully connected two clusters fig s3 which resulted in gcc equal to 1 v overall it was observed that for high intensity events the strongly connected network between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes represents less runoff from that zone in an infiltration excess dominated hillslope the overall runoff framework considering the threshold and complex network theory is presented in fig 12 the high runoff generating events group i show the stronger network connectivity between soil moisture and runoff the negligible or very low runoff generating events group ii result in a very strong and dense connection among the soil moisture nodes and the weaker connection between the soil moisture and the runoff nodes moderate network connection exists between the soil moisture and the runoff during the high rainfall intensity and low moisture condition event group iii 4 discussion 4 1 hillslope runoff thresholds the hillslope scale hydrometric data identify the runoff threshold of infiltration excess dominated landscapes the peak rainfall intensity threshold of 35 mm h and initial soil moisture content of 0 25 m3 m3 are required to be surpassed for generating a significant amount of runoff in grassed ga hillslopes similarly for agro forested agf hillslope the runoff conversion of more than 0 7 was recorded once the peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions exceed the value of 12 mm h and 0 200 m3 m3 as the name indicated the ga hillslope is covered with native grasses however 60 area of agf hillslope is fallow land so the ga hillslope possesses more surface resistance comparison to agf hillslope while generating runoff this results in higher runoff velocity and less infiltration time in agf hillslope than ga hillslope masselink et al 2017 further the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity of ga hillslope 2 34 mm h is also higher than the agf hillslope 2 23 mm h furthermore it was also observed that the extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity zone 6 mm h of ga hillslope is located at the upslope of the hillslope whereas the same is located at the outlet for agf hillslope supplementary material thus the value of runoff thresholds for the ga hillslope is higher than the agf hillslope hu et al 2021 studied the impact of vegetation cover and rainfall on runoff in the fen river basin china they also found that for generating equal units of runoff the area having higher vegetation coverage 45 85 required more precipitation comparison to the less vegetation 35 45 covered area they also stated that higher soil hydraulic conductivity is associated with dense root growth resulting in less runoff our study also observes this phenomenon as the ga hillslopes generate less runoff than the agf hillslope sarkar et al 2015 studied runoff generation processes and thresholds for the vegetated hillslope plot 18 m 6m in the brahmaputra river basin of northeast india they found that the runoff was generated when the peak rainfall intensity duration and depth of rainfall were greater than the 42 mm h 59 min and 28 mm respectively we have compared the threshold values of the vegetative hillslope plot sarkar et al 2015 and the ga hillslope as they both have the same land cover and come under the wet subtropical zone but while comparing the peak rainfall intensity threshold of both the studies it was found that the threshold value of the vegetative hillslope plot is greater than the ga hillslope 35 mm h the difference in the values is resulted due to the scale issues cammeraat 2004 and the presence of impervious layer at 1 m depth from the ground level in the vegetative hillslope plot sarkar et al 2015 as the soil moisture data sets are not recorded for the year 2008 2010 they used the antecedent moisture condition amc for representing the wet or dry condition of the vegetative hillslope plot further they observed that the surface runoff generation is rare during dry antecedent moisture conditions similar findings are also observed for the group ii events when the initial soil moisture condition is 0 200 m3 m3 and 0 250 m3 m3 in the agf and ga hillslope respectively however some rainfall events with higher intensity group iii could generate runoff even in dry soil moisture conditions sarkar et al 2015 also mentioned the same hydrological behavior during dry amc conditions janzen and mcdonnell 2015 and saffarpour et al 2016 mentioned the generation of runoff at the outlet during dry antecedent soil moisture conditions only when the rainfall intensity is high similarly in the current study even though the rainfall intensity of 26 06 2017 is high 94 4 mm h the rc is quite low due to the prevalence of extremely dry soil moisture conditions 0 100 m3 m3 in agf hillslope similarly the rainfall event of 6 07 2017 group iii had a very short rainfall duration 1 16 h during low moisture conditions 0 175 m3 m3 and resulted in very little runoff in agf hillslope as mentioned by nanda et al 2019 the runoff was only generated near the outlet of the agf hillslope at lower conductivity zone and most of the upslope water reinfiltrate into the hillslope during dry soil moisture conditions the ga hillslope also behaved in the same way during dry soil moisture and high rainfall intensity conditions from the correlation analysis we observed that the runoff conversion at hillslope is strongly correlated with the peak rainfall intensity r 0 66 for agf and r 0 68 for ga and weakly correlated with the initial soil moisture condition r 0 36 for agf and r 0 10 for ga however both peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition are significantly correlated with the runoff coefficient martínez mena et al 1998 also stated the strong influence of rainfall intensity on runoff in infiltration excess dominated systems the rainfall duration also has significant but little correlation with the runoff coefficient i e 0 17 for agf hillslope and 0 12 for ga hillslope it can be concluded that rainfall intensity is the main driving force for generating hillslope runoff however in saturation excess dominated hillslope antecedent rainfall condition plays major role for generating the runoff saffarpour et al 2016 penna et al 2011 4 2 network characteristics and hydrological processes the average correlation coefficient of each node runoff and soil moisture nodes was calculated for three different rainfall runoff events which comes under three different runoff generating groups it was noticed that the average correlation coefficient of runoff node decreases with decrease in runoff coefficient however the average correlation coefficient of soil moisture nodes is higher during low runoff generating events figs 6 and 7 due to high infiltration uniformly over the hillslopes moreover the correlation threshold ct is also following the trend of runoff nodes further we have analysed the behaviour of network structure and their characteristics cc and gcc in different runoff generating events and the changing pattern of cc in different soil hydraulic conductivity zone and for different correlation thresholds ct as mentioned by masselink et al 2017 using network theory one can study about the nodes edges and the characteristics of the complete network structure at the same time in this paper we also analysed the different properties of network structure during different rainfall runoff events and try to extract the information about the runoff generation processes using the concept of network connectivity the cc value of each node represents how densely each node is connected to other nodes in a network structure the cc of runoff node is greater for high intensity event and high runoff generating events group i than the other runoff generating event groups during the high intensity rainfall runoff generation and infiltration takes place simultaneously thus runoff node is strongly connected to the all the soil moisture nodes however the infiltration pattern over the hillslope is not uniform which reflects the in the cc values of soil moisture nodes however the low intensity event shows uniform infiltration over the hillslope generating very less runoff at the outlet rc 0 1 the uniform infiltration pattern over the hillslope is reflected in cc value of all soil moisture nodes which is greater than 0 8 at ct 0 9 and the network structure also looks dense this is also reflecting in the global clustering coefficient as the runoff node is strongly connected with soil moisture nodes for group i rainfall events the gcc value is higher than the group ii events for the ct 0 7 as the ct value increases beyond 0 7 the runoff node has missed his connection with the sm nodes which results in drop in gcc values below 0 8 the gcc values of low intensity group ii events are greater than 0 8 for all the ct value due to strong network connectivity among all the soil moisture nodes sun et al 2018 also mentioned that the characteristics of a soil moisture network are dependent on the soil texture and soil hydraulic conductivity further these networks also explain the different physical processes of landscape similar in runoff generation behaviour is also observed in this present study this is the preliminary study to understand the soil moisture and runoff network behaviour during different rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions this study demonstrates how the soil hydraulic conductivity is linked with the network characteristics and how network topology explains the runoff behaviour of hillslope this type of study can be performed in the entire catchment to understand the connections between the soil moisture and runoff we have conducted this study in the infiltration excess dominated hillslopes we encourage the researchers to explore similar approaches in saturation excess dominated hillslopes where the thresholds twining between soil moisture and runoff are different which may result in a totally different network structure moreover the application of complex network theory has been very less explored in the core hydrological process understanding and the hydrologic cycle thus this study can be used as an explorative study to investigate hydrological data in the direction of runoff process understanding further the results of this network analysis can be useful for process modelling for example the dominant soil moisture nodes which carries the maximum information about runoff can be utilized to generate runoff using machine learning models 5 conclusions this study has analyzed the role of rainfall intensity initial soil moisture condition and rainfall duration for understanding the hillslope response of grassed and agro forested hillslopes in the infiltration excess dominated landscapes further the complex network theory was used to understand the soil moisture and runoff network behavior during different runoff generating groups the runoff generation in grassed ga hillslope is significantly triggered rc 0 7 when the 5 min peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions exceed 50 mm h and 0 250 m3 m3 respectively the runoff generation in agro forested agf hillslope is triggered rc 0 7 when the 5 min peak rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture condition cross the mark of 12 mm h and 0 200 m3 m3 accordingly the surface resistance and spatial pattern of soil hydraulic conductivity causes higher threshold values of ga hillslope than the agf hillslope further from network analysis it was found that the behavior of runoff and soil moisture networks are dependent upon not only on the event characteristics but also on the soil properties the correlation threshold ct value of network is event dependent as the dynamic between soil moisture and runoff changes in different rainfall runoff events and the value is approximately equal to average correlation value of runoff nodes during a high runoff generating event the strong network strength between the soil moisture and the runoff was observed however a strong network strength among the soil moisture points was noticed during the low runoff generating events the uniform infiltration over the hillslope during low rainfall intensity event results stronger network connectivity among soil moisture nodes which reflects in higher clustering coefficient values the proposed methodological framework can be replicated at watershed scale for identifying the dominant connections for example among various soil moisture sensor points we can identify which sensor point spatial variability has more significant connections with stream discharge further the network theory can be applied to examine the seasonal changes temporal variability among the dominant connections overall the framework could be used to identify the dominant nodes for long term monitoring towards developing effective model
