18780,although polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments studies on their source and formation are extremely scarce after investigation of phczs and carbazole in drinking water an overlooked formation route of chloro bromo czs was now proposed as aqueous chlorination of residual carbazole under bromide condition four groups of phcz including mono di tri and tetra halogenated groups were identified in chlorinated drinking water and the mechanism of the formation of the four groups of phczs was proposed twenty six phcz congeners including chloro bromo and chlorobromo mixed species were thoroughly studied and it was revealed for the first time the four groups of phczs shifted from chlorinated to being more brominated with increasing bromide level the speciation of the four groups of phczs was modeled it was revealed that the shift of phczs from chlorinated to being more brominated was caused by the reactivity differences between hocl and hobr in reactions forming phczs furthermore this study revealed that the species numbers and concentrations of phczs formed in chlorination were much higher than those in chloramination and the formation of phczs was decreased by 50 with an increase of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 this study of the variety of phczs in chlorinated water is an important step toward revealing the occurrence of phczs in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords halogenated carbazole formation pathway drinking water bromide influence factors 1 introduction polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs with structures similar to polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofurans pcdd fs are a series of emerging organohalogen contaminants in recent decades more than 20 phcz congeners have been detected in soil and sediment as well as organisms from different regions pena abaurrea et al 2014 mumbo et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for instance 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 36 ccz was screened in the sediments of lippe river germany kronimus et al 2004 3 chlorocarbazole 3 ccz 36 ccz and dibromocarbazole were detected at the concentrations up to 110 3500 and 93 ng g dw in the soils of the coastal industrial area of kavala greece grigoriadou and schwarzbauer 2011 and 17 phczs including br2 br2cl br3 br3cl br3cli br3i2 br4 br4cl br4i and br5 carbazole were detected in the sediments of lake michigan usa guo et al 2014 except the variety of congeners the concentrations of phczs in some regions reach or exceed those of the well known organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers zhu and hites 2005 guo et al 2017 found that the total phczs accumulation in the sediments of the upper great lakes was more than 3000 tons which was several orders of magnitude higher than pcbs and decabromodiphenyl ether phczs resemble pcdd fs in chemical structure with planar molecular conformations that indicate environmental persistence and promote toxicity guo et al 2017 in fact the dioxin like toxicity of certain phczs to rat cells and breast cancer cells as well as zebrafish embryos have been discovered mumbo et al 2015 riddell et al 2015 fang et al 2016 the biomagnification of phczs was also reported in the food chain of bivalve sport fish harbor seal in the san francisco bay usa wu et al 2017 as such phczs were called nitrogenated dioxins and considered novel persistent organic pollutants guo et al 2014 wu et al 2017 although certain information on their occurrence and toxicity in environment was disclosed the origin of these various phcz congeners was substantially unknown halogenated indigo dyes were considered to be potential sources of 1 8 dibromo 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 18 b 36 ccz and some other phczs as they may be formed as by products in the synthesis of halogenated indigo dyes parette et al 2015 natural origin was also considered since certain phczs were formed under the catalysis of chloroperoxidase from caldariomyces fumago in water mumbo et al 2013 chen et al 2017 limited information of phczs makes it impossible to fully explain the wide distribution of phczs detected in the environment as a compound listed on the high production list of oecd 2015 carbazole cz is an excellent raw material widely used in various industries including dyes medicines insecticides and optoelectronics benedik et al 1998 morin et al 2005 sumpter and miller 2009 cz can be easily emitted into the environment as it was released from above industrial materials after disposal but also produced from other sources such as combustion of biomass and waste incineration benedik et al 1998 glarborg et al 2003 altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 fromme et al 2018 cz has been reported at levels of 0 5 μg l in source water samples from a drinking water treatment plant in usa stackelberg et al 2007 and has been detected as the dominant contaminant at the maximum concentration of 18 mg kg dw in sediment from a creosote oil contaminated harbor in puget sound wa krone et al 1986 chlorination is a typical process widely used for disinfection of drinking water cleaning solution and bleaching textiles and paper pulp but also processes halogenated chemicals in water previous studies confirmed that dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofuran and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can be transformed into pcdd fs as well as chlorinated pahs cl pahs during aqueous chlorination due to the electrophilic attack by the active chlorine species lafleur et al 1990 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 cz is a potential precursor of phczs in aquatic systems during chlorination in water treatment to date the process and the mechanism of cz transforming into phczs in chlorination is not clear the formation and speciation of halogenated compounds could be closely related to commonly existing chemical species presented in water chlorination bromide is naturally present in source water at concentrations ranging from 0 024 to 4 13 mg l pan and zhang 2013 it has been well recognized that bromide in water increased the structural complexity of the halogenated products during aqueous chlorination brominated organic compounds usually have more toxicologic potency than those of chlorinated ones zhai and zhang 2011 hua and reckhow 2012 liu et al 2018 although limit studies have shown that chlorinated carbazoles can be formed during aqueous chlorination xu et al 2017 the effect of bromide and other factors such as ph value and chlorination type on the formation and speciation of phczs during water chlorination were seldomly reported before in this study a variety of chlorinated brominated and mixed chlorinated brominated czs were found in the chlorinated drinking water the objectives of the study were to 1 identify and characterize the structure of the produced phczs 2 reveal the effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs in water chlorination 3 model the speciation of phczs and

until pretreatment in this study chlorinated drinking water was prepared following previous literatures pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 firstly a series of simulated source water were prepared with ultrapure water containing 2 mg l nom as c 100 mg l nahco3 as caco3 simulated the alkalinity in source water different levels of kbr as br i e 0 1 25 5 12 5 25 and 50 μm and different levels of cz i e 0 12 and 120 nm those concentrations of cz were chosen based on the reported concentrations in the source water from a drinking water treatment plant stackelberg et al 2007 the simulated drinking water samples were then prepared by dosing the simulated source water with naocl or nh2cl 5 mg l as cl2 at different ph values 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and keeping without headspace in darkness at 21 c for various contact times 0 5 3 6 12 and 24 h after reaction the residual disinfectant in each sample was immediately quenched by na2so3 as described before a series of phczs was identified in the simulated drinking water samples and thus factors in source water including bromide concentration contact time disinfectant type and ph that may affect the formation of phczs during chlorination were examined with batch experiments a baseline experiment condition was set as a 200 ml portion of the simulated source water sample containing 12 nm cz and 5 μm kbr as br chlorinated by dosing 5 mg l naocl as cl2 for 12 h at ph 7 5 in each batch experiment one factor was changed at a time and the other factors were kept the same as those of the baseline experiment condition 2 3 extraction of phczs and cz from tap water and simulated drinking water to measure the concentrations of phczs and cz in tap water samples 5 l aliquots of tap water sample were first spiked with 20 ng each of the four surrogate standards of carbazole derivatives necz vcz pcz and 36 btbcz then the spiked water sample passed through a methanol 5 ml prewashed poly sery psd spe cartridge at a flow rate of 2 ml min and was then eluted with 8 ml of hexane ethyl acetate 1 1 v v after residual water was removed by passing the sample through na2so4 the eluate was concentrated to 100 μl for further instrumental analysis the extraction of phczs and cz from simulated drinking water proceeded as follows briefly 200 ml aliquots of water sample were first spiked with 20 ng each of four surrogate standards and saturated with na2so4 then 50 ml of hexane ethyl acetate 1 1 v v was mixed with the sample in a 300 ml flask with intense shaking the homogenates were ultrasonicated for 10 min at 20 c after 15 min the organic layer containing cz and phczs was collected and concentrated to a final volume of 100 μl for further analysis 2 4 instrumental analysis determinations of cz and its halogenated products of phczs as

min and then held for 5 min cz and phczs with commercial standards were quantified via selected ion monitoring in the electron impact ionization mode the retention time rt and mass spectrum of phczs cz and surrogate standards were confirmed using the commercial standards figs s1 and s2 the parameters used for the gc ms and the quantitative ions of each analyte are listed in table s1 2 5 quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of the chemicals were assessed by spiking water samples with a standard solution for the spiked tap water samples actual concentrations of phczs and cz were determined after subtraction of the concentrations in non spiked tap water recoveries of individual phcz congeners and cz as well as the four surrogate standards ranged from 93 3 to 103 1 in simulated source waters samples and from 92 7 to 105 4 in tap water samples precision was evaluated after replicate analysis of random samples n 5 the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 6 to 6 2 for individual phcz congeners from 1 3 to 4 1 for cz and the four surrogate standards the method limits of quantification mloqs were defined as 10 times of the signal to noise ratio for the phczs cz and four surrogate standards the mloqs were in a range from 2 6 to 9 2 ng l based on 200 ml of simulated source water and from 0 11 to 0 46 ng l based on 5 l of tap water table s1 the method detection limits mdls were defined as 3 times of the signal to noise ratio and concentrations below the mdls were considered nondetectable the concentrations of phcz and cz in water samples were calculated according to their corresponding calibration curves with the four surrogate standards standard curves exhibited good and reproducible linearity with r2 values ranging from 0 991 to 0 999 no phczs cz or surrogate standards were detected in sample blanks of simulated source water with nom at analyte volume of 200 ml concentrations of surrogate standards in tap water were measured and actual levels of surrogate standards in the spiked tap water samples were determined after subtraction of the measured concentrations for the analytes below mloqs or detected with detection frequency below 40 a regression plotting method was adopted to assign their concentrations for statistical analysis newman 1995 2 6 data analysis effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs were now investigated using the model derived from probability theory cowman and singer 1996 previously the effect of bromide concentration on the speciation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were evaluated by introducing γ to represent the ratio of the reaction rate constants of hobr to hocl with the active carbons in substance nokes et al 1999 pan and zhang 2013 for the similar reaction scheme of halogen substitution fig s3 the same parameters were applied to model the species of the four groups of phczs mono di tri and tetra halogenated group equations 1 14 were applied to model the speciation of the mono di tri and tetra halogenated group respectively the derivations of these equations referred to previous studies

respectively hobr was set to be the initial bromide concentration while hocl was set to be the difference between the initial chlorine concentration and hobr result of the γ value is presented in the following results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and relationships of phczs and cz in tap water cz and phczs were detectable in 9 out of 10 tap water samples revealing a wide distribution of these compounds in the studied waterbody table s2 the detection frequency of cz and individual phczs ranged from 0 for 2367 ccz and 27 bcz to 90 for cz while the quantification frequency ranged from 0 for 2367 ccz and 27 bcz to 80 for 36 ccz cz was below the mloq in sample 7 9 and was detected at concentrations ranging from 5 8 to 54 3 ng l in samples 1 6 table s2 meanwhile the total concentrations of quantifiable phczs phczs in samples 1 6 ranged from 9 6 to 51 9 ng l which was significantly higher than phczs in samples 7 8 ranging from 3 6 to 6 1 ng l the concentrations of 3 ccz 36 ccz 3 bcz and 36 bcz fig 1a and phczs fig 1b show significantly positive correlations with that of cz r2 0 62 0 93 p 0 01 these results suggested that the detectable chlorinated and brominated czs in tap water might be generated from cz due to the fact of disinfection of tap water using reactive chlorine species and the occurrence of bromide in source water to confirm this speculation we simulated the chlorination process of tap water to investigate the formation of phczs 3 2 identification of phczs in simulated drinking water under the full scan mode 26 phcz congeners including chloro bromo and chlorobromo mixed species were detected in the simulated drinking water samples with different concentration of bromide 0 1 25 5 12 5 25 and 50 μm table 1 this is the first time that the formation of brominated czs and mixed chlorinated brominated czs were investigated in chlorinated water structures of phczs were proposed and identified in batch experiments at ph 7 5 for 12 h identification of the compound with m z 312 9 313 9 314 9 315 9 316 9 317 9 318 9 at rt of 22 34 min p7 is exemplified here fig s4g shows the extract ion 312 9 or 314 9 chromatogram of the simulated drinking water sample with a bromide concentration of 5 μm from the corresponding mass spectra at rt of 22 34 min fig s5g the isotopic abundance ratio of the molecular ion m of this compound shown in the dashed line box was found to be 11 2 17 3 8 1 1 3 which matched well with the theoretical isotopic ratio of formula c12h6cl2brn containing 2 cl and 1 br the fragment clusters or ions at m z 277 9 279 9 234 236 198 1 and 164 1 in mass spectra fig s5g indicated the loss of one cl m cl one br m br clbr m clbr and cl2br m cl2br from the molecular ion fragment ion m z 164 1 appeared in the mass spectra also indicated the backbone of substituted czs guo et al 2014 furthermore another ion fragment at m z 137 1 was observed and assumed to be ion of m cl2br cnh from the fragmentation pattern this compound was proposed to be monobromo dichlorocarbazole fig s1 and fig s2j show the ion chromatogram and mass spectra of 1 b 36 ccz standard solution at rt of 22 32 min the same rt and identical mass spectra confirmed that the compound p7 was 1 b 36 ccz it is notable that other two peaks appearing in the extracted ion chromatogram at 22 20 min and 20 78 min fig s4g with the same molecular ion cluster m of 312 9 313 9 314 9 315 9 316 9 317 9 318 9 and the similar mass spectra to p7 were suggested to be isomers of p7 and were then labeled as p7 and p7 similarly 3 ccz p1 36 ccz p2 1368 ccz p4 3 bcz p5 36 bcz p9 18 b 36 ccz p11 136 bcz p12 and 1368 bcz p14 were identified in the simulated drinking water samples figs s1 s2 and s4 besides those nine phczs verified with commercial standards we found another five new phcz congeners as trichlorocarbazole fig s4c monobromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4f monobromo trichlorocarbazole fig s4h dibromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4j and tribromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4m which were identified by the full mass spectra figs s5c f h j and m and the rt relative to the other phczs with similar structures due to the lack of available standards it is noted that 27 bcz and 2367 ccz was not detectable in the simulated drinking water besides the products of p1 p2 p5 p6 p9 and p10 we also detected their corresponding isomers of p1 p2 p5 p6 p6 p6 p6 p9 p10 and p10 at corresponding rts 3 3 formation mechanism and structure deduction of phczs in chlorinated water the halogenation mechanism of cz consists of halogen substitution reactions on the phenyl rings in carbazole through electrophilic attacking by active halogen 9 position amine nh of carbazole is a strong electron donating group which activates the electrophilic substitution reaction and thus halogen substitutions on cz are much easier than those on dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofuran and pahs compounds containing no strong electron donating groups lafleur et al 1990 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in aqueous chlorination hocl hobr substituted onto cz resulting in the breakage of c h bond of phenyl ring in carbazole to form the various phczs as demonstrated in table 1 the fukui based electrophilic index f 1 r describes the reactivity of electrophilic attack on a specific site within a molecule which the larger value of f 1 r on a certain atom reflects the more probability that this atom be accessible to electrophilic attack parr and yang 1984 the calculated values of f 1 r and the testing experimental data suggest that the tendency of cz undergoing halogenation via electrophilic substitution follows the sequence of 3 6 1 8 4 5 2 guo et al 2014 altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 based on the tendency and experimental data xu et al 2017 reported that two monochlorocarbazoles generated in chlorinated water were 3 ccz and 1 chlorocarbazole 1 ccz where 3 ccz was the dominant one our results also verified these conclusions that two monochlorocarbazole isomers p1 and p1 were detected in simulated drinking water with the predominant species of 3 ccz p1 fig s4a similarly p5 and p5 were detected as monobromocarbazole and p5 3 bcz was the predominant species fig s4e notably no 27 bcz or 2367 ccz was detected in simulated drinking water which might be caused by the fact that 2 and 7 positions were not the favored sites of carbazole for electrophilic substitution as illustrated in fig s3 the monohalo species generated by carbazole was further transferred into dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo species via halogen substitution reaction on the remaining favored sites according to previous literature p1 and p5 in this study were identified as 1 ccz and 1 bromocarbazole 1 bcz respectively the rt of 1 ccz p1 17 20 min was shorter than that of 3 ccz p1 18 81 min while the rt of 1 bcz p5 18 12 min was shorter than that of 3 bcz p5 19 83 min in the ion chromatogram figs s4a and s4e results indicated that when a chlorine or bromine atom was attached to c1 site the rt of this phcz was shorter than that with chlorine or bromine substitution at the c3 site for 1 6 1 7 min in this study these findings are consistent to those of xu et al 2017 who found that the rt of 1 ccz was shorter than that of 3 ccz in the gc gc chromatogram similarly under the same site of substitution the rt of monochloro cz seems shorter than that of monobromo cz for 0 9 1 0 min based on the relationships of tendency of favored site substitution generation quantities reflected in the peak areas and rts of chemicals in this study we deduced that the structures of the products p3 p6 p8 p10 p13 p1 p2 p5 p6 p6 p6 p6 p7 p7 p9 p10 and p10 in the simulated drinking water were 1 3 6 trichlorocarbazole 136 ccz 3 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 3 b 6 ccz 1 bromo 3 6 8 chlorocarbazole 1 b 368 ccz 1 3 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 13 b 6 ccz 1 3 8 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 138 b 6 ccz 1 chlorocarbazole 1 6 chlorocarbazole 1 bromocarbazole 3 bromo 8 chlorocarbazole 1 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 6 bromo 8 chlorocarbazole 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole 3 bromo 1 6 chlorocarbazole 6 bromo 1 3 chlorocarbazole 1 6 bromocarbazole 1 6 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole and 3 6 bromo 1 chlorocarbazole respectively it should be noted that these proposed structures might be different from their actual skeletons thus additional studies or chemical standards are needed to confirm the exact positions of the halogen substituents in those phczs 3 4 effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs effect of bromide concentration on the formation of phczs was investigated at contact time of 12 h and ph 7 5 for the simulated drinking water with bromide concentrations of 0 1 25 5 00 12 50 25 00 and 50 00 μm the whole pictures of 14 major reflected as the peak area phczs p1 p14 are shown in fig 2a f respectively it is not surprising to find that with increasing of bromide concentration the level of chloro czs p1 p2 p3 and p4 kept decreasing while the level of bromo czs p5 p9 p12 and p14 kept increasing in simulated drinking water samples for a better investigation of the effect of bromide concentration on the phczs formation standards of the nine phcz congeners p1 p2 p4 p5 p7 p9 p11 p12 and p14 were used concentrations of these nine phczs and their corresponding isomers in the six samples were measured directly using commercial standards for the lack of available standards concentrations of the other five phczs including p3 136 ccz p6 3 b 6 ccz p8 1 b 368 ccz p10 13 b 6 ccz and p13 138 b 6 ccz and their corresponding isomers were estimated by the calibration curve of 36 ccz 3 bcz 1 b 36 ccz 18 b 26 ccz and 136 bcz respectively based on the assumptions shown in the supplemental material although these concentrations of estimation are not their actual values the approximate values also give us quantitative information for the understanding of the effect of bromide concentration on the formation of phczs in chlorination as shown in fig 3 those phczs were classified into four groups monohalo czs p1 p1 p5 and p5 dihalo czs p2 p2 p6 p6 p6 p6 p6 p9 and p9 trihalo czs p3 p7 p7 p7 p10 p10 p10 and p12 and tetrahalo czs p4 p8 p11 p13 and p14 based on the number of halogen substitution phczs containing more than five halogen atoms were not detected or below the mdls in this study with the increase of bromide concentration the solely chlorinated species were dominant at first in each group and then the mixed chlorinated brominated species took over until the solely brominated species became dominant all these indicated that within each group of the phczs increasing the bromide concentration shifted the chlorinated species to the corresponding chlorobromo mixed species and then to the corresponding solely brominated species this kind of shift is not new for a group of dbps such as thms or aromatic halogenated compounds nokes et al 1999 pan and zhang 2013 but it is the first time that such a shift was demonstrated in the formation of phczs during aqueous chlorination besides comparing the solely brominated species at 50 μm bromide and the solely chlorinated species with no bromide in each group the concentration of solely brominated species were much higher than those of solely chlorinated species indicating that increasing bromide concentration also promote the conversion of cz to phczs in aqueous chlorination these results are also shown in fig 4a and b in which 20 1 24 5 of cz was converted to phczs with the absence of bromide while 56 0 61 4 of cz was converted to phczs at the concentration of 50 μm bromide notably with the increase of bromide concentration concentrations of solely chlorinated species and mixed chlorinated brominated species in each group kept decreasing suggesting that not only those phczs but also brominated species could be converted into more halogenated species with further halogen substitution why these phczs are mostly converted into polybrominated species rather than polychlorinated species will be explained in the following modeling section 3 5 modeling of the species of the four groups of phczs the best fitting γ values for the four groups of phczs monohalo dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo species are calculated as 23 7 0 9 45 6 1 47 5 2 6 and 26 6 1 5 respectively by the least squares nonlinear regression of the experimental data with the equations 1 14 fig 5 the experimental speciation data and modeling results were compared in each of the four groups using statistical indicators of the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 notably the speciation patterns of the four groups of phczs matched well with those obtained from the model equations at the best fitting γ values as the rmse values fell within the range of 0 01 0 05 and the r2 values fell within the range of 0 95 0 99 the best fitting γ value of 23 7 0 9 for monohalo czs means that under the condition of these experiments hobr is approximately 23 7 0 9 times more reactive than hocl in electrophilic halogen substitution reactions forming monohalo czs fig 5a the higher electrophilicity of hobr compared to the corresponding hocl may be attributed to the more positive partial atomic charge of bromine 0 22 mulliken atomic charge calculated using the dft method with the b3lyp 6 31g basis set in gaussian 09 in hobr than that of chlorine 0 14 in hocl as a higher electrophilicity is expected for a higher positive partial atomic charge heeb et al 2017 the γ value in reactions forming dihalo cz γ 45 6 1 fig 5b was approximately 2 times higher than that of forming monohalo cz γ 23 7 0 9 fig 5a indicating that the reactivity difference between hobr and hocl in reactions with cz or phczs was significantly affected by the number of available halogen substituents on them the best fitting γ values of the four groups of phczs are in the range of 23 7 47 5 that are similar with another group of aromatic halogenated compounds for which the γ values ranged from 25 to 40 pan and zhang 2013 these γ values are larger than those of the alkyl halogenated compounds of thms and haas γ values of 9 25 cowman and singer 1996 nokes et al 1999 chang et al 2001 indicating that the reactivity differences between hobr and hocl in reactions forming the aromatic halogenated compounds might be larger than those in reactions forming alkyl halogenated compounds the high γ values of phczs 23 7 47 5 reflected the cz or phczs containing few halogen substituents were mostly converted into polybrominated species rather than polychlorinated species with increasing of bromide concentration 3 6 effects of reagent ratio contact time chlorination type and ph on the formation of phczs the formation of phczs was investigated in simulated drinking water with 12 nm and 120 nm cz both at bromide concentration of 5 μm ph 7 5 and contact times from 0 5 to 24 h the concentrations of monohalo dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo czs in both groups of 12 nm fig 6a and 120 nm fig 6b cz began to decrease after reaching the maximum levels before 0 5 3 and 6 h and then reached stable before 12 h many phczs detected in the first 0 5 h in both groups indicated that phczs generated quickly in aqueous chlorination under appropriate conditions at 0 5 h the trihalo czs accounted for 25 5 0 8 of phczs in 12 nm group naocl as cl2 cz 5867 1 which were higher than those of 15 9 0 3 in 120 nm group naocl cz 587 1 fig 6a and b indicating that the high molar ratio of naocl cz accelerated the transformation of cz to halogenated cz compared with 0 5 h phczs at 12 h decreased by 34 9 and 28 3 in 12 nm and 120 nm groups respectively indicating that the formed phczs could be decomposed during prolonged chlorination when the residual chlorine in water was reduced to 0 07 1 0 mg l after 12 h fig s6 the degradation rates of phczs became slow and the concentration of phczs in water seemed stable although the four groups of halogenated czs decomposed for further chlorination from 6 to 24 h the mole fraction of each phcz in corresponding halogenated group was not significantly changed fig s7 suggesting the decomposing rates of phczs with the same number of halogens were almost the same the formation of phczs was compared between chlorination and chloramination species numbers and concentrations of phczs were higher in chlorination fig 6b than those in chloramination fig 6c across the contact times this difference should be caused by the stronger oxidation ability of hocl ocl in chlorination than those of nh2cl nhcl2 in chloramination the effect of ph on the formation of phczs was investigated in the general range of 6 9 for water treatment with increasing ph from 6 to 9 the contents of cz converted into phczs were dramatically decreased by 56 4 3 3 and 52 8 2 8 in 12 and 120 nm groups respectively fig 6d beside the easier decomposition of halogenated compounds in alkaline solution than that of acid solution zhai and zhang 2011 this result might also be caused by the decreasing oxidation capacity of naocl naobr for phczs generation as more dissociation of hocl hobr would happen in alkaline solution than that of acid one michałowicz et al 2007 additionally as the ph increased more cz were converted into other substances indicating that cz itself was not stable under chlorination conditions additionally it should be noted that 2 mg l of nom was included into the simulated source water as typical substances in source water nom may compete with cz to react with hobr hocl nokes et al 1999 in addition to the experiment with 2 mg l of nom the formation of phczs in the experiment without nom was also investigated under the conditions of ph 7 5 contact time 12 h naocl 70 4 μm or 5 mg l cz 120 nm and br 5 μm however there is no significant difference of the formation species and the concentration of each species of phczs in the experiment with 2 mg l of nom compared to those of the corresponding results in the experiment without nom fig s8 this result may be caused by the sufficient naocl 70 4 μm or 5 mg l as cl2 as compared with the concentration of cz 120 nm and nom 2 mg l under the condition of sufficient naocl low concentration of nom may not cause significant interference with the conversion of cz to phczs 4 conclusion chlorination is ubiquitously used for disinfection of drinking water or sewage drainage as well as the bleaching of paper pulp for hundred years nom is usually less than 3 mg l and the ph of natural source water is 6 9 the identification of various phcz congeners under these conditions indicated that chlorination process might be an important source for phczs in drinking water in this study 36 ccz and 36 bcz were the most abundant species in samples with bromide concentrations from 0 to 1 25 μm and 12 5 50 μm respectively results are in accordance with the distribution of phcz congeners in aquatic environment in which 36 ccz and 36 bcz was the dominant species guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 suggesting that phczs in environment were potentially generated from aqueous chlorination increasing bromide levels shifts the species of phczs from chlorinated to being more brominated species and increased the formation of the total phczs the successful modeling of the speciation of phczs can facilitate the prediction of their relative distribution in chlorinated water with different bromide concentrations this study shed light on the genesis of phczs in water environment acknowledgements we acknowledge

18780,although polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments studies on their source and formation are extremely scarce after investigation of phczs and carbazole in drinking water an overlooked formation route of chloro bromo czs was now proposed as aqueous chlorination of residual carbazole under bromide condition four groups of phcz including mono di tri and tetra halogenated groups were identified in chlorinated drinking water and the mechanism of the formation of the four groups of phczs was proposed twenty six phcz congeners including chloro bromo and chlorobromo mixed species were thoroughly studied and it was revealed for the first time the four groups of phczs shifted from chlorinated to being more brominated with increasing bromide level the speciation of the four groups of phczs was modeled it was revealed that the shift of phczs from chlorinated to being more brominated was caused by the reactivity differences between hocl and hobr in reactions forming phczs furthermore this study revealed that the species numbers and concentrations of phczs formed in chlorination were much higher than those in chloramination and the formation of phczs was decreased by 50 with an increase of ph from 6 0 to 9 0 this study of the variety of phczs in chlorinated water is an important step toward revealing the occurrence of phczs in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords halogenated carbazole formation pathway drinking water bromide influence factors 1 introduction polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs with structures similar to polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofurans pcdd fs are a series of emerging organohalogen contaminants in recent decades more than 20 phcz congeners have been detected in soil and sediment as well as organisms from different regions pena abaurrea et al 2014 mumbo et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for instance 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 36 ccz was screened in the sediments of lippe river germany kronimus et al 2004 3 chlorocarbazole 3 ccz 36 ccz and dibromocarbazole were detected at the concentrations up to 110 3500 and 93 ng g dw in the soils of the coastal industrial area of kavala greece grigoriadou and schwarzbauer 2011 and 17 phczs including br2 br2cl br3 br3cl br3cli br3i2 br4 br4cl br4i and br5 carbazole were detected in the sediments of lake michigan usa guo et al 2014 except the variety of congeners the concentrations of phczs in some regions reach or exceed those of the well known organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers zhu and hites 2005 guo et al 2017 found that the total phczs accumulation in the sediments of the upper great lakes was more than 3000 tons which was several orders of magnitude higher than pcbs and decabromodiphenyl ether phczs resemble pcdd fs in chemical structure with planar molecular conformations that indicate environmental persistence and promote toxicity guo et al 2017 in fact the dioxin like toxicity of certain phczs to rat cells and breast cancer cells as well as zebrafish embryos have been discovered mumbo et al 2015 riddell et al 2015 fang et al 2016 the biomagnification of phczs was also reported in the food chain of bivalve sport fish harbor seal in the san francisco bay usa wu et al 2017 as such phczs were called nitrogenated dioxins and considered novel persistent organic pollutants guo et al 2014 wu et al 2017 although certain information on their occurrence and toxicity in environment was disclosed the origin of these various phcz congeners was substantially unknown halogenated indigo dyes were considered to be potential sources of 1 8 dibromo 3 6 dichlorocarbazole 18 b 36 ccz and some other phczs as they may be formed as by products in the synthesis of halogenated indigo dyes parette et al 2015 natural origin was also considered since certain phczs were formed under the catalysis of chloroperoxidase from caldariomyces fumago in water mumbo et al 2013 chen et al 2017 limited information of phczs makes it impossible to fully explain the wide distribution of phczs detected in the environment as a compound listed on the high production list of oecd 2015 carbazole cz is an excellent raw material widely used in various industries including dyes medicines insecticides and optoelectronics benedik et al 1998 morin et al 2005 sumpter and miller 2009 cz can be easily emitted into the environment as it was released from above industrial materials after disposal but also produced from other sources such as combustion of biomass and waste incineration benedik et al 1998 glarborg et al 2003 altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 fromme et al 2018 cz has been reported at levels of 0 5 μg l in source water samples from a drinking water treatment plant in usa stackelberg et al 2007 and has been detected as the dominant contaminant at the maximum concentration of 18 mg kg dw in sediment from a creosote oil contaminated harbor in puget sound wa krone et al 1986 chlorination is a typical process widely used for disinfection of drinking water cleaning solution and bleaching textiles and paper pulp but also processes halogenated chemicals in water previous studies confirmed that dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofuran and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can be transformed into pcdd fs as well as chlorinated pahs cl pahs during aqueous chlorination due to the electrophilic attack by the active chlorine species lafleur et al 1990 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 cz is a potential precursor of phczs in aquatic systems during chlorination in water treatment to date the process and the mechanism of cz transforming into phczs in chlorination is not clear the formation and speciation of halogenated compounds could be closely related to commonly existing chemical species presented in water chlorination bromide is naturally present in source water at concentrations ranging from 0 024 to 4 13 mg l pan and zhang 2013 it has been well recognized that bromide in water increased the structural complexity of the halogenated products during aqueous chlorination brominated organic compounds usually have more toxicologic potency than those of chlorinated ones zhai and zhang 2011 hua and reckhow 2012 liu et al 2018 although limit studies have shown that chlorinated carbazoles can be formed during aqueous chlorination xu et al 2017 the effect of bromide and other factors such as ph value and chlorination type on the formation and speciation of phczs during water chlorination were seldomly reported before in this study a variety of chlorinated brominated and mixed chlorinated brominated czs were found in the chlorinated drinking water the objectives of the study were to 1 identify and characterize the structure of the produced phczs 2 reveal the effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs in water chlorination 3 model the speciation of phczs and

drinking water ten tap water samples ph 7 0 7 9 were collected from ten drinking water treatment plants supply area in the city of wuhan china in april 2018 disinfectant residuals in samples ranged from 0 04 to 0 07 mg l as cl2 and were quenched immediately by na2so3 with a 60 excess of molar amount of naocl as cl2 all samples were shipped with ice packs to the lab and kept refrigerated 4 c until pretreatment in this study chlorinated drinking water was prepared following previous literatures pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 firstly a series of simulated source water were prepared with ultrapure water containing 2 mg l nom as c 100 mg l nahco3 as caco3 simulated the alkalinity in source water different levels of kbr as br i e 0 1 25 5 12 5 25 and 50 μm and different levels of cz i e 0 12 and 120 nm those concentrations of cz were chosen based on the reported concentrations in the source water from a drinking water treatment plant stackelberg et al 2007 the simulated drinking water samples were then prepared by dosing the simulated source water with naocl or nh2cl 5 mg l as cl2 at different ph values 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and keeping without headspace in darkness at 21 c for various contact times 0 5 3 6 12 and 24 h after reaction the residual disinfectant in each sample was immediately quenched by na2so3 as described before a series of phczs was identified in the simulated drinking water samples and thus factors in source water including bromide concentration contact time disinfectant type and ph that may affect the formation of phczs during chlorination were examined with batch experiments a baseline experiment condition was set as a 200 ml portion of the simulated source water sample containing 12 nm cz and 5 μm kbr as br chlorinated by dosing 5 mg l naocl as cl2 for 12 h at ph 7 5 in each batch experiment one factor was changed at a time and the other factors were kept the same as those of the baseline experiment condition 2 3 extraction of phczs and cz from tap water and simulated drinking water to measure the concentrations of phczs and cz in tap water samples 5 l aliquots of tap water sample were first spiked with 20 ng each of the four surrogate standards of carbazole derivatives necz vcz pcz and 36 btbcz then the spiked water sample passed through a methanol 5 ml prewashed poly sery psd spe cartridge at a flow rate of 2 ml min and was then eluted with 8 ml of hexane ethyl acetate 1 1 v v after residual water was removed by passing the sample through na2so4 the eluate was concentrated to 100 μl for further instrumental analysis the extraction of phczs and cz from simulated drinking water proceeded as follows briefly 200 ml aliquots of water sample were first spiked with 20 ng each of four surrogate standards and saturated with na2so4 then 50 ml of hexane ethyl acetate 1 1 v v was mixed with the sample in a 300 ml flask with intense shaking the homogenates were ultrasonicated for 10 min at 20 c after 15 min the organic layer containing cz and phczs was collected and concentrated to a final volume of 100 μl for further analysis 2 4 instrumental analysis determinations of cz and its halogenated products of phczs as well as the surrogate standards were conducted on an agilent 7890b gas chromatography gc agilent tech usa coupled with a single quadrupole mass analyzer agilent 5977a ms wu et al 2016 the injector temperature was held at 250 c and helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 0 ml min 1 μl sample was injected into gc ms equipped with a 30 m hp 5ms capillary column 0 25 mm i d 0 25

min and then held for 5 min cz and phczs with commercial standards were quantified via selected ion monitoring in the electron impact ionization mode the retention time rt and mass spectrum of phczs cz and surrogate standards were confirmed using the commercial standards figs s1 and s2 the parameters used for the gc ms and the quantitative ions of each analyte are listed in table s1 2 5 quality assurance and quality control the recoveries of the chemicals were assessed by spiking water samples with a standard solution for the spiked tap water samples actual concentrations of phczs and cz were determined after subtraction of the concentrations in non spiked tap water recoveries of individual phcz congeners and cz as well as the four surrogate standards ranged from 93 3 to 103 1 in simulated source waters samples and from 92 7 to 105 4 in tap water samples precision was evaluated after replicate analysis of random samples n 5 the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 6 to 6 2 for individual phcz congeners from 1 3 to 4 1 for cz and the four surrogate standards the method limits of quantification mloqs were defined as 10 times of the signal to noise ratio for the phczs cz and four surrogate standards the mloqs were in a range from 2 6 to 9 2 ng l based on 200 ml of simulated source water and from 0 11 to 0 46 ng l based on 5 l of tap water table s1 the method detection limits mdls were defined as 3 times of the signal to noise ratio and concentrations below the mdls were considered nondetectable the concentrations of phcz and cz in water samples were calculated according to their corresponding calibration curves with the four surrogate standards standard curves exhibited good and reproducible linearity with r2 values ranging from 0 991 to 0 999 no phczs cz or surrogate standards were detected in sample blanks of simulated source water with nom at analyte volume of 200 ml concentrations of surrogate standards in tap water were measured and actual levels of surrogate standards in the spiked tap water samples were determined after subtraction of the measured concentrations for the analytes below mloqs or detected with detection frequency below 40 a regression plotting method was adopted to assign their concentrations for statistical analysis newman 1995 2 6 data analysis effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs were now investigated using the model derived from probability theory cowman and singer 1996 previously the effect of bromide concentration on the speciation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were evaluated by introducing γ to represent the ratio of the reaction rate constants of hobr to hocl with the active carbons in substance nokes et al 1999 pan and zhang 2013 for the similar reaction scheme of halogen substitution fig s3 the same parameters were applied to model the species of the four groups of phczs mono di tri and tetra halogenated group equations 1 14 were applied to model the speciation of the mono di tri and tetra halogenated group respectively the derivations of these equations referred to previous studies

following results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and relationships of phczs and cz in tap water cz and phczs were detectable in 9 out of 10 tap water samples revealing a wide distribution of these compounds in the studied waterbody table s2 the detection frequency of cz and individual phczs ranged from 0 for 2367 ccz and 27 bcz to 90 for cz while the quantification frequency ranged from 0 for 2367 ccz and 27 bcz to 80 for 36 ccz cz was below the mloq in sample 7 9 and was detected at concentrations ranging from 5 8 to 54 3 ng l in samples 1 6 table s2 meanwhile the total concentrations of quantifiable phczs phczs in samples 1 6 ranged from 9 6 to 51 9 ng l which was significantly higher than phczs in samples 7 8 ranging from 3 6 to 6 1 ng l the concentrations of 3 ccz 36 ccz 3 bcz and 36 bcz fig 1a and phczs fig 1b show significantly positive correlations with that of cz r2 0 62 0 93 p 0 01 these results suggested that the detectable chlorinated and brominated czs in tap water might be generated from cz due to the fact of disinfection of tap water using reactive chlorine species and the occurrence of bromide in source water to confirm this speculation we simulated the chlorination process of tap water to investigate the formation of phczs 3 2 identification of phczs in simulated drinking water under the full scan mode 26 phcz congeners including chloro bromo and chlorobromo mixed species were detected in the simulated drinking water samples with different concentration of bromide 0 1 25 5 12 5 25 and 50 μm table 1

s4g with the same molecular ion cluster m of 312 9 313 9 314 9 315 9 316 9 317 9 318 9 and the similar mass spectra to p7 were suggested to be isomers of p7 and were then labeled as p7 and p7 similarly 3 ccz p1 36 ccz p2 1368 ccz p4 3 bcz p5 36 bcz p9 18 b 36 ccz p11 136 bcz p12 and 1368 bcz p14 were identified in the simulated drinking water samples figs s1 s2 and s4 besides those nine phczs verified with commercial standards we found another five new phcz congeners as trichlorocarbazole fig s4c monobromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4f monobromo trichlorocarbazole fig s4h dibromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4j and tribromo monochlorocarbazole fig s4m which were identified by the full mass spectra figs s5c f h j and m and the rt relative to the other phczs with similar structures due to the lack of available standards it is noted that 27 bcz and 2367 ccz was not detectable in the simulated drinking water besides the products of p1 p2 p5 p6 p9 and p10 we also detected their corresponding isomers of p1 p2 p5 p6 p6 p6 p6 p9 p10 and p10 at corresponding rts 3 3 formation mechanism and structure deduction of phczs in chlorinated water the halogenation mechanism of cz consists of halogen substitution reactions on the phenyl rings in carbazole through electrophilic attacking by active halogen 9 position amine nh of carbazole is a strong electron donating group which activates the electrophilic substitution reaction and thus halogen substitutions on cz are much easier than those on dibenzo p dioxin dibenzofuran and pahs compounds containing no strong electron donating groups lafleur et al 1990 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in aqueous chlorination hocl hobr substituted onto cz resulting in the breakage of c h bond of phenyl ring in carbazole to form the various phczs as demonstrated in table 1 the fukui based electrophilic index f 1 r describes the reactivity of electrophilic attack on a specific site within a molecule which the larger value of f 1 r on a certain atom reflects the more probability that this atom be accessible to electrophilic attack parr and yang 1984 the calculated values of f 1 r and the testing experimental data suggest that the tendency of cz undergoing halogenation via electrophilic substitution follows the sequence of 3 6 1 8 4 5 2 guo et al 2014 altarawneh and dlugogorski 2015 based on the tendency and experimental data xu et al 2017 reported that two monochlorocarbazoles generated in chlorinated water were 3 ccz and 1 chlorocarbazole 1 ccz where 3 ccz was the dominant one our results also verified these conclusions that two monochlorocarbazole isomers p1 and p1 were detected in simulated drinking water with the predominant species of 3 ccz p1 fig s4a similarly p5 and p5 were detected as monobromocarbazole and p5 3 bcz was the predominant species fig s4e notably no 27 bcz or 2367 ccz was detected in simulated drinking water which might be caused by the fact that 2 and 7 positions were not the favored sites of carbazole for electrophilic substitution as illustrated in fig s3 the monohalo species generated by carbazole was further transferred into dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo species via halogen substitution reaction on the remaining favored sites according to previous literature p1 and p5 in this study were identified as 1 ccz and 1 bromocarbazole 1 bcz respectively the rt of 1 ccz p1 17 20 min was shorter than that of 3 ccz p1 18 81 min while the rt of 1 bcz p5 18 12 min was shorter than that of 3 bcz p5 19 83 min in the ion chromatogram figs s4a and s4e results indicated that when a chlorine or bromine atom was attached to c1 site the rt of this phcz was shorter than that with chlorine or bromine substitution at the c3 site for 1 6 1 7 min in this study these findings are consistent to those of xu et al 2017 who found that the rt of 1 ccz was shorter than that of 3 ccz in the gc gc chromatogram similarly under the same site of substitution the rt of monochloro cz seems shorter than that of monobromo cz for 0 9 1 0 min based on the relationships of tendency of favored site substitution generation quantities reflected in the peak areas and rts of chemicals in this study we deduced that the structures of the products p3 p6 p8 p10 p13 p1 p2 p5 p6 p6 p6 p6 p7 p7 p9 p10 and p10 in the simulated drinking water were 1 3 6 trichlorocarbazole 136 ccz 3 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 3 b 6 ccz 1 bromo 3 6 8 chlorocarbazole 1 b 368 ccz 1 3 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 13 b 6 ccz 1 3 8 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 138 b 6 ccz 1 chlorocarbazole 1 6 chlorocarbazole 1 bromocarbazole 3 bromo 8 chlorocarbazole 1 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole 6 bromo 8 chlorocarbazole 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole 3 bromo 1 6 chlorocarbazole 6 bromo 1 3 chlorocarbazole 1 6 bromocarbazole 1 6 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole and 3 6 bromo 1 chlorocarbazole respectively it should be noted that these proposed structures might be different from their actual skeletons thus additional studies or chemical standards are needed to confirm the exact positions of the halogen substituents in those phczs 3 4 effect of bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of phczs effect of bromide concentration on the formation of phczs was investigated at contact time of 12 h and ph 7 5 for the simulated drinking water with bromide concentrations of 0 1 25 5 00 12 50 25 00 and 50 00 μm the whole pictures of 14 major reflected as the peak area phczs p1 p14 are shown in fig 2a f respectively it is not surprising to find that with increasing of bromide concentration the level of chloro czs p1 p2 p3 and p4 kept decreasing while the level of bromo czs p5 p9 p12 and p14 kept increasing in simulated drinking water samples for a better investigation of the effect of bromide concentration on the phczs formation standards of the nine phcz congeners p1 p2 p4 p5 p7 p9 p11 p12 and p14 were used concentrations of these nine phczs and their corresponding isomers in the six samples were measured directly using commercial standards for the lack of available standards concentrations of the other five phczs including p3 136 ccz p6 3 b 6 ccz p8 1 b 368 ccz p10 13 b 6 ccz and p13 138 b 6 ccz and their corresponding isomers were estimated by the calibration curve of 36 ccz 3 bcz 1 b 36 ccz 18 b 26 ccz and 136 bcz respectively based on the assumptions shown in the supplemental material although these concentrations of estimation are not their actual values the approximate values also give us quantitative information for the understanding of the effect of bromide concentration on the formation of phczs in chlorination as shown in fig 3 those phczs were classified into four groups monohalo czs p1 p1 p5 and p5 dihalo czs p2 p2 p6 p6 p6 p6 p6 p9 and p9 trihalo czs p3 p7 p7 p7 p10 p10 p10 and p12 and tetrahalo czs p4 p8 p11 p13 and p14 based on the number of halogen substitution phczs containing more than five halogen atoms were not detected or below the mdls in this study with the increase of bromide concentration the solely chlorinated species were dominant at first in each group and then the mixed chlorinated brominated species took over until the solely brominated species became dominant all these indicated that within each group of the phczs increasing the bromide concentration shifted the chlorinated species to the corresponding chlorobromo mixed species and then to the corresponding solely brominated species this kind of shift is not new for a group of dbps such as thms or aromatic halogenated compounds nokes et al 1999 pan and zhang 2013 but it is the first time that such a shift was demonstrated in the formation of phczs during aqueous chlorination besides comparing the solely brominated species at 50 μm bromide and the solely chlorinated species with no bromide in each group the concentration of solely brominated species were much higher than those of solely chlorinated species indicating that increasing bromide concentration also promote the conversion of cz to phczs in aqueous chlorination these results are also shown in fig 4a and b in which 20 1 24 5 of cz was converted to phczs with the absence of bromide while 56 0 61 4 of cz was converted to phczs at the concentration of 50 μm bromide notably with the increase of bromide concentration concentrations of solely chlorinated species and mixed chlorinated brominated species in each group kept decreasing suggesting that not only those phczs but also brominated species could be converted into more halogenated species with further halogen substitution why these phczs are mostly converted into polybrominated species rather than polychlorinated species will be explained in the following modeling section 3 5 modeling of the species of the four groups of phczs the best fitting γ values for the four groups of phczs monohalo dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo species are calculated as 23 7 0 9 45 6 1 47 5 2 6 and 26 6 1 5 respectively by the least squares nonlinear regression of the experimental data with the equations 1 14 fig 5 the experimental speciation data and modeling results were compared in each of the four groups using statistical indicators of the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 notably the speciation patterns of the four groups of phczs matched well with those obtained from the model equations at the best fitting γ values as the rmse values fell within the range of 0 01 0 05 and the r2 values fell within the range of 0 95 0 99 the best fitting γ value of 23 7 0 9 for monohalo czs means that under the condition of these experiments hobr is approximately 23 7 0 9 times more reactive than hocl in electrophilic halogen substitution reactions forming monohalo czs fig 5a the higher electrophilicity of hobr compared to the corresponding hocl may be attributed to the more positive partial atomic charge of bromine 0 22 mulliken atomic charge calculated using the dft method with the b3lyp 6 31g basis set in gaussian 09 in hobr than that of chlorine 0 14 in hocl as a higher electrophilicity is expected for a higher positive partial atomic charge heeb et al 2017 the γ value in reactions forming dihalo cz γ 45 6 1 fig 5b was approximately 2 times higher than that of forming monohalo cz γ 23 7 0 9 fig 5a indicating that the reactivity difference between hobr and hocl in reactions with cz or phczs was significantly affected by the number of available halogen substituents on them the best fitting γ values of the four groups of phczs are in the range of 23 7 47 5 that are similar with another group of aromatic halogenated compounds for which the γ values ranged from 25 to 40 pan and zhang 2013 these γ values are larger than those of the alkyl halogenated compounds of thms and haas γ values of 9 25 cowman and singer 1996 nokes et al 1999 chang et al 2001 indicating that the reactivity differences between hobr and hocl in reactions forming the aromatic halogenated compounds might be larger than those in reactions forming alkyl halogenated compounds the high γ values of phczs 23 7 47 5 reflected the cz or phczs containing few halogen substituents were mostly converted into polybrominated species rather than polychlorinated species with increasing of bromide concentration 3 6 effects of reagent ratio contact time chlorination type and ph on the formation of phczs the formation of phczs was investigated in simulated drinking water with 12 nm and 120 nm cz both at bromide concentration of 5 μm ph 7 5 and contact times from 0 5 to 24 h the concentrations of monohalo dihalo trihalo and tetrahalo czs in both groups of 12 nm fig 6a and 120 nm fig 6b cz began to decrease after reaching the maximum levels before 0 5 3 and 6 h and then reached stable before 12 h many phczs detected in the first 0 5 h in both groups indicated that phczs generated quickly in aqueous chlorination under appropriate conditions at 0 5 h the trihalo czs accounted for 25 5 0 8 of phczs in 12 nm group naocl as cl2 cz 5867 1 which were higher than those of 15 9 0 3 in 120 nm group naocl cz 587 1 fig 6a and b indicating that the high molar ratio of naocl cz accelerated the transformation of cz to halogenated cz compared with 0 5 h phczs at 12 h decreased by 34 9 and 28 3 in 12 nm and 120 nm groups respectively indicating that the formed phczs could be decomposed during prolonged chlorination when the residual chlorine in water was reduced to 0 07 1 0 mg l after 12 h fig s6 the degradation rates of phczs became slow and the concentration of phczs in water seemed stable although the four groups of halogenated czs decomposed for further chlorination from 6 to 24 h the mole fraction of each phcz in corresponding halogenated group was not significantly changed fig s7 suggesting the decomposing rates of phczs with the same number of halogens were almost the same the formation of phczs was compared between chlorination and chloramination species numbers and concentrations of phczs were higher in chlorination fig 6b than those in chloramination fig 6c across the contact times this difference should be caused by the stronger oxidation ability of hocl ocl in chlorination than those of nh2cl nhcl2 in chloramination the effect of ph on the formation of phczs was investigated in the general range of 6 9 for water treatment with increasing ph from 6 to 9 the contents of cz converted into phczs were dramatically decreased by 56 4 3 3 and 52 8 2 8 in 12 and 120 nm groups respectively fig 6d beside the easier decomposition of halogenated compounds in alkaline solution than that of acid solution zhai and zhang 2011 this result might also be caused by the decreasing oxidation capacity of naocl naobr for phczs generation as more dissociation of hocl hobr would happen in alkaline solution than that of acid one michałowicz et al 2007 additionally as the ph increased more cz were converted into other substances indicating that cz itself was not stable under chlorination conditions additionally it should be noted that 2 mg l of nom was included into the simulated source water as typical substances in source water nom may compete with cz to react with hobr hocl nokes et al 1999 in addition to the experiment with 2 mg l of nom the formation of phczs in the experiment without nom was also investigated under the conditions of ph 7 5 contact time 12 h naocl 70 4 μm or 5 mg l cz 120 nm and br 5 μm however there is no significant difference of the formation species and the concentration of each species of phczs in the experiment with 2 mg l of nom compared to those of the corresponding results in the experiment without nom fig s8 this result may be caused by the sufficient naocl 70 4 μm or 5 mg l as cl2 as compared with the concentration of cz 120 nm and nom 2 mg l under the condition of sufficient naocl low concentration of nom may not cause significant interference with the conversion of cz to phczs 4 conclusion chlorination is ubiquitously used for disinfection of drinking water or sewage drainage as well as the bleaching of paper pulp for hundred years nom is usually less than 3 mg l and the ph of natural source water is 6 9 the identification of various phcz congeners under these conditions indicated that chlorination process might be an important source for phczs in drinking water in this study 36 ccz and 36 bcz were the most abundant species in samples with bromide concentrations from 0 to 1 25 μm and 12 5 50 μm respectively results are in accordance with the distribution of phcz congeners in aquatic environment in which 36 ccz and 36 bcz was the dominant species guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 suggesting that phczs in environment were potentially generated from aqueous chlorination increasing bromide levels shifts the species of phczs from chlorinated to being more brominated species and increased the formation of the total phczs the successful modeling of the speciation of phczs can facilitate the prediction of their relative distribution in chlorinated water with different bromide concentrations this study shed light on the genesis of phczs in water environment acknowledgements we acknowledge

18781,biological processes and chemical precipitation in combination with polishing by granular media or membrane filtration can remove 90 95 of the phosphorus p from wastewater however reducing the concentration to levels near those in high quality receiving waters requires additional advanced treatment typically including adsorption onto specialty media these processes are often costly they can be hard to control when the p loading varies and their effectiveness can be compromised by the presence of competing adsorbates in the water in this work a novel process that might mitigate or overcome some of these challenges was explored in the process water is treated by passage through micron sized adsorbent particles heated aluminum oxide particles haops packed in a layer that is 1 mm thick thus combining the attractive features of very small particles with those of flow through packed media in laboratory tests using both synthetic feed and the effluent from an mbr at a full scale wastewater treatment plant the process removed p very efficiently until the haops capacity was nearly exhausted at which point rapid breakthrough of p occurred the removal capacity was proportional to the thickness of the haops layer and declined by only 20 when so4 2 cl and no3 were all added to the mbr effluent at concentrations of 30 mm 2880 1065 and 1860 mg l respectively increasing the solution ph from 7 0 to 8 5 had a similar effect and increasing the flux of water through the adsorbent layer from 200 to 600 lmh had an even smaller effect 10 reduction in removal capacity in 18 days of continuous pilot scale operation at the treatment plant the process performed well achieving 99 5 p removal steadily during the final seven days of testing during which the p concentration in the feed ranged from 4 to 9 mg l the process also removed 52 of the organic matter in the mbr effluent as represented by uv254 the sludge generated by the process was extremely easy to dewater and dry

alternative for maintaining low p concentrations in the effluents from mbrs or other biological treatment processes midorikawa et al 2008 pan et al 2014 xiong et al 2017 adsorbents that have been explored for such applications include natural materials such as pyrrhotite zeolite and calcium rich attapulgite or sepolite li et al 2013 schick et al 2012 yin et al 2017 2013 solid wastes like slag and fly ash pratt et al 2007 chen et al 2007 and synthesized materials such as metal modified carbon cui et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 while natural and waste based source materials for such adsorbents might be readily accessible those materials typically require modification prior to use they are often less efficient at p removal than synthetic adsorbents and they can generate secondary pollution du et al 2017 therefore novel adsorbents that are cost effective and environmentally friendly and that have high affinity and capacity for p are still being sought du et al 2017 lin et al 2019 many low cost adsorbents rely on aluminum and or ferric ions on the particles surfaces to bind and capture the phosphorus choo et al 2004 de vicente et al 2008 choi et al 2016 du et al 2017 over the past decade our group has investigated the use of heated aluminum oxide particles haops to remove organic material from water especially the materials responsible for membrane fouling cai et al 2008 kim et al 2008a 2010 wang and benjamin 2016a and formation of disinfection byproducts dbps wang and benjamin 2016b malczewska and benjamin 2016 these particles have adsorptive properties similar to those of freshly precipitated i e unheated aluminum hydroxide but the heating step partially dehydrates them making them smaller almost all 50 μm harder and less flocculant than the freshly precipitated particles as a result it is practical to deploy haops in a novel type of reactor in which the particles are tightly packed in a thin 1 mm layer through which the feed water passes as it does so contaminants are removed by both adsorption and filtration this process which we refer as microgranular adsorptive filtration μgaf thus combines the attractive kinetics of adsorption onto powdered adsorbents with the attractive hydrodynamics of plug flow packed bed reactors cai et al 2008 kim et al 2008a 2010 malczewska et al 2015 malczewska and benjamin 2016 modarresi and benjamin 2019 in one prior study we investigated adsorption of phosphorus and organic matter by haops from the effluent of a membrane bioreactor mbr kim et al 2008b the current work extends that research to a broader range of water quality and operational conditions longer term operation and investigation of the dewatering and drying of haops sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater adsorbent and reagents both synthetic solutions and mbr effluent from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brightwater wwtp in woodinville wa were used in experiments the synthetic solutions contained only di water hcl or naoh to adjust the ph 0 5 mm nahco3 to buffer the ph and various concentrations of phosphorus added as na2hpo4 the mbr modules at the treatment plant zw 500d suez water technologies solutions contain pvdf membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm the two samples of mbr effluent collected for laboratory experiments were both at ph 7 5 and they had soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations of 3 9 and 2 9 mg l respectively the only water quality parameters in the mbr effluent that are routinely monitored by plant personnel are bod and tss during the test period the average bod in the effluent was 1 8 mg l and virtually all the tss values were below the lower reporting limit of 2 0 mg l in some tests the ph of the effluent was adjusted with hcl or naoh and in others the solution was amended with various doses of na2so4 nano3 and nacl when the salts were added all three were dosed together at equal molar concentrations the mbr effluent used during the onsite testing had substantially higher and more variable srp concentrations 4 9 mg l the total phosphorus tp in these solutions was almost identical to the srp so only srp was analyzed in the experiments feedwater for the laboratory tests was stored at 4 c and was brought to room temperature immediately before the tests haops were synthesized by neutralizing a solution of aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 18h2o acros organics 10 g l as al with naoh to ph 7 0 to form aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 precipitates and heating the suspension in a closed bottle at 110 c for 24 h kim et al 2008b the heated suspensions were then cooled to room temperature haops prepared according to this method have been reported to be approximately 25 al by weight cai et al 2008 and to have a mean diameter of approximately 30 μm a bet surface area of 35 6 m2 g and a point of zero charge pzc of ph 7 6 liu and benjamin 2016 these values for mean particle diameter and specific surface area are different from those given by cai et al 2008 an explanation for the differences is provided in supplementary file 1 all chemicals were acs reagent grade deionized di water millipore milli q billerica ma was used to prepare synthetic test solutions and standard solutions for srp analysis 2 2 batch tests adsorption of phosphorus onto haops at room temperature 20 c in batch reactors was characterized using both synthetic solutions and mbr effluent after the desired dose of adsorbent was added to each sample the ph was adjusted to 7 5 1 with 0 1 m naoh or hcl and the samples were mixed on a rotary shaker for 2 h they were then passed through a 0 2 μm syringe filter to separate the solids from the solution 2 3 microgranular adsorptive filtration μgaf tests 2 3 1 bench scale tests in bench scale μgaf tests a nylon mesh with a nominal pore size of 5 μm and 1 open area sefar inc buffalo ny was used to support a layer of haops the mesh was cut into 47 mm diameter disks and soaked in di water prior to insertion in a filter cartridge in line polycarbonate filter holder pall corp new york ny the desired volume of haops stock suspension was injected into the cartridge with a syringe and was deposited on the mesh by feeding di water to the system for at least 30 min at the flux to be used in the upcoming experiment the feed was then switched to the solution to be treated and samples of the filtrate were collected at preselected intervals the ph of the mbr effluent after passing through the haops was virtually identical to that of the influent but when the synthetic feed was used the ph of the haops treated water early in the run was 6 therefore prior to injecting synthetic feed a solution containing di water plus 0 5 mm nahco3 at ph 7 5 was circulated through the system until the effluent ph was stable at 7 5 after pre equilibration of the haops to ph 7 5 in this way the ph of the synthetic solution exiting the cartridge was close to 7 5 from the beginning of the test the pressure loss across the haops layer was measured with a transducer px302 100 gv omega engineering inc stamford ct in addition to the composition of the feedwater parameters that were varied in the experiments included the haops loading and the feed flux a schematic of the bench scale μgaf setup is shown in fig 1 2 3 2 onsite tests the onsite μgaf tests at the wwtp were conducted using a treatment system comprising two modules each containing six 2 foot long tubes made of nylon mesh with nominal 10 μm openings each module provided 1724 cm2 of effective filtration area the two modules could be operated individually or in series i e with the filtrate from one module used as feed to the other in the initial experiments three consecutive treatment cycles were carried out in one of the modules to initiate each cycle a stock slurry containing enough haops to generate a surface loading on the mesh of 40 g al m2 was prepared and injected into the tubes line labeled 1 in fig 2 a portion of the water from this slurry was allowed to permeate across the mesh walls line 1a carrying haops to the wall where they were captured the remaining slurry exited the downstream end of the tube line 1b both the permeating and non permeating flows were recycled to the inlet reservoir after 20 min the reservoir was virtually free of haops based on visual observation the feed to the tubes was then switched to mbr effluent and the circulation flow was terminated so the system operated in dead end filtration mode with all the feed passing through the pre deposited haops and the underlying mesh at a flux of 200 lmh line 2 in fig 2 the pressure difference across the tubes was monitored online using transducers the unit was also equipped with an online uv254 analyzer uvm5000 chemtrac inc norcross ga each filtration cycle lasted 8 h after which the tubes were cleaned by sequential backwashing and flushing with the treated water lines 3a and 3b respectively air was also injected during the flushing step a composite sample of the feed water was collected during each filtration cycle in the next tests the two treatment modules were operated in series with the filtrate from the upstream module fed to the downstream module fig 3 a after a predetermined filtration time the upstream module was taken offline and cleaned as described above fig 3b a new layer of haops was then deposited on the mesh tubes in the cleaned module and it was returned to service in the downstream position fig 3c while one module was being cleaned feed was entering and being treated in the other module so feed was filtered continuously throughout the test period a summary of all the tests conducted as part of this research is provided in table 1 2 4 chemical analyses srp was analyzed in accordance with standard methods 4500 p b and 4500 p e in batch tests uv254 absorbance was measured with a portable uv254 analyzer p200 real tech inc using a 1 cm quartz cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal from synthetic solutions and mbr effluent in batch experiments adsorption of phosphorus by haops from mbr effluent was almost identical to that from synthetic solutions containing an equivalent srp concentration fig 4 a this result is consistent with that reported by kim et al 2008b and indicates that competition between srp and other constituents of the wastewater e g organic matter anions metals etc for binding sites on the haops was negligible in both solutions the fractional removal of srp increased with increasing haops dose and was 90 at haops doses of 50 mg al l and higher molar al p ratios 15 1 the results could be well fit with the langmuir isotherm equation 1 q q max k c e 1 k c e where q is the equilibrium adsorption density q max is the maximum adsorption density k is the adsorptive equilibrium constant and c e is the dissolved srp concentration at equilibrium the best fit values of q max and k for adsorption from both solutions are shown in table 2 because haops are 25 al the q max values for p adsorption from the synthetic solution and mbr effluent normalized to the mass of haops are 35 and 33 mg p per g haops respectively literature values for q max for p adsorption usually from synthetic solutions by various al and fe oxides tend to fall in the range from 5 to 30 mg p per g adsorbent while those for adsorption by more exotic adsorbents e g containing zr or la are often somewhat higher 30 45 mg g narkis and meiri 1981 tanada et al 2003 xie et al 2015 aboelenin et al 2015 next tests were conducted in μgaf systems using the same feed solutions as were used in batch experiments a plateau of high removal efficiency was maintained until breakthrough began when the specific volume treated v sp the volume of water treated per unit cross section of mesh reached 2300 l m2 fig 4b for the given haops loading this v sp value corresponds to a ratio of 7 4 mol al dosed per mole of srp in the original solution 6 4 mg al per mg srp as was the case in the batch tests the synthetic solution and mbr effluent behaved almost identically the ultimate adsorption densities q based on extrapolation of the data to complete breakthrough were 0 107 and 0 099 mol p mol al for the synthetic solution and mbr effluent respectively these values are both within 5 of the value of q computed from the isotherm equations derived from the batch experiments for c e equal to the srp concentration in the feed solutions indicating that the haops adsorption sites were just as accessible in the packed layer as in the well mixed suspensions even though the same adsorption isotherm equation could characterize the interaction between haops and srp in the two types of reactor the quality of the treated water produced by the μgaf reactor was significantly better than that produced by the well mixed reactor at the same effective haops dose mass of haops applied per liter of feed treated when that dose was high fig 5 a put another way under conditions where the reactor was producing high quality i e low srp water the adsorption capacity of the haops was being used much more efficiently in the μgaf reactor fig 5b this result can be attributed to the behavior of the haops as a miniaturized packed bed with the haops near the feed side of the layer equilibrating with a much higher srp concentration and therefore reaching a much higher srp adsorption density than the particles deeper in the layer no concentration gradient exists in a well mixed reactor so all the haops in such a reactor equilibrate with the low srp concentration in the treated water and they all have the same low adsorption density this scenario mimics the difference between adsorption onto pac in well mixed tanks and onto gac in packed beds except that the design of the μgaf reactor allows the benefits of packed bed adsorption to be realized in a much smaller space 3 2 effects of haops loading and feed fluxes in μgaf tests in μgaf experiments with different haops loadings srp breakthrough was progressively delayed with increasing haops loading fig 6 a and the v sp at which a given removal efficiency was reached increased linearly with that loading fig 6b uv254 is a widely used surrogate for the concentration of minimally degradable organic matter in both natural water and wastewater in wastewater the removal of this material can enhance the efficiency of uv based disinfection in conventional well mixed reactors any removal of organic matter by haops is presumably attributable to adsorption however kim et al 2008a and modarresi and benjamin 2019 have suggested that when haops are used in μgaf reactors removal can also occur by coalescence of organic molecules to form a gel on the haops surfaces the uv254 removal efficiency in these experiments differed from that of srp decreasing approximately linearly until it reached 25 and then remaining close to that value as the run continued fig 6c the removal dropped to lower levels in the test with the lowest haops loading 10 g al m2 but even in that case the decline in removal efficiency became much more gradual below the 25 threshold the pressure required to drive the mbr effluent through the μgaf layer was 15 kpa throughout all the runs regardless of the haops loading fig 7 this result likely reflects efficient removal of colloidal and particulate matter from the feed by the prior mbr treatment consistent with the report by liu and benjamin 2016 that fouling of a haops layer in μgaf tests was substantially reduced when the feed was pre filtered through a membrane with 0 35 μm pores the low required pressure suggests that the system could be efficiently operated at higher fluxes which would reduce the filtration area required to treat a given feed flow rate to test this possibility experiments were conducted at fluxes up to 600 lmh at a haops loading of 50 g al m2 in these tests srp removal followed the same trend as in the lower flux systems with high efficiency initially and only a slight penalty in the form of slightly earlier srp breakthrough at the higher fluxes fig 8 a the ultimate apparent adsorption density in these tests was in the range of 0 096 0 118 mol srp mol al the removal of uv254 was even less sensitive to flux than the srp removal was fig 8a modarresi 2016 reported similar findings for the removal of dissolved organic carbon and uv254 in μgaf tests using lake water as the feed as would be expected the initial pressure loss across the haops layer increased with increasing flux but only from 2 kpa at 200 lmh to 16 kpa at 600 lmh fig 8b the pressure loss increased only slightly during the filtration runs supporting the suggestion that operation at high fluxes would be practical 3 3 effects of ph and anions as was the case for feed flux the ph of the feed solution had a relatively small effect on srp removal which declined by about 20 as the ph was increased from 7 0 to 8 5 the change in ph had virtually no effect on removal of uv254 fig 9 in all cases the composite removal efficiency of uv254 for the entire run was close to 35 when a group of anions so4 2 no3 and cl was added to the mbr effluent srp removal in the μgaf reactors decreased but the general pattern of removal was not affected i e removal was still excellent until breakthrough occurred the impact of the salts was similar for both uv254 and srp removal fig 10 and led to a reduction of 25 in the water volume that could be treated effectively when 30 mm of each salt was added this dose of salts corresponds to an increase of 8565 mg l in total dissolved solids tds which is an order of magnitude higher than the tds of typical high strength domestic wastewater metcalf and eddy 2014 further reductions in capacity were evident at even higher salt additions but these experiments nevertheless suggest that haops could be useful for removing p from some high strength industrial wastewaters removal of the added anions was not evaluated in this work but other unpublished tests have indicated that haops remove negligible amounts of most major salt ions from solution they can however remove trace concentrations of some solutes e g 1 mg l of f and si the ultimate srp adsorption density and the composite removal of uv254 in the runs at different ph s and salt concentrations are summarized in table 3 3 4 sludge processing in addition to the efficiency with which a process collects phosphorus from treated wastewater the management of residuals from the process can play a major role in its practicality and cost preliminary data on water retention by the haops sludge was obtained by vacuum filtering a portion of the sludge from the μgaf tests through glass fiber filters 0 45 μm nominal pore size and drying the filtered mass either in a stagnant air desiccator at 20 c or in an oven at various elevated temperatures after vacuum filtration the layer was approximately 1 mm thick when the filtered sludge was dried in a desiccator for 25 h 82 0 of its mass evaporated subsequent heating steps for 25 h at 30 c 11 5 h at 70 c 2 5 h at 110 c and 25 h at 550 c caused additional losses of 1 8 1 1 0 4 and 3 8 respectively of the initial mass the last step presumably volatilized any organics that accumulated on the solids during treatment as well as residual water that was tightly bound to or in the haops taking the mass after heating at 110 c as the dry weight the wet sludge contained 18 solids and 82 water immediately after filtration however the vast majority of the water evaporated in 25 h at room temperature leaving a mass that was 96 7 solids the rate of evaporation depends on several geometric and environmental factors such as the thickness of the sludge mass the humidity of the air and whether the air is actively blown past or through the sludge so the time required for drying at a treatment site would be different from that in the lab nevertheless the data indicate that the water associated with the wet sludge is very weakly held and could easily be removed by passive drying and removed even more rapidly if some warm air were blown through the sludge 3 5 onsite testing of μgaf system after completion of the bench scale tests the pilot system containing two larger treatment modules was constructed and deployed at a full scale wastewater treatment plant in the first tests at the plant μgaf filtration experiments were conducted using only one treatment module which was loaded with 40 g al m2 and fed mbr effluent at a flux of 200 lmh the results from three sequential runs under these conditions are presented in fig 11 the breakthrough curves for srp and uv254 were consistent for all three runs and were similar to the curves derived from lab scale tests with the exception that srp breakthrough occurred sooner in the onsite tests presumably because of the significantly higher phosphorus concentration in the feed water 7 7 mg l as opposed to 3 4 mg l the srp al molar ratios at the end of all three tests were 0 129 0 003 very close to the values of q max shown in table 2 from the batch experiments next the pilot system was operated with flow to the two modules in series at a feed flux of 200 lmh and a haops loading of 40 g al m2 in both modules for the first 11 days of this test the cycle time was five hours i e every five hours the upstream column was cleaned loaded with a new batch of haops and placed back into service in the downstream position as shown in fig 3 the srp concentration in the feed varied between approximately 4 0 and 8 5 mg l during this period and that in the effluent ranged from 0 05 to 0 30 mg l at the beginning of each cycle and from 0 30 to as high as 3 5 mg l at the end fig 12 a the cycles with more extensive srp breakthrough typically corresponded to times when the feed concentration was especially high the mean concentrations one standard deviation in the feed and effluent over the full 11 d period were 6 63 0 96 and 0 48 0 62 mg srp l respectively corresponding to an average removal efficiency of 92 8 the results suggested that the haops loading in the modules was insufficient to reliably remove all the srp entering over a 5 h period so the cycle time was reduced to 4 h for the next seven days this change dramatically improved the performance allowing the system to generate filtrate that almost always contained less than 0 05 mg srp l inset in fig 12a the only significant excursion from this performance occurred when the feed concentration briefly exceeded 9 mg l the average feed and filtrate srp concentrations during this period were 6 32 1 09 and 0 033 0 020 mg l corresponding to 99 5 removal although removal of organic matter was not a primary goal of the study it is noteworthy that when the cycle time was reduced to four hours the uv254 of the water was reduced by 52 by passage through the reactor fig 12b note that throughout the 18 d test all system functions were carried out automatically without any operator intervention other than adjusting the filtration cycle time on day 11 the ratio of the al dose in the haops to the srp removed was about 6 4 and 7 9 mg al per mg srp respectively during the five and four hour stages of the test it seems likely that small modifications to the haops dose and or filtration cycle time would allow an effluent with 0 02 mg srp l to be achieved consistently and reliably with an al srp ratio in this range or perhaps even lower after a break of a few days a 5 day test was conducted with the same haops loading but at a flux that was 50 higher 300 lmh for this test the cycle time was reduced to 2 67 h so that the same volume of mbr effluent was treated in each cycle as in the final week of the previous test the srp removal efficiency during this test was again 99 5 with an average concentration in the treated water of 0 022 mg l lower than in the previous test because the feed concentration was lower 4 conclusions this research investigated the removal of soluble reactive phosphorus srp and uv254 from synthetic solutions and mbr effluent using heated aluminum oxide particles haops in both batch and μgaf reactors the use of micron size haops as the adsorbent in conjunction with the plug flow hydrodynamics of μgaf reactors produces higher quality treated water using lower adsorbent doses than can be achieved in conventional well mixed reactors the amount of srp that can be accumulated by haops in μgaf systems is approximately proportional to the haops loading and is insensitive to the flux of water through the haops layer the organic constituents present in mbr effluent and variations in ph ionic strength and the concentration of sulfate a potential competitor with srp for adsorptive sites on haops in the ranges typically found in domestic wastewaters in addition the headloss associated with passage of mbr effluent through the haops layer is small at fluxes up to at least 600 lmh a two stage system can reduce the srp concentration to 30 μg l and remove 50 of the uv254 from mbr effluent generating a sludge that can be easily dewatered and dried declaration of interest mark benjamin is president of microhaops inc a

18781,biological processes and chemical precipitation in combination with polishing by granular media or membrane filtration can remove 90 95 of the phosphorus p from wastewater however reducing the concentration to levels near those in high quality receiving waters requires additional advanced treatment typically including adsorption onto specialty media these processes are often costly they can be hard to control when the p loading varies and their effectiveness can be compromised by the presence of competing adsorbates in the water in this work a novel process that might mitigate or overcome some of these challenges was explored in the process water is treated by passage through micron sized adsorbent particles heated aluminum oxide particles haops packed in a layer that is 1 mm thick thus combining the attractive features of very small particles with those of flow through packed media in laboratory tests using both synthetic feed and the effluent from an mbr at a full scale wastewater treatment plant the process removed p very efficiently until the haops capacity was nearly exhausted at which point rapid breakthrough of p occurred the removal capacity was proportional to the thickness of the haops layer and declined by only 20 when so4 2 cl and no3 were all added to the mbr effluent at concentrations of 30 mm 2880 1065 and 1860 mg l respectively increasing the solution ph from 7 0 to 8 5 had a similar effect and increasing the flux of water through the adsorbent layer from 200 to 600 lmh had an even smaller effect 10 reduction in removal capacity in 18 days of continuous pilot scale operation at the treatment plant the process performed well achieving 99 5 p removal steadily during the final seven days of testing during which the p concentration in the feed ranged from 4 to 9 mg l the process also removed 52 of the organic matter in the mbr effluent as represented by uv254 the sludge generated by the process was extremely easy to dewater and dry

low cost adsorbents rely on aluminum and or ferric ions on the particles surfaces to bind and capture the phosphorus choo et al 2004 de vicente et al 2008 choi et al 2016 du et al 2017 over the past decade our group has investigated the use of heated aluminum oxide particles haops to remove organic material from water especially the materials responsible for membrane fouling cai et al 2008 kim et al 2008a 2010 wang and benjamin 2016a and formation of disinfection byproducts dbps wang and benjamin 2016b malczewska and benjamin 2016 these particles have adsorptive properties similar to those of freshly precipitated i e unheated aluminum hydroxide but the heating step partially dehydrates them making them smaller almost all 50 μm harder and less flocculant than the freshly precipitated particles as a result it is practical to deploy haops in a novel type of reactor in which the particles are tightly packed in a thin 1 mm layer through which the feed water passes as it does so contaminants are removed by both adsorption and filtration this process which we refer as microgranular adsorptive filtration μgaf thus combines the attractive kinetics of adsorption onto powdered adsorbents with the attractive hydrodynamics of plug flow packed bed reactors cai et al 2008 kim et al 2008a 2010 malczewska et al 2015 malczewska and benjamin 2016 modarresi and benjamin 2019 in one prior study we investigated adsorption of phosphorus and organic matter by haops from the effluent of a membrane bioreactor mbr kim et al 2008b the current work extends that research to a broader range of water quality and operational conditions longer term operation and investigation of the dewatering and drying of haops sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater adsorbent and reagents both synthetic solutions and mbr effluent from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brightwater wwtp in woodinville wa were used in experiments the synthetic solutions contained only di water hcl or naoh to adjust the ph 0 5 mm nahco3 to buffer the ph and various concentrations of phosphorus added as na2hpo4 the mbr modules at the treatment plant zw 500d suez water technologies solutions contain pvdf membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm the two samples of mbr effluent collected for laboratory experiments were both at ph 7 5 and they had soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations of 3 9 and 2 9 mg l respectively the only water quality parameters in the mbr effluent that are routinely monitored by plant personnel are bod and tss during the test period the average bod in the effluent was 1 8 mg l and virtually all the tss values were below the lower reporting limit of 2 0 mg l in some tests the ph of the effluent was adjusted with hcl or naoh and in others the solution was amended with various doses of na2so4 nano3 and nacl when the salts were added all three were dosed together at equal molar concentrations the mbr effluent used during the onsite testing had substantially higher and more variable srp concentrations 4 9 mg l the total phosphorus tp in these solutions was almost identical to the srp so only srp was analyzed in the experiments feedwater for the laboratory tests was stored at 4 c and was brought to room temperature immediately before the tests haops were synthesized by neutralizing a solution of aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 18h2o acros organics 10 g l as al with naoh to ph 7 0 to form aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 precipitates and heating the suspension in a closed bottle at 110 c for 24 h kim et al 2008b the heated suspensions were then cooled to room temperature haops prepared according to this method have been reported to be approximately 25 al by weight cai et al 2008 and to have a mean diameter of approximately 30 μm a bet surface area of 35 6 m2 g and a point of zero charge pzc of ph 7 6 liu and benjamin 2016 these values for mean particle diameter and specific surface area are different from those given by cai et al 2008 an explanation for the differences is provided in supplementary file 1 all chemicals were acs reagent grade deionized di water millipore milli q billerica ma was used to prepare synthetic test solutions and standard solutions for srp analysis 2 2 batch tests adsorption of phosphorus onto haops at room temperature 20 c in batch reactors was characterized using both synthetic solutions and mbr effluent after the desired dose of adsorbent was added to each sample the ph was adjusted to 7 5 1 with 0 1 m naoh or hcl and the samples were mixed on a rotary shaker for 2 h they were then passed through a 0 2 μm syringe filter to separate the solids from the solution 2 3 microgranular adsorptive filtration μgaf tests 2 3 1 bench scale tests in bench scale μgaf tests a nylon mesh with a nominal pore size of 5 μm and 1 open area sefar inc buffalo ny was used to support a layer of haops the mesh was cut into 47 mm diameter disks and soaked in di water prior to insertion in a filter cartridge in line polycarbonate filter holder pall corp new york ny the desired volume of haops stock suspension was injected into the cartridge with a syringe and was deposited on the mesh by feeding di water to the system for at least 30 min at the flux to be used in the upcoming experiment the feed was then switched to the solution to be treated and samples of the filtrate were collected at preselected intervals the ph of the mbr effluent after passing through the haops was virtually identical to that of the influent but when the synthetic feed was used the ph of the haops treated water early in the run was 6 therefore prior to injecting synthetic feed a solution containing di water plus 0 5 mm nahco3 at ph 7 5 was circulated through the system until the effluent ph was stable at 7 5 after pre equilibration of the haops to ph 7 5 in this way the ph of the synthetic solution exiting the cartridge was close to 7 5 from the beginning of the test the pressure loss across the haops layer was measured with a transducer px302 100 gv omega engineering inc stamford ct in addition to the composition of the feedwater parameters that were varied in the experiments included the haops loading and the feed flux a schematic of the bench scale μgaf setup is shown in fig 1 2 3 2 onsite tests the onsite μgaf tests at the wwtp were conducted using a treatment system comprising two modules each containing six 2 foot long tubes made of nylon mesh with nominal 10 μm openings each module provided 1724 cm2 of effective filtration area the two modules could be operated individually or in series i e with the filtrate from one module used as feed to the other in the initial experiments three consecutive treatment cycles were carried out in one of the modules to initiate each cycle a stock slurry containing enough haops to generate a surface loading on the mesh of 40 g al m2 was prepared and injected into the tubes line labeled 1 in fig 2 a portion of the water from this slurry was allowed to permeate across the mesh walls line 1a carrying haops to the wall where they were captured the remaining slurry exited the downstream end of the tube line 1b both the permeating and non permeating flows were recycled to the inlet reservoir after 20 min the reservoir was virtually free of haops based on visual observation the feed to the tubes was then switched to mbr effluent and the circulation flow was terminated so the system operated in dead end filtration mode with all the feed passing through the pre deposited haops and the underlying mesh at a flux of 200 lmh line 2 in fig 2 the pressure difference across the tubes was monitored online using transducers the unit was also equipped with an online uv254 analyzer uvm5000 chemtrac inc norcross ga each filtration cycle lasted 8 h after which the tubes were cleaned by sequential backwashing and flushing with the treated water lines 3a and 3b respectively air was also injected during the flushing step a composite sample of the feed water was collected during each filtration cycle in the next tests the two treatment modules were operated in series with the filtrate from the upstream module fed to the downstream module fig 3 a after a predetermined filtration time the upstream module was taken offline and cleaned as described above fig 3b a new layer of haops was then deposited on the mesh tubes in the cleaned module and it was returned to service in the downstream position fig 3c while one module was being cleaned feed was entering and being treated in the other module so feed was filtered continuously throughout the test period a summary of all the tests conducted as part of this research is provided in table 1 2 4 chemical analyses srp was analyzed in accordance with standard methods 4500 p b and 4500 p e in batch tests uv254 absorbance was measured with a portable uv254 analyzer p200 real tech inc using a 1 cm quartz cell 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal from synthetic solutions and mbr effluent in batch experiments adsorption of phosphorus by haops from mbr effluent was almost identical to that from synthetic solutions containing an equivalent srp concentration fig 4 a this result is consistent with that reported by kim et al 2008b and indicates that competition between srp and other constituents of the wastewater e g organic matter anions metals etc for binding sites on the haops was negligible in both solutions the fractional removal of srp increased with increasing haops dose and was 90 at haops doses of 50 mg al l and higher molar al p ratios 15 1 the results could be well fit with the langmuir isotherm equation 1 q q max k c e 1 k c e where q is the equilibrium adsorption density q max is the maximum adsorption density k is the adsorptive equilibrium constant and c e is the dissolved srp concentration at equilibrium the best fit values of q max and k for adsorption from both solutions are shown in table 2 because haops are 25 al the q max values for p adsorption from the synthetic solution and mbr effluent normalized to the mass of haops are 35 and 33 mg p per g haops respectively literature values for q max for p adsorption usually from synthetic solutions by various al and fe oxides tend to fall in the range from 5 to 30 mg p per g adsorbent while those for adsorption by more exotic adsorbents e g containing zr or la are often somewhat higher 30 45 mg g narkis and meiri 1981 tanada et al 2003 xie et al 2015 aboelenin et al 2015 next tests were conducted in μgaf systems using the same feed solutions as were used in batch experiments a plateau of high removal efficiency was maintained until breakthrough began when the specific volume treated v sp the volume of water treated per unit cross section of mesh reached 2300 l m2 fig 4b for the given haops loading this v sp value corresponds to a ratio of 7 4 mol al dosed per mole of srp in the original solution 6 4 mg al per mg srp as was the case in the batch tests the synthetic solution and mbr effluent behaved almost identically the ultimate adsorption densities q based on extrapolation of the data to complete breakthrough were 0 107 and 0 099 mol p mol al for the synthetic solution and mbr effluent respectively these values are both within 5 of the value of q computed from the isotherm equations derived from the batch experiments for c e equal to the srp concentration in the feed solutions indicating that the haops adsorption sites were just as accessible in the packed layer as in the well mixed suspensions even though the same adsorption isotherm equation could characterize the interaction between haops and srp in the two types of reactor the quality of the treated water produced by the μgaf reactor was significantly better than that produced by the well mixed reactor at the same effective haops dose mass of haops applied per liter of feed treated when that dose was high fig 5 a put another way under conditions where the reactor was producing high quality i e low srp water the adsorption capacity of the haops was being used much more efficiently in the μgaf reactor fig 5b this result can be attributed to the behavior of the haops as a miniaturized packed bed with the haops near the feed side of the layer equilibrating with a much higher srp concentration and therefore reaching a much higher srp adsorption density than the particles deeper in the layer no concentration gradient exists in a well mixed reactor so all the haops in such a reactor equilibrate with the low srp concentration in the treated water and they all have the same low adsorption density this scenario mimics the difference between adsorption onto pac in well mixed tanks and onto gac in packed beds except that the design of the μgaf reactor allows the benefits of packed bed adsorption to be realized in a much smaller space 3 2 effects of haops loading and feed fluxes in μgaf tests in μgaf experiments with different haops loadings srp breakthrough was progressively delayed with increasing haops loading fig 6 a and the v sp at which a given removal efficiency was reached increased linearly with that loading fig 6b uv254 is a widely used surrogate for the concentration of minimally degradable organic matter in both natural water and wastewater in wastewater the removal of this material can enhance the efficiency of uv based disinfection in conventional well mixed reactors any removal of organic matter by haops is presumably attributable to adsorption however kim et al 2008a and modarresi and benjamin 2019 have suggested that when haops are used in μgaf reactors removal can also occur by coalescence of organic molecules to form a gel on the haops surfaces the uv254 removal efficiency in these experiments differed from that of srp decreasing approximately linearly until it reached 25 and then remaining close to that value as the run continued fig 6c the removal dropped to lower levels in the test with the lowest haops loading 10 g al m2 but even in that case the decline in removal efficiency became much more gradual below the 25 threshold the pressure required to drive the mbr effluent through the μgaf layer was 15 kpa throughout all the runs regardless of the haops loading fig 7 this result likely reflects efficient removal of colloidal and particulate matter from the feed by the prior mbr treatment consistent with the report by liu and benjamin 2016 that fouling of a haops layer in μgaf tests was substantially reduced when the feed was pre filtered through a membrane with 0 35 μm pores the low required pressure suggests that the system could be efficiently operated at higher fluxes which would reduce the filtration area required to treat a given feed flow rate to test this possibility experiments were conducted at fluxes up to 600 lmh at a haops loading of 50 g al m2 in these tests srp removal followed the same trend as in the lower flux systems with high efficiency initially and only a slight penalty in the form of slightly earlier srp breakthrough at the higher fluxes fig 8 a the ultimate apparent adsorption density in these tests was in the range of 0 096 0 118 mol srp mol al the removal of uv254 was even less sensitive to flux than the srp removal was fig 8a modarresi 2016 reported similar findings for the removal of dissolved organic carbon and uv254 in μgaf tests using lake water as the feed as would be expected the initial pressure loss across the haops layer increased with increasing flux but only from 2 kpa at 200 lmh to 16 kpa at 600 lmh fig 8b the pressure loss increased only slightly during the filtration runs supporting the suggestion that operation at high fluxes would be practical 3 3 effects of ph and anions as was the case for feed flux the ph of the feed solution had a relatively small effect on srp removal which declined by about 20 as the ph was increased from 7 0 to 8 5 the change in ph had virtually no effect on removal of uv254 fig 9 in all cases the composite removal efficiency of uv254 for the entire run was close to 35 when a group of anions so4 2 no3 and cl was added to the mbr effluent srp removal in the μgaf reactors decreased but the general pattern of removal was not affected i e removal was still excellent until breakthrough occurred the impact of the salts was similar for both uv254 and srp removal fig 10 and led to a reduction of 25 in the water volume that could be treated effectively when 30 mm of each salt was added this dose of salts corresponds to an increase of 8565 mg l in total dissolved solids tds which is an order of magnitude higher than the tds of typical high strength domestic wastewater metcalf and eddy 2014 further reductions in capacity were evident at even higher salt additions but these experiments nevertheless suggest that haops could be useful for removing p from some high strength industrial wastewaters removal of the added anions was not evaluated in this work but other unpublished tests have indicated that haops remove negligible amounts of most major salt ions from solution they can however remove trace concentrations of some solutes e g 1 mg l of f and si the ultimate srp adsorption density and the composite removal of uv254 in the runs at different ph s and salt concentrations are summarized in table 3 3 4 sludge processing in addition to the efficiency with which a process collects phosphorus from treated wastewater the management of residuals from the process can play a major role in its practicality and cost preliminary data on water retention by the haops sludge was obtained by vacuum filtering a portion of the sludge from the μgaf tests through glass fiber filters 0 45 μm nominal pore size and drying the filtered mass either in a stagnant air desiccator at 20 c or in an oven at various elevated temperatures after vacuum filtration the layer was approximately 1 mm thick when the filtered sludge was dried in a desiccator for 25 h 82 0 of its mass evaporated subsequent heating steps for 25 h at 30 c 11 5 h at 70 c 2 5 h at 110 c and 25 h at 550 c caused additional losses of 1 8 1 1 0 4 and 3 8 respectively of the initial mass the last step presumably volatilized any organics that accumulated on the solids during treatment as well as residual water that was tightly bound to or in the haops taking the mass after heating at 110 c as the dry weight the wet sludge contained 18 solids and 82 water immediately after filtration however the vast majority of the water evaporated in 25 h at room temperature leaving a mass that was 96 7 solids the rate of evaporation depends on several geometric and environmental factors such as the thickness of the sludge mass the humidity of the air and whether the air is actively blown past or through the sludge so the time required for drying at a treatment site would be different from that in the lab nevertheless the data indicate that the water associated with the wet sludge is very weakly held and could easily be removed by passive drying and removed even more rapidly if some warm air were blown through the sludge 3 5 onsite testing of μgaf system after completion of the bench scale tests the pilot system containing two larger treatment modules was constructed and deployed at a full scale wastewater treatment plant in the first tests at the plant μgaf filtration experiments were conducted using only one treatment module which was loaded with 40 g al m2 and fed mbr effluent at a flux of 200 lmh the results from three sequential runs under these conditions are presented in fig 11 the breakthrough curves for srp and uv254 were consistent for all three runs and were similar to the curves derived from lab scale tests with the exception that srp breakthrough occurred sooner in the onsite tests presumably because of the significantly higher phosphorus concentration in the feed water 7 7 mg l as opposed to 3 4 mg l the srp al molar ratios at the end of all three tests were 0 129 0 003 very close to the values of q max shown in table 2 from the batch experiments next the pilot system was operated with flow to the two modules in series at a feed flux of 200 lmh and a haops loading of 40 g al m2 in both modules for the first 11 days of this test the cycle time was five hours i e every five hours the upstream column was cleaned loaded with a new batch of haops and placed back into service in the downstream position as shown in fig 3 the srp concentration in the feed varied between approximately 4 0 and 8 5 mg l during this period and that in the effluent ranged from 0 05 to 0 30 mg l at the beginning of each cycle and from 0 30 to as high as 3 5 mg l at the end fig 12 a the cycles with more extensive srp breakthrough typically corresponded to times when the feed concentration was especially high the mean concentrations one standard deviation in the feed and effluent over the full 11 d period were 6 63 0 96 and 0 48 0 62 mg srp l respectively corresponding to an average removal efficiency of 92 8 the results suggested that the haops loading in the modules was insufficient to reliably remove all the srp entering over a 5 h period so the cycle time was reduced to 4 h for the next seven days this change dramatically improved the performance allowing the system to generate filtrate that almost always contained less than 0 05 mg srp l inset in fig 12a the only significant excursion from this performance occurred when the feed concentration briefly exceeded 9 mg l the average feed and filtrate srp concentrations during this period were 6 32 1 09 and 0 033 0 020 mg l corresponding to 99 5 removal although removal of organic matter was not a primary goal of the study it is noteworthy that when the cycle time was reduced to four hours the uv254 of the water was reduced by 52 by passage through the reactor fig 12b note that throughout the 18 d test all system functions were carried out automatically without any operator intervention other than adjusting the filtration cycle time on day 11 the ratio of the al dose in the haops to the srp removed was about 6 4 and 7 9 mg al per mg srp respectively during the five and four hour stages of the test it seems likely that small modifications to the haops dose and or filtration cycle time would allow an effluent with 0 02 mg srp l to be achieved consistently and reliably with an al srp ratio in this range or perhaps even lower after a break of a few days a 5 day test was conducted with the same haops loading but at a flux that was 50 higher 300 lmh for this test the cycle time was reduced to 2 67 h so that the same volume of mbr effluent was treated in each cycle as in the final week of the previous test the srp removal efficiency during this test was again 99 5 with an average concentration in the treated water of 0 022 mg l lower than in the previous test because the feed concentration was lower 4 conclusions this research investigated the removal of soluble reactive phosphorus srp and uv254 from synthetic solutions and mbr effluent using heated aluminum oxide particles haops in both batch and μgaf reactors the use of micron size haops as the adsorbent in conjunction with the plug flow hydrodynamics of μgaf reactors produces higher quality treated water using lower adsorbent doses than can be achieved in conventional well mixed reactors the amount of srp that can be accumulated by haops in μgaf systems is approximately proportional to the haops loading and is insensitive to the flux of water through the haops layer the organic constituents present in mbr effluent and variations in ph ionic strength and the concentration of sulfate a potential competitor with srp for adsorptive sites on haops in the ranges typically found in domestic wastewaters in addition the headloss associated with passage of mbr effluent through the haops layer is small at fluxes up to at least 600 lmh a two stage system can reduce the srp concentration to 30 μg l and remove 50 of the uv254 from mbr effluent generating a sludge that can be easily dewatered and dried declaration of interest mark benjamin is president of microhaops inc a

18782,in this work uv and uv chlorine uv cl were employed to enhance powdered activated carbon pac adsorption pretreatment prior to ultrafiltration process for algae contaminated surface water treatment their performance on membrane fouling mitigation and organic pollutant rejection was systematically evaluated a comparative experiment was conducted under varying pollution degrees of algal extracellular organic matter eom contamination in surface river water the results indicated that uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatment effectively enhanced the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbing at 254 nm uv254 the characteristics of feed water after pretreatments were investigated through apparent molecular weight mw distribution and fluorescence parallel factor analysis parafac in regard to membrane fouling mitigation uv cl pac noticeably decreased reversible and irreversible fouling resistance simultaneously and uv pac preferred reducing reversible membrane fouling combined fouling modeling was operated to scrutinize the fouling mitigation mechanisms and standard pore blocking was proved to be dominant during the filtration process moreover the uv cl and uv cl pac pretreatments were proved positive for emerging micropollutants degradation and disinfection by products formation potential reduction the results suggested that uv and uv cl are likely strategies to enhance the efficiency of pac adsorption pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration during algae contaminated water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords powdered activated carbon uv chlorine process algal rich water membrane fouling micropollutants 1 introduction frequent algae blooms have emerged in surface water sources and brought out a serious challenge in drinking water treatment senga et al 2018 in recent decades ineffective treatment of algae laden water can cause the deterioration of water quality such as high effluent turbidity undesirable organic matter release and microcystins leakage guo 2007 ultrafiltration uf has been proposed as an acceptable option for algae contaminated water treatment owing to its high efficiency for particle retention peter varbanets et al 2009 however membrane fouling accumulation during filtration remains an obstacle for broad utilization of uf process during algal rich water treatment lin et al 2009 the typical algal metabolite in algae contaminated water extracellular organic matter eom has been recognized mainly responsible for rapid flux decline for uf membranes zhang et al 2015 a further potential risk for algal water treatment is the limited retention of low molecular weight substances and micropollutants as the pore size of uf membrane was considerably larger than these compounds lee and walker 2008 liu et al 2018 many strategies have been employed to diminish membrane fouling and toxin substances caused by algae contaminated water sources the pretreatment of feed water solution has been applied as a simple and impressive approach including coagulation ma et al 2014 adsorption tang et al 2018 and oxidation merle et al 2017 the combined processes of these methods were adopted as well huang et al 2017 despite the fact that prevalent pretreatments displayed positive effects on membrane fouling alleviation and micropollutant removal there are still some problems emerging during practical application van geluwe et al 2011 powdered activated carbon pac as a typical adsorbent in water treatment has been demonstrated to effectively reduce organic contaminants altmann et al 2015 it is generally recognized that pac adsorption prefers to remove low mw organic fractions and mircropollutants löwenberg et al 2014 which are responsible for disinfection by products formation and toxic substances respectively besides pac was employed to alleviate membrane fouling induced by natural organic pollutant wang et al 2016 nonetheless the removal of high mw organic pollutants is not obvious due to the poor adsorption between pac and macromolecules which could not effectively mitigate uf membrane fouling induced by eom some studies also reported that the membrane fouling accumulation was even aggravated due to the consolidation of organic substances and pac shao et al 2016 in brief the performance of pac adsorption alone on mitigating uf membrane fouling was still unsatisfactory hence further enhancement of pac adsorption process is required to solve the problems during algal rich water treatment numerous investigations have proposed that the removal of organic contaminations can be enhanced through oxidation processes which could decompose organic substances and change the characteristics of organic contaminants chen et al 2017 the molecules containing electron rich areas i e aromatic delocalization are preferably degraded which could not be easily absorbed by pac treguer et al 2010 commonly utilized oxidants include ozone chlorine permanganate and ferrate whereas some undesirable disinfection by products or water colority were frequently generated from the reactions wert et al 2007 uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been applied as novel methods to decompose many contaminants in aquatic solutions such as nitrobenzene fang et al 2014 geosmin xie et al 2015 and algal toxins sun et al 2018 uv chlorine uv cl as a typical uv aops process has recently drawn widespread attention due to its high oxidation efficiency uv chlorine even showed higher degradation efficiency than uv h2o2 process for some micropollutants which could be attributed to both hydroxyl and chlorine radicals ho and cl produced during uv cl process wang et al 2012 considering its strong oxidative performance uv chlorine could be an ideal alternative to improve the adsorption capability of pac on contaminates removal and subsequent membrane fouling mitigation however previous studies mainly concentrated on the effects of common oxidants on enhancing pac adsorption efficiency in organic matter removal and membrane fouling mitigation huang et al 2017 the application of uv chlorine in pac adsorption pretreatment has not been investigated especially for algal contaminated water treatment by uf membrane the work aims to investigate the effects of uv and uv cl on pac adsorption pretreatment during algal rich water treatment by uf membrane the impacts of the pretreatments on organic matter removal and characteristic were comprehensively identified the membrane fouling control by these methods was investigated through transmembrane pressure curves reversibility analysis and combined model fitting in addition the removal of micropollutants and disinfection by products formation potential was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation and feed water preparation the algae microcystis aeruginosa pcc7820 utilized to simulate the algae rich natural water resource was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the algal seeds were incubated in bg11 culture media at 25 c using an incubator and 14 h of constant illumination was provided every day xie et al 2013 the cultured algae were employed at the stationary stage harvested at 35 days in this study the centrifugation of algae solutions was conducted at 10 000 rpm and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtration of the supernatant through 0 45 μm mixed fiber filter lanrain china to extract algal eom cheng et al 2018 the raw natural surface water solutions were obtained from songhua river northeast china during march 2018 and pre filtered by 0 45 μm filter as well raw prepared eom solutions were diluted to the same concentration of doc in songhua river water table s1 to simulate and investigate high medium and slight algal rich feed water the eom solution and the river water was mixed in varying proportion of 1 3 1 7 and 1 15 denoted as haw maw and saw respectively 1 μmol l of atrazine and p chloronitrobenzene were independently diluted into feed water prior to the experiment to study the removal of micropollutants 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 pretreatments as illustrated in fig 1 the adsorption pretreatments of pac uv pac up and uv cl pac ucp were adopted for uf membrane filtration in this study the uv cl uc process was also evaluated for comparison pac of analytical reagent grade was provided by aladdin chemical shanghai china and sodium hypochlorite solution active chlorine content 10 was supplied by bench chemicals tianjin china pac pretreatment was performed by adding 20 mg l of pac into the feed water and then stirring at 200 r min for 30 min the relatively lower dosage of pac was applied here to avoid loss of uv transmittance and massive sludge during filtration process the uv pac uv chlorine and uv chlorine pac pretreatments were conducted in a quasi collimated uv device as shown in fig s1 the uv irradiator contains six uv lamps 254 nm heraeus germany and a glass reactor of 15 cm diameter was located beneath the uv irradiation beam the uv light flux was determined by a uvc radiometer beijing normal university china and the irradiation intensity on the water surface was measured to be 2 0 mw cm2 uv pac pretreatment was performed by adding 20 mg l pac into the feed water then mixed under uv exposure for 30 min the chlorine naclo stock solution was freshly prepared and standardized using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd sulfate spectrophotometric method federation and association 2005 uv chlorine pretreatment was operated by adding 4 mg l of chlorine solution into the feed water followed by mixing and uv exposure uv chlorine pac pretreatment was performed by adding a certain dosage of pac and chlorine 20 and 4 mg l into feed water and then mixed under uv irradiation for 30 min 2 2 2 uf membrane filtration the flat sheet uf membrane of polyethersulfone pes was supplied by microdyn nadir gmbh germany the mw cut off of the membrane was 150 kda and the membrane area of each piece was sheared to 25 cm2 the fresh membranes were saturated in ethanol solutions for 30 min and then rinsed using pure water until the doc of filtrated water was less than 0 2 mg l the experiment of the uf process was operated in dead end flow filtration mode with the flux stable at 4 0 10 5 m s 1 through a peristaltic pump lange china hydraulic backwash was performed at the end of each filtration period using milli q water the transmembrane pressure was recorded every 5 s by pressure transducer and data receiving system 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation to explore the fouling behavior during filtration the resistance in series model rai et al 2006 was employed for calculating membrane fouling resistance distribution as presented in eq 1 1 r t tmp μj r m r r r ir where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa r t is the total fouling resistance m 1 μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux m s 1 and constant r m is the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 r r and r ir represent reversible and irreversible resistance m 1 after hydraulic backwash respectively during the experiments the average tmp of pure water filtration was recorded as tmp 0 and then the r m was calculated according to eq 2 2 r m tmp 0 μj at the end of each filtration period of water samples the tmp was recorded as tmp 1 and total fouling resistance r t was calculated through eq 3 the filtration transmembrane pressure of pure water after backwash of each filtration period was recorded as tmp 2 subsequently reversible r r and irreversible fouling resistance r ir were determined through eqs 4 and 5 3 r t tmp 1 μj 4 r r tmp 1 μj tmp 2 μj 5 r ir r t r m r r the membrane fouling behavior can be classified in four typical mechanisms consisting of complete blocking model intermediate blocking model standard blocking and cake filtration model however the membrane fouling accumulation tends to vary during the filtration period to analyze the influence of pretreatments on fouling mechanisms and variation a combined model proposed by bolton was utilized to evaluate the filtration data bolton et al 2006 in this study the dominating mechanism and its variation during filtration can be described according to equations in table 1 in the modeling equations p is the normalized tmp at a given time calculated by eq 6 t represents the filtration time s j refers to the flux m s 1 during filtration 6 p tmp tmp 0 modeling fitting was performed using the five combined models and the most conforming fouling model can be determined according to the goodness of fit r squared subsequently the fouling mechanism and its transition can be obtained using the fitted parameters 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena the uv absorbing at 254 nm uv254 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was collected via the fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan all eem measurements were conducted in a 1 cm cuvette at constant temperature 20 1 c the raman scatter peaks were mostly eliminated by subtracting the spectrum of ultrapure water from each sample detailed information about the wavelength of measurement was introduced previously cheng et al 2017 parallel factor analysis parafac is employed to distinguish the eem spectra into several relatively independent fluorescent components by matlab domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 the component number was derived and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component was achieved from the parafac modeling analysis ly et al 2018 the constituent and relative concentration of derived fluorescent components in raw and pre treated water could be calculated the apparent molecular weight mw distribution was determined using a high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec wufeng equipped with a uv detector at 254 nm the chromatographic separation was conducted with a silica gel column tsk gel g4000pwxl the phosphate buffer mobile phase 0 008 m of na2hpo4 and 0 018 m of kh2po4 ph 6 85 was freshly prepared and ultrasonically treated to removed dissolved air before use the flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min and temperature of column oven was kept at 30 c respectively the concentration of atz and p cnb was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 through a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm waters atz was analyzed in a mobile phase of mixed methanol milli q water at a ratio of 30 70 v v at a wavelength of 222 nm the concentration of p cnb was determined at a wavelength of 275 nm in the mobile phase consisted of methanol and pure water with a ratio of 80 20 v v the flow rate was 1 ml min and the column temperature was 30 c in both atz and p cnb analysis microcystin lr mc lr which is typical microcystin in algae rich water was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled with a triple quadrupole detector xevo tm tq ms equipped with an electrospray interface lc ms ms waters the uplc beh column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm particle size was employed the detailed description of this method could be obtained in earlier research liu et al 2017 trihalomethane formation potential thmfp of feed water solutions was measured to evaluate disinfection by products dbps precursors according to us epa method and the residence time after chlorination was reduced to 36 h the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography agilent 6980n coupled with a capillary column 30 m 2 mmm 0 25 μm agilent and an electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the column and detector was controlled at 60 and 200 c respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of uv pac and uv cl pac on organic pollutant removal as illustrated in fig 2 the effects of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments on doc and uv254 removal for algae contaminated surface water were identified fig 2 a indicated that the doc removal efficiency varied according to the different proportion of eom in feed water in terms of pac adsorption a minor reduction on doc was achieved of 5 0 5 5 and 7 2 for haw maw and saw respectively with the uv irradiation the doc reduction rated was enhanced to 7 2 8 9 and 11 under these three feed water conditions furthermore the addition of chlorine in ucp showed even higher performance in doc removal 9 4 13 and 17 than uv pac or uv chlorine in haw maw and saw respectively the distinction of doc removal by uv pac and uv cl pac could be attributed to the different removal mechanisms of these two processes specifically the uv irradiation alone could hardly degrade the organic contaminate based on the limited and short lived hydroxyl radicals ho in solutions it tends to draw partially quality change of dom in feed water such as c c bonds or aromatic nucleus break xing et al 2018 thus the rare improvement of doc removal in uv pac was mainly caused by higher adsorption of irradiated dom as its absorbability increases with aromaticity decrease huang et al 2017 while in uv cl and uv cl pac systems both ho and chlorine radical cl were generated under uv light via reaction equations 7 and 8 watts and linden 2007 the effective oxidation of organic pollutant in water samples by ho and cl promoted the reduction of doc in addition some high mw organic components were decomposed into low mw contaminates by uv cl which were easier to be adsorbed in uv cl pac process as suggested in fig 2 b the degradation of uv254 showed a similar response to that of doc except for that the values of uv254 after pretreatments were notably lower for example the removal rates of uv254 by uv cl pac pretreatment reached 54 52 and 51 for haw maw and saw respectively the results could be attributed to that the aromatic compounds and other unsaturated bonds in dom are more responsive to radical oxidation while they were relatively hard to be mineralized to inorganic substances it was noteworthy that the removal rate of uv254 by uv cl pac raised slightly with the larger proportion of eom in feed water suggesting satisfying and stable decrease of both uv absorbance matter in nom and eom overall the removal performance of doc and uv254 by pac was enhanced by uv and uv cl in the following order uv cl pac uv pac pac 7 h o c l uv light h o c l 8 o c l uv light o c l 3 2 effects of uv pac and uv chlorine pac on dom characteristics fluorescence eem spectrum has been employed as an effective method to characterize dom and the parafac analysis was applied for quantitative spectra interpretation as shown in fig 3 a model of four independent components was identified in this study wavelengths of excitation ex and emission em pairs are described in table s2 and the corresponding ex and em loadings are shown in fig s2 based on the position of ex em wavelengths the various components in water samples are classified according to previous studies to be specific component 1 ex em 250 320 nm 395 nm c1 is correlated to the microbial humic like fluorescence and component 2 ex em 260 350 nm 450 nm c2 represents the terrestrial humic like substances the two components c1 and c2 have been previously recognized dominant in natural water resources component 3 ex em 240 270 nm 345 nm c3 is associated with tryptophan like proteins while component 4 ex em 265 nm 280 530 nm c4 is found as tyrosine like protein and humic like component from bacterial processing sgroi et al 2018 c3 and c4 tryptophan and tyrosine like proteins are commonly found through eem parafac analysis as important compositions of microorganisms in surface and waste water xu and jiang 2013 for feed water of haw maw and saw the proportion of c3 and c4 decreased with the higher ratio of nom eom as shown in fig 4 indicating the different characteristics of particularly algae contaminated surface water fig 4 illustrated the performance of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments for removing four derived fluorescence components using parafac analysis in terms of haw pretreatments with pac uv pac uv cl and uv cl pac efficiently reduced the c2 humic like substances fluorescence intensity by 44 46 91 and 94 respectively the uv cl and uv cl pac pretreatments displayed significant removal performance on the removal of c2 whereas pac adsorption alone and uv pac exhibited limited and similar reduction efficiency for that the results could be attributed to the limited effects of uv light on humic like organic matters and relatively competent oxidation by ho and cl radicals the removal performance of c1 is similar to that of c2 however the uv pac pretreatment greatly improve the removal efficiency of c3 and c4 compared to pac alone by 24 and 23 respectively furthermore uv cl pac even degraded and adsorbed the protein like substances c3 by 92 it is notable that the distinct improvement of c4 removal was observed with uv cl pac compared to uv cl oxidation which led to a lower proportion of protein like substances in the treated solutions and uv pac pretreatment also displayed preferential removal of tryptophan and tyrosine like proteins compared to pac adsorption alone the results suggested that uv and uv cl achieved more obvious impact on enhancing the removal of protein like than humic like components with pac adsorption in view of the different contamination degrees by algal organic matter the fluorescent intensities of protein like substances were further decreased in relatively less algae polluted surface water maw and saw shown in fig 4 in previous study proteins were identified as major constituents of macromolecular contaminates in the algal organic matter yang et al 2017 moreover they are proved remarkably concerned with uf membrane fouling considering the impressive elimination of protein like and humic like organic matter it is reasonable to assume that uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments could appreciably mitigate membrane fouling during algal rich water purification with uf process the mw distribution of raw water and pretreated water solutions was investigated to evaluate the effects of different pretreatments fig 5 for untreated feed water three significant peaks were detected as high mw 20 kda medium mw 2 5 kda substances and low mw 1 kda organics for the uv absorbing substances fig 5 showed that pac adsorption alone performed limited effects on the high mw organic matter removal and with the less proportion of uv absorbing algal organic matter in raw water the reduction of high mw pollutants by pac adsorption was slightly improved the results indicate that pac exhibited poor adsorption ability of macromolecular substances biopolymers or protein like substances which corresponded to earlier studies wang et al 2016 when uv pac was employed high mw matter in the three untreated feed water was further removed and the improvement showed a regularity of haw maw saw this is attributed to the similar removal rate of high mw substances by uv pac in surface water contaminated by algae in different degrees on the contrary the medium mw organic matter tends to be better eliminated in slightly algae polluted water solutions therefore it was implied that the medium and high mw uv absorbing substances reduction was improved by uv pac treatment compared to pac adsorption alone as for the uv cl pac treatment the peaks of high and medium mw compounds were significantly decreased in the order of haw maw saw the results were consistent with the uv254 removal by uv cl pac treatment while the reduction of high mw substances by uv cl exhibited minor distinction between the three untreated water suggesting that the uv absorbing components 3000 da from algal organic matter are more responsive to uv cl pac pretreatment hence less organic fouling would accumulate during following membrane filtration process of algae contaminated surface water 3 3 effects of uv pac and uv cl pac on membrane fouling fig 6 illustrated the influences of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments on uf membrane fouling induced by algae contaminated feed water via tmp variation and fouling resistance distribution as shown in fig 6 a the raw haw feed water led to a rapid tmp development from 19 to 69 78 and 81 kpa during the first second and third filtration period respectively when the water samples were pretreated by uv pac it certainly alleviated tmp development with the terminal tmp of the third filtration cycle reduced to 67 kpa while the pretreatment of pac adsorption alone exhibited minor influence on membrane fouling control as the final tmp was close to that of raw water without pretreatment the improvement of filtration performance was mainly associated with the uv irradiation which could decompose some high mw substances into low mw fractions that could be adsorbed by pac huang et al 2017 and this structural change of organic matter could also promote uf filtration productivity the results indicated uv irradiation was a feasible strategy for improving the performance of pac in membrane fouling reduction when uv cl pac was employed to feed water the tmp development was significantly slowed down and terminated at 56 kpa it was mainly ascribed to that the organic components were reduced by uv cl pac at a wide range of mw distribution through the combined effects of oxidation and adsorption as shown in fig 5 to further reveal the influences of pretreatments on fouling mitigation the resistance distribution during filtration process was analyzed fig 6 d showed that both notable reversible and irreversible membrane fouling was formed in raw haw filtration with the final rir and r r of 3 48 and 6 21 1011 m 1 respectively for the pac pretreatment the final reversible fouling could be hardly reduced compared to irreversible fouling which was associated with the limited pac adsorption ability for high mw substances than smaller molecules the previous study also reported that the low mw fractions tended to cause irreversible fouling due to pore narrowing and blocking and large molecules were linked with cake layer fouling cheng et al 2017 when uv pac was applied the irreversible and reversible fouling were alleviated by 26 36 and 13 22 respectively the degradation and characteristics revision of dissolved organic contaminants both took responsibility for the improved performance of uf membrane as shown in figs 5 and 6 the uv cl pretreatment did not obviously enhance the rir removal compared to uv pac the uv cl could mineralize some low mw components by radical oxidation while some low mw fragments were formed from broken high and medium mw substances simultaneously hence the retardation of irreversible fouling by uv cl was not noticeable under the condition of uv cl pac pretreatment the irreversible and reversible fouling was significantly alleviated by 44 48 and 33 53 respectively uv cl pac achieved most satisfying efficiency for alleviating membrane fouling which was associated with the lowest organic loading of high and low mw substances compared to pac adsorption the addition of uv cl provided the oxidation of pollutant and promoted the adsorption capacity by decomposing macromolecules effects of algal contamination degrees on membrane fouling control by pretreatments were also investigated fig 6 b and c showed the tmp increase curve of maw and saw filtration respectively the reversible and irreversible fouling distributions were also calculated as the proportion of eom decreased the membrane fouling of untreated water filtration correspondingly declined especially for the reversible fouling resistances for maw solutions similar to haw the pac adsorption alone exhibited limited performance in membrane fouling reduction with the uv irradiation the irreversible and reversible fouling was mitigated by 5 20 and 13 39 respectively when the uv cl was applied the reversible fouling reduction was more obvious than uv pac while the final r ir of first filtration cycle even increased compared to untreated water the results indicated that uv cl oxidation could degrade some dissolved organic substances into smaller ones than mineralization xing et al 2018 which could hardly alleviate the irreversible fouling caused by pore blocking as expected uv cl pac performed a positive impact in fouling reduction in maw of both irreversible 13 30 and reversible 43 72 fouling resistances in terms of saw solutions the uv irradiation improved the pac adsorption pretreatment in membrane fouling control and the uv cl pac notably reduced tmp increase as well it is noteworthy that the irreversible fouling was significantly decreased by uv cl pac pretreatment in saw filtration by 68 91 the results indicated that the extracellular organic matter was relatively harder to be decomposed into smaller fractions or mineralized compared to natural organic substances overall both uv and uv cl persuasively promoted fouling resistance reduction by pac pretreatment during algae contaminated surface water purification and the best performance of membrane fouling mitigation was observed when uv cl pac was applied to obtain a better recognition for the effects of pretreatments on fouling mechanisms during algae contaminated surface water the normalized tmp versus filtration time was fitted according to the combined membrane fouling model introduced in section 2 3 as fig 7 illustrated the processed data were well fitted to the complete standard model r2 0 990 which indicated that the complete and standard blocking was significant in the membrane fouling accumulation related to algae contaminated surface water this result was agreeable with the co existence of reversible and irreversible fouling induced from high and low mw components in nom and eom the contribution of complete blocking and standard blocking could be investigated from the fitting parameters table s3 suggesting that the standard pore blocking was dominant during the fouling formation and mitigation the occurrence of standard blocking during the filtration of eom using polymeric membranes was also found in previous study qu et al 2014 wei also reported that standard blocking mechanism was notable in the fouling caused by eom using ceramic uf membrane wei et al 2016 the fitting parameter ks for the complete standard model for different pretreatments and raw water was illustrated in fig 7 d it could be observed that the ks for raw water gradually decreased with reducing the proportion of eom which further implied that the algal substances in contaminated surface water could cause server standard pore blocking liu et al 2018 the results were consistent with the rapid and smooth development of tmp in haw and saw solutions in initial filtration stage fig 6 respectively uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments remarkably cut down the absolute magnitude of ks while pac displayed limited impact on account of the ks values the maw solutions exhibited the most sensitive response to uv pac and uv cl pac fig 7 d the maw and saw solutions pretreated by uv cl pac even reached a similar ks value however the fouling development of treated maw was faster than saw which justified the occurrence of complete blocking mechanism during the filtration process wei et al 2016 based on the modeling fit the standard blocking could be notably reduced by uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments and the variation of modeling parameter was consistent with the fouling resistance calculated from tmp curves 3 4 removal of micropollutants micropollutants have been detected in the source of drinking water due to their stability and microcystis toxins derived from cells raised a significant concern during algae contaminated surface water treatment liu et al 2018 in this study mc lr atz and p cnb were selected as representative micropollutants of microcystis toxins herbicides and antibiotics respectively these contaminants have been proved as threaten and risk to the health of human and animals kong et al 2016 due to the much higher mw cutoff of polymeric uf membrane the micropollutants could hardly be retained by uf membrane alone through size exclusion fig 8 presented the performance of micropollutants rejection during filtration with or without pretreatments the mc lr concentration in raw eom solution was measured to be 4 2 μg l and the haw maw and saw feed water contained 1 05 0 53 and 0 26 μg l of mc lr respectively as shown in fig 8 a uf without pretreatment performed poor ability for mc lr removal of less than 13 despite of the initial concentration when uv pac was applied the removal rate was significantly improved to 36 43 and the removal efficiency increased with the higher concentration of mc lr by contrast the reduction of mc lr by pac adsorption alone and uv cl was slightly promoted at the removal rate of 25 27 and 31 33 respectively the generated cl and ho radicals during uv cl process were supposed to mineralize or partially decompose the micropollutants while the pac adsorption was inclined to absorb the whole molecule of micropollutant which led to that the removal efficiency by uv cl was somewhat higher that pac adsorption alone previous study also indicated that the removal of microcystins by low dosage of pac at 30 min was less than 20 şengül et al 2018 and many kinds of micropollutants were insensitive to pac adsorption alone at the dose of 20 mg l altmann et al 2015 as expected the uv cl pac showed significant improvement of mc lr removal at the rate of 42 46 this result was generally ascribed to the combined effects of adsorption and radical oxidation and the intermediate products generated from oxidation could be further adsorbed similar to mc lr the uf membrane alone exhibited low efficiency in atz and p cnb removal as shown in fig 8 b in terms of atz the removal rate was greatly promoted to 42 65 and 60 72 by uv pac and uv cl pac respectively the obvious improvement of atz removal was attributed to the high degradation efficiency by uv irradiation and uv cl oxidation when the pretreatment was applied the p cnb removal showed noticeable distinction in the order of uv cl pac uv pac pac the uv irradiation only slighted improved removal rate for p cnb by 6 12 compared to pac alone it was due to the nitrobenzene compounds could strongly absorb uv lights and had a lower reaction rate with cl garcia einschlag et al 2002 and the uv cl pac significantly encouraged p cnb removal by 42 76 as expected overall the uv and uv cl were favorable in the control of micropollutants by enhancing pac adsorption pretreatment in algae contaminated water purification using uf membrane 3 5 removal of tcmfp as shown in fig 9 the trihalomethanes tcms were selected to evaluate the main components of disinfection by products in algae contaminated surface water treatment for raw water the tcmfp followed the order of saw maw haw this result was attributed to the distinguished ratio of eom nom in the three feed water it was reported that the algal organic matter had a lower rate of typical dbps generation than that of nom li et al 2012 as the eem parafac analysis presented in fig 4 d the highly algae contaminated surface water contained a lower concentration of humic like substances which was proved most reactive in the formation of tcms when pac adsorption was applied alone the tcmfp was reduced by 18 and 7 of haw and maw respectively however the removal rate of tcmfp was decreased except for the saw solution it could be implied that the smaller fractions formed under uv irradiation tended to have a higher potential of tcms formation and the different trend for saw could be attributed to the more efficient elimination of low mw humic like components in nom when uv cl pac was employed the tcmfp of haw maw and saw was all significantly reduced at the rates of 26 17 and 18 respectively the combination of uv cl oxidation and pac adsorption offset the negative impacts of dbps formation induced by uv cl overall both uv pac and uv cl pac showed positive effects on tcmfp removal and uv cl pac achieved the most satisfactory performance 4 conclusion in this study uv and uv cl were applied to assist pac adsorption pretreatment prior to uf membrane during typical algal rich microcystis aeruginos water purification the following conclusions can be drawn 1 uv and uv cl promoted the removal of doc and uv254 for algal rich water and it was correlated to membrane fouling control considering the various degrees of algal contamination uv pac and uv cl pac showed even better performance of uv254 removal in highly algae polluted surface water 2 the fluorescent eem spectra of algae contaminated surface water were well interpreted using a four component model uv and uv cl were impressive in promoting the removal of protein like substances c3 and c4 in apparent order of uv cl pac uv pac pac 3 uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments attributed to the mitigation of uf membrane fouling during algal water filtration and uv cl pac showed most satisfactory performance in mitigating reversible and irreversible fouling likely attributed to the combined effects of high and low mw uv absorbing substances removal 4 the standard pore blocking mechanism was proved significant to uf membrane fouling caused by algal rich surface water uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments were proved effective in alleviating pore blocking in comparison with pac adsorption alone 5 uv pac and uv cl pac significantly improved the removal of typical algal toxin mc lr atz and p cnb and the uv cl pac pretreatment was effective in reducing tcm formation potential particularly during

18782,in this work uv and uv chlorine uv cl were employed to enhance powdered activated carbon pac adsorption pretreatment prior to ultrafiltration process for algae contaminated surface water treatment their performance on membrane fouling mitigation and organic pollutant rejection was systematically evaluated a comparative experiment was conducted under varying pollution degrees of algal extracellular organic matter eom contamination in surface river water the results indicated that uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatment effectively enhanced the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbing at 254 nm uv254 the characteristics of feed water after pretreatments were investigated through apparent molecular weight mw distribution and fluorescence parallel factor analysis parafac in regard to membrane fouling mitigation uv cl pac noticeably decreased reversible and irreversible fouling resistance simultaneously and uv pac preferred reducing reversible membrane fouling combined fouling modeling was operated to scrutinize the fouling mitigation mechanisms and standard pore blocking was proved to be dominant during the filtration process moreover the uv cl and uv cl pac pretreatments were proved positive for emerging micropollutants degradation and disinfection by products formation potential reduction the results suggested that uv and uv cl are likely strategies to enhance the efficiency of pac adsorption pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration during algae contaminated water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords powdered activated carbon uv chlorine process algal rich water membrane fouling micropollutants 1 introduction frequent algae blooms have emerged in surface water sources and brought out a serious challenge in drinking water treatment senga et al 2018 in recent decades ineffective treatment of algae laden water can cause the deterioration of water quality such as high effluent turbidity undesirable organic matter release and microcystins leakage guo 2007 ultrafiltration uf has been proposed as an acceptable option for algae contaminated water treatment owing to its high efficiency for particle retention peter varbanets et al 2009 however membrane fouling accumulation during filtration remains an obstacle for broad utilization of uf process during algal rich water treatment lin et al 2009 the typical algal metabolite in algae contaminated water extracellular organic matter eom has been recognized mainly responsible for rapid flux decline for uf membranes zhang et al 2015 a further potential risk for algal water treatment is the limited retention of low molecular weight substances and micropollutants as the pore size of uf membrane was considerably larger than these compounds lee and walker 2008 liu et al 2018 many strategies have been employed to diminish membrane fouling and toxin substances caused by algae contaminated water sources the pretreatment of feed water solution has been applied as a simple and impressive approach including coagulation ma et al 2014 adsorption tang et al 2018 and oxidation merle et al 2017 the combined processes of these methods were adopted as well huang et al 2017 despite the fact that prevalent pretreatments displayed positive effects on membrane fouling alleviation and micropollutant removal there are still some problems emerging during practical application van geluwe et al 2011 powdered activated carbon pac as a typical adsorbent in water treatment has been demonstrated to effectively reduce organic contaminants altmann et al 2015 it is generally recognized that pac adsorption prefers to remove low mw organic fractions and mircropollutants löwenberg et al 2014 which are responsible for disinfection by products formation and toxic substances respectively besides pac was employed to alleviate membrane fouling induced by natural organic pollutant wang et al 2016 nonetheless the removal of high mw organic pollutants is not obvious due to the poor adsorption between pac and macromolecules which could not effectively mitigate uf membrane fouling induced by eom some studies also reported that the membrane fouling accumulation was even aggravated due to the consolidation of organic substances and pac shao et al 2016 in brief the performance of pac adsorption alone on mitigating uf membrane fouling was still unsatisfactory hence further enhancement of pac adsorption process is required to solve the problems during algal rich water treatment numerous investigations have proposed that the removal of organic contaminations can be enhanced through oxidation processes which could decompose organic substances and change the characteristics of organic contaminants chen et al 2017 the molecules containing electron rich areas i e aromatic delocalization are preferably degraded which could not be easily absorbed by pac treguer et al 2010 commonly utilized oxidants include ozone chlorine permanganate and ferrate whereas some undesirable disinfection by products or water colority were frequently generated from the reactions wert et al 2007 uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been applied as novel methods to decompose many contaminants in aquatic solutions such as nitrobenzene fang et al 2014 geosmin xie et al 2015 and algal toxins sun et al 2018 uv chlorine uv cl as a typical uv aops process has recently drawn widespread attention due to its high oxidation efficiency uv chlorine even showed higher degradation efficiency than uv h2o2 process for some micropollutants which could be attributed to both hydroxyl and chlorine radicals ho and cl produced during uv cl process wang et al 2012 considering its strong oxidative performance uv chlorine could be an ideal alternative to improve the adsorption capability of pac on contaminates removal and subsequent membrane fouling mitigation however previous studies mainly concentrated on the effects of common oxidants on enhancing pac adsorption efficiency in organic matter removal and membrane fouling mitigation huang et al 2017 the application of uv chlorine in pac adsorption pretreatment has not been investigated especially for algal contaminated water treatment by uf membrane the work aims to investigate the effects of uv and uv cl on pac adsorption pretreatment during algal rich water treatment by uf membrane the impacts of the pretreatments on organic matter removal and characteristic were comprehensively identified the membrane fouling control by these methods was investigated through transmembrane pressure curves reversibility analysis and combined model fitting in addition the removal of micropollutants and disinfection by products formation potential was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation and feed water preparation the algae microcystis aeruginosa pcc7820 utilized to simulate the algae rich natural water resource was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the algal seeds were incubated in bg11 culture media at 25 c using an incubator and 14 h of constant illumination was provided every day xie et al 2013 the cultured algae were employed at the stationary stage harvested at 35 days in this study the centrifugation of algae solutions was conducted at 10 000 rpm and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtration of the supernatant through 0 45 μm mixed fiber filter lanrain china to extract algal eom cheng et al 2018 the raw natural surface water solutions were obtained from songhua river northeast china during march 2018 and pre filtered by 0 45 μm filter as well raw prepared eom solutions were diluted to the same concentration of doc in songhua river water table s1 to simulate and investigate high medium and slight algal rich feed water the eom solution and the river water was mixed in varying proportion of 1 3 1 7 and 1 15 denoted as haw maw and saw respectively 1 μmol l of atrazine and p chloronitrobenzene were independently diluted into feed water prior to the experiment to study the removal of micropollutants 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 pretreatments as illustrated in fig 1 the adsorption pretreatments of pac uv pac up and uv cl pac ucp were adopted for uf membrane filtration in this study the uv cl uc process was also evaluated for comparison pac of analytical reagent grade was provided by aladdin chemical shanghai china and sodium hypochlorite solution active chlorine content 10 was supplied by bench chemicals tianjin china pac pretreatment was performed by adding 20 mg l of pac into the feed water and then stirring at 200 r min for 30 min the relatively lower dosage of pac was applied here to avoid loss of uv transmittance and massive sludge during filtration process the uv pac uv chlorine and uv chlorine pac pretreatments were conducted in a quasi collimated uv device as shown in fig s1 the uv irradiator contains six uv lamps 254 nm heraeus germany and a glass reactor of 15 cm diameter was located beneath the uv irradiation beam the uv light flux was determined by a uvc radiometer beijing normal university china and the irradiation intensity on the water surface was measured to be 2 0 mw cm2 uv pac pretreatment was performed by adding 20 mg l pac into the feed water then mixed under uv exposure for 30 min the chlorine naclo stock solution was freshly prepared and standardized using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd sulfate spectrophotometric method federation and association 2005 uv chlorine pretreatment was operated by adding 4 mg l of chlorine solution into the feed water followed by mixing and uv exposure uv chlorine pac pretreatment was performed by adding a certain dosage of pac and chlorine 20 and 4 mg l into feed water and then mixed under uv irradiation for 30 min 2 2 2 uf membrane filtration the flat sheet uf membrane of polyethersulfone pes was supplied by microdyn nadir gmbh germany the mw cut off of the membrane was 150 kda and the membrane area of each piece was sheared to 25 cm2 the fresh membranes were saturated in ethanol solutions for 30 min and then rinsed using pure water until the doc of filtrated water was less than 0 2 mg l the experiment of the uf process was operated in dead end flow filtration mode with the flux stable at 4 0 10 5 m s 1 through a peristaltic pump lange china hydraulic backwash was performed at the end of each filtration period using milli q water the transmembrane pressure was recorded every 5 s by pressure transducer and data receiving system 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation to explore the fouling behavior during filtration the resistance in series model rai et al 2006 was employed for calculating membrane fouling resistance distribution as presented in eq 1 1 r t tmp μj r m r r r ir where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa r t is the total fouling resistance m 1 μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux m s 1 and constant r m is the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 r r and r ir represent reversible and irreversible resistance m 1 after hydraulic backwash respectively during the experiments the average tmp of pure water filtration was recorded as tmp 0 and then the r m was calculated according to eq 2 2 r m tmp 0 μj at the end of each filtration period of water samples the tmp was recorded as tmp 1 and total fouling resistance r t was calculated through eq 3 the filtration transmembrane pressure of pure water after backwash of each filtration period was recorded as tmp 2 subsequently reversible r r and irreversible fouling resistance r ir were determined through eqs 4 and 5 3 r t tmp 1 μj 4 r r tmp 1 μj tmp 2 μj 5 r ir r t r m r r the membrane fouling behavior can be classified in four typical mechanisms consisting of complete blocking model intermediate blocking model standard blocking and cake filtration model however the membrane fouling accumulation tends to vary during the filtration period to analyze the influence of pretreatments on fouling mechanisms and variation a combined model proposed by bolton was utilized to evaluate the filtration data bolton et al 2006 in this study the dominating mechanism and its variation during filtration can be described according to equations in table 1 in the modeling equations p is the normalized tmp at a given time calculated by eq 6 t represents the filtration time s j refers to the flux m s 1 during filtration 6 p tmp tmp 0 modeling fitting was performed using the five combined models and the most conforming fouling model can be determined according to the goodness of fit r squared subsequently the fouling mechanism and its transition can be obtained using the fitted parameters 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena the uv absorbing at 254 nm uv254 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was collected via the fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan all eem measurements were conducted in a 1 cm cuvette at constant temperature 20 1 c the raman scatter peaks were mostly eliminated by subtracting the spectrum of ultrapure water from each sample detailed information about the wavelength of measurement was introduced previously cheng et al 2017 parallel factor analysis parafac is employed to distinguish the eem spectra into several relatively independent fluorescent components by matlab domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 the component number was derived and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component was achieved from the parafac modeling analysis ly et al 2018 the constituent and relative concentration of derived fluorescent components in raw and pre treated water could be calculated the apparent molecular weight mw distribution was determined using a high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec wufeng equipped with a uv detector at 254 nm the chromatographic separation was conducted with a silica gel column tsk gel g4000pwxl the phosphate buffer mobile phase 0 008 m of na2hpo4 and 0 018 m of kh2po4 ph 6 85 was freshly prepared and ultrasonically treated to removed dissolved air before use the flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min and temperature of column oven was kept at 30 c respectively the concentration of atz and p cnb was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 through a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm waters atz was analyzed in a mobile phase of mixed methanol milli q water at a ratio of 30 70 v v at a wavelength of 222 nm the concentration of p cnb was determined at a wavelength of 275 nm in the mobile phase consisted of methanol and pure water with a ratio of 80 20 v v the flow rate was 1 ml min and the column temperature was 30 c in both atz and p cnb analysis microcystin lr mc lr which is typical microcystin in algae rich water was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled with a triple quadrupole detector xevo tm tq ms equipped with an electrospray interface lc ms ms waters the uplc beh column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm particle size was employed the detailed description of this method could be obtained in earlier research liu et al 2017 trihalomethane formation potential thmfp of feed water solutions was measured to evaluate disinfection by products dbps precursors according to us epa method and the residence time after chlorination was reduced to 36 h the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography agilent 6980n coupled with a capillary column 30 m 2 mmm 0 25 μm agilent and an electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the column and detector was controlled at 60 and 200 c respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of uv pac and uv cl pac on organic pollutant removal as illustrated in fig 2 the effects of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments on doc and uv254 removal for algae contaminated surface water were identified fig 2 a indicated that the doc removal efficiency varied according to the different proportion of eom in feed water in terms of pac adsorption a minor reduction on doc was achieved of 5 0 5 5 and 7 2 for haw maw and saw respectively with the uv irradiation the doc reduction rated was enhanced to 7 2 8 9 and 11 under these three feed water conditions furthermore the addition of chlorine in ucp showed even higher performance in doc removal 9 4 13 and 17 than uv pac or uv chlorine in haw maw and saw respectively the distinction of doc removal by uv pac and uv cl pac could be attributed to the different removal mechanisms of these two processes specifically the uv irradiation alone could hardly degrade the organic contaminate based on the limited and short lived hydroxyl radicals ho in solutions it tends to draw partially quality change of dom in feed water such as c c bonds or aromatic nucleus break xing et al 2018 thus the rare improvement of doc removal in uv pac was mainly caused by higher adsorption of irradiated dom as its absorbability increases with aromaticity decrease huang et al 2017 while in uv cl and uv cl pac systems both ho and chlorine radical cl were generated under uv light via reaction equations 7 and 8 watts and linden 2007 the effective oxidation of organic pollutant in water samples by ho and cl promoted the reduction of doc in addition some high mw organic components were decomposed into low mw contaminates by uv cl which were easier to be adsorbed in uv cl pac process as suggested in fig 2 b the degradation of uv254 showed a similar response to that of doc except for that the values of uv254 after pretreatments were notably lower for example the removal rates of uv254 by uv cl pac pretreatment reached 54 52 and 51 for haw maw and saw respectively the results could be attributed to that the aromatic compounds and other unsaturated bonds in dom are more responsive to radical oxidation while they were relatively hard to be mineralized to inorganic substances it was noteworthy that the removal rate of uv254 by uv cl pac raised slightly with the larger proportion of eom in feed water suggesting satisfying and stable decrease of both uv absorbance matter in nom and eom overall the removal performance of doc and uv254 by pac was enhanced by uv and uv cl in the following order uv cl pac uv pac pac 7 h o c l uv light h o c l 8 o c l uv light o c l 3 2 effects of uv pac and uv chlorine pac on dom characteristics fluorescence eem spectrum has been employed as an effective method to characterize dom and the parafac analysis was applied for quantitative spectra interpretation as shown in fig 3 a model of four independent components was identified in this study wavelengths of excitation ex and emission em pairs are described in table s2 and the corresponding ex and em loadings are shown in fig s2 based on the position of ex em wavelengths the various components in water samples are classified according to previous studies to be specific component 1 ex em 250 320 nm 395 nm c1 is correlated to the microbial humic like fluorescence and component 2 ex em 260 350 nm 450 nm c2 represents the terrestrial humic like substances the two components c1 and c2 have been previously recognized dominant in natural water resources component 3 ex em 240 270 nm 345 nm c3 is associated with tryptophan like proteins while component 4 ex em 265 nm 280 530 nm c4 is found as tyrosine like protein and humic like component from bacterial processing sgroi et al 2018 c3 and c4 tryptophan and tyrosine like proteins are commonly found through eem parafac analysis as important compositions of microorganisms in surface and waste water xu and jiang 2013 for feed water of haw maw and saw the proportion of c3 and c4 decreased with the higher ratio of nom eom as shown in fig 4 indicating the different characteristics of particularly algae contaminated surface water fig 4 illustrated the performance of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments for removing four derived fluorescence components using parafac analysis in terms of haw pretreatments with pac uv pac uv cl and uv cl pac efficiently reduced the c2 humic like substances fluorescence intensity by 44 46 91 and 94 respectively the uv cl and uv cl pac pretreatments displayed significant removal performance on the removal of c2 whereas pac adsorption alone and uv pac exhibited limited and similar reduction efficiency for that the results could be attributed to the limited effects of uv light on humic like organic matters and relatively competent oxidation by ho and cl radicals the removal performance of c1 is similar to that of c2 however the uv pac pretreatment greatly improve the removal efficiency of c3 and c4 compared to pac alone by 24 and 23 respectively furthermore uv cl pac even degraded and adsorbed the protein like substances c3 by 92 it is notable that the distinct improvement of c4 removal was observed with uv cl pac compared to uv cl oxidation which led to a lower proportion of protein like substances in the treated solutions and uv pac pretreatment also displayed preferential removal of tryptophan and tyrosine like proteins compared to pac adsorption alone the results suggested that uv and uv cl achieved more obvious impact on enhancing the removal of protein like than humic like components with pac adsorption in view of the different contamination degrees by algal organic matter the fluorescent intensities of protein like substances were further decreased in relatively less algae polluted surface water maw and saw shown in fig 4 in previous study proteins were identified as major constituents of macromolecular contaminates in the algal organic matter yang et al 2017 moreover they are proved remarkably concerned with uf membrane fouling considering the impressive elimination of protein like and humic like organic matter it is reasonable to assume that uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments could appreciably mitigate membrane fouling during algal rich water purification with uf process the mw distribution of raw water and pretreated water solutions was investigated to evaluate the effects of different pretreatments fig 5 for untreated feed water three significant peaks were detected as high mw 20 kda medium mw 2 5 kda substances and low mw 1 kda organics for the uv absorbing substances fig 5 showed that pac adsorption alone performed limited effects on the high mw organic matter removal and with the less proportion of uv absorbing algal organic matter in raw water the reduction of high mw pollutants by pac adsorption was slightly improved the results indicate that pac exhibited poor adsorption ability of macromolecular substances biopolymers or protein like substances which corresponded to earlier studies wang et al 2016 when uv pac was employed high mw matter in the three untreated feed water was further removed and the improvement showed a regularity of haw maw saw this is attributed to the similar removal rate of high mw substances by uv pac in surface water contaminated by algae in different degrees on the contrary the medium mw organic matter tends to be better eliminated in slightly algae polluted water solutions therefore it was implied that the medium and high mw uv absorbing substances reduction was improved by uv pac treatment compared to pac adsorption alone as for the uv cl pac treatment the peaks of high and medium mw compounds were significantly decreased in the order of haw maw saw the results were consistent with the uv254 removal by uv cl pac treatment while the reduction of high mw substances by uv cl exhibited minor distinction between the three untreated water suggesting that the uv absorbing components 3000 da from algal organic matter are more responsive to uv cl pac pretreatment hence less organic fouling would accumulate during following membrane filtration process of algae contaminated surface water 3 3 effects of uv pac and uv cl pac on membrane fouling fig 6 illustrated the influences of uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments on uf membrane fouling induced by algae contaminated feed water via tmp variation and fouling resistance distribution as shown in fig 6 a the raw haw feed water led to a rapid tmp development from 19 to 69 78 and 81 kpa during the first second and third filtration period respectively when the water samples were pretreated by uv pac it certainly alleviated tmp development with the terminal tmp of the third filtration cycle reduced to 67 kpa while the pretreatment of pac adsorption alone exhibited minor influence on membrane fouling control as the final tmp was close to that of raw water without pretreatment the improvement of filtration performance was mainly associated with the uv irradiation which could decompose some high mw substances into low mw fractions that could be adsorbed by pac huang et al 2017 and this structural change of organic matter could also promote uf filtration productivity the results indicated uv irradiation was a feasible strategy for improving the performance of pac in membrane fouling reduction when uv cl pac was employed to feed water the tmp development was significantly slowed down and terminated at 56 kpa it was mainly ascribed to that the organic components were reduced by uv cl pac at a wide range of mw distribution through the combined effects of oxidation and adsorption as shown in fig 5 to further reveal the influences of pretreatments on fouling mitigation the resistance distribution during filtration process was analyzed fig 6 d showed that both notable reversible and irreversible membrane fouling was formed in raw haw filtration with the final rir and r r of 3 48 and 6 21 1011 m 1 respectively for the pac pretreatment the final reversible fouling could be hardly reduced compared to irreversible fouling which was associated with the limited pac adsorption ability for high mw substances than smaller molecules the previous study also reported that the low mw fractions tended to cause irreversible fouling due to pore narrowing and blocking and large molecules were linked with cake layer fouling cheng et al 2017 when uv pac was applied the irreversible and reversible fouling were alleviated by 26 36 and 13 22 respectively the degradation and characteristics revision of dissolved organic contaminants both took responsibility for the improved performance of uf membrane as shown in figs 5 and 6 the uv cl pretreatment did not obviously enhance the rir removal compared to uv pac the uv cl could mineralize some low mw components by radical oxidation while some low mw fragments were formed from broken high and medium mw substances simultaneously hence the retardation of irreversible fouling by uv cl was not noticeable under the condition of uv cl pac pretreatment the irreversible and reversible fouling was significantly alleviated by 44 48 and 33 53 respectively uv cl pac achieved most satisfying efficiency for alleviating membrane fouling which was associated with the lowest organic loading of high and low mw substances compared to pac adsorption the addition of uv cl provided the oxidation of pollutant and promoted the adsorption capacity by decomposing macromolecules effects of algal contamination degrees on membrane fouling control by pretreatments were also investigated fig 6 b and c showed the tmp increase curve of maw and saw filtration respectively the reversible and irreversible fouling distributions were also calculated as the proportion of eom decreased the membrane fouling of untreated water filtration correspondingly declined especially for the reversible fouling resistances for maw solutions similar to haw the pac adsorption alone exhibited limited performance in membrane fouling reduction with the uv irradiation the irreversible and reversible fouling was mitigated by 5 20 and 13 39 respectively when the uv cl was applied the reversible fouling reduction was more obvious than uv pac while the final r ir of first filtration cycle even increased compared to untreated water the results indicated that uv cl oxidation could degrade some dissolved organic substances into smaller ones than mineralization xing et al 2018 which could hardly alleviate the irreversible fouling caused by pore blocking as expected uv cl pac performed a positive impact in fouling reduction in maw of both irreversible 13 30 and reversible 43 72 fouling resistances in terms of saw solutions the uv irradiation improved the pac adsorption pretreatment in membrane fouling control and the uv cl pac notably reduced tmp increase as well it is noteworthy that the irreversible fouling was significantly decreased by uv cl pac pretreatment in saw filtration by 68 91 the results indicated that the extracellular organic matter was relatively harder to be decomposed into smaller fractions or mineralized compared to natural organic substances overall both uv and uv cl persuasively promoted fouling resistance reduction by pac pretreatment during algae contaminated surface water purification and the best performance of membrane fouling mitigation was observed when uv cl pac was applied to obtain a better recognition for the effects of pretreatments on fouling mechanisms during algae contaminated surface water the normalized tmp versus filtration time was fitted according to the combined membrane fouling model introduced in section 2 3 as fig 7 illustrated the processed data were well fitted to the complete standard model r2 0 990 which indicated that the complete and standard blocking was significant in the membrane fouling accumulation related to algae contaminated surface water this result was agreeable with the co existence of reversible and irreversible fouling induced from high and low mw components in nom and eom the contribution of complete blocking and standard blocking could be investigated from the fitting parameters table s3 suggesting that the standard pore blocking was dominant during the fouling formation and mitigation the occurrence of standard blocking during the filtration of eom using polymeric membranes was also found in previous study qu et al 2014 wei also reported that standard blocking mechanism was notable in the fouling caused by eom using ceramic uf membrane wei et al 2016 the fitting parameter ks for the complete standard model for different pretreatments and raw water was illustrated in fig 7 d it could be observed that the ks for raw water gradually decreased with reducing the proportion of eom which further implied that the algal substances in contaminated surface water could cause server standard pore blocking liu et al 2018 the results were consistent with the rapid and smooth development of tmp in haw and saw solutions in initial filtration stage fig 6 respectively uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments remarkably cut down the absolute magnitude of ks while pac displayed limited impact on account of the ks values the maw solutions exhibited the most sensitive response to uv pac and uv cl pac fig 7 d the maw and saw solutions pretreated by uv cl pac even reached a similar ks value however the fouling development of treated maw was faster than saw which justified the occurrence of complete blocking mechanism during the filtration process wei et al 2016 based on the modeling fit the standard blocking could be notably reduced by uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments and the variation of modeling parameter was consistent with the fouling resistance calculated from tmp curves 3 4 removal of micropollutants micropollutants have been detected in the source of drinking water due to their stability and microcystis toxins derived from cells raised a significant concern during algae contaminated surface water treatment liu et al 2018 in this study mc lr atz and p cnb were selected as representative micropollutants of microcystis toxins herbicides and antibiotics respectively these contaminants have been proved as threaten and risk to the health of human and animals kong et al 2016 due to the much higher mw cutoff of polymeric uf membrane the micropollutants could hardly be retained by uf membrane alone through size exclusion fig 8 presented the performance of micropollutants rejection during filtration with or without pretreatments the mc lr concentration in raw eom solution was measured to be 4 2 μg l and the haw maw and saw feed water contained 1 05 0 53 and 0 26 μg l of mc lr respectively as shown in fig 8 a uf without pretreatment performed poor ability for mc lr removal of less than 13 despite of the initial concentration when uv pac was applied the removal rate was significantly improved to 36 43 and the removal efficiency increased with the higher concentration of mc lr by contrast the reduction of mc lr by pac adsorption alone and uv cl was slightly promoted at the removal rate of 25 27 and 31 33 respectively the generated cl and ho radicals during uv cl process were supposed to mineralize or partially decompose the micropollutants while the pac adsorption was inclined to absorb the whole molecule of micropollutant which led to that the removal efficiency by uv cl was somewhat higher that pac adsorption alone previous study also indicated that the removal of microcystins by low dosage of pac at 30 min was less than 20 şengül et al 2018 and many kinds of micropollutants were insensitive to pac adsorption alone at the dose of 20 mg l altmann et al 2015 as expected the uv cl pac showed significant improvement of mc lr removal at the rate of 42 46 this result was generally ascribed to the combined effects of adsorption and radical oxidation and the intermediate products generated from oxidation could be further adsorbed similar to mc lr the uf membrane alone exhibited low efficiency in atz and p cnb removal as shown in fig 8 b in terms of atz the removal rate was greatly promoted to 42 65 and 60 72 by uv pac and uv cl pac respectively the obvious improvement of atz removal was attributed to the high degradation efficiency by uv irradiation and uv cl oxidation when the pretreatment was applied the p cnb removal showed noticeable distinction in the order of uv cl pac uv pac pac the uv irradiation only slighted improved removal rate for p cnb by 6 12 compared to pac alone it was due to the nitrobenzene compounds could strongly absorb uv lights and had a lower reaction rate with cl garcia einschlag et al 2002 and the uv cl pac significantly encouraged p cnb removal by 42 76 as expected overall the uv and uv cl were favorable in the control of micropollutants by enhancing pac adsorption pretreatment in algae contaminated water purification using uf membrane 3 5 removal of tcmfp as shown in fig 9 the trihalomethanes tcms were selected to evaluate the main components of disinfection by products in algae contaminated surface water treatment for raw water the tcmfp followed the order of saw maw haw this result was attributed to the distinguished ratio of eom nom in the three feed water it was reported that the algal organic matter had a lower rate of typical dbps generation than that of nom li et al 2012 as the eem parafac analysis presented in fig 4 d the highly algae contaminated surface water contained a lower concentration of humic like substances which was proved most reactive in the formation of tcms when pac adsorption was applied alone the tcmfp was reduced by 18 and 7 of haw and maw respectively however the removal rate of tcmfp was decreased except for the saw solution it could be implied that the smaller fractions formed under uv irradiation tended to have a higher potential of tcms formation and the different trend for saw could be attributed to the more efficient elimination of low mw humic like components in nom when uv cl pac was employed the tcmfp of haw maw and saw was all significantly reduced at the rates of 26 17 and 18 respectively the combination of uv cl oxidation and pac adsorption offset the negative impacts of dbps formation induced by uv cl overall both uv pac and uv cl pac showed positive effects on tcmfp removal and uv cl pac achieved the most satisfactory performance 4 conclusion in this study uv and uv cl were applied to assist pac adsorption pretreatment prior to uf membrane during typical algal rich microcystis aeruginos water purification the following conclusions can be drawn 1 uv and uv cl promoted the removal of doc and uv254 for algal rich water and it was correlated to membrane fouling control considering the various degrees of algal contamination uv pac and uv cl pac showed even better performance of uv254 removal in highly algae polluted surface water 2 the fluorescent eem spectra of algae contaminated surface water were well interpreted using a four component model uv and uv cl were impressive in promoting the removal of protein like substances c3 and c4 in apparent order of uv cl pac uv pac pac 3 uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments attributed to the mitigation of uf membrane fouling during algal water filtration and uv cl pac showed most satisfactory performance in mitigating reversible and irreversible fouling likely attributed to the combined effects of high and low mw uv absorbing substances removal 4 the standard pore blocking mechanism was proved significant to uf membrane fouling caused by algal rich surface water uv pac and uv cl pac pretreatments were proved effective in alleviating pore blocking in comparison with pac adsorption alone 5 uv pac and uv cl pac significantly improved the removal of typical algal toxin mc lr atz and p cnb and the uv cl pac pretreatment was effective in reducing tcm formation potential particularly during highly algae contaminated surface water treatment acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national key research and development program of china 2018yfc0408001 the national natural

18783,the extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency in bioelectrochemical systems has been proven to be dependent on anode potentials to explore the underlying mechanism previous studies have mainly focused on eet conduit and bacterial biomass but rarely concerned with the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps surrounding electroactive cells in this study the response of geobacter biofilms to anode potentials was investigated with a special emphasis on the mechanistic role of eps the electrochemical activities and cell viabilities of geobacter soli biofilms were simultaneously attenuated at 0 4 and 0 6 v compared to 0 2 and 0 v it was found that the biofilms especially the biofilm region closer to electrode surface grown at 0 2 and 0 v produced relatively more extracellular redox active proteins and less extracellular polysaccharides which conferred higher electron accepting donating capacities to eps and consequently facilitated eet meanwhile electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide dominated interior layers were formed in the biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v which limited direct eet but might serve as physical barriers for protecting cells in these biofilms from the increasing stress by poised electrodes these results demonstrated that the production of eps under different anode potentials might be finely regulated by cells to keep balance

introduction bioelectrochemical systems bess are engineered systems in which electroactive bacteria are grown under electrochemical interactions with electrodes hirose et al 2018 these systems have attracted wide attention owing to their utility in various biotechnological processes including electrical current generation from organic wastewater production of useful chemicals and environmental remediation sevda et al 2018 in a bes the anode functions as a terminal electron acceptor for microbial metabolism a growing number of studies have shown that anode potentials primarily determine the rate of electron flow from electroactive bacteria to electrodes and control the theoretical metabolic energy gained for microbial growth hirose et al 2018 geobacter and shewanella species are the most attractive electroactive bacteria in bess kumar et al 2017 for facultative anaerobic shewanella biofilms grown at high anode potentials are superior in current generation than that at middle or low potentials kitayama et al 2017 hirose et al 2018 however for anaerobic geobacter or community predominated by geobacter current generation is commonly improved at relatively negative potentials wagner et al 2010 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 in theory more positive potentials are thermodynamically favorable for energy capture for bacterial growth wei et al 2010 and therefore it is inexplicable that why geobacter biofilms produced lower current at more positive potentials for extracelluar electron transfer eet through geobacter biofilms a pili network nanowires and redox active proteins associated with the outer membranes and localized in the extracellular matrix are essential kumar et al 2017 several previous studies based on voltammetry have proposed that geobacter can alter the interfacial redox active proteins at different anode potentials zhu et al 2012 peng et al 2016 there is also voltammetric evidence indicating that the interfacial redox proteins in geobacter biofilms are not affected by anode potentials wei et al 2010 and the limited current generation at more positive potentials is due to the decreased cell viability by unknown reason li et al 2017 overall no clear and plausible mechanisms have been proposed to explain how anode potentials regulate the eet properties of geobacter biofilms as the major constituents of biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps are generally considered as networks of organic material including polysaccharides proteins and lipids xue et al 2012 and play multiple roles in promoting the structural development of biofilm and providing a protective barrier against environmental stress jia et al 2017 sheng et al 2010 in addition to promoting biofilm formation eps produced by geobacter cells also contributed to the electrochemical activities of the biofilms due to the redox active proteins trapped therein rollefson et al 2011 magnuson 2011 to date studies associated with eps in geobacter biofilms have primarily focused on redox protein and exopolysaccharide content using gel electrophoresis and microscopy rollefson et al 2011 magnuson 2011 cologgi et al 2014 while the composition and spatial distribution of eps in geobacter biofilms have not yet been adequately elucidated as eps production is easily affected by operational conditions jia et al 2017 it is expected that the properties of eps will vary depending on anode potentials considering the important contributions of eps to eet in geobacter biofilms liu et al 2018 the effect of such eps variations on electrochemical characteristics of geobacter biofilms is worth studying therefore in the present study bess with geobacter soli as inoculum were constructed and operated at six different anode potentials 1 to examine how eps in geobacter biofilms vary based on the change of anode potentials and 2 to elucidate the relationship between eps composition and the electrochemical activities and structures of geobacter biofilms to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the regulation of electroactive biofilms in the context of eps geobacter soli was used here because of its great efficiency for eet high similarity to other important geobacter species such as geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter anodireducens based on 16s rrna gene sequences and the available genetic information yang et al 2015 2017 cai et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and reactor operation geobacter soli gss01 was isolated and identified in our laboratory zhou et al 2014 and was routinely cultured in freshwater medium at 30 c under anaerobic conditions with acetate 16 mm as the electron donor and fe iii citrate 56 mm as the electron acceptor nevin et al 2009 dual chamber bes triplicates for each treatment with a volume of 250 ml for each chamber was constructed graphite plates were used as the working and counter electrodes and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the working electrodes were separately controlled at 0 4 v 0 2 v 0 v 0 2 v 0 4 v and 0 6 v vs sce in individual reactor using a chi1000c electrochemical station ch instruments inc shanghai china current measurement was collected for at least 12 h prior to inoculation and then log phase cultures of g soli were inoculated 10 v v into the working chamber containing freshwater medium with both acetate 10 mm and fe iii citrate 56 mm once the cells reached a600 of ca 0 2 the medium was replaced with freshwater medium containing acetate only when the current reached approximately 1 ma the system was switched to a continuous flow through mode at a dilution rate of 0 15 h the system was operated continuously for approximately 24 h after a constant current was reached and then the biofilms were electrochemically characterized by differential pulse voltammetry dpv as documented in the literature pous et al 2016 2 2 biomass cell viability and cellular stress evaluation in biofilm the biomass of biofilms was measured by bacterial protein extraction kit and bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china viability of the cells in biofilms was detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm sun et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 the anodes were rinsed in sterile pbs to eliminate the growth medium stained for 20 min using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen ca rinsed in sterile pbs twice to eliminate excess dye and examined by clsm lsm 880 carl zeiss the three dimensional 3d biofilm structure z stack was reconstructed and analyzed using zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the specific viability of each biofilm layer was analyzed and presented by the ratio of viable total cells via software image pro plus 6 0 xiang et al 2017 the cellular stress was evaluated by two universal stress response proteins catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod as their expression has been reported to be increased under environmental stress such as heavy metal toxicity and nutrient limitation holmes et al 2006 mouser et al 2009 orellana et al 2014 marozava et al 2014 kit s0051 and kit s0101 beyotime biotechnology china were used for determining the activities of cat and sod respectively the specific enzymes activities were presented as units per mg of total protein 2 3 spatial structure composition and redox activity of eps 2 3 1 the spatial structure of eps the anode biofilms were rinsed in pbs to eliminate growth medium and stained with fitc cona calcofluor white and nile red for the detection of proteins α polysaccharides β polysaccharides and lipids respectively in the eps chen et al 2007 briefly 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer ph 9 0 200 μl was added to the electrode to maintain the amine group in a non protonated form followed by incubation with fitc solution 1 g l 100 μl for 1 h subsequently the electrode was incubated with cona solution 250 mg l 200 μl for another 30 min followed successively by calcofluor white 300 mg l 200 μl for 30 min and nile red 10 mg l 120 μl for 10 min after each stage of staining the samples were washed twice with pbs to remove the excess stain then the electrode was examined with a clsm lsm 880 carl zeiss with a 40 objective the collection wavelengths of all stains are listed in table s1 the 3d biofilm structure was reconstructed and analyzed using zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the specific eps composition of each biofilm layer was analyzed based on counting per area obj total via software image pro plus 6 0 and presented by the ratio of specific total eps components 2 3 2 eps extraction and composition analysis the biofilm on the electrode was peeled and the dispersed biomass was harvested edta treatment for extraction and preparation of both loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps fractions were carried out by following a previously reported protocol cao et al 2011 the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured using the anthrone method loewus 1952 and bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce respectively the eps were then analyzed using eem parafac excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis to quantitatively determine the fluorescence components of eps ye et al 2018 2 3 3 redox ability of eps as an index of redox capability the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc were determined through electrochemical approaches as previously reported aeschbacher et al 2010 chen et al 2017 ye et al 2018 to quantify the eac and edc of eps chronoamperometry measurements were performed at an applied potential of 0 73 v and 0 37 v vs sce respectively and the transferred amount of electrons tae was obtained by integration of the reductive or oxidative currents over time the data of lb eps and tb eps were counted up to study the edc and eac of the total eps of each biofilm the expression of redox active protein was assessed using reverse transcription quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr the target genes namely se37 01745 se37 02820 and se37 04285 were selected based on the genome and transcriptome analysis of g soli yang et al 2015 cai et al 2018 annotations of the target genes and primers used for rt qpcr are listed in table s2 gene expression levels were normalized to the expression level of proc a gene shown to be constitutively expressed in geobacter species holmes et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced electrochemical activity of biofilms at 0 2 and 0 v the time course of current production and the maximum current generated by g soli grown at various anode potentials were compared fig 1 a and b the biofilm grown at 0 4 v had the lowest maximum current 3 8 ma which might be due to the limitation of electron acceptor as this potential is close to the oxidation potential of acetate 0 52 v vs sce and is thermodynamically unfavorable for energy capture peng et al 2016 an enhancement in current generation was observed when the anode potentials increased from 0 4 to 0 v with a maximum current of 9 2 ma observed at 0 2 and 0 v which indicated that 0 2 v is positive enough for bes with g soli when the anode potentials were further increased to 0 6 v the maximum current was then decreased to 6 2 ma these results were consistent with previous reports that current generation by geobacter biofilm is higher at relatively negative potentials wei et al 2010 li et al 2017 dpv was used to measure the electrochemical activities of g soli biofilms at different potentials as it can show redox peaks of effective electrode reductases under catalytic conditions peng et al 2016 pous et al 2016 biofilms grown at 0 4 v showed three redox peaks with mid point potentials of about 0 518 v 0 378 v and 0 241 v biofilms at 0 2 0 2 v showed two redox peaks with mid potentials of 0 486 0 499 v and 0 305 0 341 v fig 1c and table s3 however no obvious peaks were detected in the biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v suggesting that the contents of interfacial redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes in these biofilms might be sharply decreased for some reason fig 1d the difference in the number of redox pairs and their midpoint potentials supported the controversial hypothesis that interfacial redox active proteins that directly interact with electrodes are affected by anode potentials zhu et al 2012 peng et al 2016 except for biofilm grown at 0 4 v the peak currents of oxidation and reduction peaks of biofilms grown in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v were strongly positively related to the maximum currents generated r2 0 981 and 0 968 for oxidation and reduction peak respectively p 0 05 fig s1 suggesting that the current generation of biofilms grown at potentials ranging from 0 2 0 6 v lied on the effective redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes 3 2 decreased viability and increased biofilm heterogeneity at 0 4 and 0 6 v the 0 4 v electrode was covered by a thinnest biofilm 15 μm fig 2 a and the lowest biomass fig 2b which might be responsible for the lowest current generation at this potential weak cell adhesion to the electrode might be attributed to a low biomass gained at this potential since geobacter cells are negatively charged and the electrode poised at 0 4 v should encounter more difficulties in attracting negatively charged bacteria kuzume et al 2013 maestro et al 2014 an increase in biofilm thickness and biomass was observed when the potentials increased from 0 2 to 0 2 v and no increase was observed when the potential further increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v fig 2 and s2 it is logical that the biomass accumulation was enhanced in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v compared with 0 4 0 v as more positive potentials are favorable for cell adhesion and energy capture for microbial growth thermodynamically wei et al 2010 zhu et al 2012 a similar average cell viability of approximately 0 74 was observed for biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v and decreased viability of biofilms was observed with potentials increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v ranging from 0 68 0 07 for biofilm grown at 0 2 v to 0 42 0 11 for biofilm grown at 0 6 v fig 2b as viable cells are responsible for electron production the decreased cell viability might be a reason for the declined electrical current generation by biofilms heterogeneous distribution of viable cells within all biofilms was observed that is the outer biofilm layer consisted of more viable cells and the inner layer consisted of more dead cells fig 2a and s2 the two layer structure of geobacter biofilm has been previously reported which is proposed as a result of transfer resistance of electron donors and gradient of protons accumulated within biofilm franks et al 2009 renslow et al 2013 it is noticed that the viability in biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v especially at 0 6 v was more heterogeneous in comparison the maximum viability 0 91 0 1 was 1 8 times of the minimum viability 0 50 0 06 in biofilm grown at 0 v whereas the maximum viability 0 62 0 14 was 3 1 times of the minimum viability 0 20 0 07 in biofilm grown at 0 6 v in addition even in the outer biofilm layers the distribution of viable cells in biofilm grown at 0 6 v was also heterogeneous presented as aggregated viable cells surrounded by inactive cells figs s2f h cell aggregation is a protective strategy for microbes to resist environmental stress tsimring et al 1995 flemming et al 2016 the activities of stress response proteins sod and cat in g soli cells increased when the anode potentials rose from 0 to 0 6 v fig 2c showing that g soli cells grown at 0 6 v were exposed to high stress induced by anode it is likely that the increased stress is a potential cause of the decreased viability and increased heterogeneity of biofilms at 0 4 and 0 6 v similar to a speculation in previous studies dennis et al 2016 3 3 electrochemical activity of biofilm is positively related with redox activity of eps considering the spatial distances electrons generated by active cells cannot be directly transferred to electrodes when a thick layer of eps covers the cell surface xiao et al 2017 fortunately eps have been proved to store electrochemically active substances such as c cyts which enable eps enveloped cells to transport extracellular electrons to acceptors cao et al 2011 rollefson et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is also important to evaluate eps redox abilities of the biofilms grown at various electrode potentials as shown in fig 3 a the eps of biofilm grown at 0 v had the maximum edc 10 7 μmol e g dry cell and eac 31 4 μmol e g dry cell followed by the eps of biofilm grown at 0 2 v 9 6 and 30 0 μmol e g dry cell for edc and eac respectively and the weakest redox abilities were detected in the eps of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v 4 2 4 3 μmol e g dry cell for edc and 13 6 15 8 μmol e g dry cell for eac a positive correlation was found between eac and peak current of reduction peak in dpv of biofilms r2 0 867 p 0 05 and between edc and peak current of oxidation peak r2 0 673 p 0 05 fig 3b and c the edc and eac can reflect the redox activity of eps ye et al 2018 and the dpv reflects the electrochemical activity of biofilms pous et al 2016 and therefore this result indicated that the electrochemical activity of biofilm is positively related with redox activity of eps eps in biofilm functions as a conductive matrix for electron transfer to electrode which is most likely mediated by outer membrane and extracellular redox proteins liu et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 the highest expression of three key genes encoding outer membrane or extracellular c cyts in g soli was observed in biofilm grown at 0 v which was in agreement with the strongest redox ability of eps fig 3d 3 4 geobacter soli responds to anode potentials by regulating the eps composition and spatial structure analysis of the eem spectra using parafac identified two aromatic protein like substances with characteristic peaks at ex em of 225 335 495 nm and 235 280 340 nm which corresponded to tyrosine aromatic protein like substance and tryptophan protein like substance fluorophores respectively fig 4a and s3 jia et al 2017 he et al 2014 with the potentials increased from 0 4 0 6 v the amount of tyrosine aromatic protein like substances initially increased and then decreased in lb eps whereas the amount of tryptophan protein like substances first increased and then decreased in both lb eps and tb eps the aromatic amino acids play an important role in electron transfer hirasawa et al 1998 görner 2007 vargas et al 2013 and thus the reduction of the two aromatic protein like substances in eps might be responsible for the decreased redox activity of eps of biofilms grown at 0 4 0 6 v with the potentials increased from 0 2 0 6 v the concentration of extracellular polysaccharide was increased while the production of extracellular protein was reduced fig 4 b and c in addition the eps components in all biofilms were found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the entire biofilm fig 5 compared to the interior layer of biofilm grown at 0 2 v which contained higher proportion of proteins 42 4 the interior layers of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v were predominated by extracellular polysaccharides 41 1 60 7 fig s5 these results suggested that g soli cells especially the cells in the interior layer of the biofilm stimulated the production of extracellular polysaccharide by higher potentials 0 4 and 0 6 v the maximum current generated by biofilms grown in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v was positively related to protein content but negatively related to extracellular polysaccharide content in eps of the entire biofilm r2 0 87 p 0 05 figs s6a and c this correlation was also applied to the interior biofilm layers r2 0 86 p 0 05 figs s6b and d but not to the middle and outer biofilm layers data not shown which agreed with the result in section 3 1 that current generation of biofilms grown at potentials ranging from 0 2 0 6 v lied on the effective redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes according to a model of mechanistic stratification in electroactive biofilms the eps associated redox active proteins function coordinately with conductive pili to transfer electrons in the region within 10 μm closer to the electrode however the pili networks become as the primary mechanism for discharging electrons in the upper region 10 μm steidl et al 2016 that is electron transfer mediated by eps associated redox active proteins mainly occurs in the region closer to the electrode and therefore the eps composition in the interior biofilm layers might play an essential role in determining the eet efficiency of biofilms as previously reported electron transfer in electroactive biofilms is mainly taken charge by the outer membrane and extracellular redox active proteins kumar et al 2017 while nonconductive polysaccharides can interfere with eet between redox active proteins and electrodes kouzuma et al 2010 kitayama et al 2017 thus the predominant presence of extracellular polysaccharides especially in the interior biofilm layers might be a direct cause for the low electrochemical activity of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v in the present study extracellular polysaccharide production is often activated by environmental stress for cell protection gambino and cappitelli 2016 han et al 2017 this might be a potential reason for the accumulation of interfacial polysaccharides in geobacter biofilms at 0 4 and 0 6 v exposing to high stress induced by anode section 3 2 geobacter species are anaerobic bacteria which commonly grow via reduction of metal oxyhydr oxides with low predicted redox potentials ranging from 0 11 v vs sce e g birnessite to 0 41 v vs sce e g α feooh elevar et al 2017 therefore high potentials of 0 4 and 0 6 v might induce stress response in geobacter cells and activate the production of extracellular polysaccharides for self protection purpose if cells exposing to excessive stress are not protected by eps proteins on the cell surface are easily inactivated even resulting in cell death and eet lost xiao et al 2017 han et al 2017 by contrast for facultative anaerobe shewanella species that have developed perfect strategies to adapt quite positive oxidation potentials e g oxygen 0 99 v vs sce the production of polysaccharides will not be stimulated under high anode potentials kitayama et al 2017 overall the production of eps under different anode potentials would be finely regulated by cells to keep balance between eet efficiency and cell protection this might be an important underlying mechanism for tuning the electrochemical properties of biofilms at various anode potentials which are helpful to better understand how to set and evaluate optimal anode potentials for improving bes performance 4 conclusion in this work geobacter soli biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v were found to have higher electrochemical activity and eet efficiency than those grown at higher potentials ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 v although more positive potential is thermodynamically favorable for microbial metabolism it was demonstrated that biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v possessed higher cell viability and thereby generated more electrons from cellular metabolism than those grown at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 v meanwhile higher concentrations of protein were detected in eps of the biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v resulting in higher redox activity of eps and greater eet efficiency in these biofilms the accumulation of electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide in the biofilm grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v especially in the region closer to electrodes will dramatically interfere with electron transfer from redox active proteins to electrodes but be favorable for cell protection these findings provide a new insight for deep understanding the regulation of electroactive biofilms for optimal performance and can be useful for elucidating the mechanisms how biofilms respond to environmental changes declarations of competing

are not affected by anode potentials wei et al 2010 and the limited current generation at more positive potentials is due to the decreased cell viability by unknown reason li et al 2017 overall no clear and plausible mechanisms have been proposed to explain how anode potentials regulate the eet properties of geobacter biofilms as the major constituents of biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps are generally considered as networks of organic material including polysaccharides proteins and lipids xue et al 2012 and play multiple roles in promoting the structural development of biofilm and providing a protective barrier against environmental stress jia et al 2017 sheng et al 2010 in addition to promoting biofilm formation eps produced by geobacter cells also contributed to the electrochemical activities of the biofilms due to the redox active proteins trapped therein rollefson et al 2011 magnuson 2011 to date studies associated with eps in geobacter biofilms have primarily focused on redox protein and exopolysaccharide content using gel electrophoresis and microscopy rollefson et al 2011 magnuson 2011 cologgi et al 2014 while the composition and spatial distribution of eps in geobacter biofilms have not yet been adequately elucidated as eps production is easily affected by operational conditions jia et al 2017 it is expected that the properties of eps will vary depending on anode potentials considering the important contributions of eps to eet in geobacter biofilms liu et al 2018 the effect of such eps variations on electrochemical characteristics of geobacter biofilms is worth studying therefore in the present study bess with geobacter soli as inoculum were constructed and operated at six different anode potentials 1 to examine how eps in geobacter biofilms vary based on the change of anode potentials and 2 to elucidate the relationship between eps composition and the electrochemical activities and structures of geobacter biofilms to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the regulation of electroactive biofilms in the context of eps geobacter soli was used here because of its great efficiency for eet high similarity to other important geobacter species such as geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter anodireducens based on 16s rrna gene sequences and the available genetic information yang et al 2015 2017 cai et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and reactor operation geobacter soli gss01 was isolated and identified in our laboratory zhou et al 2014 and was routinely cultured in freshwater medium at 30 c under anaerobic conditions with acetate 16 mm as the electron donor and fe iii citrate 56 mm as the electron acceptor nevin et al 2009 dual chamber bes triplicates for each treatment with a volume of 250 ml for each chamber was constructed graphite plates were used as the working and counter electrodes and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the working electrodes were separately controlled at 0 4 v 0 2 v 0 v 0 2 v 0 4 v and 0 6 v vs sce in individual reactor using a chi1000c electrochemical station ch instruments inc shanghai china current measurement was collected for at least 12 h prior to inoculation and then log phase cultures of g soli were inoculated 10 v v into the working chamber containing freshwater medium with both acetate 10 mm and fe iii citrate 56 mm once the cells reached a600 of ca 0 2 the medium was replaced with freshwater medium containing acetate only when the current reached approximately 1 ma the system was switched to a continuous flow through mode at a dilution rate of 0 15 h the system was operated continuously for approximately 24 h after a constant current was reached and then the biofilms were electrochemically characterized by differential pulse voltammetry dpv as documented in the literature pous et al 2016 2 2 biomass cell viability and cellular stress evaluation in biofilm the biomass of biofilms was measured by bacterial protein extraction kit and bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china viability of the cells in biofilms was detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm sun et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 the anodes were rinsed in sterile pbs to eliminate the growth medium stained for 20 min using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen ca rinsed in sterile pbs twice to eliminate excess dye and examined by clsm lsm 880 carl zeiss the three dimensional 3d biofilm structure z stack was reconstructed and analyzed using zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the specific viability of each biofilm layer was analyzed and presented by the ratio of viable total cells via software image pro plus 6 0 xiang et al 2017 the cellular stress was evaluated by two universal stress response proteins catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod as their expression has been reported to be increased under environmental stress such as heavy metal toxicity and nutrient limitation holmes et al 2006 mouser et al 2009 orellana et al 2014 marozava et al 2014 kit s0051 and kit s0101 beyotime biotechnology china were used for determining the activities of cat and sod respectively the specific enzymes activities were presented as units per mg of total protein 2 3 spatial structure composition and redox activity of eps 2 3 1 the spatial structure of eps the anode biofilms were rinsed in pbs to eliminate growth medium and stained with fitc cona calcofluor white and nile red for the detection of proteins α polysaccharides β polysaccharides and lipids respectively in the eps chen et al 2007 briefly 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer ph 9 0 200 μl was added to the electrode to maintain the amine group in a non protonated form followed by incubation with fitc solution 1 g l 100 μl for 1 h subsequently the electrode was incubated with cona solution 250 mg l 200 μl for another 30 min followed successively by calcofluor white 300 mg l 200 μl for 30 min and nile red 10 mg l 120 μl for 10 min after each stage of staining the samples were washed twice with pbs to remove the excess stain then the electrode was examined with a clsm lsm 880 carl zeiss with a 40 objective the collection wavelengths of all stains are listed in table s1 the 3d biofilm structure was reconstructed and analyzed using zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the specific eps composition of each biofilm layer was analyzed based on counting per area obj total via software image pro plus 6 0 and presented by the ratio of specific total eps components 2 3 2 eps extraction and composition analysis the biofilm on the electrode was peeled and the dispersed biomass was harvested edta treatment for extraction and preparation of both loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps fractions were carried out by following a previously reported protocol cao et al 2011 the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured using the anthrone method loewus 1952 and bca protein assay kit thermo scientific pierce respectively the eps were then analyzed using eem parafac excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis to quantitatively determine the fluorescence components of eps ye et al 2018 2 3 3 redox ability of eps as an index of redox capability the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc were determined through electrochemical approaches as previously reported aeschbacher et al 2010 chen et al 2017 ye et al 2018 to quantify the eac and edc of eps chronoamperometry measurements were performed at an applied potential of 0 73 v and 0 37 v vs sce respectively and the transferred amount of electrons tae was obtained by integration of the reductive or oxidative currents over time the data of lb eps and tb eps were counted up to study the edc and eac of the total eps of each biofilm the expression of redox active protein was assessed using reverse transcription quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr the target genes namely se37 01745 se37 02820 and se37 04285 were selected based on the genome and transcriptome analysis of g soli yang et al 2015 cai et al 2018 annotations of the target genes and primers used for rt qpcr are listed in table s2 gene expression levels were normalized to the expression level of proc a gene shown to be constitutively expressed in geobacter species holmes et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced electrochemical activity of biofilms at 0 2 and 0 v the time course of current production and the maximum current generated by g soli grown at various anode potentials were compared fig 1 a and b the biofilm grown at 0 4 v had the lowest maximum current 3 8 ma which might be due to the limitation of electron acceptor as this potential is close to the oxidation potential of acetate 0 52 v vs sce and is thermodynamically unfavorable for energy capture peng et al 2016 an enhancement in current generation was observed when the anode potentials increased from 0 4 to 0 v with a maximum current of 9 2 ma observed at 0 2 and 0 v which indicated that 0 2 v is positive enough for bes with g soli when the anode potentials were further increased to 0 6 v the maximum current was then decreased to 6 2 ma these results were consistent with previous reports that current generation by geobacter biofilm is higher at relatively negative potentials wei et al 2010 li et al 2017 dpv was used to measure the electrochemical activities of g soli biofilms at different potentials as it can show redox peaks of effective electrode reductases under catalytic conditions peng et al 2016 pous et al 2016 biofilms grown at 0 4 v showed three redox peaks with mid point potentials of about 0 518 v 0 378 v and 0 241 v biofilms at 0 2 0 2 v showed two redox peaks with mid potentials of 0 486 0 499 v and 0 305 0 341 v fig 1c and table s3 however no obvious peaks were detected in the biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v suggesting that the contents of interfacial redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes in these biofilms might be sharply decreased for some reason fig 1d the difference in the number of redox pairs and their midpoint potentials supported the controversial hypothesis that interfacial redox active proteins that directly interact with electrodes are affected by anode potentials zhu et al 2012 peng et al 2016 except for biofilm grown at 0 4 v the peak currents of oxidation and reduction peaks of biofilms grown in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v were strongly positively related to the maximum currents generated r2 0 981 and 0 968 for oxidation and reduction peak respectively p 0 05 fig s1 suggesting that the current generation of biofilms grown at potentials ranging from 0 2 0 6 v lied on the effective redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes 3 2 decreased viability and increased biofilm heterogeneity at 0 4 and 0 6 v the 0 4 v electrode was covered by a thinnest biofilm 15 μm fig 2 a and the lowest biomass fig 2b which might be responsible for the lowest current generation at this potential weak cell adhesion to the electrode might be attributed to a low biomass gained at this potential since geobacter cells are negatively charged and the electrode poised at 0 4 v should encounter more difficulties in attracting negatively charged bacteria kuzume et al 2013 maestro et al 2014 an increase in biofilm thickness and biomass was observed when the potentials increased from 0 2 to 0 2 v and no increase was observed when the potential further increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v fig 2 and s2 it is logical that the biomass accumulation was enhanced in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v compared with 0 4 0 v as more positive potentials are favorable for cell adhesion and energy capture for microbial growth thermodynamically wei et al 2010 zhu et al 2012 a similar average cell viability of approximately 0 74 was observed for biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v and decreased viability of biofilms was observed with potentials increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v ranging from 0 68 0 07 for biofilm grown at 0 2 v to 0 42 0 11 for biofilm grown at 0 6 v fig 2b as viable cells are responsible for electron production the decreased cell viability might be a reason for the declined electrical current generation by biofilms heterogeneous distribution of viable cells within all biofilms was observed that is the outer biofilm layer consisted of more viable cells and the inner layer consisted of more dead cells fig 2a and s2 the two layer structure of geobacter biofilm has been previously reported which is proposed as a result of transfer resistance of electron donors and gradient of protons accumulated within biofilm franks et al 2009 renslow et al 2013 it is noticed that the viability in biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v especially at 0 6 v was more heterogeneous in comparison the maximum viability 0 91 0 1 was 1 8 times of the minimum viability 0 50 0 06 in biofilm grown at 0 v whereas the maximum viability 0 62 0 14 was 3 1 times of the minimum viability 0 20 0 07 in biofilm grown at 0 6 v in addition even in the outer biofilm layers the distribution of viable cells in biofilm grown at 0 6 v was also heterogeneous presented as aggregated viable cells surrounded by inactive cells figs s2f h cell aggregation is a protective strategy for microbes to resist environmental stress tsimring et al 1995 flemming et al 2016 the activities of stress response proteins sod and cat in g soli cells increased when the anode potentials rose from 0 to 0 6 v fig 2c showing that g soli cells grown at 0 6 v were exposed to high stress induced by anode it is likely that the increased stress is a potential cause of the decreased viability and increased heterogeneity of biofilms at 0 4 and 0 6 v similar to a speculation in previous studies dennis et al 2016 3 3 electrochemical activity of biofilm is positively related with redox activity of eps considering the spatial distances electrons generated by active cells cannot be directly transferred to electrodes when a thick layer of eps covers the cell surface xiao et al 2017 fortunately eps have been proved to store electrochemically active substances such as c cyts which enable eps enveloped cells to transport extracellular electrons to acceptors cao et al 2011 rollefson et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is also important to evaluate eps redox abilities of the biofilms grown at various electrode potentials as shown in fig 3 a the eps of biofilm grown at 0 v had the maximum edc 10 7 μmol e g dry cell and eac 31 4 μmol e g dry cell followed by the eps of biofilm grown at 0 2 v 9 6 and 30 0 μmol e g dry cell for edc and eac respectively and the weakest redox abilities were detected in the eps of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v 4 2 4 3 μmol e g dry cell for edc and 13 6 15 8 μmol e g dry cell for eac a positive correlation was found between eac and peak current of reduction peak in dpv of biofilms r2 0 867 p 0 05 and between edc and peak current of oxidation peak r2 0 673 p 0 05 fig 3b and c the edc and eac can reflect the redox activity of eps ye et al 2018 and the dpv reflects the electrochemical activity of biofilms pous et al 2016 and therefore this result indicated that the electrochemical activity of biofilm is positively related with redox activity of eps eps in biofilm functions as a conductive matrix for electron transfer to electrode which is most likely mediated by outer membrane and extracellular redox proteins liu et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 the highest expression of three key genes encoding outer membrane or extracellular c cyts in g soli was observed in biofilm grown at 0 v which was in agreement with the strongest redox ability of eps fig 3d 3 4 geobacter soli responds to anode potentials by regulating the eps composition and spatial structure analysis of the eem spectra using parafac identified two aromatic protein like substances with characteristic peaks at ex em of 225 335 495 nm and 235 280 340 nm which corresponded to tyrosine aromatic protein like substance and tryptophan protein like substance fluorophores respectively fig 4a and s3 jia et al 2017 he et al 2014 with the potentials increased from 0 4 0 6 v the amount of tyrosine aromatic protein like substances initially increased and then decreased in lb eps whereas the amount of tryptophan protein like substances first increased and then decreased in both lb eps and tb eps the aromatic amino acids play an important role in electron transfer hirasawa et al 1998 görner 2007 vargas et al 2013 and thus the reduction of the two aromatic protein like substances in eps might be responsible for the decreased redox activity of eps of biofilms grown at 0 4 0 6 v with the potentials increased from 0 2 0 6 v the concentration of extracellular polysaccharide was increased while the production of extracellular protein was reduced fig 4 b and c in addition the eps components in all biofilms were found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the entire biofilm fig 5 compared to the interior layer of biofilm grown at 0 2 v which contained higher proportion of proteins 42 4 the interior layers of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v were predominated by extracellular polysaccharides 41 1 60 7 fig s5 these results suggested that g soli cells especially the cells in the interior layer of the biofilm stimulated the production of extracellular polysaccharide by higher potentials 0 4 and 0 6 v the maximum current generated by biofilms grown in the potential range of 0 2 0 6 v was positively related to protein content but negatively related to extracellular polysaccharide content in eps of the entire biofilm r2 0 87 p 0 05 figs s6a and c this correlation was also applied to the interior biofilm layers r2 0 86 p 0 05 figs s6b and d but not to the middle and outer biofilm layers data not shown which agreed with the result in section 3 1 that current generation of biofilms grown at potentials ranging from 0 2 0 6 v lied on the effective redox active proteins interacting with the electrodes according to a model of mechanistic stratification in electroactive biofilms the eps associated redox active proteins function coordinately with conductive pili to transfer electrons in the region within 10 μm closer to the electrode however the pili networks become as the primary mechanism for discharging electrons in the upper region 10 μm steidl et al 2016 that is electron transfer mediated by eps associated redox active proteins mainly occurs in the region closer to the electrode and therefore the eps composition in the interior biofilm layers might play an essential role in determining the eet efficiency of biofilms as previously reported electron transfer in electroactive biofilms is mainly taken charge by the outer membrane and extracellular redox active proteins kumar et al 2017 while nonconductive polysaccharides can interfere with eet between redox active proteins and electrodes kouzuma et al 2010 kitayama et al 2017 thus the predominant presence of extracellular polysaccharides especially in the interior biofilm layers might be a direct cause for the low electrochemical activity of biofilms grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v in the present study extracellular polysaccharide production is often activated by environmental stress for cell protection gambino and cappitelli 2016 han et al 2017 this might be a potential reason for the accumulation of interfacial polysaccharides in geobacter biofilms at 0 4 and 0 6 v exposing to high stress induced by anode section 3 2 geobacter species are anaerobic bacteria which commonly grow via reduction of metal oxyhydr oxides with low predicted redox potentials ranging from 0 11 v vs sce e g birnessite to 0 41 v vs sce e g α feooh elevar et al 2017 therefore high potentials of 0 4 and 0 6 v might induce stress response in geobacter cells and activate the production of extracellular polysaccharides for self protection purpose if cells exposing to excessive stress are not protected by eps proteins on the cell surface are easily inactivated even resulting in cell death and eet lost xiao et al 2017 han et al 2017 by contrast for facultative anaerobe shewanella species that have developed perfect strategies to adapt quite positive oxidation potentials e g oxygen 0 99 v vs sce the production of polysaccharides will not be stimulated under high anode potentials kitayama et al 2017 overall the production of eps under different anode potentials would be finely regulated by cells to keep balance between eet efficiency and cell protection this might be an important underlying mechanism for tuning the electrochemical properties of biofilms at various anode potentials which are helpful to better understand how to set and evaluate optimal anode potentials for improving bes performance 4 conclusion in this work geobacter soli biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v were found to have higher electrochemical activity and eet efficiency than those grown at higher potentials ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 v although more positive potential is thermodynamically favorable for microbial metabolism it was demonstrated that biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v possessed higher cell viability and thereby generated more electrons from cellular metabolism than those grown at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 v meanwhile higher concentrations of protein were detected in eps of the biofilms grown at 0 2 and 0 v resulting in higher redox activity of eps and greater eet efficiency in these biofilms the accumulation of electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide in the biofilm grown at 0 4 and 0 6 v especially in the region closer to electrodes will dramatically interfere with electron transfer from redox active proteins to electrodes but be favorable for cell protection these findings provide a new insight for deep understanding the regulation of electroactive biofilms for optimal performance and can be useful for elucidating the mechanisms how biofilms respond to environmental changes declarations of competing

18784,moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr are promising as a post treatment for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater however the effect of easily degradable carbon sources on the degradation of pharmaceuticals is unclear this study shows the influence of acetate on the degradation of 26 pharmaceuticals in an mbbr was dose and compound dependent while the degradation of venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin was promoted increase of reaction rate constant k by 133 212 55 by acetate its presence caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac decrease of k by 76 57 44 the deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine was clearly slowed down decrease of k by 75 by the dosed acetate probably due to feedback inhibition by abundant acetate 17 out of 25 tested compounds were found to be independent of the acetate dosage which suggested dosing acetate induced minor effects on most of pharmaceuticals removal enrichment of s or first eluted enantiomer of 4 β blockers and the metabolite metoprolol acid was observed both non enantioselective rapid at elevated compound concentration and enantioselective enzymes slower and predominant at lower compound concentration played a part in the biodegradation high doses of acetate slowed down the enantiomeric enrichment of atenolol metoprolol propranolol and metoprolol acid which demonstrated that the acetate is able to up or down regulate enzymes involved in the enantioselective degradation of β blockers and thus reveals a complex co metabolism relationship between transformation pathways of pharmaceuticals and carbon source graphical abstract image 1 keywords kinetics deconjugation enantioselectivity co metabolism competitive inhibition 1 introduction high consumption of pharmaceuticals induces concerns on environmental quality and enhances discussions on treatments for removing these compounds from wastewater daughton and ternes 1999 grandclément et al 2017 conventional activated sludge cas treatment as widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is reported to be effective for easily degradable pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen acyclovir atenolol ibuprofen but fails to remove a large number of recalcitrant compounds e g diclofenac carbamazepine venlafaxine snyder et al 2003 ternes et al 2004 falås et al 2016 thus pharmaceuticals are frequently present in effluent wastewater ng l μg l as well as in the receiving waters ternes 1998 ben et al 2018 discharged pharmaceuticals are a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems triebskorn et al 2004 godoy et al 2015 abatement of pharmaceuticals thus becomes a major challenge in wastewater treatment technology several technologies have been tested to remove pharmaceuticals post stream to cas e g sorption to activated carbon margot et al 2013 separation by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis kimura et al 2003 or oxidation with advanced oxidation processes bourgin et al 2017 however these processes either do not destroy the contaminants or have high operating cost and generate potentially harmful by products ahmed et al 2017 recent studies showed that moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr could be a promising alternative since mbbr provided high removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater tang et al 2017b torresi et al 2017 compared to cas mbbr was reported to exhibit significant enhanced removal rates per biomass unit for 5 out of 7 pharmaceuticals which suggested that biofilm biomass is more effective to remove certain compounds falås et al 2012 casas et al 2015 reported high removal by a three staged mbbr with little but very efficient biomass in the last stage while the first stage had a lot of biomass which was however less active the low supply of energy and electron acceptor i e easily degradable carbon is probably one of the limiting factors for the performance of the biofilm used post stream horvath 1972 pascale et al 1998 thus it is suggested that co metabolism mechanisms are relevant for the removal of micropollutants fischer and majewsky 2014 and the biomass is build up and maintained by other carbon sources than the micropollutants on the other hand supply of too much easily degradable carbon might result in competitive inhibition and consequent less degradation of pharmaceuticals abtahi et al 2018 however the best configurations for dosing extra carbon sources in order to optimize performance of mbbr are unknown tang et al 2017b used a mbbr fed with intermittent raw wastewater as a polishing treatment for pharmaceuticals and managed complete removal of diclofenac ibuprofen and atenolol with 4 h hydraulic retention time hrt even so the mechanisms involved in the degradation of recalcitrant substrates by co degradation of pharmaceuticals in mbbr are still unclear we presently assume that enzymatic effects can be triggered by short supply of carbon sources avoiding adaptation of the biofilm thus the constant supply of substrate to the biofilm was avoided acetate was chosen as the carbon source to be dosed into mbbr as it is easily biodegradable and frequently used as co substrate and has relevance to a multitude of microbial metabolic processes thus we hypothesized 1 that doses of acetate would affect biodegradation of the pharmaceuticals either by up regulating degradation co metabolism or down regulating degradation inhibition acetate dosing is not only relevant for parent compounds but also transformation products and transformation pathways to understand through what mechanisms co substrates participate in the enzyme mediated degradation of pharmaceuticals the transformation pathways that involves acetate e g acetylation deacetylation are of large interest to be studied this task was undertaken by using acetyl sulfadiazine as an example of a well known human metabolite which is rapidly deconjugated by microorganisms in biological treatment processes göbel et al 2005 yuan et al 2019 more than 50 of the pharmaceuticals sold in the market are chiral and usually manufactured as racemic compounds kasprzyk hordern 2010 sanganyado et al 2017 in addition various chiral pharmaceuticals are degraded enantioselectively by microbial processes in wwtps indicating towards different enzymes mediating the respective processes ribeiro et al 2012 evans et al 2017 in our study we focused on the enantiomeric separation of β blockers which can be performed in one chromatographic run although many studies reported enantioselective removal of β blockers by activated sludge or in natural water microcosm sanganyado et al 2017 the effect of extra carbon source on the enantioselective degradation in biofilm reactor was never studied before in this context analysis of enantioselectivity was used to test whether different acetate concentrations can shift reactions towards enzymes with different enantiomer preference ribeiro et al 2012 we thus hypothesized 2 that different enzymes degrading our target compounds leave different enantiomeric signatures on the residues and the metabolites with varying amount of carbon source the first objective of our study was to determine whether short dosing of acetate results in up or down regulation of the degradation of pharmaceuticals and if so at which concentration the second objective was to study the influence of acetate on the deconjugation of acetyl metabolites the third objective was through assessing the enantiomeric fraction of β blockers to reveal their transformation pathways and under varying co degradation scenarios this study addresses how the co metabolism and competitive inhibition of pharmaceuticals removal can be controlled by management of carbon source the combined study of degradation kinetics transformation pathways and enantioselectivity of pharmaceuticals allowed for the first time to distinguish different mechanisms induced by acetate in the co degradation pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals twenty six pharmaceuticals were selected for this

mbbr carriers with effluent wastewater flow through a 3 l continuous flow reactor fed with effluent wastewater was filled with a total of 330 k5 carriers anoxkaldnes lund sweden for incubation of biofilm the flow in this reactor was 1 5 l d effluent wastewater with 48 h hrt the feed water was stored in a 4 c fridge and aerated constantly before pumping into the reactor using a cole parmer masterflex l s pump cole parmer illinois usa to avoid adsorption of pharmaceuticals or other organic matter on the tubing during feeding all tubing used was made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the reactor was kept in dark to avoid algae growth and operated at 20 c all the time the biofilm was adapted to the conditions for more than 6 months before performing the batch degradation experiments section 2 3 to obtain expansive kinetics the used effluent wastewater was collected from bjergmarken wwtp in roskilde denmark which is a cas plant casas and bester 2015 the general parameters of the effluent used for the continuous flow incubation and also the batch test are shown in table s2 supporting information the concentrations of indigenous pharmaceuticals in the used effluent are shown in table s3 supporting information 2 3 kinetic experiment batch mbbr with dosed acetate batch mbbr was chosen to test kinetics deconjugation and enantioselective degradation of spiked pharmaceuticals with pre defined doses of acetate the batch experiments with different acetate concentrations were conducted in duplicate using the following procedure a 75 μl of pharmaceuticals stock solution containing a mixture of 26 pharmaceuticals dissolved in methanol were spiked into 100 ml empty erlenmeyer flasks to avoid methanol from the stock solution affecting this experiment the erlenmeyer flasks with spiked stock solution were put in a fume hood overnight to completely evaporate the methanol successively 75 ml of effluent wastewater were added to each erlenmeyer flask after being filtered through a 1 6 μm glass microfiber filters whatman gf a the wastewater in the flasks was dosed to contain 0 5 10 20 30 60 90 160 and 320 mg c l sodium acetate the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken at 140 rpm for 2 h to completely dissolve the spiked pharmaceuticals the initial concentrations of the spiked pharmaceuticals ranged from 5 1 to 58 4 μg l detail is shown in table s3 no loss of compounds during the spiking process was observed as the recovery for compounds ranged from 90 to 114 table s3 for each flask ten pre incubated mbbr carriers were randomly picked from the continuous flow reactor and transferred to the respective flask to reach a filling ratio of 40 carrier surface area 0 323 m2 l ooi et al 2017 in the parallel control test ten new carriers without biofilm were placed in the erlenmeyer instead of biofilm attached carriers the controls were used to determine the fraction of pharmaceutical removal caused by abiotic reactions or suspended microorganisms during the batch experiments all flasks were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation shaken at 140 rpm and aerated with 0 5 l air min to maintain aerobic conditions the water loss due to the evaporation was supplemented by adding deionized water on a daily basis these batch reactors were sampled over three weeks for each sample 900 μl of liquid were collected from each flask at 0 4 8 12 24 30 48 72 96 144 192 336 and 552 h and 100 μl of internal standard is solution detail is shown in table s4 supporting information were added the samples were stored at 20 c until analysis mbbr carriers were removed from each flask to maintain a filling ratio of 40 and counteracting the water losses by sampling 2 4 quantification of cod and biomass in the batch mbbr experiment the changes of chemical oxygen demand cod during the batch mbbr experiment were analyzed by performing a separate 225 ml batch incubation to understand the degradation of acetate as cod analysis requires larger volumes to suppress microorganism activity after sample collection the ph of the samples was adjusted to less than 4 0 with sulfuric acid and the samples were put into a freezer for storage until analysis the cod of samples was analyzed according to standard method iso 15705 2002 st cod the standard error and the limits of detection of the cod analysis were 1 61 and 3 11 mg l respectively biomass concentration in the start of the batch mbbr experiment was measured according to torresi et al 2017 details shown as supporting information s2 2 5 quantification of the pharmaceuticals by hplc ms ms including the enantiomers of the β blockers before analysis the samples were brought to room temperature vortexed for 30 s and successively centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min after separation of the particles the supernatant was directly analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometrer hplc ms ms the hplc was an ultimate 3000 hplc series system from dionex the mass spectrometer was an api 4000 triple quadrupole system absciex framingham ma usa details on the hplc ms ms method are documented in casas et al 2015 while the limit of determinations lods and limit of quantifications loqs for this analysis are shown in table s3 the concentration range for the calibration was typically 0 025 54 μg l enantiomeric analysis of the β blockers was performed on the same hplc ms ms enantiomers of atenolol metoprolol propranolol sotalol and metoprolol acid were separated in an astec chirobiotic t 150 4 6 mm 5 μm chiral column with an astec chirobiotic t 20 4 6 mm 5 μm guard column the hplc separation was run using isocratic conditions with 3 a hplc water 0 2 formic acid and 97 b methanol 20 mm ammonium formate at a rate of 0 3 ml min for 28 min after the separation the mobile phase was changed to 100 a for 5 min to elute potential salt precipitates from the column and successively stabilized at 3 a 97 b for 6 min the column temperature was set at 20 c the ms operating conditions for the enantiomeric analysis are shown in table s5 the chromatograms of separated enantiomers are shown in figure s1 notably the parent and fragment mass of metoprolol and metoprolol acid were the same in our instrument so these two compounds needed to be separated by the hplc column the structure of the respective enantiomers of the β blockers was elucidated by comparing retention times with enantiopure standards as no enantiopure standards of sotalol and metoprolol acid were available this was not possible for these two compounds thus for sotalol and metoprolol acid we characterized the enantiomers by elution order 2 6 data analysis the concentrations of all compounds were calculated by linear calibration 1 x weighting and utilizing internal standards using the analyst 1 6 software r2 of linear regression of calibration for each compound were shown in table s3 supporting information to access the

and how long acetate was present in the batch mbbr the temporal development of cod in the batch incubations are shown in fig 1 significant removal of cod is visible for all acetate doses higher than 30 mg c l thus functions were fitted and plotted into the graph the batch mbbr with 0 no acetate added and 5 mg c l added varied around the starting cod value 20 6 4 mg o2 l as the background the overall slow removal of cod is due to the relative low amount of biomass on carriers about 1 0 mg per carrier supporting information a pseudo first order followed by a plateau kinetic model discussed in supporting information s1 was used to fit the removal of cod as a function of the acetate dose 30 90 and 320 mg c l respectively fig 1 the plateau was attributed to the background hard cod about 20 mg o2 l as contained in the effluent water used for feeding and conducting the experiments in as a result reaction rate constants k 1 of 0 0373 0 0073 and 0 0018 h 1 for the mbbr spiked with 30 90 and 320 mg c l acetate respectively are obtained for the degradation of acetate it turns out the lower the initial cod the higher is k 1 which is indicating towards a michaelis menten or monod like saturation kinetics these results demonstrated that the biofilm supplied with high dosages of acetate 90 320 mg c l had an easily degradable carbon source available until the end of the batch experiment whereas without enough additional acetate 0 30 mg c l the biofilm had to rely on the hard cod during most of the incubation period 3 2 degradation kinetics of pharmaceuticals by batch mbbr with dosed acetate out of the 26 pharmaceuticals that were tested including β blockers analgesics antidepressants contrast media and antibiotics structures and properties are shown in table s1 all compounds except diatrizoic acid were degraded in the mbbr figs 2 and 4 and figure s2 of supporting information the range of the average experimental errors for compounds concentration c c0 was 0 03 0 17 without dosed acetate atenolol ibuprofen citalopram propranolol and acetyl sulfadiazine were relatively rapidly degraded in the mbbr with removal exceeding 80 in 48 h on the other hand less than 50 of phenazone tramadol carbamazepine iopamidol and sulfamethoxazole were degraded after 552 h in the mbbr without acetate these compounds were considered as recalcitrant both in cas and mbbr joss et al 2006 falås et al 2016 these values seem to fit to other studies as there was very little biomass on these carriers casas et al 2015 tang et al 2017a most of the studied compounds were not degraded in the biofilm free control reactors however some removal of clarithromycin erythromycin azithromycin and clindamycin was observed in the biofilm free reactors figure s2 as these reactors contain minute amounts of suspended biomass another experiment was conducted to exclude biodegradation by residual suspended biomass new chips were incubated in deionized water even in these reactors these four antibiotics were removed which is interpreted as hydrolysis however this hydrolysis in deionized water was slower than that observed in the effluent thus it was assumed that the removal of these four antibiotics was not only caused by degradation in the biofilm but also by either abiotic reactions hydrolysis or biodegradation by residual suspended microorganisms in effluent wastewater the results demonstrate that mbbr has a potential to be used as post treatment for lowering certain pharmaceuticals in wastewater degradation of 22 compounds occurred following pseudo first order kinetic whilst degradation of atenolol clindamycin and trimethoprim were better described by a zero order kinetics fig 2 and fig s2 table 1 this was not surprising and probably caused by two mechanisms 1 saturation of enzymes or microorganisms at high concentrations of compounds which would simplify michaelis menten or monod kinetics from pseudo first order to zero order kinetic model bekins et al 1998 2 an adaptation phase for microorganism occurred when high concentrations of compounds were spiked which could lead to a lag phase or change the kinetics liang et al 2016 el taliawy et al 2018 comparing the reaction rate constants k from our study table 1 with the values from literature the k values of 10 compounds were significantly higher 1 4 8 times than the values from a polishing mbbr of tang et al 2017a but our k values for most compounds were significantly lower 2 58 times than the values from another polishing mbbr of tang et al 2017b and the three stage mbbr of casas et al 2015 due to considerable uncertainties in assessing the biomass in this study the biomass normalized kinetic constants in this study was not compared with other studies though the data is documented in supporting information table s6 all in all there is a complex competition of processes causing mixed efficiencies on mbbr working purely on effluent wastewater according to the different effects induced by the acetate on the degradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals in the mbbr the kinetic results of pharmaceuticals were divided into 3 groups 1 compounds that degraded faster under acetate dosing 2 compounds that degraded slower under acetate dosing 3 compounds for which the degradation did not change under acetate dosing 3 2 1 pharmaceuticals that degraded faster under acetate dosing as shown in fig 3 a the reaction rate constant k for venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin increased significantly due to the acetate dosing for venlafaxine and tramadol the k increased steadily with the increasing acetate concentrations above 60 mg c l reaching its maximum 233 and 312 respectively higher removal than degradation without dosing acetate at the highest acetate dosing this indicates towards co metabolism at the higher acetate concentrations for ciprofloxacin a maximum of the degradation rate constant was observed at 20 60 mg c l of acetate and the k was increased by 55 in comparison to degradation without dosing acetate while the promotion disappeared at higher dosages 90 mg c l and more this agrees to the results from pan et al 2018 who reported that 0 5 g l of acetate promoted ciprofloxacin biodegradation by a thermus sp isolated from sludge while 1 3 g l sodium acetate inhibited the degradation notably the k of sotalol in our study was uniquely increased at 20 mg c l acetate and decreased to below the initial level at 90 mg c l figure s3 thus these results suggest that for certain pharmaceuticals there was a reaction rate that was dependent on the dose of acetate tang et al 2017a reported that adding 4 9 24 7 mg l of humic acids facilitated the removal of 10 pharmaceuticals by mbbr torresi et al 2017 found that 9 out of 22 pharmaceuticals were degraded faster by a pre denitrifying mbbr dosed with methanol than ethanol both at 239 mg cod l combining our results with the literature it is suggested that the co metabolism of pharmaceuticals by mbbr is for some compounds dependent on the type and dose of carbon source for application of co metabolism removal of pharmaceuticals by mbbr the optimal dosage of carbon source should be further determined under realistic operational conditions 3 2 2 pharmaceuticals that degraded slower under acetate dosing the degradation of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac was slowed down by the acetate addition fig 3b for citalopram and diclofenac the respective k value started to decrease after dosing more than 10 and 90 mg c l acetate respectively 43 and 56 lower than without dosing acetate the reaction rate constant k of ibuprofen showed a significantly decrease as low as 76 at 30 90 and 320 mg c l acetate compared with the initial k without dosing acetate at 60 and 160 mg c l acetate results are not significantly different to no amendment with acetate probably due to the large deviation for those data points kassotaki et al 2018 reported that acetate promoted degradation of ibuprofen by a nitrifying community thus the contrary results indicate that co metabolism varies among distinct microbial communities two possible reasons could explain the inhibited degradation of these pharmaceuticals by acetate 1 competitive inhibition occurred between the pharmaceuticals and acetate active sites on enzymes involved in the transformation of a number of pharmaceuticals might be blocked by the more abundant acetate more simply the microorganisms in biofilm preferred to use easily degradable carbon source rather than to degrade recalcitrant molecules it has been previously reported that acetate suppressed the biodegradation of acetaminophen caffeine crotamiton and artificial sweeteners in a soil column foolad et al 2015 2 dosing large amount of acetate might cause an unbalanced c n ratio in mbbr system which would lead to negative effects on the functional microorganisms li et al 2018 reported that the optimal c n ratio for a bacterial co culture to degrade 17 β estradiol was 1 35 while higher c n ratios 1 10 and 1 20 were less effective it was also reported that a c n ratio 6 1 of influent was better than the one with c n ratio 14 1 for activated sludge and membrane bioreactor regarding the removal of toxic compounds boonnorat et al 2017 the suitable c n ratio could facilitate the maintenance of key microbial activities such as nitrification which helps to produce the enzymes crucial to degradation of the compounds yu et al 2018 3 2 3 pharmaceuticals for which the degradation did not change under acetate dosing the degradation rate constants k for propranolol atenolol metoprolol phenazone carbamazepine azithromycin clindamycin clarithromycin erythromycin trimethoprim sulfamethizole sulfamethoxazole iohexol iopromide iopamidol and iomeprol was not significantly affected by any of the used acetate doses fig 3c and figure s3 although the k of some compounds under certain dosages of acetate showed changes e g metoprolol trimethoprim the difference was not statistically significant moreover because the tested dosage range of acetate 0 320 mg c l was wide and high concentrations of acetate persisted until the end see cod in fig 1 degradation of the above pharmaceuticals is expected to be unaffected even by higher dosage of acetate it has been previously reported in a biofilm based soil aquifer treatment that the removal of 9 out of 14 pharmaceuticals and personal care products were independent of the addition of acetate onesios and bouwer 2012 transformation of the compounds studied in our study in the mbbr biofilm might relate to processes which do not require acetate as substrates based on the results of our kinetic study we proved that short supply of a carbon source like acetate for enhancing co metabolism cannot up regulate the removal of the large variety of pharmaceuticals in mbbr however the differences in these above kinetic studies were not that large to explain the differences between the results obtained by casas et al 2015 on the one hand and tang et al 2017b on the other hand as reported by tang et al 2017b their polishing mbbr adapted with intermittent feeding of high carbon source exhibited considerably higher removal of diclofenac and other pharmaceuticals it seems like tang et al 2017b initiated a highly adapted biomass thus the critical factor for up regulating the removal by mbbr could be the adaptation of the microbial community in the biofilm biomass to certain conditions e g suitable carbon source c n ratio while an enhancement of co degradation by short dosing carbon as tested in this study is less effective 3 3 acetate involved deconjugation of sulfonamide metabolites acetyl sulfadiazine has been previously shown to be deconjugated to sulfadiazine in a post denitrifying mbbr torresi et al 2017 as shown below nevertheless the effect of acetate on the deconjugation reaction was never studied before to understand this process we studied the transformation of acetyl sulfadiazine into sulfadiazine the reaction kinetic model of these two compounds is proposed by us assuming that the degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine followed pseudo first order kinetics as eqs 4 and 5 respectively acetyl sulfadiazine ac sfd k ac sfd sulfadiazine sfd acetate sulfadiazine sfd k sfd transformation products transformation of acetyl sulfadiazine ac sfd and sulfadiazine sfd in the mbbr k ac sfd and k sfd are the reaction rate constants for acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine respectively 4 d c ac sfd dt k ac sfd c ac sfd 5 d c sfd d t k for sfd c ac sfd k deg sfd c sfd c ac sfd and c sfd are the real concentrations molarity of the two compounds k for sfd is the formation rate constant of sulfadiazine due to the deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine whereas k deg sfd is the degradation reaction rate constant of sulfadiazine we hypothesized that acetyl sulfadiazine only transformed into sulfadiazine in our study thus the formation rate of sulfadiazine equaled to the degradation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine k for sfd k ac sfd k deg sfd k sfd thus eqs 4 and 5 can be rewritten as eqs 6 and 7 6 c ac sfd c ac sfd 0 e k ac sfd t 7 d c sfd d t k ac sfd c ac sfd k sfd c sfd eq 6 was combined into eq 7 to become eq 8 8 d c sfd d t k ac sfd c ac sfd 0 e k ac sfd t k sfd c sfd c ac sfd 0 is the initial concentration molarity of acetyl sulfadiazine eq 8 can be expressed as explicit function 9 c sfd c sfd 0 e k sfd t c ac sfd 0 k ac sfd k sfd k ac sfd e k ac sfd t e k sfd t c sfd 0 were initial concentration molarity of sulfadiazine the concentrations of acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine from the experimental analysis were fitted to eqs 6 and 9 respectively fig 4a and c the results demonstrated the fitting of degradation of sulfadiazine to eq 9 relatively well r2 0 88 fig 4c and d table s6 which proved our hypothesis that almost all acetyl sulfadiazine transformed to sulfadiazine in the aerobic mbbr in the study of torresi et al 2017 the kinetic fitting to the retransformation model was poor r2 0 2 which was explained by more complex transformation pathways of acetyl sulfadiazine in the anaerobic denitrifying mbbr in our mbbr because k ac sfd was much higher than k sfd fig 4e and f it led to the boost of sulfadiazine during the initial period of reaction fig 4c different dosages of acetate exhibited clearly impacts on the degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine to sulfadiazine fig 4e when 5 and 10 mg c l of acetate were added to the mbbr the degradation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine was increased to a maximum of 39 of the initial without dosing acetate with higher dosages of acetate a gradual decline of degradation rates appeared up to 90 mg c l were a decrease of up to 75 of the initial was observed after 90 mg l acetate the degradation rate constants showed little variation 0 018 0 022 h 1 this result demonstrated that acetate as one transformation product of acetyl sulfadiazine itself facilitated deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine at very low concentration 5 10 mg c l however high dosing of acetate caused significant inhibition of the degradation the inhibition of deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine by acetate is not due to competitive inhibition but more likely a feedback inhibition on the functional enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway gerhart and pardee 1962 interestingly the degradation rate constant k of sulfadiazine was nearly constant and thus independent of the acetate dose fig 4f nevertheless the high dosage of acetate decreased the observed maximum of sulfadiazine due to the lower transformation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine fig 4c and d our results revealed that additional acetate especially with a high dosage probably made a major difference on the specific biotransformation pathways in which acetate was involved like de conjugation of acetyl sulfonamides but barely had effects on many other biotransformation of pharmaceuticals since acetate is involved in a large number of microbial reactions it will be of major interest to resolve the effects of acetate involved in other similar metabolism of pharmaceuticals 3 4 enantioselective degradation of β blockers by mbbr with dosed acetate the concentration of enantiomers and ef of four β blockers and metoprolol acid also named as atenolol acid which is a transformation product of both atenolol and metoprolol nodler et al 2013 are shown in fig 5 for all β blockers the r enantiomer is degraded faster than the s enantiomer thus leading to enrichment of the s enantiomers when enantioselective degradation is observed according to evans et al 2017 s enrichment of atenolol metoprolol propranolol was also found in activated sludge microcosms however in their study the ef of sotalol was unchanged after the incubation period interestingly in the present work the enantioselective degradation for all β blockers was observed only when the major removal had already occurred and the concentrations were already down to about one third of each compound starting concentration the enantioselective degradation of atenolol was the only one which occurred over the whole incubation period but its ef only changed from 0 50 0 01 to 0 55 0 01 t test showed p one tail 0 001 for metoprolol and its metabolite metoprolol acid enantioselectivity was established already after 48 h while it took 24 h and 96 h for propranolol and sotalol respectively the enantioselective fate of chiral pharmaceuticals in environment is generally caused by their interaction with enzymes which are often enantioselective kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 the shift from racemic non enantioselective to enantioselective degradation can be interpreted assuming there are two degradation processes of β blockers in the reactor 1 the majority of the degradation rapidly was conducted by the non enantioselective enzymes while 2 the enantioselective enzymes were working more slowly and more dominant at lower concentrations the enantioselective degradation played probably a stronger role with indigenous concentration of β blockers souchier et al 2016 claimed that the ef could be considered as a quantitative indicator for the biodegradation of metoprolol in wwtps however because of the existence of non enantioselective biodegradation pathways of β blockers the ef of the β blockers could not reflect accurately the status of the biodegradation in our experiments metoprolol acid was not spiked into the batch mbbr but was still detected 0 352 0 072 μg l being indigenous to the water used to feed the reactors wastewater effluent a slight enrichment of the first eluting enantiomer e1 of metoprolol acid occurred during our batch incubation however to determine its origin atenolol or metoprolol it the mass balance of metoprolol acid and its formation from both atenolol and metoprolol needs to be adressed as shown in fig 5a b and 5e 38 4 nm atenolol was removed from the reactor within 12 h which was coinciding with the formation peak of metoprolol acid 34 3 nm 12 h while at the same time only 8 4 nm metoprolol was degraded thus it can be safely assumed that the observed formation of metoprolol acid predominantly originated from atenolol in that phase the ef of metoprolol acid changed from 0 46 0 02 to 0 50 0 01 which was corresponding to atenolol itself developing an ef of up to 0 55 0 01 after 12 h no metoprolol acid can be formed from atenolol as the parent compound was quantitatively degraded however a slow formation from metoprolol was possible however after 24 h metoprolol acid slowly degraded with an apparent reaction rate constant of k 1 0 023 0 010 h 1 during that phase the observed reaction rate constant results from i a degradation of metoprolol acid and ii a slower formation from metoprolol in parallel to degradation of 30 nm metoprolol k 1 0 027 0 003 h 1 the development of an enantio preference in metoprolol acid was most probably due to an enantioselective degradation of metoprolol acid 48 96 h of the experiment it is worth noting that the ef of atenolol metoprolol propranolol and metoprolol acid was developing faster with low dosage 0 20 mg c l of acetate than with the high dose 90 320 mg c l especially towards the end of the incubation fig 5 for the transformation product metoprolol acid the high dose of acetate inhibited the degradation 48 96 h compared with low dose of acetate fig 5e acetate dosing also had an effect on the ef of sotalol at the end of the incubation but the trend was different to the other β blockers this suggests that dosing acetate changes the enantioselectivity of the degradation of β blockers including propranolol and their transformation product metoprolol acid the assumption that a two phase kinetics indeed is a pure enantiomeric effect casas et al 2015 can thus be at least made more plausible a similar effect has been previously been reported when degrading ofloxacine with pure bacterial strains under acetate dosages maia et al 2018 as well as for alprenolol and propranolol by activated sludge ribeiro et al 2013 the presence of readily degradable carbon source like acetate might induce higher or lower metabolic activity from part of functional microorganisms that degraded the β blockers however because the majority of the β blockers in our study was degraded through the non enantioselective processes during which ef of β blockers did not change the observed degradation kinetic rate constants of β blockers was not significantly changed by dosing acetate it suggests that the dosed acetate only affects the specific enantioselective transformation pathways other than non enantioselective pathways of β blockers in the mbbr these results indicate that the amount of available carbon source for microbial communities might result in different enantiomer levels of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment on the other hand the co existence of non enantioselective and enantioselective transformation pathways characterizes the co metabolism of pharmaceuticals and carbon source as a complex process thus instead of studying racemic compounds enantiomeric analysis might reveal more detail of the different biodegradation pathways 4 conclusions based on the kinetic and enantiomeric analysis of pharmaceuticals in the batch polishing mbbr with dosed acetate the following conclusions can be draw the degradation of venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin was enhanced by acetate dosing on the other hand acetate especially at high dosages caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac the promotion and inhibition by acetate were dose and compound dependent the degradation of 17 out of 25 compounds was found to be independent of the acetate doses overall the majority of pharmaceuticals could not be up or down regulated by co metabolism of acetate in mbbr deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine was suppressed by the dosed acetate probably because of a feedback inhibition of functional enzyme by excess acetate although the observed degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine was affected by the acetate dosing the degradation of sulfadiazine was found to be independent of the acetate dose enantioselective degradation of β blockers and metoprolol acid occurred in the mbbr resulting for all in enrichment of s or first eluted enantiomer the majority of the degradation was non enantioselective while the enantioselective degradation was more slowly and evident at low concentrations which suggested the non enantioselective and enantioselective enzymes play a role in the removal process high dosed acetate resulted in lower ef of atenolol propranolol metoprolol and metoprolol acid than the one with low dosage of acetate thus changes in wastewater conditions amount of available easily degradable carbon source can make differences on the enantiomer enrichment to understand and be able to predict which compounds can and which cannot be degraded under which conditions more knowledge on biofilm metabolism is necessary however to improve removal rates in biofilm systems adaptation seems a better strategy than targeted up regulation by using short dosing co metabolic approaches acknowledgments the study was supported

18784,moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr are promising as a post treatment for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater however the effect of easily degradable carbon sources on the degradation of pharmaceuticals is unclear this study shows the influence of acetate on the degradation of 26 pharmaceuticals in an mbbr was dose and compound dependent while the degradation of venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin was promoted increase of reaction rate constant k by 133 212 55 by acetate its presence caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac decrease of k by 76 57 44 the deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine was clearly slowed down decrease of k by 75 by the dosed acetate probably due to feedback inhibition by abundant acetate 17 out of 25 tested compounds were found to be independent of the acetate dosage which suggested dosing acetate induced minor effects on most of pharmaceuticals removal enrichment of s or first eluted enantiomer of 4 β blockers and the metabolite metoprolol acid was observed both non enantioselective rapid at elevated compound concentration and enantioselective enzymes slower and predominant at lower compound concentration played a part in the biodegradation high doses of acetate slowed down the enantiomeric enrichment of atenolol metoprolol propranolol and metoprolol acid which demonstrated that the acetate is able to up or down regulate enzymes involved in the enantioselective degradation of β blockers and thus reveals a complex co metabolism relationship between transformation pathways of pharmaceuticals and carbon source graphical abstract image 1 keywords kinetics deconjugation enantioselectivity co metabolism competitive inhibition 1 introduction high consumption of pharmaceuticals induces concerns on environmental quality and enhances discussions on treatments for removing these compounds from wastewater daughton and ternes 1999 grandclément et al 2017 conventional activated sludge cas treatment as widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is reported to be effective for easily degradable pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen acyclovir atenolol ibuprofen but fails to remove a large number of recalcitrant compounds e g diclofenac carbamazepine venlafaxine snyder et al 2003 ternes et al 2004 falås et al 2016 thus pharmaceuticals are frequently present in effluent wastewater ng l μg l as well as in the receiving waters ternes 1998 ben et al 2018 discharged pharmaceuticals are a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems triebskorn et al 2004 godoy et al 2015 abatement of pharmaceuticals thus becomes a major challenge in wastewater treatment technology several technologies have been tested to remove pharmaceuticals post stream to cas e g sorption to activated carbon margot et al 2013 separation by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis kimura et al 2003 or oxidation with advanced oxidation processes bourgin et al 2017 however these processes either do not destroy the contaminants or have high operating cost and generate potentially harmful by products ahmed et al 2017 recent studies showed that moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr could be a promising alternative since mbbr provided high removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater tang et al 2017b torresi et al 2017 compared to cas mbbr was reported to exhibit significant enhanced removal rates per biomass unit for 5 out of 7 pharmaceuticals which suggested that biofilm biomass is more effective to remove certain compounds falås et al 2012 casas et al 2015 reported high removal by a three staged mbbr with little but very efficient biomass in the last stage while the first stage had a lot of biomass which was however less active the low supply of energy and electron acceptor i e easily degradable carbon is probably one of the limiting factors for the performance of the biofilm used post stream horvath 1972 pascale et al 1998 thus it is suggested that co metabolism mechanisms are relevant for the removal of micropollutants fischer and majewsky 2014 and the biomass is build up and maintained by other carbon sources than the micropollutants on the other hand supply of too much easily degradable carbon might result in competitive inhibition and consequent less degradation of pharmaceuticals abtahi et al 2018 however the best configurations for dosing extra carbon sources in order to optimize performance of mbbr are unknown tang et al 2017b used a mbbr fed with intermittent raw wastewater as a polishing treatment for pharmaceuticals and managed complete removal of diclofenac ibuprofen and atenolol with 4 h hydraulic retention time hrt even so the mechanisms involved in the degradation of recalcitrant substrates by co degradation of pharmaceuticals in mbbr are still unclear we presently assume that enzymatic effects can be triggered by short supply of carbon sources avoiding adaptation of the biofilm thus the constant supply of substrate to the biofilm was avoided acetate was chosen as the carbon source to be dosed into mbbr as it is easily biodegradable and frequently used as co substrate and has relevance to a multitude of microbial metabolic processes thus we hypothesized 1 that doses of acetate would affect biodegradation of the pharmaceuticals either by up regulating degradation co metabolism or down regulating degradation inhibition acetate dosing is not only relevant for parent compounds but also transformation products and transformation pathways to understand through what mechanisms co substrates participate in the enzyme mediated degradation of pharmaceuticals the transformation pathways that involves acetate e g acetylation deacetylation are of large interest to be studied this task was undertaken by using acetyl sulfadiazine as an example of a well known human metabolite which is rapidly deconjugated by microorganisms in biological treatment processes göbel et al 2005 yuan et al 2019 more than 50 of the pharmaceuticals sold in the market are chiral and usually manufactured as racemic compounds kasprzyk hordern 2010 sanganyado et al 2017 in addition various chiral pharmaceuticals are degraded enantioselectively by microbial processes in wwtps indicating towards different enzymes mediating the respective processes ribeiro et al 2012 evans et al 2017 in our study we focused on the enantiomeric separation of β blockers which can be performed in one chromatographic run although many studies reported enantioselective removal of β blockers by activated sludge or in natural water microcosm sanganyado et al 2017 the effect of extra carbon source on the enantioselective degradation in biofilm reactor was never studied before in this context analysis of enantioselectivity was used to test whether different acetate concentrations can shift reactions towards enzymes with different enantiomer preference ribeiro et al 2012 we thus hypothesized 2 that different enzymes degrading our target compounds leave different enantiomeric signatures on the residues and the metabolites with varying amount of carbon source the first objective of our study was to determine whether short dosing of acetate results in up or down regulation of the degradation of pharmaceuticals and if so at which concentration the second objective was to study the influence of acetate on the deconjugation of acetyl metabolites the third objective was through assessing the enantiomeric fraction of β blockers to reveal their transformation pathways and under varying co degradation scenarios this study addresses how the co metabolism and competitive inhibition of pharmaceuticals removal can be controlled by management of carbon source the combined study of degradation kinetics transformation pathways and enantioselectivity of pharmaceuticals allowed for the first time to distinguish different mechanisms induced by acetate in the co degradation pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals twenty six pharmaceuticals were selected for this

mbbr carriers with effluent wastewater flow through a 3 l continuous flow reactor fed with effluent wastewater was filled with a total of 330 k5 carriers anoxkaldnes lund sweden for incubation of biofilm the flow in this reactor was 1 5 l d effluent wastewater with 48 h hrt the feed water was stored in a 4 c fridge and aerated constantly before pumping into the reactor using a cole parmer masterflex l s pump cole parmer illinois usa to avoid adsorption of pharmaceuticals or other organic matter on the tubing during feeding all tubing used was made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the reactor was kept in dark to avoid algae growth and operated at 20 c all the time the biofilm was adapted to the conditions for more than 6 months before performing the batch degradation experiments section 2 3 to obtain expansive kinetics the used effluent wastewater was collected from bjergmarken wwtp in roskilde denmark which is a cas plant casas and bester 2015 the general parameters of the effluent used for the continuous flow incubation and also the batch test are shown in table s2 supporting information the concentrations of indigenous pharmaceuticals in the used effluent are shown in table s3 supporting information 2 3 kinetic experiment batch mbbr with dosed acetate batch mbbr was chosen to test kinetics deconjugation and enantioselective degradation of spiked pharmaceuticals with pre defined doses of acetate the batch experiments with different acetate concentrations were conducted in duplicate using the following procedure a 75 μl of pharmaceuticals stock solution containing a mixture of 26 pharmaceuticals dissolved in methanol were spiked into 100 ml empty erlenmeyer flasks to avoid methanol from the stock solution affecting this experiment the erlenmeyer flasks with spiked stock solution were put in a fume hood overnight to completely evaporate the methanol successively 75 ml of effluent wastewater were added to each erlenmeyer flask after being filtered through a 1 6 μm glass microfiber filters whatman gf a the wastewater in the flasks was dosed to contain 0 5 10 20 30 60 90 160 and 320 mg c l sodium acetate the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken at 140 rpm for 2 h to completely dissolve the spiked pharmaceuticals the initial concentrations of the spiked pharmaceuticals ranged from 5 1 to 58 4 μg l detail is shown in table s3 no loss of compounds during the spiking process was observed as the recovery for compounds ranged from 90 to 114 table s3 for each flask ten pre incubated mbbr carriers were randomly picked from the continuous flow reactor and transferred to the respective flask to reach a filling ratio of 40 carrier surface area 0 323 m2 l ooi et al 2017 in the parallel control test ten new carriers without biofilm were placed in the erlenmeyer instead of biofilm attached carriers the controls were used to determine the fraction of pharmaceutical removal caused by abiotic reactions or suspended microorganisms during the batch experiments all flasks were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation shaken at 140 rpm and aerated with 0 5 l air min to maintain aerobic conditions the water loss due to the evaporation was supplemented by adding deionized water on a daily basis these batch reactors were sampled over three weeks for each sample 900 μl of liquid were collected from each flask at 0 4 8 12 24 30 48 72 96 144 192 336 and 552 h and 100 μl of internal standard is solution detail is shown in table s4 supporting information were added the samples were stored at 20 c until analysis mbbr carriers were removed from each flask to maintain a filling ratio of 40 and counteracting the water losses by sampling 2 4 quantification of cod and biomass in the batch mbbr experiment the changes of chemical oxygen demand cod during the batch mbbr experiment were analyzed by performing a separate 225 ml batch incubation to understand the degradation of acetate as cod analysis requires larger volumes to suppress microorganism activity after sample collection the ph of the samples was adjusted to less than 4 0 with sulfuric acid and the samples were put into a freezer for storage until analysis the cod of samples was analyzed according to standard method iso 15705 2002 st cod the standard error and the limits of detection of the cod analysis were 1 61 and 3 11 mg l respectively biomass concentration in the start of the batch mbbr experiment was measured according to torresi et al 2017 details shown as supporting information s2 2 5 quantification of the pharmaceuticals by hplc ms ms including the enantiomers of the β blockers before analysis the samples were brought to room temperature vortexed for 30 s and successively centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min after separation of the particles the supernatant was directly analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometrer hplc ms ms the hplc was an ultimate 3000 hplc series system from dionex the mass spectrometer was an api 4000 triple quadrupole system absciex framingham ma usa details on the hplc ms ms method are documented in casas et al 2015 while the limit of determinations lods and limit of quantifications loqs for this analysis are shown in table s3 the concentration range for the calibration was typically 0 025 54 μg l enantiomeric analysis of the β blockers was performed on the same hplc ms ms enantiomers of atenolol metoprolol propranolol sotalol and metoprolol acid were separated in an astec chirobiotic t 150 4 6 mm 5 μm chiral column with an astec chirobiotic t 20 4 6 mm 5 μm guard column the hplc separation was run using isocratic conditions with 3 a hplc water 0 2 formic acid and 97 b methanol 20 mm ammonium formate at a rate of 0 3 ml min for 28 min after the separation the mobile phase was changed to 100 a for 5 min to elute potential salt precipitates from the column and successively stabilized at 3 a 97 b for 6 min the column temperature was set at 20 c the ms operating conditions for the enantiomeric analysis are shown in table s5 the chromatograms of separated enantiomers are shown in figure s1 notably the parent and fragment mass of metoprolol and metoprolol acid were the same in our instrument so these two compounds needed to be separated by the hplc column the structure of the respective enantiomers of the β blockers was elucidated by comparing retention times with enantiopure standards as no enantiopure standards of sotalol and metoprolol acid were available this was not possible for these two compounds thus for sotalol and metoprolol acid we characterized the enantiomers by elution order 2 6 data analysis the concentrations of all compounds were calculated by linear calibration 1 x weighting and utilizing internal standards using the analyst 1 6 software r2 of linear regression of calibration for each compound were shown in table s3 supporting information to access the

and how long acetate was present in the batch mbbr the temporal development of cod in the batch incubations are shown in fig 1 significant removal of cod is visible for all acetate doses higher than 30 mg c l thus functions were fitted and plotted into the graph the batch mbbr with 0 no acetate added and 5 mg c l added varied around the starting cod value 20 6 4 mg o2 l as the background the overall slow removal of cod is due to the relative low amount of biomass on carriers about 1 0 mg per carrier supporting information a pseudo first order followed by a plateau kinetic model discussed in supporting information s1 was used to fit the removal of cod as a function of the acetate dose 30 90 and 320 mg c l respectively fig 1 the plateau was attributed to the background hard cod about 20 mg o2 l as contained in the effluent water used for feeding and conducting the experiments in as a result reaction rate constants k 1 of 0 0373 0 0073 and 0 0018 h 1 for the mbbr spiked with 30 90 and 320 mg c l acetate respectively are obtained for the degradation of acetate it turns out the lower the initial cod the higher is k 1 which is indicating towards a michaelis menten or monod like saturation kinetics these results demonstrated that the biofilm supplied with high dosages of acetate 90 320 mg c l had an easily degradable carbon source available until the end of the batch experiment whereas without enough additional acetate 0 30 mg c l the biofilm had to rely on the hard cod during most of the incubation period 3 2 degradation kinetics of pharmaceuticals by batch mbbr with dosed acetate out of the 26 pharmaceuticals that were tested including β blockers analgesics antidepressants contrast media and antibiotics structures and properties are shown in table s1 all compounds except diatrizoic acid were degraded in the mbbr figs 2 and 4 and figure s2 of supporting information the range of the average experimental errors for compounds concentration c c0 was 0 03 0 17 without dosed acetate atenolol ibuprofen citalopram propranolol and acetyl sulfadiazine were relatively rapidly degraded in the mbbr with removal exceeding 80 in 48 h on the other hand less than 50 of phenazone tramadol carbamazepine iopamidol and sulfamethoxazole were degraded after 552 h in the mbbr without acetate these compounds were considered as recalcitrant both in cas and mbbr joss et al 2006 falås et al 2016 these values seem to fit to other studies as there was very little biomass on these carriers casas et al 2015 tang et al 2017a most of the studied compounds were not degraded in the biofilm free control reactors however some removal of clarithromycin erythromycin azithromycin and clindamycin was observed in the biofilm free reactors figure s2 as these reactors contain minute amounts of suspended biomass another experiment was conducted to exclude biodegradation by residual suspended biomass new chips were incubated in deionized water even in these reactors these four antibiotics were removed which is interpreted as hydrolysis however this hydrolysis in deionized water was slower than that observed in the effluent thus it was assumed that the removal of these four antibiotics was not only caused by degradation in the biofilm but also by either abiotic reactions hydrolysis or biodegradation by residual suspended microorganisms in effluent wastewater the results demonstrate that mbbr has a potential to be used as post treatment for lowering certain pharmaceuticals in wastewater degradation of 22 compounds occurred following pseudo first order kinetic whilst degradation of atenolol clindamycin and trimethoprim were better described by a zero order kinetics fig 2 and fig s2 table 1 this was not surprising and probably caused by two mechanisms 1 saturation of enzymes or microorganisms at high concentrations of compounds which would simplify michaelis menten or monod kinetics from pseudo first order to zero order kinetic model bekins et al 1998 2 an adaptation phase for microorganism occurred when high concentrations of compounds were spiked which could lead to a lag phase or change the kinetics liang et al 2016 el taliawy et al 2018 comparing the reaction rate constants k from our study table 1 with the values from literature the k values of 10 compounds were significantly higher 1 4 8 times than the values from a polishing mbbr of tang et al 2017a but our k values for most compounds were significantly lower 2 58 times than the values from another polishing mbbr of tang et al 2017b and the three stage mbbr of casas et al 2015 due to considerable uncertainties in assessing the biomass in this study the biomass normalized kinetic constants in this study was not compared with other studies though the data is documented in supporting information table s6 all in all there is a complex competition of processes causing mixed efficiencies on mbbr working purely on effluent wastewater according to the different effects induced by the acetate on the degradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals in the mbbr the kinetic results of pharmaceuticals were divided into 3 groups 1 compounds that degraded faster under acetate dosing 2 compounds that degraded slower under acetate dosing 3 compounds for which the degradation did not change under acetate dosing 3 2 1 pharmaceuticals that degraded faster under acetate dosing as shown in fig 3 a the reaction rate constant k for venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin increased significantly due to the acetate dosing for venlafaxine and tramadol the k increased steadily with the increasing acetate concentrations above 60 mg c l reaching its maximum 233 and 312 respectively higher removal than degradation without dosing acetate at the highest acetate dosing this indicates towards co metabolism at the higher acetate concentrations for ciprofloxacin a maximum of the degradation rate constant was observed at 20 60 mg c l of acetate and the k was increased by 55 in comparison to degradation without dosing acetate while the promotion disappeared at higher dosages 90 mg c l and more this agrees to the results from pan et al 2018 who reported that 0 5 g l of acetate promoted ciprofloxacin biodegradation by a thermus sp isolated from sludge while 1 3 g l sodium acetate inhibited the degradation notably the k of sotalol in our study was uniquely increased at 20 mg c l acetate and decreased to below the initial level at 90 mg c l figure s3 thus these results suggest that for certain pharmaceuticals there was a reaction rate that was dependent on the dose of acetate tang et al 2017a reported that adding 4 9 24 7 mg l of humic acids facilitated the removal of 10 pharmaceuticals by mbbr torresi et al 2017 found that 9 out of 22 pharmaceuticals were degraded faster by a pre denitrifying mbbr dosed with methanol than ethanol both at 239 mg cod l combining our results with the literature it is suggested that the co metabolism of pharmaceuticals by mbbr is for some compounds dependent on the type and dose of carbon source for application of co metabolism removal of pharmaceuticals by mbbr the optimal dosage of carbon source should be further determined under realistic operational conditions 3 2 2 pharmaceuticals that degraded slower under acetate dosing the degradation of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac was slowed down by the acetate addition fig 3b for citalopram and diclofenac the respective k value started to decrease after dosing more than 10 and 90 mg c l acetate respectively 43 and 56 lower than without dosing acetate the reaction rate constant k of ibuprofen showed a significantly decrease as low as 76 at 30 90 and 320 mg c l acetate compared with the initial k without dosing acetate at 60 and 160 mg c l acetate results are not significantly different to no amendment with acetate probably due to the large deviation for those data points kassotaki et al 2018 reported that acetate promoted degradation of ibuprofen by a nitrifying community thus the contrary results indicate that co metabolism varies among distinct microbial communities two possible reasons could explain the inhibited degradation of these pharmaceuticals by acetate 1 competitive inhibition occurred between the pharmaceuticals and acetate active sites on enzymes involved in the transformation of a number of pharmaceuticals might be blocked by the more abundant acetate more simply the microorganisms in biofilm preferred to use easily degradable carbon source rather than to degrade recalcitrant molecules it has been previously reported that acetate suppressed the biodegradation of acetaminophen caffeine crotamiton and artificial sweeteners in a soil column foolad et al 2015 2 dosing large amount of acetate might cause an unbalanced c n ratio in mbbr system which would lead to negative effects on the functional microorganisms li et al 2018 reported that the optimal c n ratio for a bacterial co culture to degrade 17 β estradiol was 1 35 while higher c n ratios 1 10 and 1 20 were less effective it was also reported that a c n ratio 6 1 of influent was better than the one with c n ratio 14 1 for activated sludge and membrane bioreactor regarding the removal of toxic compounds boonnorat et al 2017 the suitable c n ratio could facilitate the maintenance of key microbial activities such as nitrification which helps to produce the enzymes crucial to degradation of the compounds yu et al 2018 3 2 3 pharmaceuticals for which the degradation did not change under acetate dosing the degradation rate constants k for propranolol atenolol metoprolol phenazone carbamazepine azithromycin clindamycin clarithromycin erythromycin trimethoprim sulfamethizole sulfamethoxazole iohexol iopromide iopamidol and iomeprol was not significantly affected by any of the used acetate doses fig 3c and figure s3 although the k of some compounds under certain dosages of acetate showed changes e g metoprolol trimethoprim the difference was not statistically significant moreover because the tested dosage range of acetate 0 320 mg c l was wide and high concentrations of acetate persisted until the end see cod in fig 1 degradation of the above pharmaceuticals is expected to be unaffected even by higher dosage of acetate it has been previously reported in a biofilm based soil aquifer treatment that the removal of 9 out of 14 pharmaceuticals and personal care products were independent of the addition of acetate onesios and bouwer 2012 transformation of the compounds studied in our study in the mbbr biofilm might relate to processes which do not require acetate as substrates based on the results of our kinetic study we proved that short supply of a carbon source like acetate for enhancing co metabolism cannot up regulate the removal of the large variety of pharmaceuticals in mbbr however the differences in these above kinetic studies were not that large to explain the differences between the results obtained by casas et al 2015 on the one hand and tang et al 2017b on the other hand as reported by tang et al 2017b their polishing mbbr adapted with intermittent feeding of high carbon source exhibited considerably higher removal of diclofenac and other pharmaceuticals it seems like tang et al 2017b initiated a highly adapted biomass thus the critical factor for up regulating the removal by mbbr could be the adaptation of the microbial community in the biofilm biomass to certain conditions e g suitable carbon source c n ratio while an enhancement of co degradation by short dosing carbon as tested in this study is less effective 3 3 acetate involved deconjugation of sulfonamide metabolites acetyl sulfadiazine has been previously shown to be deconjugated to sulfadiazine in a post denitrifying mbbr torresi et al 2017 as shown below nevertheless the effect of acetate on the deconjugation reaction was never studied before to understand this process we studied the transformation of acetyl sulfadiazine into sulfadiazine the reaction kinetic model of these two compounds is proposed by us assuming that the degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine followed pseudo first order kinetics as eqs 4 and 5 respectively acetyl sulfadiazine ac sfd k ac sfd sulfadiazine sfd acetate sulfadiazine sfd k sfd transformation products transformation of acetyl sulfadiazine ac sfd and sulfadiazine sfd in the mbbr k ac sfd and k sfd are the reaction rate constants for acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine respectively 4 d c ac sfd dt k ac sfd c ac sfd 5 d c sfd d t k for sfd c ac sfd k deg sfd c sfd c ac sfd and c sfd are the real concentrations molarity of the two compounds k for sfd is the formation rate constant of sulfadiazine due to the deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine whereas k deg sfd is the degradation reaction rate constant of sulfadiazine we hypothesized that acetyl sulfadiazine only transformed into sulfadiazine in our study thus the formation rate of sulfadiazine equaled to the degradation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine k for sfd k ac sfd k deg sfd k sfd thus eqs 4 and 5 can be rewritten as eqs 6 and 7 6 c ac sfd c ac sfd 0 e k ac sfd t 7 d c sfd d t k ac sfd c ac sfd k sfd c sfd eq 6 was combined into eq 7 to become eq 8 8 d c sfd d t k ac sfd c ac sfd 0 e k ac sfd t k sfd c sfd c ac sfd 0 is the initial concentration molarity of acetyl sulfadiazine eq 8 can be expressed as explicit function 9 c sfd c sfd 0 e k sfd t c ac sfd 0 k ac sfd k sfd k ac sfd e k ac sfd t e k sfd t c sfd 0 were initial concentration molarity of sulfadiazine the concentrations of acetyl sulfadiazine and sulfadiazine from the experimental analysis were fitted to eqs 6 and 9 respectively fig 4a and c the results demonstrated the fitting of degradation of sulfadiazine to eq 9 relatively well r2 0 88 fig 4c and d table s6 which proved our hypothesis that almost all acetyl sulfadiazine transformed to sulfadiazine in the aerobic mbbr in the study of torresi et al 2017 the kinetic fitting to the retransformation model was poor r2 0 2 which was explained by more complex transformation pathways of acetyl sulfadiazine in the anaerobic denitrifying mbbr in our mbbr because k ac sfd was much higher than k sfd fig 4e and f it led to the boost of sulfadiazine during the initial period of reaction fig 4c different dosages of acetate exhibited clearly impacts on the degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine to sulfadiazine fig 4e when 5 and 10 mg c l of acetate were added to the mbbr the degradation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine was increased to a maximum of 39 of the initial without dosing acetate with higher dosages of acetate a gradual decline of degradation rates appeared up to 90 mg c l were a decrease of up to 75 of the initial was observed after 90 mg l acetate the degradation rate constants showed little variation 0 018 0 022 h 1 this result demonstrated that acetate as one transformation product of acetyl sulfadiazine itself facilitated deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine at very low concentration 5 10 mg c l however high dosing of acetate caused significant inhibition of the degradation the inhibition of deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine by acetate is not due to competitive inhibition but more likely a feedback inhibition on the functional enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway gerhart and pardee 1962 interestingly the degradation rate constant k of sulfadiazine was nearly constant and thus independent of the acetate dose fig 4f nevertheless the high dosage of acetate decreased the observed maximum of sulfadiazine due to the lower transformation rate of acetyl sulfadiazine fig 4c and d our results revealed that additional acetate especially with a high dosage probably made a major difference on the specific biotransformation pathways in which acetate was involved like de conjugation of acetyl sulfonamides but barely had effects on many other biotransformation of pharmaceuticals since acetate is involved in a large number of microbial reactions it will be of major interest to resolve the effects of acetate involved in other similar metabolism of pharmaceuticals 3 4 enantioselective degradation of β blockers by mbbr with dosed acetate the concentration of enantiomers and ef of four β blockers and metoprolol acid also named as atenolol acid which is a transformation product of both atenolol and metoprolol nodler et al 2013 are shown in fig 5 for all β blockers the r enantiomer is degraded faster than the s enantiomer thus leading to enrichment of the s enantiomers when enantioselective degradation is observed according to evans et al 2017 s enrichment of atenolol metoprolol propranolol was also found in activated sludge microcosms however in their study the ef of sotalol was unchanged after the incubation period interestingly in the present work the enantioselective degradation for all β blockers was observed only when the major removal had already occurred and the concentrations were already down to about one third of each compound starting concentration the enantioselective degradation of atenolol was the only one which occurred over the whole incubation period but its ef only changed from 0 50 0 01 to 0 55 0 01 t test showed p one tail 0 001 for metoprolol and its metabolite metoprolol acid enantioselectivity was established already after 48 h while it took 24 h and 96 h for propranolol and sotalol respectively the enantioselective fate of chiral pharmaceuticals in environment is generally caused by their interaction with enzymes which are often enantioselective kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 the shift from racemic non enantioselective to enantioselective degradation can be interpreted assuming there are two degradation processes of β blockers in the reactor 1 the majority of the degradation rapidly was conducted by the non enantioselective enzymes while 2 the enantioselective enzymes were working more slowly and more dominant at lower concentrations the enantioselective degradation played probably a stronger role with indigenous concentration of β blockers souchier et al 2016 claimed that the ef could be considered as a quantitative indicator for the biodegradation of metoprolol in wwtps however because of the existence of non enantioselective biodegradation pathways of β blockers the ef of the β blockers could not reflect accurately the status of the biodegradation in our experiments metoprolol acid was not spiked into the batch mbbr but was still detected 0 352 0 072 μg l being indigenous to the water used to feed the reactors wastewater effluent a slight enrichment of the first eluting enantiomer e1 of metoprolol acid occurred during our batch incubation however to determine its origin atenolol or metoprolol it the mass balance of metoprolol acid and its formation from both atenolol and metoprolol needs to be adressed as shown in fig 5a b and 5e 38 4 nm atenolol was removed from the reactor within 12 h which was coinciding with the formation peak of metoprolol acid 34 3 nm 12 h while at the same time only 8 4 nm metoprolol was degraded thus it can be safely assumed that the observed formation of metoprolol acid predominantly originated from atenolol in that phase the ef of metoprolol acid changed from 0 46 0 02 to 0 50 0 01 which was corresponding to atenolol itself developing an ef of up to 0 55 0 01 after 12 h no metoprolol acid can be formed from atenolol as the parent compound was quantitatively degraded however a slow formation from metoprolol was possible however after 24 h metoprolol acid slowly degraded with an apparent reaction rate constant of k 1 0 023 0 010 h 1 during that phase the observed reaction rate constant results from i a degradation of metoprolol acid and ii a slower formation from metoprolol in parallel to degradation of 30 nm metoprolol k 1 0 027 0 003 h 1 the development of an enantio preference in metoprolol acid was most probably due to an enantioselective degradation of metoprolol acid 48 96 h of the experiment it is worth noting that the ef of atenolol metoprolol propranolol and metoprolol acid was developing faster with low dosage 0 20 mg c l of acetate than with the high dose 90 320 mg c l especially towards the end of the incubation fig 5 for the transformation product metoprolol acid the high dose of acetate inhibited the degradation 48 96 h compared with low dose of acetate fig 5e acetate dosing also had an effect on the ef of sotalol at the end of the incubation but the trend was different to the other β blockers this suggests that dosing acetate changes the enantioselectivity of the degradation of β blockers including propranolol and their transformation product metoprolol acid the assumption that a two phase kinetics indeed is a pure enantiomeric effect casas et al 2015 can thus be at least made more plausible a similar effect has been previously been reported when degrading ofloxacine with pure bacterial strains under acetate dosages maia et al 2018 as well as for alprenolol and propranolol by activated sludge ribeiro et al 2013 the presence of readily degradable carbon source like acetate might induce higher or lower metabolic activity from part of functional microorganisms that degraded the β blockers however because the majority of the β blockers in our study was degraded through the non enantioselective processes during which ef of β blockers did not change the observed degradation kinetic rate constants of β blockers was not significantly changed by dosing acetate it suggests that the dosed acetate only affects the specific enantioselective transformation pathways other than non enantioselective pathways of β blockers in the mbbr these results indicate that the amount of available carbon source for microbial communities might result in different enantiomer levels of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment on the other hand the co existence of non enantioselective and enantioselective transformation pathways characterizes the co metabolism of pharmaceuticals and carbon source as a complex process thus instead of studying racemic compounds enantiomeric analysis might reveal more detail of the different biodegradation pathways 4 conclusions based on the kinetic and enantiomeric analysis of pharmaceuticals in the batch polishing mbbr with dosed acetate the following conclusions can be draw the degradation of venlafaxine tramadol and ciprofloxacin was enhanced by acetate dosing on the other hand acetate especially at high dosages caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen citalopram and diclofenac the promotion and inhibition by acetate were dose and compound dependent the degradation of 17 out of 25 compounds was found to be independent of the acetate doses overall the majority of pharmaceuticals could not be up or down regulated by co metabolism of acetate in mbbr deconjugation of acetyl sulfadiazine was suppressed by the dosed acetate probably because of a feedback inhibition of functional enzyme by excess acetate although the observed degradation of acetyl sulfadiazine was affected by the acetate dosing the degradation of sulfadiazine was found to be independent of the acetate dose enantioselective degradation of β blockers and metoprolol acid occurred in the mbbr resulting for all in enrichment of s or first eluted enantiomer the majority of the degradation was non enantioselective while the enantioselective degradation was more slowly and evident at low concentrations which suggested the non enantioselective and enantioselective enzymes play a role in the removal process high dosed acetate resulted in lower ef of atenolol propranolol metoprolol and metoprolol acid than the one with low dosage of acetate thus changes in wastewater conditions amount of available easily degradable carbon source can make differences on the enantiomer enrichment to understand and be able to predict which compounds can and which cannot be degraded under which conditions more knowledge on biofilm metabolism is necessary however to improve removal rates in biofilm systems adaptation seems a better strategy than targeted up regulation by using short dosing co metabolic approaches acknowledgments the study was supported
